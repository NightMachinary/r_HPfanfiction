I know there was a similar post right before, but it wound up primarily with sirius escaping and adopting him, and snape getting dragged in, i believe.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

*** And a heads up, the Resonance trilogy was abandoned very near the end of the third story. It seemed to be wrapping up and you can get a little more off the authors blog than what was uploaded, but ultimately it wasn't finished. Still a very good story, I just don't want someone finding out the hard way.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  #+begin_example
      When starting this, please keep in mind that A Year Like None Other was started long before HBP came out\. It was always my intention to write an alternate 6th year and when the canon Year 6 was published, it meant that my own little saga seriously diverged from canon\. So reading this, imagine that Years 1\-5 did occur, but nothing we discover from HBP and DH is necessarily true this time around\.The most important divergences are these: In this universe, Snape \*is\* a pureblood and his father's name was Hostilian \(which tells you a lot all by itself\)\. Dumbledore never died \-\- and certainly not at Snape's hand\!   This story is completely finished and is about 760,000 words long\. It took me a while to get it all posted here at AO3, but I am very happy to report that the whole thing is now online for your \(hopefully\) intense enjoyment\!And now, on with the show, which begins with A Year Like None Other \(completed\), continues on into A Summer Like None Other \(also completed\) and wraps up with A Family Like None Other, a Year 7 novel that I am still writing\.

** The only good one is linkffn(1795399) - Resonance. It's the first part of a trilogy. It starts off iffy, but there's some seriously awesome magic in the story, as well as some Harry/Tonks. Naturally, if this fic didn't have Snape at all, it would be even better, but even so, it's still pretty good.

I mean, the one i read was about 20%, he can be reasonable with others, about 40% snape has issues and one of them is that he really doesn't make new freinds, and his old freindslist is all death eaters and corpses, 30% snape couldn't hate an abused... something really young, especially when he isn't that much of a bother, and most of the remainder was harry decided he liked snape. His character wasn't ideal there either, but it didn't feel that far off-base for a possible future snape when he's not deliberately being nasty.

******* Ao3 or do you have M filter set to off? pretty sure FF used to elimitate those.

Snape is shippable with a finite number of characters, and the further you diverge from canon the greater that number is, but it's still low. Anyone from a different generation just hits squick, though it could have been plausible in canon- when snape falls, he falls hard. The fact that he was willing to die for lily demonstrates that, and that is what he was risking.Still, it would need to be mutual, or he'd be quite content to pine or force it from his mind, but snape is, at the minimum, a complete jerk when teaching, so that is implausible.

assuming his social circle never expands, and with students out, that leaves narcissia- but she's married- mcgonnagal, but they don't really like each other, dumbledore but snape shows no signs of being gay, and any other staff member. in short, canon snape isn't the type to have a commited relationship, he doesn't interact with enough people. narcissia, of all people, is the most likely.

As such, any ship-fic requires snape have some character growth to work, if just enough to leave his shell and develop a deep and meaningful freindship that then corrupts into a romance. Most solid snape ship-fics would take multiple years, because snape is messed up pretty badly, (and he seems the type that falls in love from solid freindship, rather than having a split between love and freinds) and therefore snape would need consistent interaction with the character choosen. As such, the most plausible shipping targets are characters from hogwarts, members of the order of the pheonix, and other teachers.

in short, snape is doomed to be single, or not really be that enthusiastic and just doing it because he feels obligated to.

******** That's a big reason all those Marriage Law fics exist, because canon Snape would never get with anyone on his own. You need some kind of external pressure or something to force him into a relationship and then see what he does with it.

If you like that kind of thing, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7170435/1/Bound-to-Him][Bound to Him]] is a pretty good Snape/Hermione. Voldemort decides he wants to spy on Harry and kidnaps Hermione during the summer and does an evil soul-bond thingy with her and Snape so that Snape can control her. Then they both have to live with it, which is rough on them both.

I like the way Resonance handles it maybe the best, pretty much Snape only gets a girlfriend because he's adopted Harry. She's a very mellow, accepting person and an accountant so more logical than most Magicals and yet without Harry in the mix as a family member it wouldn't work at all.
