About summaries. When you have a pairing, write the names of both characters like this "Harry/Hermione" "Draco/Ron" etc. But please, PLEASE stop combining name and writing shit like Haphnee, Honks, Harrom, or Dumbleghorn, please ! You can't even imagine how much that make me cringe !

Thank you, have a nice day :)

****** Normally, when someone says this, my instinct is to bombard them with fics featuring the pairing they've never seen. (I am also several glasses of wine deep right now, and therefore able to stomach skimming a Harry/Peter piece maybe.)

I'll be damned if I didn't check AO3 /and/ FFN and get 0 results on each site for this pairing

** I've seen tons of fanfiction pairing names in summaries and I just realized that almost all of them have something to do with Hermione. I don't even see Hinny or Romione that often and those pairings are every fucking where

*** One reason may be that while prevalent, the vast majority of romione isn't as the main paring, but a side pair to h/G. Pairings like dramione and harmony are much more likely to be the main pairing of a fic. As for Hinny, it just sounds stupid, so people use h/g instead. For ships like harrymort and hagranogle that (imo) are somewhat cracky and not super serious, it makes sense to have a cracky and non serious name for them.
