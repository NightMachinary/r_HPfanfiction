Are there any short fics that deal with Voldemort's threts to Fudge (he thretened a mass muggle killin if Fudge doesn't step down), followed by the distruction of the Brockdale bridge and that death eater attack in the west country. I'd love to read part of it from Fudge's or some ordinary wizard's point of view and part of it from some death eater's point of view.
