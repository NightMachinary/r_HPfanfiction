Saw another discussion from another site about the theory of transfiguration. Thought I'd post my understanding and see what some other people think.

In my mind Transfiguration has 7 subsections

1.  Transformation- changes

2.  object to object

3.  Organic to organic (animal to animal)

4.  state of matter changes (water, ice, vapour)

5.  Cross class transformations- changes from one type to another.

6.  object to organic

7.  Organic to object

8.  Conjuration- making things appear, summoning, (objects- basic, weapons, animals, objects etc.)

9.  Animation- giving life

10. Transmogrification- Spacial changes (Charms + Transfiguration)

11. Transubstantiation the changing of one substance (raw material) into another (iron to silver)

12. Transmogrify to change in appearance or form of humans, especially strangely or grotesquely. (Includes human transformation/transfiguration)

Masters can combine multiple disciplines simultaneously

Transfiguration has 7 base elements to consider when transforming something

1. Size of object/creature The greater disparity of size between two objects/creatures being performed, the more magic needs to be expended

2. Weight of object/creature The greater disparity of weight between two objects/creatures being performed, the more magic needs to be expended

3.Complexity of transfiguration The more complex/detailed a transfiguration, the more will/focus required

4.Will of object/creature The greater the will of an object/creature, the more will/focus required

5.Amount of magic necessary The amount of magic necessary varies greatly, but in general is more than most other fields of magic

1. Will of Caster The will of the caster is essential for any transformation, but will vary based upon each individual case.

7.Association aspect The hardest part to predict. How powerfully can the mind of the caster connect two seemingly disparate ideas or things. Individual understanding is relevant and important. Mystery aspect.

The 3 Laws of resistance

1. The greater the difference between transformations, the greater the resistance

2. The force of resistance is directly proportional to the will and magical energy of the object/creature being transformed.

3. The greater the resistance, the more power and concentration from the caster is required.

Transformations are sometimes permanent, but are dependent on the will of the object/subject. There is little resistance in non living objects and most ‘simple' animals won't resist changes into other living creatures as they don't have a very good sense of self. The exception being the more intelligent the animal, the more opposed to change it may be. One's will must be stronger than an animal's in this case to complete the change. Also, transformation may last for years on things like a muggle or weak willed animal but they can spontaneously change back.

Difficulty Cross class transformation is hardly ever permanent. Why? For all but the masters, no transfiguration is perfect. You are enforcing a change on the world using your magic (energy) and will. The change though, is unnatural, and the world fights you on these changes as it tries to balance them against the laws of resistance. Newton's laws of resistance. The time a transfiguration lasts depends on the amount of magical energy of the spell used, the casters will, and how well it was cast. Consider what we are doing much like knitting a jersey. Not too difficult you suppose? Now imagine two tug of war teams pulling at the jersey from the moment its finished, trying to rip it shreds. Almost every jersey ever made would be ripped to shreds eventually. However, there are those that can make their jerseys from dragon hide. Every ‘stitch' must be perfect, every conceptualization clear and natural before one can hope to make something that lasts for longer than a few moments. In those rare instances, it's possible to make a change permanent. There have been only four or five such masters in the last one hundred years who could do this. Even then, their transformations were only fully successful some of the time. Dumbledore is one such master.

Conjurations on the other hand have never been made permeant (unless in conjunction with Runes and sacrifice). The creations are completely reliant on the magical energy of the caster. They are there for the express purpose of fulfilling a task within minutes/hours. Two options for this. Constantly feeding conjuration- magic is funnelled towards maintaining spell. Powered conjuration- excess amount of magic ‘tied off' to object allowing it to exist for the amount of time caster dictates.

** Andddd part 3

Reference objects

The above describes how you might add detail to your transfigurations in terms of the casting process, but that is distinct from the theoretical question of where the information comes from for that detail. As I mentioned in my post above, it cannot be the caster's own knowledge of the objects they are transfiguring: Hogwarts doesn't teach biology, and even if it did, students are performing transfigurations on animals the biology of which they couldn't possibly understand at their age (or any age). So it can't really be visualisation, given that the caster lacks the requisite knowledge.

One possible answer, and the one I have used in Victoria Potter, lies in the concept of Platonic Forms:

What followed was a long hour of taking notes as Professor McGonagall lectured them on the basics of transfiguration, a piece of No-Squeak Chalk writing definitions and drawing diagrams on the blackboard under the direction of her wand. They learnt of the two substances, physical and aetherial, discovered that Transfiguration could only change physical substance, and deduced that for every object there existed an ideal form. To illustrate this final point, McGonagall had them all trying to draw a perfect circle.

“Notice how all these circles have imperfections, and yet we can still recognise them as circles,” Professor McGonagall explained, “this is because objects in the world are but imitations of their true forms. We perceive that these imperfect circles share features with the perfect circle, even though none of us have ever seen it. The perfect circle is a form which exists only as an ideal. It is these true forms which the magic of transfiguration calls upon.” Basically, magic/the universe has an idea of what a chair is, or what a rabbit is, or what a hat is. Those are the "default" forms for any transfiguration into a chair, rabbit, or hat. The caster is using their various transfiguration spells to push an object towards a different form as recognised by magic. The magic itself provides the detail, unless the caster specifically guides the magic otherwise. So if you're transfiguring a chair, you get the default chair, unless you specifically and manually guide the magic to create detail which deviates from the default form. This would be where visualisation comes into play. But because you're deviating from the default and relying on your own guidance, it's also where errors can easily creep in

** For those of you not on DLP here were Taure's comments...

We can actually work out a lot about how Transfiguration works from the Hogwarts curriculum. All this requires is a single assumption: that McGonagall's teaching method is to introduce students to a topic by having them perform easy transformations before moving on to more complex ones.

This pedagogy is explicitly recognised with respect to Vanishing, where McGonagall has them start in invertebrates at the start of fifth year:

“Yes, you too, Longbottom,” said Professor McGonagall. “There's nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So... today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until NEWT level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your OWL.”

She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly difficult. By the end of a double period neither he nor Ron had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practicing (OotP Chapter 13) They then advance to vertebrates later in the year: “As I was saying: the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be Vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal, offers a much greater one” (OotP Chapter 15) So the assumption is not so great a leap, I think. All it requires is that we take McGonagall's approach with Vanishing and assume it is also her approach in other areas.

With this assumption in hand, we can identify which factors do and do not contribute to the difficulty of Transfiguration. As explicitly indicated in the above quotes, complexity of the subject is a major factor in the difficulty of a Transfiguration. We also see this more generally in how students progress year to year. The curriculum is as follows:

Turning inanimate objects into other inanimate objects in first year (match into needle in PS Chapter 8),

Turning animals into objects from the end of first year (mouse into a snuff box in PS Chapter 16), continuing in second year (beetle into button in CoS Chapter 6);

Turning objects into animals in third year (teapot into a tortoise in PoA Chapter 16);

Turning animals into other animals in fourth year (guinea fowl into guinea pigs in GoF Chapter 22), as well as switching spells (GoF Chapter 20);

Learning Vanishing in fifth year, as above;

Learning Human Transfiguration in sixth year (HBP Chapter 15);

Learning Conjuration in seventh year (from the fact that McGonagall refers to Conjuration as N.E.W.T. level in OotP Chapter 13, combined with the fact that we know it is not in sixth year).

We see in this the trend towards increasing complexity, from inanimate objects to animals to humans. Also note that an increase in complexity (object to animal) is more difficult than a decrease in complexity (animal to object, which is introduced earlier). But hardest of all is turning one complex thing into a different complex thing (animal to animal; human to human).

Note that the curriculum outlined above shows when new subjects are introduced, not the exclusive year of their practice. For example students are still practicing animal to object transformations in fourth year, when they practice turning a hedgehog into a pincushion (GoF Chapter 15). This makes sense. It is common in teaching to reinforce and expand previously studied material as students' knowledge grows.

(It is unclear when you study animation and Untransfiguration. They may be included within the 7 years and not mentioned, or they may not be taught as standard at Hogwarts.)

Another factor in Transfiguration difficulty is size (i.e. volume). This is explicitly mentioned in GoF: “The trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon's hide... I'd say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven't got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall...” (GoF Chapter 20) In this quote, Hermione makes it clear that something being big makes it more difficult to Transfigure, with something dragon-sized being on the edge of possibility for even a master of the art - Hermione is not sure if McGonagall would be able to manage it or not.

(It's also interesting to note that it is size, not the fact that the subject is a dragon, which makes Hermione doubt McGonagall's ability to succeed. This really hammers home the above point that Transfiguration is powerful magic).

A similar factor to size is number. We know that it is possible to transfigure multiple objects simultaneously: Dumbledore's animation of the statutes in OotP Chapter 36, or his conjuration of hundreds of sleeping bags in PoA Chapter 9,. But the students always practice transforming just one thing. This indicates that performing a Transfiguration on multiple things at once is difficult.

These three factors -- complexity, size, and number -- are all absolute factors when it comes to difficulty. But there is also a relative factor: the similarity of the original object to the resulting object.

We see the importance of similarity in numerous transformations. Size and shape appear to be important relative factors: almost all of the “beginner” Transfigurations which McGonagall assigns to her students are of objects which are a similar size and shape. Textural similarity also seems to be relevant: a teapot made of porcelain has certain textural similarities to a tortoise shell.

Even more interestingly, the names of the objects can apparently contribute towards similarity, with “beetle” and “button” being similar, as well as “guinea fowl” and “guinea pig”. Another example of an abstract relative factor which contributes to Transfiguration difficulty is that of social association: the transformation of rabbits into slippers is a play on the famous (at least in the UK) trend in the 90s of fluffy slippers which resembled rabbits.

We can also deduce certain factors which do not affect the difficulty of Transfiguration.

One of the most important is mass. Turning a matchstick into a needle is the very first Transfiguration the students are introduced to, from which we can deduce that it is extremely simple as Transfiguration goes. Now, matches are typically made of a softwood such as pine, which has a density of around 350 and 550 kg/m3. Meanwhile, a needle is generally made of steel, which has a density of around 7,750 and 8,050 kg/m3. So by turning a match into a needle, students are massively increasing the mass of the object - by a factor of 10 or even 20. Apparently this is something easily done, and so we can deduce that mass is not a factor which the rules of Transfiguration give weight (pun intended).

Another factor which we can deduce Transfiguration treats with contempt is that of chemical composition. This is somewhat implicit in the entire definition of the subject, but we also see it in the transformation of a teapot into a tortoise. The textural similarity of the objects appears to be sufficient to render that transformation suitable as appropriate practice for students, even though porcelain and a tortoise's shell are made of completely different materials (earthenware vs bone).

However, from the fact that you need a Philosopher's Stone to make gold with magic, substance does not appear to be completely ignored by Transfiguration. But perhaps the magical theory of substance is not the same thing as the chemical understanding of the elements.

A third and final factor which we can discount as important to Transfiguration is knowledge of chemistry and biology. There is no evidence that either is taught at Hogwarts, and even if they were, it would be impossible for students to have a complete understanding of the biology of rabbits, turtles, and so on. Not even the most educated Muggle scientists completely understand the biology of these animals. Nonetheless, the students are perfectly capable of Transfiguring animals. This shows that you don't need to have detailed knowledge of the object of your Transfiguration. All you need to understand is how the Transfiguration itself works:

“He's lost his mind,” said Ron in an almost awed voice.

“Yes,” said Hermione irritably, turning a page of Intermediate Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses. “Yes, I'm starting to think he has. But, unfortunately, he made Harry and me promise.” (OotP Chapter 31)

As a matter of preference, I like this much better than "you're actually transfiguring air" approach. Firstly it seems more magical, whereas wizards actually transfiguring air is a bit sciencey. Secondly, if the angle is that wizards don't understand what they're doing, this fundamentally clashes with what I consider a strong theme running through canon magic, which is that knowledge/understanding is required to successfully cast it.

*** One criticism: needles are usually very thin. They could well be quite close to matchsticks in weight.

A matchstick may have 2 mm diameter and square, while a thick needle is needle 0.9 mm and round. Matchsticks at least have a volume of 4 mm^{2} for a certain cross-section, while this is 0.81 for needles, so the cross section ratio is at least 4.93:1, and needles also taper. That could easily give 7:1, taken all together.

** Part 2

Permanent vs Temporary Transfiguration

Transfiguration is defined as the branch of magic concerned with altering a thing's physical composition and structure - what JK Rowling refers to as an object's “fundamental nature”:

“Every now and then somebody asks me for the difference between a spell, a charm and a hex. Within the Potter world, the boundaries are flexible, and I imagine that wizards may have their own ideas. Hermione-ish, however, I've always had a working theory:

Spell: The generic term for a piece of magic.

Charm: Does not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject of the spell, but adds, or changes, properties. Turning a teacup into a rat would be a spell, whereas making a teacup dance would be a charm. The grey area comes with things like 'Stunning Spells', which on balance I think are Charms, but which I call spells for alliterative effect.” (JK Rowling's Old Website: Spell Definitions) Although JK Rowling phrases this as the difference between “Charms” and “Spells”, from the example of “turning a teacup into a rat” she's clearly talking about Transfiguration. A Charm, unlike a Transfiguration, is stated to “not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject”, which means that the reverse holds: Transfiguration does fundamentally alter the properties of the subject.

JK Rowling has been consistent on this. As early as 1998 she stated:

“With a charm you add properties to something. With a transfiguration you change its nature completely; the molecular structure alters.” (The Herald, 7 December 1998) The change that Transfiguration makes is a permanent one. We know this from two sources. The first is the pig's tail that Hagrid gave Dudley, which did not go away on its own and had to be surgically removed:

Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig's tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London. (GoF Chapter 4) The second is from the legend of Quintapeds in the companion book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them:

In retaliation, so the story has it, a gang of McCliverts surrounded the MacBoon dwellings one night and Transfigured each and every MacBoon into a monstrous five-legged creature. [...] The Quintapeds cannot talk and have strenuously resisted every attempt by the Department for the Regulation and Control of magical Creatures to capture a specimen and try to untransfigure it... (Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them: Quintaped) Now, no one knows if the legend of the Quintapeds' origin is true or not. But the key part is that wizards, including the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, consider the story credible enough that they have attempted Untransfiguration. That means that the story -- including the permanence of the Transfiguration performed -- is within the realm of Transfiguration possibility.

So Transfiguration is not some kind of tactile illusion. It is not that the original object lurks “beneath” a layer of Transfiguration magic. Rather, the object is fundamentally, physically changed into a different object.

The permanence of Transfiguration also makes sense. Since Transfiguration is a physical change, there's no reason for the object to revert to its previous state. Physical objects do not spontaneously turn into other objects in the absence of magic. You would need some new magical intervention to make a further change.

However, Transfiguration can be reversed with Untransfiguration:

“I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my NEWT classes unless they have achieved ‘Exceeds Expectations' or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level.” (OotP Chapter 29) But the possibility of Untransfiguration does not mean that the original object is still there, “underneath”. We know from Dumbledore that magic always leaves traces:

“How did you know that was there?” Harry asked in astonishment. “Magic always leaves traces,” said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, “sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.” (HBP Chapter 26) So from what we know about the nature of Transfiguration as a fundamental change, Untransfiguration would appear to be a reversal of that change, not a removal of it. The fact that magic leaves traces explains how this is possible, even though nothing physical of the original object remains.

Detail

We know that it is possible to use transfiguration to create objects with fine detail: Dumbledore's armchairs are noted as having particular character. So transfiguration can do more than create "generic" objects. However, it's worth noting that Dumbledore is a master of the art.

One thing that fanfic writers often forget about transfiguration in canon is that, except for high level wizards like Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape, transfigurations are not performed as a single spell. You don't wave your wand once and hey presto, you've got the object you wanted. That represents the culmination of mastery of the subject, it is not "normal" transfiguration. From what we see in McGonagall's classes, the students spend hours performing a single transfiguration, taking it in stages, performing one aspect of the transformation and then another. This provides the answer to how you create detail, I think: you add it bit by bit, manually, casting different spells to perform different aspects of the transfiguration.

I've begun to explore this in Victoria Potter, where the first year transfiguration curriculum covers three items:

- The Transubstantiation Spell (changing a thing's substance)
- The Shaping Spell (changing a thing's shape)
- The Solidification Spell (changing a thing's state, liquid to solid, e.g. water to ice, wine to grapes)

These are distinct spells, each with its own theory behind it. However, once you have mastered the spells and properly understand them, you may find that they begin to flow together:

It was simple: using the Solidification Spell, they were to turn some of the water into ice. Once in that form, they could use the Shaping Spell to form it into the shape of a key, using the drawing as a guide. Then it was a simple matter of using the Transubstantiation Spell to turn the ice key into something less brittle, so that it wouldn't snap in the lock.

Victoria took her wand from the loop at her waist, relief flooding her body. It would be over in a matter of seconds. But just as she opened her mouth to utter the first incantation, something very strange happened. A new awareness came to her, like the rush of sound following a pop of the ears, when suddenly she would realise, days after having gone swimming, that the world had been on mute.

The world changed.

The moment she thought of the Solidification Spell, she saw how it would flow into the Shaping Spell, forming a single, unified process; and the same in turn for the Transubstantiation Spell. They weren't separate spells, really---they were all different aspects of the same process. It was like running. You didn't think about lifting one leg up, then pushing off with the other... once you knew how, you just did it.

Her wand jabbed forward, tight grip, slight twist. No words were spoken. The water shimmered, and at the centre of the pool a metal key coalesced. Dazed, Victoria knelt down and fished the key from the water. What had she just done?

The key fit perfectly; with a click, the chest swung open.

Victoria glanced at McGonagall, who was looking at her with something suspiciously like pride. "An impressive display," she said, placing her clipboard on her lap. "Are you aware of what you just did?" The above is from Victoria's end of year exam. McGonagall goes on to explain that "transfiguration by technique", where the spells all merge together to form a single process, is something that students normally only begin to grasp around fourth year at the earliest. She also explains its limitations:

Victoria looked at her wand, wondering if she'd be able to duplicate the feat. "So... does this mean I can transfigure anything?"

Professor McGonagall's focus snapped back to Victoria. "Why don't you try?"

She imagined the chest forming into a lion, huge and ferocious, and, just as she did before, jabbed her wand. Nothing happened. If Victoria didn't know better, she could have sworn she saw McGonagall's lips twitching.

"Transfiguration by technique comes from your ability to see the connections between different processes," McGonagall explained. "As with most magic, there is no shortcut to mastery. You must first learn the component parts before you can put them together”

**** Bigger changes in any sense are harder in Transfiguration. It's harder to change something into a thing completely unalike it. It's harder to Conjure something very detailed and specific than it is something general and vague. The larger a thing is the more difficult it is to affect with a single cast, etc. There's no reason to think mass or weight are at all significant, such that it becomes a limitation of something to consider on it's own. The very first spell is one where the mass changes by more than an order of magnitude, so it shouldn't really be a limitation otherwise the spell would be inappropriate imo.
