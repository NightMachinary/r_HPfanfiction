I haven't seen this one recommended on this subreddit, which is sad, because it's one of my favorites.

 

It begins with an amnesic 11th Doctor possessing Harry Potter during his first trip to Platform 9 3/4. The Doctor (or rather, since he doesn't remember his name, he goes by: the, Rubert and The Tutor) then spends his time attending Hogwarts and trying to restore Harry control of his rightful body.

  

But don't worry, it's barely a crossover at all. Rubert doesn't know remember who he is and there's not a Dalek or Tardis in sight. It's really more of a crossover between the manic curiosity of Dr. Who and the wonder of the Wizarding World.

 

This fic definitely isn't for everyone; it has no combat scenes nor romance. But what it does have is more references than you can shake a literature professor at and a truly beautiful imagining of Hogwarts and British magical culture. The writing is top-notch too.

 

In summary: it's funny, charming, happy and even a touch educational (I had to look up so many words). It might not be your cup of tea, but if it is, it's one of the best cuppas you'll have this side of Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams.

** You'd think with the name Rupert he'd be possessing Ron. I feel that'd be more Doctor like - he'd have this sense of 'finally ginger!' and no idea why.

  No TARDIS, no screwdriver, and no memory --- on the plus side, an owl and a wand! May or may not be AU. "It's all in the mind, you know."
