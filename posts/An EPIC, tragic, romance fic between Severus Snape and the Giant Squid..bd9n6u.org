Obviously it should start off with Snape thinking that the Squid is a dunderhead because it doesn't know what the ingredients for the Draught of Living Death are, but in the end, the Squid teaches him that the magic was inside him all along. Perhaps they go on an adventure together to find the Loch Ness monster - since Nessie is magically capable of destroying horcruxes.

And then everyone dies from syphilis.

I'm thinking somewhere around 500k words would be the minimum before it's abandoned.

Edit: Dramatic twist: After falling hard for the sexy cephalopod, Snape discovers to his dismay that the Giant Squid is really the offspring of his most hated rival, James Potter!

Second twist: it turns out to be a Wrong Boy Who Lived story, and it is really the Giant Squid that is destined to destroy Voldemort.

Twist the Third: the Giant Squid is really just a normal squid that Sirius Black once cast a really strong /Engorgio/ spell upon.

Thoughts?

*** Nah. JKR tweeted recently that her writing the Giant Squid/Hogwarts was really just wish fulfillment by her inner Slytherin. Hogwarts was actually in love with Harry's broken Nimbus 2000 the whole time.

*** But Nessis wouldn't love him for who he really is! Not like the squid. Nessie's only in it for his greasy hair!

**** Nevermind the long supporting relationship Snape and the squid had in all those years sat alone in the Slytherin commonroom and he watched over Snape through the windows to the lake

***** Good point.

And think of the years of heartbreak the Squid had to bear watching Snape pine after that no-good Gryffindor girl with the red hair! How could the Squid possibly compete with a creature that has /hair/? The poor cephalopod probably had self-image issues for years after that.

****** But that is a triangle relationship since Lily had a thing for the squid back in the fifth year. Making snape angry at the squid.

******* So THAT'S the reason why Snape snapped and called her a mudblood! Lily was movin' in on his territory. That makes much more sense. Snape was forced to finally choose between his two loves. Little did he know that since the Squid spends so much time in the silt at the bottom of the lake that there is actually quite a bit of mud in the Squid's blood...
