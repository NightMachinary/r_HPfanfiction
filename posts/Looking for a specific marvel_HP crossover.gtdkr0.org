:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's a post endgame fic where after Natasha does she is sent to the HP universe on Halloween â€˜81 where she takes harry and raises him unbeknownst to her the potters came back to life. It kinda skips till fourth year when Harry's name comes out of the goblet and he is forced to come to Hogwarts.


** I think that this is the story your searching for as it's the only one i know of where a baby Harry is "given" to Natasha to look after. It has the potters being alive and pretty much skips to the 4th year for harry. It's called Natasha Romanoff and the Secrets of Death.

  Parallel universe time travel? Natasha Romanoff has done it. But meeting Death himself who gives her a baby who's being hunted by terrorists? That's a new one. Simply put, she might need little Harry as much as he needs her. Natasha Mother Figure. T/M rating. Update whenever her movie comes out :D
