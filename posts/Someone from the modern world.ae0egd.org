It's rated T and the protagonist is on the fluffy good side of light, but otherwise it fits what you were asking for.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Self-Insert Gen/Friendship

** Cambrian, a rather prolific smut writer, has a surprisingly romantic and fluffy fic called [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/hella-potter-and-the-reincarnated-oc-harry-potter-au.8770/reader][Hella Potter and the Reincarnated OC]], which is exactly what it says on the tin. Its got a genderbent Harry whose actually a fairly well written character, and a Hermione that's mostly canon, albeit influenced by porn logic. As for the OC, well, the fact that he has devil horns and a prehensile tail from a prank potion and voluntarily declined to get them removed should tell you all you need to know about him.

Two things of note: it's a commission piece, so Cambrian will keep writing as long as someone keeps paying, and it's on QQ, so you'll need an account to view it.

A guy reincarnates as Harry Potter

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13024176/1/Worst-Jumpchain-Ever][Worst Jumpchain Ever]]

And then gets summoned to an AU and then goes traveling dimensions following the pull of the rituals calling him.

The ideas are fun to read but the author has the annoying tendency to write word vomit thousands of words long, he writes with little to no dialogue and, if you reach that far in WJE or read his other stories, he likes to build castles or bases and entrench there with traps and abominations he creates. Honestly a bit boring in the long run and I've dropped his other fics because of this but â€˜A Brighter Future' and the first few chapters of its sequel are fun and a good read.
