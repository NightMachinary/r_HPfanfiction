Over a large portion of HP fics unless its quite AU and harry is dark or a time traveler we get treated to a Harry who is portrayed as extremely modest, forgiving, shy and downright soppy. Whenever I read Harry portrayed like this I find it quite sad. This is as a large part of Harry's personality is formed by the abuse he suffered by the Dursleys and this can be seen in the way he acts. Firstly the way in which he shuts himself off at school i.e. not really interacting with a large group of friends and also being unable to handle criticism well. Secondly, you can see this in his general self-worth including how he irrationally views himself as a cause of pain for other people etc. Thirdly it has meant that Harry essentially hasnt grown up emotionally or intellectually to the same degree as someone else to practically look after himself, this can be seen whenever he takes abuse lying down like umbridges torture. This can also show in his selflessness as he essentially views himself as nothing which is a direct cause of the dursleys treatment of him. Whenever Harry is portrayed to have grown up I think that you could potentially view how he changes as a person in these aspects as it wouldnt be unreasonable to believe that Harry could become less selfless and have a bit more pride. Mainly I just wrote this to try and highlight something for which I find annoying but also something hopefully people will take into account when they write their own fics and possibly for any readers of this thread to contemplate. Thanks
