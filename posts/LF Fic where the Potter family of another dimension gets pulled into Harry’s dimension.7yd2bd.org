I can not for the love of me remember what this fic was called. It's a Harmony fic where his family from another world all end up being kind of huge dicks and Harry ends up adopting his AU sister.

**** It's actually pretty trite. His other family is caricatures at best, and it's all quite silly. But I still liked it.

***** It's the kind of fic that you remember and think about, then realize you didn't save it, so now you desperately want to read it. Then you find it, and it turns out there was a good reason why you didn't save it.

**** It's not particularly good in terms of characterization and plot. Harry's other family are so over-the-top with their foolishness, it makes it hard to accept. And the origins of Harry's trauma are cartoonish.

**** It's fun if you enjoy stories where the baddies get their rich deserts and get humiliated, while not being too serious about it all (no overdone violence and edgy revenge). Kinda whimsical.

**** My opinion of it combines what some of the others have said, the AU family is so obnoxious and over the top that I had to struggle through it. But the satisfaction at the end was definitely worth a read through. I'll never read it again though

*** Is this the one where the new Harry gets with Ginny because he's willing to play up his fame?

**** Yup, this is the one. I always felt it could have had the makings of something better but ended up being kind of just another bashing fic.
