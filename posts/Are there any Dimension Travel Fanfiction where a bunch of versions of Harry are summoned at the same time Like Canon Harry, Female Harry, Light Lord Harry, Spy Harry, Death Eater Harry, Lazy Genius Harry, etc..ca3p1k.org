**** Thanks! It was fun to write too - the kind of thing I just would sit down at the keyboard, start thinking of the next ridiculous idea and then make it happen. I basically didn't know how it would end until this morning!

  Harry's life turns into a game, where he is the main character. Thus begins the journey of Harry Potter as the hero of Potter Verse. Watch as Harry conquers the world of Potter Verse as not just a wizard but as The Gamer. A Harry/Harem story

  Harry raised his head from the book he was reading, snugly sat on top of his bunk, at the topmost floor of Ravenclaw Tower. Right in front of him, he saw himself. And that was only the least strange thing that would happen on that day...

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5924716/chapters/13626331][The Many Faces of Harry Potter]] is really really solid, very enjoyable premise but abandoned before anything happens.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12979337/1/Harry-Potter-et-al-and-the-Keystone-Council][This]] is a currently updating WIP that's alright, personally not my cup of tea but is popular around here.
