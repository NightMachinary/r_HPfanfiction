Assuming Harry and Dudley went to a Muggle state school he would have been in grades 1 or 2 when it got banned in the Uk state schools.

Could that have been the reason he turned his teacher's wig blue with Accidental Magic?

The thing that's galling is that it seems like few are doing anything to harness the gift they are given (yes, the same thing happens in our world, but there are more of us, so it doesn't seem as bad.)

Not only is it not supported by canon, it's blatant and awful writing. Canon makes you think, wow House-Elves are slaves. Canon makes you think, wow the muggleborn are like any minority scapegoat.

**** Yeah, since a HUGE amount of the differential social norms for men and women is based on two realities- differential physical strength and the health/time investment costs of pregnancy and childbirth - and since the wizarding world has magic which ameliorates these two realities hugely, it makes 0 sense for there to be any strong inequality between the two groups.

***** Yep!

Funny thing is that barring her fictional historical figures, Rowling has no really strong female characters.

Lily killed Voldemort only because Snape was a creepy stalker.

McGonagall drove off Snape only because he didn't want to hurt her and she had backup. She was frankly just an informed badass who lost to handicapped Voldemort.

Molly/Bellatrix might have ended up being her strongest female characters.

****** I dunno, with people like Tonks and Amelia Bones, I'd say she does a good job of illustrating a society in which, while men and women do have on average different likes/dislikes/interests, neither maleness nor femaleness is seen as an obstacle to breaking out of these averages - while many/most women take a maternal or otherwise people-related job (teaching, administration etc) just like in the Muggle world, there are no barriers to women becoming law enforcement, Minister (Bagnold) etc since pregnancy is far less risky and magic limits the amount it inconveniences you, the wand makes physicality near irrelevant and the existence of a far more noticeable and important social cleavage (blood status) causes gender differences to be even less important.

That said, I think she focuses too much on Harry and his world, and that necessarily limits the amount of characters he interacts with in large enough amounts to really see lots of strong female characters, or even other well written and developed male characters.

I mean, think about the Death Eaters. We know a good amount about the characters of Snape, Pettigrew and Lucius/Draco Malfoy. We know that Bellatrix is powerful and crazy, that Karkaroff is a coward and that Crouch JR is clever and a good actor. That's the sum total of character for the entirety of the enemy army.

And then think about the order. The Marauders, Tonks, Moody, The Weasleys are about the only characters who we can say more than a few words about. Dung is sneaky and criminal; Figg is a scatterbrained Squib; Diggle, Jones and Vance exist, etc.

What about the Wizengamot or Aurors? Tonks, Amelia Bones MAYBE, Shacklebolt arguably, and that's it. Maybe Dawlish and Umbridge, though YMMV on Dawlish's character and Umbridge having a Wizengamot seat.

What about the entirety of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff? Luna gets a character. Cho is pretty and was sad when her boyfriend died; Marietta is a traitor and/or coward; Cedric was a golden boy; Justin Finch-Fletchley is posh; Zacharias Smith is pompous; Penelope Clearwater once dated Percy; Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott, Michael Goldstein, Anthony Corner, Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan and Padma Patil all exist.

Or even Gryffindors outside of Harry's year and the Quidditch team?

Romilda Vayne fancies Harry, and the Creeveys are fanboys of him. McLaggen is a prick. The non-Ron Weasleys also get characters.

Harry is myopic, and that leaves the world and minor characters unexplored, but JK does do a bang up job IMO in using the few surface facts Harry observes to built an interesting and evocative impact - there's a reason we have extensive fanon characterisations for most of the characters I've named and more.

One thing I think could have improved the canon series for me is more fantasy.

********* Ehh, it's not that unusual.

She assumed Snape was the person trying to kill Harry/steal the stone.

She thought Malfoy was the heir (this is my favorite book with her) until she was proven wrong.

She was right about Scabbers not being dead, but not for any good reason. I hate the fact that she's made right for all the wrong reasons. Sirius did send the broom, but it wasn't cursed.

Book 5 she was actually right about the ministry.

Book 7, she assumes that the elder wand doesn't exist until she's proven wrong.

Her character makes quite a few wrong assumptions throughout the series. The Malfoy one is just galling because you need the intelligence of a toddler not to have seen it.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where nearly everyone can at least hope to live into the neighborhood of 90--120 years, being a child-minder is probably only a witch's “first” job. Particularly in a society which appears to encourage and facilitate very early marriages. Once Ginny is out of Hogwarts, married off, and set up in her “first job”, Molly, like most witches, will be largely free to embark on her “real” career. And that career may well not be as a professional grandmother, and she may well be counting the days.

** Eh, another instance of not thinking the universe through.

Regular education went through many iterations of corporal punishment. Often based on the best (although lacking) data at the time. The magical world seems to go from 'oil up the racks' directly to banned.

So I would go with that: the magical world had some sort of traumatic event (kid tortured to insanity goes crazy and kills half his class), resulting in a ban. This would also give reason why the magical world still has.... Strangely high acceptance of child abuse and child endangerment, as those views didn't change along with a sudden ban. Contrast the real world, where the fading out of corporal punishment was very much part of a larger shift on appropriate behavior toward children.

I swear the punishments described by Filch are Matilda level evil.
