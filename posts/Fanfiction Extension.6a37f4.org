Just wanted to bring attention to an extension for google chrome which allows you to like or dislike stories and authors, and allows disliked stories to be hidden. The liked stories are coloured green for identification. This allows the reader to mark read fanfics so they can go through all the fanfics on the site.

[[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fanfiction-organizer/adlnghnicfngjnofbljedmclmdoepcbe?hl=en]]

Hope this helps everyone.

Happy reading


** now just add option to remove certain crossovers and it will be perfect

** This is awesome. Can you make an extension for other browsers? Safari would be great!

Some ideas for features to add:

- filter out stories based on matched "keywords". E.g "mpreg"
- filter out certain pairings. e.g. "Harry/Voldemort"
- for ao3 filter out stories with more than n number of tags, crossovers etc.
- Filter out genres. On FF.net you can remove 1, but I would really like to be able to filter out Romance/Hurt/Comfort/Family

** My first several thoughts were along the lines of "How does one extend a fanfic to the complex numbers?"
