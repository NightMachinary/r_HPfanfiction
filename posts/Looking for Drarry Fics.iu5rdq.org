I really wanna read a Drarry fic where Draco ends up fighting beside harry in the final battle. Does that exist anywhere?

â€‹

I recently watched a really cute Drarry animatic ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I-tECVlrxY][link here]]) and I was inspired by it to read some fanfics surrounding that idea
