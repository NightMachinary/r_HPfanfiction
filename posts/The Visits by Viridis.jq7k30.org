:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a fic titled *The Visits* by Viridis; it used to be on [[https://fictionalley.org][fictionalley.org]] and you can see the intro page on the waybackmachine here: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200121231056/http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/viridis/TV.html]]

The fic summary from the above page is:

#+begin_quote
  When child gets a Hogwarts letter, parents sometimes refuse the invitation. First visit after declining, Flitwick shows up. Second one, it's McGonagall. Third time, it's Snape, explaining that little Johnny *will* attend Hogwarts - either as a pupil or a potions ingredient....
#+end_quote

... but the waybackmachine didn't archive the pages of the actual fic.

I can't find it anywhere else; does anyone know of a cross-posting or have a downloaded copy they are willing to share?


** I had no trouble at all reading it from [[https://fictionalley.ikeran.org/authors/viridis/TV.html]]
