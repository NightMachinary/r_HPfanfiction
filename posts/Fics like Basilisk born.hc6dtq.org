Can you recommend me a fic that is like Basilisk born, in a way that Harry gets somehow in the past and has to live and mess throughout history until he gets back to his time?

I prefer gen, but I'm fine with het too (except H/G). Slash isn't my cup of tea.

Thanks!


** Okay I remember this:

One with a fem harry/merlin, forgot it's name.\\
One where he's in ancient egypt and everyone thinks he's Haru, a god, due to his magic.\\
The Nightmare Man, where he gets sent back and is really insane and deranged.

** You will 100% enjoy linkffn(A long journey home)

The past part begins in chapter four, and requires no introduction. Although personally, I enjoy the "present" chapters very much.

In my opinion it's to basilisk born like an actual restaurant is to a McDonalds.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

*** I started it just recently and wow it's fantastic. The description made me think it was about a Harry getting put in femharry's head so I avoided it until someone gave me a better description the other day.

For the record, it's not about a Harry getting put in femharry's head.
