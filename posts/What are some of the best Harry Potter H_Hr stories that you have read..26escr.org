I'll start it off with some of my favorites:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2841153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5218660/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sisters-Black]]


** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/4941/1][Harry Potter and the Circles End]] - There's also a sequel to this one, I've just started on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109003/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Maw][Harry Potter and the Maw]] directly following this one, and I have to say I'm legitimately missing madscientists versions of Harry and Hermione. WARNING He only writes at a NC17+ level so expect content to match.

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/3805944/1][Forbidden Love]] - Really good one, shows Harry and Hermione with her parents. Really like how it's written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/28/Resistance][Resistance]] - The title should give this one away a little bit, but they're essentially in hiding from the dark lord.

** I second [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lori/TPOU.html][Paradigm of uncertainty]]. It was written between GoF and OotP, so a lot of stuff is different from canon, but that is one of the things that make the story an interesting read.

Also, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister][Unlike a sister]]. One of the very few epilogue-compliant H/Hr stories and one of the most thrilling romance stories I have ever read.

** If you are a fan of H/Hr, do yourself a favor and read Harry Potter and the Fifth Element. It's massive and really well written and hands down my favorite fic that I've ever read. It was written before Half-blood prince came out and pretty much is a rewrite of book six. So good! Check it out here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4098039/1/Harry-Potter-The-Fifth-Element]]

*** As much as I really wanted to like this fic, I had to say adios once there was infidelity.

***** I can understand that, but infidelity is just another form of angst. Especially when it's a result of a certain overdone plot device.

His world building was really first rate, though. Some really brilliant ideas as you said.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8831374/1/The-Power-of-the-Press][Power of the Press]] by Bobmin356

Harry leaves Britain to avoid being forced into the triwizard tournament, but contacts Hermione after realizing his feelings for her. The story centers around the development of their relationship via correspondence while finishing school.

** I'll recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion][Champion's Champion]] all day long.

If you really can't stand Ron, then this story is perfect. It's hilarious, but the writing kinda goes downhill in the second half and devolves into wish fulfillment.

Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1330896/Seel-vor][this guy]] probably writes some of the best H/Hr fics. His oneshots are pretty great, especially BOaDL.

Robst and old crow are okay if you don't mind terrible grammar and a general lack of conflict, but I feel they give the ship a bad name.

I tend to avoid unfinished fics like the plague, but the best one of those is unequivocally [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1430023/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Acceptance-of-Fate][HP & the Acceptance of Fate]].
