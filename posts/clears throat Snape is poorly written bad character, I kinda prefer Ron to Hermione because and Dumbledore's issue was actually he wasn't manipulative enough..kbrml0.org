Snape is not a good example of a "grey" character, he is bad at his job of being both a spy and a teacher. And he abuses children. Literally would have been better if he died during the first war. Hermione constantly tells Harry to "respect " Snape which is gross. Why should he respect an adult who bullies him. Also wish she didn't snitch on them. Also, Harry was way too young to get the info Dumbledore gave him through the first books. Once Dumbledore started recognizing voldemort was returning he should have started both hunting down ways to take down voldemort but also manipulated events so Harry was far better trained.


** We have gone through often enough about this topic here and generally agreed that Dumbledore is mostly a dumbed down plot device in a children's series. Useless and negligent adults are after all trademarks of children's literature, and Harry Potter is not that bad in this regard.

Anyway, if you don't write Dumbledore as an incompetent and criminally negligent plot device, you will get something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], in which the plot is solved and there's nothing to do for the kids.

Therefore, you have to do a lot more changes if you want to write a competent Dumbledore and still end up with canon stations. That's also why I and many others HATE canon rehashes so much.

*** My problem with Petrification Prolifiration is that Dumbledore still has done things that should earn him a jail sentence. The whole Philosopher Stone plot in particular and to a lesser extent not doing anything about Harry's abuse.

But this just serves to highlight your point more. If Dumbledore were competent, then the story would look completely different and there would be no place for Harry and his friends to play heroes.

(As an aside you could probably also lay a large part of the Imperius defense working at Dumbledore's feet. To further drive the point home regarding how much canon would need to change with a competent Dumbledore.)

** Snape is just a classic incel. He asks Voldemort to kill Lily's husband and child, so that she can then 'become his'. When that falls through he becomes (or stays) a bitter basement dweller who is so hateful that nobody is surprised when he is his students' nightmare fuel (Neville's boggart).

To be fair to Dumbledore, while many bashing fics portray him as some sort of Machiavellian 4D chessmaster, in canon he is arguably just an inspired academic, who ends up thrust into leadership roles because everyone else is so incompetent. At no point is it even implied, let alone seen, that he is a skilled politician/general.

He walks into the government bumrushing Harry in 5, outmaneuvers everyone in a handful of paragraphs, and walks back out again. He's seen as a leader by literally the entire society, and of the school. He was the leader in every conflict over the last half century that we know about. He was offered Minister three separate times. Implications were all over the series talking about Dumbledore's leadership skills.

You can argue he did all of those things because of incompetence of everyone else, but that would /still/ make him comparatively fall into those roles.

**** I'd more say he did that because Rowling wanted him to.

Nothing he did in the trial is uber-political or some sort of great speech or anything. It was typical Rowling. Everything happens because she wants it to.

It's one of her flaws, she writes a great world, but characterization shows the authorial hand -all the time-.

** To be fair, Hermione being trusting to Authority is one of her earlier personality traits, which she has to overcome.

Also, Snape is not a good person. He loves Lily, yes, but that does not make him a good person. He's just an asshole. He hates Harry's guts because he's reminded that Lily chose James over him, because Harry looks exactly like James, but with Lily's eyes. I'm not saying that Snape treating Harry like that is in anyway right, I'm just pointing out that he's not doing bad stuff without reason. Not a good reason, yes, but still a reason. Also, I'm pretty sure Snape doesn't treat all of the students like he treats Harry. Sure, he's unfair and shouldn't be a teacher, but he doesn't try to make students cry.

*** Oh, he does try to make his students cry. He belittles and insults them, we see this from day one where he refers most of his previous students as dunderheads oe somesuch. He is Neville's boggart ffs. No, what makes Snape compelling is he is a necessary evil. He is practically untouchable because both Dumbledore and Voldemort trust him implicitly. So, he does whatever the fuck he wants at Hogwarts because Dumbledore can't stop him.

**** Ok, I accept your point, he does make students cry. But I maintain that he does not actually hate the other students like he does Harry.

While I believe that Dumbledore does trust him implicitly, I don't think Voldemort is able to trust anyone to that degree. Also, why does this make him a necessary evil? I feel like you've gone off track.

***** Because Dumbledore needs him, he overlooks the things that would get Snape fired within a day. Meaning, for all Harry and the co.'s frustrations and misgivings about Snape, him staying as a professor was for the best. He is written in such a way that the reader hates him, and yet can see he was an essential part of the victory so has to give him the necessary credit. That, in my opinion, what makes Snape a great character.

******* What does Snape do that is vital? We see 0 times where Snape provides information that helped the war. War is not an evil nessisity, but that implies he is competent. He is bad at all his jobs including being a spy. He kills no death eaters, he doesn't stop things like Azkaban being raided. He is a poorly written character. Also he didn't love lily, last hw actually knew her was 15. He is in his 40s by end of the books.

******** But the narrator of the books is Harry. We don't have much information about the last war, and even if he didn't help in this one, he could have still been a major life-saving asset during the last war. Also, I apologize, but I don't get what you mean at the part where you believe he didn't love Lily? Also also, he is a double spy for Dumbledore. You try gaining the trust of a megalomaniac that loves homicide. Trust me, it wouldn't be easy.

Despite all I've said however, I mean no offense, and I would apologize if I did indeed offended you somehow. So... uhh... That's it?

********* You didn't offend me, but Snape simply does not pass the test for well written character. You saying he maybe did stuff behind the scenes, that's bad writing. Show don't tell is an important concept in all forms of media. If Snape is a character we should view as complicated, we should be informed of specific ways he was in fact useful. Also last war remembered Snape turned right when he learned voldemort was gonna kill Harry's family. That's, right right at the end of the war, so he likely wasn't helpful then.

********** Good point. But even if that's all true, Snape should still be commended for being brave enough to try to redeem himself for the greatest mistake he made, i.e telling Voldemort of the prophecy/becoming a death eater. It's not gonna be easy to be a double spy, considering Voldemort's nature and his views on traitors.

** Yes, he is not a well-written character, he is a walking/talking plot twist.

He doesn't have to be logical in any way, his trauma doesn't need to match his actions, the character we see doesn't need to match his abilities (how often do we see him lose his cool, see him as an emotional and explosive man, with a short temper, who is unable do hide his dislikes but he is such a good spy that he can control even his own thoughts and never let anything shine through? That doesn't make any sense...). And what kind of reminds me of a Mary-Sue, stories and character wrap around him to make him important. Dumbledore apparently doesn't trust anyone, but that spy with questionable loyalty (and every spy's loyalty should always be questioned and a spy should never know more than they really really need to work). And Voldemort, a cruel man to his own followers, is all too happy to trust him again and let him in on sensitive information and into a powerful position? Smart people have to hold the idiot ball really tight to make Snape important...

*** Yes exactly. Fun fact, if you critically think through all the books, Snape only is shown to accomplish 3 tasks. He ineffectivly tries to counter the charm on Harry's broom, he brews wolfsbane third year and he delivers them the sword (although he decides to put it in the bottom of a frozen lake, and not say, near a backpack with supplies for them. ). Literally does nothing else in 7 books.

**** People often shout out, when I say Snape reminds me of a Mary-Sue.

But to me the thing that makes or breaks a Mary-Sue is the fact if the world and the characters are twisted around them. And that happens with Snape.

And that he is always at least a mini-plot twist.

1st book, Oh shock! Snape isn't the evil one

2nd book, that maybe the book without one...

3rd book, Oh shock! Snape was helping Lupin and hated Harry's father and friends.

4th book, Oh shock! Snape is an ex-death eater.

5th book, Oh shock! Snape had a reason to hate Harry's father.

6th book, Oh shock! Snape kills Dumbledore and is the half-blood prince.

7th book, Oh shock! Snape was on the good side in the end and had a thing for Harry's mum.
