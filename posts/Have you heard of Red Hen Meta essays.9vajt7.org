I'm sharing a site I saw linked elsewhere: [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/weasleys.html]]

She (?) is a fic writer and artist whose site has dozens of lengthy essays speculating about the characters and dynamics.\\
For example - the page I linked is a reading of the Weasley family figuring why Charlie and Bill are so different from the younger kids. It seems a bit bashy, but reading further, she is pretty hard on /everyone./ And all 4 houses. Her essay on Hufflepuffs vs Ravenclaws posits that Ravenclaws would be aggressively eccentric oddballs who were nasty to each other, written years before Luna Lovegood was invented. Her stuff on Peter & Sirius was fascinating to me too, a deeper dive into what I've basically though (Peter is incredibly capable, but Sirius is scarier). And I loved her essay on the wrongheadedness of thinking Neville would be a Hufflepuff.

I genuinely disagreed with some of the writing too, don't get me wrong. But I really enjoy meta like this and had a ball reading though it for a while last night, so I wanted to share.

I'd love recs for other essayists like this, as well.


** I've read Red Hen's works quite a bit, and she's an interesting author. The biggest crux of most of her logical reasonings is often a negative view of a character/situation. Compared to some other head canons (Taure's), there seems to be a very Hobbes/Rousseau dynamic going on. Interesting stuff, but also sometimes unnecessarily dark for me.

*** This mirrors my thoughts quite well. She's an interesting, thoughtful, well-reasoned read. But she tends to take the darkest possible view of any given character's actions and motivations. (I guess Percy is an exception in the Weasley essay above. And she'll give Snape a break here and there too.) Of course, always attributing everything to malice and character flaws can be fun to read when you dislike a character....

**** I haven't read all of her essays, but it seems a bit strange to treat the Weasley family in a very uncharitable light but then give Snape some breaks. But that's almost certainly my own bias because I'm not a fan of Snape apologetics (especially in Canon with "Albus Severus Potter." Christ what a name).

***** She openly explains in one of her essays that Molly reminds her of her mother and her relationship with her mother was extremely fraught, so that's why the uncharitable view of the Weasleys.

Meanwhile, Snape happens to be her particular favorite (as he is for many), and that leads to an extremely uncharitable view of the Marauders. Not that the Marauders don't have their personality flaws tattooed on their foreheads for everyone to see-- but that's three more relatively popular characters for her to hate in addition to the Weasleys, contributing to the overall dark tone.

****** Given that context that makes more sense. I have a great relationship with my mother so I probably don't get bothered as much by Molly's bad characteristics because there's no real life parallel.

** That's actually a pretty fascinating analysis of the Weasley family. Useful for those of us writing our own fics as well, so that we have better character motivation. I know I'll get some good use out of that.

For other essayists, I've been partial to Dan H's articles on Ferretbrain. I don't necessarily agree with everything about it, but his one on Calvinism is pretty insightful (even if I've heard the statements about the Church of Scotland aren't actually accurate).

** Interesting article about Weasleys.

I agree they are not a nice bunch. Molly is of course my least favorite among them, not that I think she's bad or evil. No, my biggest gripe against her is that she always thinks she knows best, but is not nearly competent enough to make the right call. Examples:

- Assuming Hermione was a slut based on Skeeter article
- Opposing Twins's plan for the shop
- Denying vital information to Harry, against Sirius's wishes
- Assuming the worst of Fleur
- Sabotaging Trio's effort to prepare for the Horcrux hunt

On the other hand, I disagree with that author's assessment of Ginny's development after GoF. It seems she wants Ginny to remain that meek and innocent little girl. I don't. I don't like perfectly nice, innocent, and moralistic characters at all. They are boring.

This is basically the defining characteristic of every neighbourhood mom-type? To make your examples a bit more generic: Believing gossip mags/tabloids, pushing their children towards safe careers, "protecting" kids from the truth while severely underestimating them, disliking the person their child is dating, and again the "protecting" thing.

JKR overall writes like an adult woman of her generation. The bickering friends-turned- lovers trope. Hermione is who she sees herself as, Ginny is who she wants to be.

*** I really hate the "Mother Knows Best" character trope. Like why do people find it charming to have a domineering mother? It's that classic mother in law from hell stereotype that is so hard to get away from.

** "Or his reactions. Blowing off his falling out with Harry over the Goblet of Fire with “he's just jealous” may have made Harry feel better, but it wasn't a particularly accurate interpretation of the situation. Mere jealousy would have been if Ron were indeed fuming just because Harry had gotten some more public attention and he didn't (Q: When /hasn't/ he?). That wasn't what was going on at all. Attracting public attention wasn't the issue --- although that made an easy stick to beat Harry over the head with.

Ron was upset that Harry had somehow managed to get his name into the Goblet /without/ him. He was convinced that Harry had gone and done it by himself, and then was shutting him out even more by not even having the decency to /tell/ him about it. There was some jealousy present, sure. But he wasn't /just/jealous. Ron is used to being outshone, he doesn't mind it too much so long as you still /include/ him. But now he's been shut out, and rejected as well, and it hurts."

- Red Hen("Deconstructing Miss Granger")

Her essay on Hermione is good stuff. It's slightly bias, but it's a breath of fresh air to get this perspective on a character that is rarely criticized like other main characters are.

Plus I had to add this quote on Ron cause he's my favorite character and this event has been misinterpreted for a /decade./

** That was a surprisingly insightful essay. Very useful for writing a story and trying to make the Weasleys more dynamic and giving reason to their various personalities.

Definitely gonna read the other ones.
