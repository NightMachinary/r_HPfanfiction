I've seen plenty marvel crossovers with Dr. Strange, now I want the other strange doctor.


** I don't know that it really counts as a crossover, but there is a fic called How I learned to stop worrying and love Lord Voldemort, in which Voldemort has a paranoia of nuclear weapons. Be and Harry must team up to stop bombs.
