#+TITLE: Any time-travel Harry/Luna fics. I just feel like that even though Luna has a bad relationship with sanity, she still seems wise beyond her years. Plus it'd just be fun seeing people's reactions to Harry's, and Luna's talks.

** I love Harry/luna, and I love her brand of reality disconnection, but it think my favorite ever explanation I've seen behind crumpled horned snorkacks is that Luna walked in on her parents doing the dirty, and they explained they were looking for crumple horned snorkacks, and even though she knows what it is now, she and her dad still go on expeditions to try and find them as a way of remember her mother's unique way of looking at the world, and as family bonding, and I just thought that was really sweet.

** A fanfic where Harry's friendship with Luna helps her become more sane and stable would be nice as well. Seriously, Luna's personality in the book makes me seriously uncomfortable sometimes.

She is basically a conspiracy theorist being played for laughs, but remember that Alex Jones is not joking.

*** Alex Jones? Apart from that, nah. I'm all for leaning into the insanity. It would at least be fun, and better than most where she's either as you said played for laughs, or a prophet. I like fics where Luna is the way she is, because she just sees more. Maybe because of her mothers death having such an impact that it broke her in a significant enough manner that her mind just doesn't work like a normal persons, and because of that mixed with magic it allowed her to see, and understand more that our minds would protect us from by making us ignore. That or she does it for shits and giggles. Both is good.

Ngl, Luna reminds me of RL conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones and that's why I usually don't read stories focusing on her.

  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up. Also, the tanslation in French is available by Eohwel. This is a repost to save it from being deleted, sorry about the formatting, it won't be fixed
