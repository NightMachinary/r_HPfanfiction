****** Well there you go. Glad you liked it. Witowsmp is one of a handful of HP writers still going who've been at it as long as I have.

******** Honestly? Just Google Darth Marrs fanfiction. I should be one of the top hits. 23 novel length fics, mostly crossovers or heavy AUs. And some of My fics ARE controversial. I've moved out of HP for the past few stories, but that just comes with being old. Good reading.

***** Eh it was written starting 15 years ago before the new Puritanism that has swept through fanfic. Then again, it's also been about a decade since I read it. All I remember about it is that it met OPs request.

****** No, I don't think it is controversial because of PC reasons. It is really not very good, because it carries so many tropes, which make the story so clich√©, that (for me) it is almost unreadable. However, it was some time I tried to read it (I haven't finished), so I don't give you exact details. Lord Potter, unending wealth, goblins fixing everything, etc. All those tropes are there. Yes, the story is so old, that it wasn't that overused in these times, but now it is really hard to read.

******* While everyone is entitled to their taste, calling a fic controversial just because you don't like it is, to be frank, dishonest.

The story is actually pretty typical of the time and helped create the tropes we're tired of now. I don't remember any Lord Potter or unending wealth, just a Harry raised by McGonagalls family in America. It was unrepentantly H/Hr with typical 2006 bashing, and so it's concepts are old, and maybe not to everyone's taste, but that is not controversial.

******** Err, actually, I have apparently confused it with another story. I am sorry and stand corrected.
