I am currently planning out my fic and there is supposed to be a Draco/Hermione side-ship for plot reasons. As I'm not a shipper myself I have very little ideas as to how to get them together in a believable manner. It's an AU, where Harry is in Slytherin and he's sort friends with Draco and not on friendly terms with Ron and Hermione so any canon-based reasons might not work. Draco still has his initial aversion to Gryffindors and Ron in particular but in canon most of his encounters against trio are usually all about Potter and I don't much remember what can make him interested solely in Hermione (and haven't read any fics about them for that matter). Hermione is truly on Dumbledore's side in the fic. Any help and ideas are appreciated!


** I'm not a sniper (lol that autocorrect, I'm totally leaving it), but I do read some of the better Dramoine fics. A lot of the time, they bond over academia. While there isn't any canon evidence that Draco was studious, according to Rowling he was an occlumens, he fixed the vanishing cabinet in his sixth year/ made the plan in the first pace/ managed to come up with shitty on purpose plans (which imo sounds more difficult), and there's a quote by Rowling saying he preserved and displayed all of his family's artefacts. So I think he is a little nerdy, he's just got other things on his mind as well.

Btw, kudos to you for writing something out of your comfort zone.

*** can you link some fics? bc i've been stuck reading bad fics which warp canon in a bad way or have unrealistic writing for the characters. (canon warping is definitely fine, but when it's Hermione as Voldemort's daughter sort of shit...)

**** I would recommend [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/4314892/?cid=224&s=0&a=s][Colubrina's]] fics. I enjoyed linkffn(The Muddy Princess) and didn't finish but liked what I read of linkffn(Like Brothers by Colubrina) and linkffn(The Wrong Strain).

  Just another Pureblood!Hermione story. A hidden adoption revealed, a brother found, a new world to figure out: "What are you hoping for?" he asked as they stood ready to do the spell. "I don't know," Hermione admitted. "You?" His knuckles were white on his wand. "A sister," he said, his voice very low, "I'm hoping for a sister." Winner 2015 Energize WIP Awards. COMPLETE.

  Minerva McGonagall steps in on the awful night the Potters are murdered and arranges to have Harry Potter raised by Sirius Black and his somewhat cousins, the Malfoys. Draco and Harry grow up as almost brothers and everything - well, almost everything - is different. Gryffindor!Draco. Dramione. AU.

  Everyone knew what veela were. Veela were magical creatures, breathtakingly beautiful, who captivated men with a single look. It would have been nice to have been that strain. Instead, Hermione Granger was infected by another. Instead of captivating all men, she was captivated by one. She'd die without him. She was already in almost constant pain. DRAMIONE. COMPLETE.

** Should probably be flair'd as “discussion,” not “request”, as the “request” flair is for asking for recommendations for other fanfics.

I'm not a Dramione shipper, however. My first thought is of forbidden fruit, but Draco is such a daddy's boy he always adheres to his father's wishes to the best of his ability in canon, so unless you change his nature quite a bit...

My other thought would be, since he's a pureblood, and therefore better than Hermione in every conceivable way, he'd be obsessed with besting her, and perhaps this obsession gives way to something else.
