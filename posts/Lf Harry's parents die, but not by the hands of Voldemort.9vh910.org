Not killed by Dumbledore either preferably. Harry being the chosen one is optional. I think a ff with neither leader killing the Potters could make for an interesting read. The killer could be from either side or unknown as well. Thanks!

I've always wanted to read a story where James and Lily die of dysentery.

** Prince of the dark kingdom by mizuni-sama if you haven't read it yet

Just beware despite its 147 chapters it is a long way (probbably at least 20 or 30 more chapters) away from being finished and hasn't been updated since June 2014

Despite that however it is otherwise a fantastic story if you have the time

*** Was gonna recommend it as well. Absolutely worth a read.

Still unexplainable how it gets abandoned halfway through the last book :/

Fem!harry. Lily dead to a mob and James in azkaban. I really enjoy the story, it does some interesting stuff with the world. Also a Neville as the boy who lived.
