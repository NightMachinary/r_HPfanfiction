See title. I'm just wondering if there's any HP fics which somehow center on golf.

Wizards making magic with a different kind of stick.

Oliver preferring a different kind of Wood in his hands. And Quidditch beaters using their clubs to hit a different set of balls.

The Owlery is where you go to get birdies (and the occasional eagle).

The troll in first year practices with his club all the time, but despite that his scorecard is covered in bogies.

  An assortment of Harry Potter one shots. Though listed as "Humor/General," the collection also contains Drama, Horror, Family, and Tragedy, as well as a few experimental fiction stories as I work out my stylist chops. Contain crossovers with several fictional worlds, including the Cthulhu Mythos, Starship Troopers, Star Wars, and James Bond.
