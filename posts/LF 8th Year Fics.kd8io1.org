I'm looking for fics post-war where at least one of them decides to go back to Hogwarts and get their NEWTS. I prefer Hermione / femharry leads but I really don't mind, and I don't have a preference on what pairing it is (or if there is a pairing at all). Thanks !

  "Listen, teenage rebellion, self-discovery and petty crimes are fine, but can everyone just avoid dabbling in the Dark Arts this year?" -Theo Nott, 1998It's time for Theo's (reluctant) glow-up amidst Slytherin House's post-war evolution.
