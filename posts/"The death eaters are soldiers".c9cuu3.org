As they do not follow the rules of engagement, they are terrorists, not partisans. That is all.

Furthermore, defence of a culture is not, morally, a legitimate reason to start a war that will be costly to military personnel on either side.

Authors that try to moralize an fascist illegitimate terrorist/partisan force, except by making it not an fascist illegitimate terrorist/partisan force are annoying and I'd like to not have to read such things.

*** Honesty is a virtue. Reading fanfiction after fanfiction where Harry is brainwashed into being a militant fascist is tiring. Even though many of the death eaters would have been brainwashed in canon, at least canon acknowledges it as so - acknowledges such acts as immoral and the brainwashing as brainwashing.

While the stories are written from the perspective of a person who believes such things to be moral, you just know that the author probably believes the same - as so many authors seem to consider the arguments flawless enough to convince everyone who hears them in their narrative.

Either way, for the same argument to work on every character the author wishes to convert is extremely unrealistic in and of itself.

** I agree with you there

â€‹

But another idea I toy with at the moment is dealing with the question when and in what way is fighting against them become immoral as well. The idea is that while the cause is right for those fighting death eaters, the ways can be too extreme

Like in the Northen Ireland conflict there were terror groups on both sides, but in the story we have a good and bad side of course, because if one side is for a bloody murderous regime and genocide, there has to be a worst side.

*** Those who aren't imperiused are terrorists who threaten the lives of others every day they remain free. As there are far greater odds of killing them than imprisoning them, refusing to kill them would sacrifice many more innocent lives than guilty lives that would be saved.

According to the rules of engagement, set forth by the League of Nations in the early 20th century, an armed force is only required to take captives in a conflict if the enemy regiment surrenders to them. They are not required to attempt to capture them through non-lethal means before then.

For those who are imperiused - I would say their victims have a duty to accept their fate - as to kill one who is imperiused would be murder, but to be killed by one would be to killed by an innocent man. However, if they will have multiple victims, which is likely, this becomes more complex, morally. I would not presume to be able to make a judgement on the morality of such a scenario.

***** I respectfully disagree.

I realize I say that from the safety of my own home, and the innocence of never experiencing being in that position. But I personally find the idea of hurting innocent people reprehensible; so if that's what it took to protect the person I was hurting, I'd like to think I'd be able to accept that fate.

It's sad, and it's tragic. But war isn't happy. War isn't kind. When you have an imperioused witch/wizard torturing your family/friend/comrade you'll need to do whatever it takes to protect them, and protect yourself.

***** Not if the imperiused person continues to pose a threat to other people, which they will by definition. But otherwise? You're suggesting that a person who is culpable for their actions deserves life more than someone who isn't - than someone who is, by definition, innocent of any crime.

After the culpable person kills, they're a murderer, after the imperiused person kills, they aren't. They can claim "self-defence" all they want, but it won't wipe the stain of the blood on their hands, if they use lethal means.

You do not deserve to live anymore than anyone else. That is the way of a truly equitable world. To be selfless is a virtue. To be selfish is a vice. So men must be selfless and be prepared to sacrifice for others.

**** But if defending against someone under Imperio and you kill them in that fight, would it be murder or self-defence? Nevermind that you don't know who is imperiused and who isn't.

What about attacking the structures that support Death Eaters, but are not actively fighting themselves. financal supporters or those that protect them from the law or even try to influence lawmakers to pass terrible laws. Look at the bureaucratic Nazis in ww2.

***** The rules of engagement state that only military personnel are an acceptable military target. Killing bureaucrats would be a war crime, while revolting against a murderous regime by targeting its military force would not be so.

Bureaucrats require a military force to carry out acts of violence, so it is the military force that must be crippled in order to cripple a regime. This makes bureaucrats an unacceptable target. Killing bureaucrats would only achieve the promotion of mob justice in lieu of fair trials performed by a fair and just legal system.

To quote a summary about partisans and the laws of warfare. And article two of Hague IV is quite explicit:

#+begin_quote
  The inhabitants of a territory which has not been occupied, who, on the approach of the enemy, spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading troops without having had time to organize themselves in accordance with Article 1, shall be regarded as belligerents *if they carry arms openly and if they respect the laws and customs of war*.
#+end_quote

Also, consider Article 23:

#+begin_quote
  Art. 23. In addition to the prohibitions provided by special Conventions, it is especially forbidden

  (a) To employ poison or poisoned weapons;

  (b) To kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army;

  (...)

  (f) To make improper use of a flag of truce, of the national flag or of the military insignia and uniform of the enemy, as well as the distinctive badges of the Geneva Convention;

** What do you mean, follow the rules of engagement? They probably have their own.

Defence of a culture is absolutely a morally acceptable reason to start a war. Lots of perfectly legitimate separatist and nationalist groups have had this as their objective. The desire for political independence and self-determination is a desire for freedom.

The death eaters seek to impose their rule on others though rather than seeking self-determination or independence.

*** "What do you mean, follow the rules of engagement? They probably have their own."

The rules of engagement are still the essence of modern perceptions of morality in contemporary warfare.

"Defence of a culture is absolutely a morally acceptable reason to start a war."

Thinking people should actually die because you're having a shitfit about your heritage dying out isn't moral. Human lives are infinitely more valuable than such vague, abstract concepts.

"The desire for political independence and self-determination is a desire for freedom."

If there isn't any actual discrimination taking place, that still isn't worth fighting a war over. Fighting a war so your children won't be treated like shit because of their heritage is fine, but fighting a war because you want to preserve the existence of that heritage is far less noble a cause.
