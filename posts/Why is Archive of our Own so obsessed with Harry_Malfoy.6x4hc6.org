** Do a filter search of pairings on ffnet, the biggest pairing by FAR is HP/DM. There are more fics with that pairing than Harry/Ginny and Harry/Hermione fics *combined*.

Now obviously, there will be a lot more fics that are older than the pairing feature, but the ratio would be around the same, I think.

And then there's AO3, which is like 90% slash anyways. Of course HP/DM will be popular.

So the question you have to be asking yourself is: why is the fandom in general so obsessed with the pairing, and of a boy who had no redeemable qualities throughout canon.

*** Right? I've often wondered what the fascination with Draco is. He's a little shit through the whole series. Like another poster, I put it down to Tom Felton growing up to be pretty decent-looking. Kind of funny--a few years ago we were at a local con where Tom was a guest and there was a photo op set up with him. It was inside of a tent that was set up inside of the con floor and there was a long list of rules posted outside, including NO TOUCHING. The line of girls went on forever.

**** I think it's mostly because of Felton. And the Snape obsession is due to Alan Rickman. Both actors were really good and played their roles magnificently, and I appreciate them for that, but I hate what they did to the fandom. And I think Rickman was too good looking, despite having the Snape characterization down to perfection.

Snape is /not/ supposed to be good looking.

I always thought that JKR was trying to go for the classic children's literature witch description for Snape, except as a man. You know, hooked nose, warts, greasy hair, pointed hat, etc.

Most fanon depicts him as a sexy, dark brooding type. :\

What irritates me about this is that the same people who worship Draco and Snape are the same people who despise Ron for the couple of times he got jealous.

***** Yeah, I don't get the Snape love, either. To my mind, if he really loved Lily, he would have been less of a dick to her kid, no matter who he looked like. I understand not wanting to show Harry special treatment because of his ultimate destiny, but he could have been less of a vindictive shit. And I will adore Ron to the end of my days. He's funny, smart and loyal and he's also a teenager whose emotions get the better of him on occasion. Snape is an adult who should know better dealing with children. Grow up and get over yourself, Severus.

***** If Alan Rickman is responsible for the Snape fanfiction then I'd say Emma Watson is responsible for the Hermione fandom considering most of her fanon depictions. I won't deny that Alan Rickman adds some appeal to Snape but this argument is getting old. People read and write about him because he's, you know, an interesting character. Fanfiction about Snape existed before the movies came out and I'd like to think people are aware enough to differentiate the characters from the actor.

And Snape being unattractive can be attributed to the bias of Harry's limited pov. I don't think he's a heart-throb but I don't really find a hooked nose off-putting. People just like moral ambiguity and narratives of redemption.

****** Harry Potter fanfiction was in its infancy before the movies came out and people started to identify Alan Rickman as Snape. No one, hopefully, was looking at Emma Watson as a sexual being when she was 10-11 years old. It's not like HP fanfiction took off in 1997 with the publication of Philosopher's Stone. It most likely took a few years for the series to become really popular and for fanfiction to start being written. And the movie came out in 2001, so... yeah. When people think of the characters, they go by how the movie actors look like.

Why would Harry have a bias? Before that moment, he had never even heard of Severus Snape and had no reason to like or dislike him. Harry's first impression of the man was of a greasy fellow with sickly looking skin and a hooked nose. It wasn't just the hooked nose that made him ugly. It was his entire appearance, and his demeanor. Nothing about him was supposed to make you like him, in canon, until perhaps at the very end of the series.

Interesting character? He could be. But people let fanon get to their heads. They glorify Snape while vilifying the Marauders after seeing one memory from Snape's *very* biased perspective. They think this gives him an angsty (which the fandom loves) background, as if his past justifies his actions in the present. Thing is, Snape gave just as good as he got, and he also bullied muggleborns with dark magic while he was a student at Hogwarts. He was never a victim, and remained a bully until his dying day.

But like I said, he could be. If fanfic authors took time to examine him and all aspects of his history, such as his almost stalker-like obsession with Lily, his relationship with his parents, his relationship with Dumbledore, his relationship with Voldemort, his relationship with the Death Eaters... he could be amazingly interesting. Because all that stuff is relevant and makes a complex character. He was playing a double agent in a war that lasted for years. What did he have to do? Was his relationship with Dumbledore contentious, did he hate the man or respect him? Both? Who were his friends? Was Lucius a true friend, or just another way to solidify his place among the Death Eaters?

But authors don't. They focus on him being a victim of either James Potter, Voldemort, Dumbledore, or all of the above and forget about everything else. It's boring, not to mention factually wrong at times.

In regards to Hermione, yes. With the explosion of the movies getting people to read the books, with people growing up alongside seeing Emma Watson grow as Hermione and looking at how pretty she became, people got into the Harry/Hermione pairing. The directors didn't help at all by giving some of Ron's best lines to her and making her seem like the perfect girl for Harry.

But Hermione isn't supposed to be pretty. At most, she's an average looking girl with buckteeth and bushy, frizzy hair who doesn't care about her appearance past being clean and presentable. Yes, she was described as really beautiful when she took the time to dress up and put an effort into looking good, but it was such a surprise to other characters because prior to the Yule Ball, no one had thought of Hermione as a pretty girl. Emma Watson is entirely too good looking to be Hermione. And I'd agree that much of the popularity of the pairing is due to Emma Watson.

Agree, here. Snape is probably my second or third favorite character in the books and it has nothing to do with Alan Rickman, though he played the part amazingly. He's one of the most complex characters in the series. You could easily do quite a few things with his character, some of them completely contradictory, and /still/ be in character for him.

You're also oversimplifying, and missing, the core of the Marauders-Snape dynamic. James may get a majority of Snape's ire, but he wouldn't have been the core instigator in their interactions. He was just the Marauders' ringleader, and everything Snape wanted to be.

************ Yes. He received bullying from the Marauders. He also bullied other students, hence "gave back". What part of this confuses you? The paragraph was about bullying, it's not considered bullying if two people... bully each other. That's just an antagonistic relationship. The context of the line was in reference to bullying, not fighting each other. The implication therefore is that Snape bullied just as much as he was bullied.

But if you'd like.

Snape was vindictive enough to try and stalk Lupin around Hogwarts during their school days, knowing there was something odd about him.

Snape let it be known that Lupin was a werewolf, knowing that he would be kicked out of Hogwarts and be unemployed. Even before the events at the Shrieking Shack, Snape was so bitter and cruel that he tried to point students in the right direction about Lupin being a werewolf in order to probably get him kicked out.

Snape tried to throw both Lupin and Black into Azkaban without even deigning to hear what Lupin was all about, interrupting his explanation to the kids. Not even just Azkaban, he was hoping for the Dementor's Kiss for both of them, and was fanatic about not hearing any excuse or reason.

What exactly am I oversimplifying and missing? We got snapshots of the dynamic between them as children, brief snippets of memories. There's not much to simplify or complicate. Snape was bullied by the Marauders. Snape bullied muggleborns. You're stretching when you say Snape wanted to be everything James wanted to be, Snape never wanted to be a Gryffindor Quidditch star who acted like the worst type of jock stereotype. All he wanted, from the memories we saw, was Lily.

However, the reverse is not true, as some of my favorite female slash fics were all written by women, such as [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/][Here and There]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/][Murder Most Horrid]].

*** adding to jenorama's comment, you can filter out any tag by simply putting a - sign before it. for example: -mpreg would filter out all fics w/ the mpreg tag. -m/f or -m/m would take out all het or slash parings and -harry/draco would remove all fics w/ this pairing tagged from your search, etc. this is all done in the right hand bar. you can still get spammed by unrelated stories though since people tend to tag even minor pairings, but this can help to refine your search.

to answer op; ao3 tends to garner more explicit fanfic, esp slash, since it has less regulation than ff.net(and more tag options), and harry/malfoy is just a popular pairing in hp fandom(esp amoung teenage girls). could be the foeyay or just fangirls finding those character's actor the most attractive. personally not a huge fan of draco so i know your pain. i was surprised that harry/ron is barely shipped since they where bff's in the series, but people do tend to prefer tension/unbalance to friendship romance i guess? pls anyone rec me a good ron/harry fic
