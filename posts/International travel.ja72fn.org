World building question- how do you think wizards travel long distances (across oceans to different continents)? Do Portkeys have a distance range? In my head, I envision something similar to the Knight Bus for international travel, but I think I'm overthinking things


** Portkeys.

From Pottermore:

#+begin_quote
  In this way, the arrivals and departures of great numbers of witches and wizards can be staggered, enabling such events such as the Quidditch World Cup to take place with few security breaches.
#+end_quote

There's a Hogwarts Express page that says the original method of travel was portkeys, but too many sick kids caused them to steal a train.

Most can't apparate from Scotland or London to Germany, Tonks was howling at the thought of riding through or very close to clouds at night from Surrey to London, and I think ships, carriages, trains and the like are for schools; thousands of people traveling from the same location to another.

Portkeys.

*** Thanks. I think I'd read that before. I'm trying to brainstorm alternatives, but I'm hitting a wall. I guess if it's not broke, don't fix it haha

** I remember them mentioning somewhere that you have to arrange for international portkeys, so maybe every country has anti-Apparition charms around it, and you have to “go through customs” or something before you can arrange for a port key into a certain country?

*** Right, I think I phrased the question poorly. That's more what I was getting at- are there alternatives to Portkeys and what is that process like?

(And yes, I know it's fanfic and only limited by my imagination, but still lol)

**** I don't think there's an established alternative. I read a fic where the various Gringotts branches were connected by their own internal floo network.

Obviously in theory flight (broom/carpet) is also an option.

Generally I've felt that apparition depends on the distance being covered. For example: southern England to northern France is likely easy; but southern England to northern Scotland would be a stretch.

** While completely unsupported by cannon, my opinion is thus:

Apparation is difficult to complete successfully when traveling long distances, especially to somewhere you haven't been before. While it's possible to apparate based on a map, or even a good description and a general knowledge of location, it's still not something you want to do when adding complicating factors such as extra stuff/people or long distances.

Portkeys are better, but require that they either be made at the destination location /or/ by someone who knows the destination extremely well. And due to the risks of destabilizing the magic, it's not a very good idea to apparate or portkey while holding a portkey as you run the risk of wrecking the stored one. Similarly, traveling too far on a portkey risks failure. A sufficiently skilled creator can mitigate those risks significantly, of course.

This makes both portkeys and apparation poor choices for your "every day" long range/international travel. Perfectly acceptable for low volume travel by highly skilled/experienced travelers, or simply those able to spend the money to get a reliable long distance portkey made.

Next on the list is magical vehicles. The main issue here is that they're extremely finicky to make, as the spells that go into them have a nasty habit of reacting unpredictably. Take the weasley's car, for example -- it going feral is not an unusual or even particularly unexpected result. Nobody likes being thrown around in the knight bus, but why hasn't it been replaced? Because it /can't/ be replaced. Wizards had been trying to make something like the knight bus for /decades,/ ever since Britain start seriously building a national road network. All failures. The knight bus was one of the rare successes of a magical vehicle that reliably did what it was supposed to do and has, so far, never run off to do it's own thing. There's a reason why Durmtrang came in a 300 year old sail boat. Magical vehicles must be able to dynamically react to an ever changing environment and it's a fine line between "functional" and "functionally an animal." The Hogwarts Express has a much lower risk of going feral because it doesn't have to react to the environment - it just follows the tracks and it's up to the wizards on board to make sure the tracks are still there, not the train.

Which brings us to the next method: Animals. There are many, many magical beasts who are suitable for long range travel. Whether it's pulling a lightened carriage like Beauxbatons or riding it directly like Harry and friends did on thestrals, magical animals, when sufficiently trained or controlled, are some of the most repeatable and accessable methods of magically traveling long distances.

And then there's the last option, which until relatively recently, took the longest out of all of them: Muggles. Whether it's hiring a carriage, booking passage on a boat, or buying an airplane ticket, the muggles will get you there. Eventually.

There's other methods, of course, like brooms or flying carpets, but between the absolute explosion of muggles across the landscape and mental and physical effort involved, you're probably better off just hiring a muggle to take you there.

** In my story, Harry, with a few companions, travels from Gringotts Britain, to Gringotts Egypt. Since Harry and the others can't trust the Ministry, despite having liberated it from Riddle, and create an International Portkey, they use a direct Floo, connection between Gringotts branches.

** Judging by the sorts of transit we see in canon, most likely the alternative to a portkey would be an enchanted vehicle (H. Express, Durmstrang's ship, Knight Bus as you mentioned) or a carriage pulled by a magical creature (Beauxbatons' carriage, Hogsmeade carriages). Traveling via ship provides some opportunities for fun world-building---maybe the route passes through ‘magical waters,' which drastically cut down on travel distance and host magical sea creatures and merfolk.

** The only canonical on-screen international travel we see is Newt Scamander using Muggle means to do so. We can also assume that the Beauxbatons Carriage and the Durmstrang ship travelled from their respective schools. You can probably use Portkeys for official visits (between ministries of magic) or for international events, but other than that I think that it is up to you. Apparition would likely not work if you don't know the destination (destination being one of the three Ds of apparition).

**** BTW, in NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series there is a boat that can be summoned quite similarly to the Knight Bus by tapping any body of water with your wand. It's supposed to take the travelers anywhere in the world within an hour but it's quite expensive.
