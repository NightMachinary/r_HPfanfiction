**** So, I read it -- not bad, but needs work. First and foremost, you need to improve your proofreading and editing. There are lots of little things that tripped me up right off the bat -- "He guess" instead of "He guessed," misspelling of "Weasleys" as "Weasly's," "chocked" instead of "choked," no closing quotation mark after "love yo-," etc. Small things like that can be caught in the most perfunctory of proofreads, so it's not very encouraging for me as a reader. You've also got numerous comma splices, no commas where there ought to be some, overuse of ellipses, and other miscellaneous punctuation errors. Nothing horrendous, but they all add up and make this difficult to read. If you're only writing for yourself, none of that really matters, but if you want others to enjoy your work, too, you've got to put in more effort so you can offer a polished final piece.

More generally, I thought the story was sweet, and it kept my interest throughout, but it was kind of confusing. You say "1990" at the top, so I understood that Sirius has been sent back in time somehow... but then you show James and Lily, so I wondered if you had mistyped 1980 (especially because of all the other typos I was noticing), which seemed to fit, as Harry is pudgy and cherub-faced and getting a piggyback ride--sounds like you're describing a baby. But then you say he's Hogwarts-aged -- so, it /is/ 1990 -- but then why are James and Lily alive? And Hogwarts doesn't exist? Totally lost me. After several re-reads, I believe you meant to show that Sirius was simultaneously transported 10 years back in time /and/ into an alternate universe where there is no magic... is that it? Because it's not at all clear. I wonder whether "/There was no magic, everyone was a bloody muggle/" is intended to convey that message? Because I took that to mean that Sirius was still stuck in downtown London and couldn't make his way to a magical place, and was forced to stay in the Muggle neighborhoods. That's a huge drawback of the format you've chosen -- everything is implied and nothing is explained, so it's extremely easy for a reader to get lost. There are other times where the format works against you, too:

#+begin_quote
  /Harry started blushing and shouted./

  /"I thought they had you Siri!"/

  /"He made it look like he had you!"/
#+end_quote

If Harry spoke first, who replied?

#+begin_quote
  /"Why!" she yelled, her blue eyes filled with tears./

  /"Why couldn't it be me?" she sounded so broken./

  /Her blue eyes seemed to pierce his soul. "You better take care of him."/
#+end_quote

Who is speaking here? I don't know of any major female characters with blue eyes. Maybe Fleur? Or is this supposed to be some generic female character we haven't met? There isn't enough context for me to even guess.

#+begin_quote
  He had seen Remus after all, should have expected to see himself too.
#+end_quote

Is this implying that the man dancing with Muggle-AU-Harry is Muggle-AU-Sirius? Or Muggle-AU-Lupin?

Those are the main confusing bits, but just in general, this whole thing is hard to follow. I'm still not sure that I entirely understand what is going on in the story. This style of vaguely hinting at things is super difficult to do right, and I don't think you achieved it here.

Content-wise --I don't ship Harry/Sirius, and the characterizations you've chosen for them aren't to my taste, either, so I can't comment on either of those things, but I do like the ideas behind this (Sirius being trapped in an AU, telling his story to a writer, and finally reconnecting with Harry). The final resolution of Harry bribing Death into bringing him into the AU doesn't quite work for me, though. The Hallows (I'm assuming the "special items" are the Hallows) being legit and Death being an actual "living" (heh) thing clash with canon, and it also just doesn't make sense. What is Harry talking about when he says Sirius' story "came through?" Why would Sirius' story give Harry the Hallows? Why would Harry go to a magicless AU where there's another Harry Potter walking around when he could have just asked Death to bring Sirius back into the canon universe? If you want to stick with this ending, I'd recommend rewriting to incorporate Harry's POV as he attempts to reach Sirius (so that these questions can be answered).

I thought the pacing was great and the dialogue was very natural. I especially liked the way you wrote Rowling -- interesting and believable, but reserved, which allowed for Harry and Sirius to take center stage. The final scene with her waving goodbye was a very sweet way to end.

Side note -- I must admit that when you introduced the writer, I thought it was a self-insert and nearly gagged. Once it became clear that it was Rowling, I was very relieved. I'd recommend making her identity clear as soon as possible so that you don't scare off OC-phobes :)

Overall, and in my opinion, the story itself is good but not great, and the writing is not quite there yet. I think that with some more practice you'll improve greatly. Experiment with writing styles and figure out what best suits you in getting your story across. Also, as a fan of some pretty out-there pairings (albeit not Harry/Sirius specifically), I'm always pleased when people write less-popular ships in spite of their less-than-popularity. Some are so under-represented :( So good on you for that!

Hope you found some of this helpful!
