:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic a while back, and I remember it being recommended on this sub a couple times. However, I only remember one thing, and it's a small detail. When Harry first met Ollivander, Ollivander's pet phoenix escaped the bath and rolled around in all the dust. Any help would be appreciated.


** "What's Her Name in Hufflepuff" linkffn(13041698) has a scene like that.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.
