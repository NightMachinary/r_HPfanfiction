** Can you clarify what you mean by secretly? I can think of several where he learns dark magic and hides it from the majority of people, but he's almost always learning from someone older than him and/or teaching others dark magic, not just learning on his own and hiding it entirely. Not sure I can think of any where he's the ONLY person who knows he's studying dark magic

*** I left it purposely vague so I get more recommendations. I don't want dark trio tho, not big fan of that and it would be best if it wasn't year 1 or 2 as well

*** Come on man, you know what I mean by dark magic, there's not really many options here .

I'm looking for a classic dark harry fic where discovers and practices dark magic secretly, hides that he's dark from everyone. Problem is I've read a lot of them...

**** Well, that's exactly the point. I have spent last couple of days thinking about what exactly is the Dark Magic and how it differs from the Light One, and I have been fascinated how those definitions are murky.

And yes, I almost never read dark!Harry stories, but that's different point.
