Any completed fanfic book series/trilogies?  

Eg. linkffn(The Darkness Within) or like They Shook Hands series.


** vekin87's Albus Potter series covers all seven of Albus' years. The first year isn't anything special in my opinion, but the later fics are some of my favorite, period.

*** I've heard of these fics, is Albus any good at magic? Sure, canon makes an interesting conflict, but I'd rather not read a story with a mediocre main character if I can help it.

** linkffn(Midnight Guardian) is one of my favorite series! I've read all the books 3 times now lol. It's a steady break from cannon and has some great character development.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=474910&i=][Ignite]] and its sequels are all really good next-gen stories, collectively called the Stygian Triology.

#+begin_quote
  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.
#+end_quote

It's actually preceded by the Anguis series, which is also a really good series, set in between the books. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=247000][Latet Anguis in Herba]]. You don't have to read it first.

#+begin_quote
  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.
#+end_quote

Side Note: I noticed you stated an interest in a non-mediocre main character. Both Stygian and Anguis have varying casts of characters, several of whom are probably above average in the Wizarding World in terms of magical prowess-but maybe not Dumbledores/Voldemorts.

** linkffn(Firebird's Son;Firebird's Song;Firebird's Fury) - Probably the only fic with well done magical cores. Overlong introduction, very good middle, and end arc that fails to deliver on earlier build-up but still manages to be pretty good.

linkffn(The Ring of Gold;The Amulet of Stone;The Jewel of Darkness) - Haven't read it yet, but I've heard mainly positive opinions (though that really doesn't mean much).

*** In the firebird trilogy were the cores ever fleshed out more? I only got to the 2nd one before I quit. I may have forgotten, but what I remember was that users had magical cores that went towards a certain type of magic and some were more powerful than others. The second part is essentially in every story even if it's not explicitly said.
