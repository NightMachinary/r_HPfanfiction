Like rich snobbery and all that Jazz. It wasn't mudblood that's the problem but the Poor uncultured peasants, Scholarship students. Werewolf are not a problem, it's just they're unclean hobos with no stable job because of monthly illness.


** There's definitely undertones of that anytime a Malfoy and a Weasley are in the same room.

*** Ok, so hear me out. I don't think that the Weasleys are all /that/ poor. The main perspectives we get on their wealth are from (1) Harry, who comes from a relatively wealthy family, with 4 people in it. (2) Hermione, an only child, whose parents are both dentists. (3) Draco, an only child of old money.

They have seven (!) children, basically all of whom are actively involved in athletics at a good private school. Ok sure they're not buying top quality shit, but anyone who's been into sports know that none of that mess comes free.

There is never a shortage of food. Don't tell me that people can magic up their food. That's not consistent with the stories of very poor wizard families. They could afford to get to the World Cup Match. Hear me out again: this isn't about the tickets, which got comped. It's that Arthur paid for all his kids, plus Harry, plus Hermione, and didn't blink. This means accommodations, food, and any and all supplies for all of â€˜em without a second thought.

I'm not saying they're wealthy! Not by any stretch. Molly is for sure a hard working lady who makes things from scratch, thereby removing the need to buy a lot of what they have. I'd say they're like those catholic families where there's like 5 kids, and the parents send them all to catholic school for all elementary and middle school, go on a road trip twice a year (once in summer, once in spring), and all though there's hand me downs, nothing is dirty or bad quality.

**** I believe the Weasleys /are/ poor. We see it several time in the books (like when they all wear second hand clothes, or when Ron use his brother old wand even if it's not really consistant with the wand lore Rowling said and his brother got a freaking new owl at the same time).\\
It's just that, they are magical. Magical don't really have the same needs as us:\\
The family own the burrow so no rent.\\
They don't use electricity and get water by magic so no bills.\\
The story never been really clear on this but unless the Potter familly paid 7 years worth of tuitions when he was born (without knowing if he was not a squib, if he was going to continue after his OWL or even if he would not want to go to another school), then Hogwarts doesn't have any (or paid by Ministry, which would explain why they can appoint a teacher when the school fail some standarts).\\
Even the food doesn't cost much considering that they have a garden and that, even if you can't create food, you can multiply it. One potato is enough to feed them for weeks.\\
The only unavoidable expenses they have is for the education of their children, and for stuff like brooms. The problem is that we don't really have a clear idea of the prices of these products. We just know that a familly considered "poor" is able to buy several middle end products, and that only something extremely wealthy (even rich) can buy 7 high end of these product to furnish a team. For all we know, every magical familly is able to easily purchass at least one broom by member since it's one of their basic method of travel.

PS: already said by someone else. But Bagman "gifted" Arthur the tickets after he helped him, and the tent was lent by a friend. The only expenses he had during the World Cup was for the camping spot and for the foods so not so much (and whatever his children bought once there but they paid with their pocket money).

******* I had forgotten that. Does he indicate it was paid for by Harry's parents, or is it possible to interpret that as taxes pay for all of that?

******** It's left ambiguous in the books, sadly. Hagrid says Harry's name is on the rolls and they the gold is in the bank. Harry said Vernon wasn't going to pay and Hagrid said "didja think you parents didn't leave you anything?" and talks about going to the bank. I guess the case could be made either way lol.

********* I interpreted that as Hagrid meaning that Harry will be able to afford Potions ingredients, books, and assorted other equipment (telescopes, gloves, robes, etc.), which are explicitly /not/ covered by Hogwarts. Hogwarts doesn't charge tuition. I think Vernon assumes that it does, and doesn't really consider or care about why Harry's able to attend.

**** Didn't Bagman give them the tickets for the World Cup?

He borrowed the tents, or they were gifted to him from someone at the office. Many supplies can be conjured.

That's not me saying they're /poor/ (their food expenses have to be pretty decent, though fortunately the times that there's seven children actually in the house is basically Hogwarts holidays only) but they almost certainly have to watch their money pretty closely.

***** That's what I was getting at. We saw the Gaunts. They also had magic. They had blood purity. They were also likely inbred into complete mental oblivion, to be fair. But you do hear hints of people being poor.

I feel like because the weasleys are a huge family, buying brand new clothes won't be on, but they certainly have enough.

**** i'm pretty sure on the muggle scale of standard of living, the weasleys are middle class but probably on the lower side. wizards definitely have a much better standard of living because of magic. they probably don't have to worry about paying for utilities and it seems implied that molly and arthur magically made the house have more rooms. so on the wizard scale of income/standard of living, they only people poorer than them were the gaunts (at least the weasley house was clean), lupin and probably other werewolves

**** Oh I definitely agree with you, I was just saying that the Malfoys seemed to take an inordinate amount of joy in rubbing the relative lack of wealth on the part of the Weasleys in their faces.
