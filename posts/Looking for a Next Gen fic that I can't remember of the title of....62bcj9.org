I can't remember the name for the LIFE of me.... I know it's on ff.net but I can't remember the title or more than Albus, Rose, and Scorpius are all in Gryffindor. The story is focused on a LOT of all the next gen characters, older and younger, very centric around the family dynamic of all the next gen kids. I'm so sorry this is so vague but I know it's a fairly popular one but I just can't seem to find it. Thank you!!

  When the past and present collide with the Potter/Weasley children... A bit AU with characters' names and some pairings. Family tree now posted on my profile page. 3/16/10 -- going back and cleaning up a few things; nothing major will change.
