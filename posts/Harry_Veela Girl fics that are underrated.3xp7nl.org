*** if you want ridiculously sweet lighthearted fluff/friendship with no smut you could check out linkffn(The-Little-Veela-that-Could) Ive only seen it mentioned once on this sub i think, I'm not sure how the second half is. Dropped it when the author clarified in a note that their would be no sex till the epilogue if even then.
