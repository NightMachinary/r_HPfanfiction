A few days ago, I asked about your turn offs for fics. Well, now I ask; what concepts, ideas, plotlines, or pairings always make you click the story? What makes you automatically give a story a solid shot?

For me, I auto click any Honks pairing because Tonks is my favorite character. I also tend to give any odd pairings a good shot. I always give time travel a shot because I like chaos theory.

How about you?


** In no particular order:

A summary that I cannot automatically predict the plot line, major themes and tropes from. If I read a summary and need to read the genre and characters, I will be at least intrigued.

A fic with Harry, Ron and Hermione featuring as friends and not just in the background.

An exploration of the magical world, including its history, culture and lore. Note, I do not mean â€˜pureblood culture.'

Indication of a massive AU, because I am something of a sucker for them.

Exploration of magic, or more of a focus on unique uses and creativity with it.

On pairings, I generally don't care. But at least from where I stand, if romance is implied as subtle or in the background, I am more likely to consider reading the fic.

** Interesting take on the classic "what do you like in a fic?" question. Because of course, you can tell very little about a fic from a summary.

Most of the time when I'm browsing FF.Net/AO3/Scryer, I will be looking for guilty pleasures, because it's almost impossible to tell a truly good story from the summary alone. So the following more or less represents my decision process:

Step One: Exclusion

- Is it slash? If so, exclude.

- Does it sound angsty? If so, exclude.

- Is the point of view character someone other than Harry, Voldemort, or Dumbledore? If so, exclude.

- Exclude if it hints at the following tropes: sympathetic Snape, redeemed Malfoy, super Hermione, friendly goblins, evil/stupid Dumbledore, Muggle weaponry being used (either by Muggles against wizards or wizards against wizards).

- Exclude if Harry/Luna, Harry/Millicent, Harry/Eloise, etc.

Step Two: Favourable factors

Once all unsuitable fics have been excluded, I may click on all fics that survive the purge. But if I have less time, I will prioritise fics with the following elements:

- Magically talented Harry.

- Exploration of magic (though often this will result in me leaving the fic when I am disappointed with the magical theory being proposed).

- Exploration of magical history.

- Canonish tone.

- Expansion of wizarding culture, especially where this involves: non-Christian wizarding traditions, magical ceremonies/rituals, interesting politics which may or may not include a magical system of nobility. Often these will be terrible, but sometimes, when done right, they are brilliant (e.g. Out of the Night by Raining Ink). By first excluding "friendly goblins" you filter out a lot of the shitty "Lord Potter-Black" stuff.

Pairings can influence my story selection, but only if the story is rated M (because romance only matters if there's smut XD). If so, I am more likely to read a fic as follows:

- Tier 1 pairings: Susan Bones, Pansy Parkinson, Fleur Delacour.

- Tier 2 pairings: Ginny Weasley, Daphne Greengrass

- Tier 3 pairings: Hermione Granger

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** Harry/Daphne, be it crossover, timetravel, dimension travel. As long as Harry or Daphne aren't Death Eaters, I read it. In fact, its been a while since I found any new Harry/Daphne, seeing as I've probably read at least 90% of all the H/D fanfics in ffn. Though, I do drop when the relationship part is shit or poorly written. And I abhor grammar mistakes like "there/their" or "bemused/amused" "defiantly/definitely" which for some reason there's a lot of it. Even on beta'ed fanfics.

**** IKR, its almost as annoying for me as is bemused used as if its interchangeable with amused. Its like people either don't check to make sure if the words they are using are even correct and just go with the flow. I mean, its not that hard to just google the word. I understand when the person isn't native in english (though, I'm not a native, and that isn't an excuse for me, personaly) and doesn't have the proper grasp on the language, but that doesn't mean you can't ask for someone to be a beta, there's a shitload of people who'd beta for a story they like, if only the author ask.

***** The worst offender I've recently seen is inconsistency for invented words or OC names. I've been reading a fic where a fairly important character is spelled with an 'a' in his name all the time, but then for like half a chapter he's spelled with an 'e' and then after that with an 'a' again. How does that even happen?

Also, "your" vs "you're". How hard can it be? Like, seriously, how can someone be able to write coherent fanfiction with good plots and everything but write "what's you're name" seemingly /every single time/?

** - Pairings which I think have a high potential, like postwar Harry/Lavender or Harry/Andromeda (still waiting for a decent one for either of those)

- A lack of slash. I just don't find any male characters besides Harry, Ted Tonks and Gellert Grindelwald interesting, so I have no desire to see any of them as LI. Maybe one of the background Muggleborns (like Justin FF), but I'd rather avoid slash altogether than try to find the diamond in the pile of rotten manure.

- A lack of anyone named Malfoy, Snape, Riddle, Weasley (with the exception of Ginny) or Lupin in a prominent role. Seriously, I'd rather read Hermione/Demelza Robins (who is the secret daughter of Bellatrix Lestrange) or Luna/Katie Bell than another one of those atrocious "Happy Weasley family" things or Death Eater whitewashing (oh, their horrendous war crimes don't matter because they are good and sorry now)

- A lack of common tropes. No OP!Harry, no marriage contracts, no positive portrayal of pureblood culture (although I don't mind some purges of it), no Lord Potter, no Data-ripoff Hermione and no aforementioned "Happy Weasley family"

- One way crossovers. I want one universe and one main plot, not lacklustre attempts at juggling both and succeeding with none.
