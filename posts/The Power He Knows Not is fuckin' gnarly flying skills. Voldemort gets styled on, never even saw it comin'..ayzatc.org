*** ...The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][Last Mage of Krypton]] series has Harry flying unassisted, but given that he was born Kal-El, it's only to be expected. Voldie also flies, but it's revealed that he uses a belt/bracers/shin-guards combo to do so.

As for the magical fight thing, he defeated Lockhart with two magical techniques, neither of which needed him to use his wand.

His hardest fights were against a group of Obscurials and a year later, against Riddle and Grindelwald (plus two minions) who had used his blood to magically boost themselves to Kryptonian levels.

*** Did Tom Riddle turn an expulsion into a rule bending early Quidditch recruitment his very first time on a broom? Was it Tom Riddle who inspired Hogwarts faculty to buy him literally the world's greatest broom? Was Tom Riddle the youngest seeker in a century? Did Tom Riddle catch a Snitch while playing against a team of cheaters, all riding superior brooms, while being hunted by a rogue bludger? Was Tom Riddle able to bamboozle a dragon and steal an egg from the nest right under the beast, with nothing but sheer flying prowess?

** Frankly I'm surprised we didn't see more flying during the Battle of Hogwarts. Sure, there was the Room of Requirement scene, but otherwise broomsticks weren't used much in combat.

Even discounting the Slytherin team, Hogwarts was capable of fielding 21 experienced Quidditch players who are well versed on small team tactics and high speed dodging- even if most of the younger players were evacuated, the alumni would fill in the gaps, possibly raising this number higher. Of all the Death Eaters seen, only Voldemort and Snape were capable of unassisted flight, and most of the Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, and Ravenclaw Quidditch teams were in the DA, and thus had training in casting the patronus to counter dementors.

This gives Hogwarts the vast advantage of air superiority, especially if you use them to carry out potion and mandrake airstrikes on Death Eater forces. So long as the castle itself is unbreached, strike teams of Quidditch players could easily harass the death eaters on the ground, and attempt to drive back the giants and acromantula while staying out of range of their counterattacks. The ability to quickly move around the battlefield, relay information from a bird's eye view, and surprise enemies with aerial attacks would be a huge boon to the Hogwarts defenses.

*** I feel like JK Rowling didnt realize she could have basically had magical fighter jets and bombers when she wrote the battles.

Some fics I cant remember the name of have the Quidditch teams fighting like that, and they're all amazing. There's an... okay time travel fic that has this that comes to mind, but I cant remember the name.

*** My god, this is perfect. I didn't even consider that part of canon.

That was actually pretty stupid of them. Here's the person who's easily the most skilled flier in the room, who could fly circles around any Death Eater. Hmm, I know! Let's take him off the highest performing broom on the planet and put him in the side-car of a motorcycle that was charmed by a high-school student and being driven by a man who is /way/ too big for it and flies every few years or so. /Genius/.

Out-flying Voldemort and landing a stunner sounds pretty silly, but honestly I think it's actually quite reasonable. I would absolutely expect Harry on his firebolt to have no problem bamboozling a flying Voldemort. I mean really, when's the last time the man has flown at any kind of serious level? Never?

It could be funny to take it up a notch. I think it was said that there were thirty Death Eaters there. As soon as they're all in the air, Harry starts obliterating them. The Death Eaters can hardly understand what the fuck is going on, they just see flashes of movement and they try to hit him, but he's too fast and too agile and he's cutting through the middle of them so they're only firing at each other. Like a bunch of divers deciding to chase after a shark in deep and dark water, or a dogfight between ww1 biplanes and a modern fighter jet.
