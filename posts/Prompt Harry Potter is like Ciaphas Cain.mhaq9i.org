He has extreme luck, yet he always thinks he's a fraud.


** Could work it would be a parody of a parody, but possibly...

The issue I see here is that Ciaphas Cain is objectively (at least for the first few books until the author burned out and they became boring) a very competent, though extremely cynical, person.

Harry's accomplishments came when he was a teenager. It would be difficult to mesh that together. You would either have to have 11-year old Harry acting as a seasoned veteran or do an original storyline with an adult Harry (which could actually be quite fun to read). But it would be an original story in the HP universe, not a Harry Potter story per se. Much more difficult to write.

Could be fun, I suppose.

It was attempted at one time... can't remember the fics title. I'll get back to you.
