** linkffn(Departure from the Diary) is the closest I know of. Not there yet (not really close either), and to my knowledge, the relationship isn't going to be very healthy -- better than what the obvious assumptions may be, but still unhealthy.

*** Well, the relationship won't be /unhealthy/, but there will be some heavy codependency between them.

One of the things I've been trying to keep in mind when writing Tam is that she's a sociopath, and Harry is only individual she's ever met whom she thinks of as being a real person. Harry recognises that she's a terrible person, but he finds himself caring less and less as he finally finds himself able to really sympathise with someone, regardless of the circumstances.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

** *cracks knuckles* linkffn(9666689) is the only one I've ever read and truly enjoyed. It's three chapters long, ends on a cliffhanger, and hasn't updated in years, but the author is still active and has said that they might go back to it, so I don't think it's full on /abandoned./

  Voldemort isn't a man. Ginny Weasley died in the Chamber. Twin divergences, though insignificant compared to the infinite majesty of the universe, spell a destiny irrevocably altered. Watch as Harry's life, the lives of those around him, and eventually the fate of Magical Britain herself are affected by his slowly-growing relationship with a female Tom Riddle.

** One of the best overall fanfiction you are going to find. In this fic we have a female voldemort who isn't some deranged women seeking revenge on wizarding world. We see the story behind the circumstances of her becoming Voldemort. I love this fic. Linkffn(Limpieza De Sangre)

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
