The only thing I remember is that in the story, Harry had three differently colored snakes, maybe yellow, blue, and red. They each had a different power --- one could deliver a stinging sensation, one could change the colors of any object, and I think one could teleport. Harry uses these snakes during the Battle of Hogwarts.
