**** No probs. A super useful lifehack is that if a fic has been deleted, but the url still exists, you can just plug the url into this site and it'll give you an epub or mobi file of the original fic: [[http://ff2ebook.com/]]

Someone on this sub showed me how to do this. I couldn't believe it, haha.
