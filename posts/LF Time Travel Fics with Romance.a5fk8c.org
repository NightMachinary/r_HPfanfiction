** Delenda Est. One of the highest complimented stories of time-travel on this subreddit, it's been a while since I've read it though.

*** I enjoy Strange Attractors immensely, especially all the magic, the science, and the breakdown of Tom's character. One of the issues I have is pacing. We are 48 chapters -- full, meaty chapters -- in and I think 2 or 3 weeks have passed since Hermione has arrived in 1942. There are some fantastic OCs, the impact of Grindlewald is played out in an interesting way, but I cannot help but get distracted by the fact SO much has happened, and not just in terms of wold building, to Hermione in such a short amount of time. That said, I cannot wait to keep reading.

**** Yeah I enjoyed it for the same reasons but posted a review about it asking about the pacing. The author mentioned that there would be some sort of time skip coming up soon which would make things somewhat better. Since there are different parts/arcs iirc in the fic. Otherwise it might be hard to sustain that level of writing for a while school year!

Do you mean by this that there is too little plot relevant development or that there's too much in the short span of 2--3 weeks?

***** Just as an example, in the beginning of the fic Hermione is in the hospital wing recovering. It takes her 7 chapters to get out of the hospital wing, during which the only action is flashbacks and conversations with the people who visit her.

******* To be honest, this is the only romance fic I've seen that moves so slowly, so I'd be hesitant to hold it up as a poster child for any others.

I enjoy witty banter between characters when it is well written, especially when the dialogue advances the plot. In this case those seven chapters contain important character building between the two main protagonists, laying the groundwork for how they interact with each other after Hermione is released.

***** Too much. Some chapters will be just about a meal and what was discussed. I just wished these interactions were spread out over more time so that we could feel like there was more forward momentum. Not every day or every week in someone's life is that action packed. All the characters should be exhausted 100% of the time considering what takes place on a daily basis. I also think that it would help make the intensity of the relationship between Tom and Hermione feel a bit more realistic.

***** A lot happens in 2-3 weeks. It would've been better stretched into months but as long as there is a time skip I think it should be good. The actual plot itself is amazing, as are the characters and the dialogue. Hermione is pretty overwhelmed as a time traveler so it think it works for now. The romance aspect isn't too slow or underdeveloped and each chapter is important

  Unspeakable Granger wakes up with missing memories in Hogwarts...in 1942. Way back? What way back? If there's anyone who's too used to making the best of things, it's her. The least she could do is to drag the wizarding world kicking and screaming to the 21st century (that prejudice has to go---and oh, the things she knows...). But there's someone here that makes her brain itch...

** Obligatory mention of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past). Technically they aren't dating as at the start of fourth year, because the mental age gap would make that unethical, but it's obvious that Harry will take Ginny to the Yule Ball when that comes around. For those who don't like Ginny, I'll just say that she's had far more screen time than in canon and their friendship is much more developed.
