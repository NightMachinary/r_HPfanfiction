For some other reasons I am rereading chapter 37 of OotP, and there I noticed again what I forgot in meantime, that Kreacher collaborated on killing of Sirius Black with Narcissa Malfoy. We all are aware of tendency of JKR and many fanfic authors to whitewash personas of Draco and Snape, but somehow we forgot the absurdity of Harry Potter protecting Narcissa Malfoy for suppressing the information he was alive, when she was instrumental in organizing killing of his beloved godfather. Somehow I forgot.


** Eh, she was instrumental in luring Harry to the Ministry. Sirius, I love him, but his death is on him and Bella.

But also, HP was written by a passive, idealistic woman who repeatedly chose plot over character development, which is why the reactions to the war by the half-blood, the muggleborn, and the poor people are unrealistic at best. Lmfao, Umbridge sent Dementors after the BWL, tortured him with a blood quill, and used the Cruciatus Curse on him and she was still at the Ministry in HBP for the sake 3-5 chapters in DH.

*** Narcissa still lured Harry into a trap with killers and the dark lord. She's definitely guilty of something.

Harry was pretty much blameless. It was a mix of Narcissa for luring Harry, Bellatrix for killing Sirius & Dumbledore for hiding information.

Oh and Kreacher. That little shit.

**** Don't forget Snape. Harry and co were flying on thestrals from Scotland to London which should take some hours. Snape knew this and didn't inform the Order in time else there would've been someone to head them off in the Ministry Atrium.

Not to mention, the Order in general is also to blame for not telling Harry that he could use his Patronus to send messages and keep in touch when they knew he could use that Charm and that he's a target for assassination/kidnapping. It would've easily bypassed Kreacher's treachery. Harry gets into all that trouble repeatedly because when shit hits the metaphorical fan, the adults simply aren't there or they tell him to go to hell.

*** In a realistic story, there'd be rioting in the streets at the very minimum. People were rounded up in ghettoes, run out of their homes and jobs, killed on random, and all of this was sanctioned by the system, not one gang of overprivileged twats bent on terrorism. This sort of rot, once it sets into the system itself, is very hard to get rid of.

The 7 years is from Battle of Hogwarts to Scorpio's conception- only way for him to be at Hogwarts 19 years later

Edit: this is all conjecture, because there are 19 unmentioned years, but it does seem logical that Draco was imprisoned for his role in the war

*********** Ok, fair enough, but Draco still supported and espoused Death Eater ideologies and likely committed other, unmentioned crimes in DH, and he was still a mostly willing participant. He wasn't being Imperiused, it was free will. He can't make the excuse that he was under the threat of torture, because that is every Death Eater. Draco didn't testify, so there is no way he is getting off because he joined the DE's 2 years early. He was already practically a juniot DE, and would have likely joinef after Hogwarts.

Also, there is a significant portion of the fanbase that doesn't consider Cursed Child canon, and I was ignoring it for Lucius getting off, which doesn't matter, because it isn't in CC anyways. It was irrelevant to my other points- those are based off the epilogue- and I am not substituting headcanon for it. I was merely ignoring it because it doesn't pertain to the discussion

Note that I'm not trying to mitigate Draco's deeds. I'm just trying to say that people who weren't Death Eaters committed far worse crimes while Draco was just trying to stay alive. Teenagers who get in over their heads are a daily occurrence. Post-war trio and order members would have been more focused on not perpetuating the damage caused by the wars, and after Snape's death, Draco would've been the perfect example of a reformed Death Eater Slytherin to show to the people and say, 'Look, all these assholes have learned their lesson.

There were the "snatchers" terrorising Muggleborns and other undesirables. Most of these were probably "upstanding" ministry workers and not DEs at all.
