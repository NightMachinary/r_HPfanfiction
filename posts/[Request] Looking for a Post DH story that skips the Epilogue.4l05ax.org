Hello friends! I am searching for a post DH fic where the Harry Potter crew Harry, Ron, Hermione etc.. get to behave like more typical 18 to 20 year olds. Like going to pubs/bars, getting jobs, dating around. I would love to see career development and growing up as a person. I am down for most ships so send them at me! :)


** This is not /exactly/ what you're requesting, but I feel you might enjoy any of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3955920/HalfASlug][HalfaSlug's]] one shots. Most of them are just one-chapter-stories about Ron, Harry and Hermione being buds after the books. They're not fully fledged stories, but they're cool to read.

** This one is about Harry having a job and a family. A really well done fic. Ginny is dead in it though, but only because of an accident. There's no bashing. Linkffn(11111990)

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
