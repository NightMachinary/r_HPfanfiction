** Depends on what you mean. If you mean literal animal noises, then you're right that human beings generally don't (though we are biologically capable of doing both!).

I always pictured those kind of phrases being more metaphorical though, to add comparative effect to a bit of dialogue. Like growling in 'human vocal terms' would be like that delicious Heavy Metal People Rumbly Gruffness ("Back. Off."), and snarling would be more of a defiant aggression ("The MacGuffin belongs to me!"). It doesn't mean they literally make animal noises, just that they're particularly animalistic and aggressive when they're saying that.

*** Now, that I can understand. However, I think it would be more appropriate to use other verbs to exemplify this situations. Not wrong per se - only if these terms (growl, snarl) are used frequently.

**** I mean, sure, but surely that depends on the situation, no?

For example, in the Shrieking Shack bit in PoA. If Pettigrew had managed to somehow grab a wand (and it somehow worked) and he managed to knock Harry down and be threatening to him, then Sirius had gotten angry and pushed Pettigrew back so he could stand protectively over Harry, him telling Pettigrew to back off could be appropriate - he's slightly unhinged and dropping back into the dog-instincts, so...

Or if you're writing a Redwall/Jungle Book fic and your characters are literally animals, I suppose, but that's definitely twisting the metaphor too far into literalism. :D

The main question really is - what alternatives would you prefer? If someone is trying to make their character seem animalistic and threatening, what words would make you 'buy in' to that image?

*** Curiously, almost every example of the word "growl" use dogs to exemplify the term... The term snarl even specifies that it's "specially" for dogs. (Cambridge Dictionary)

** I disagree. From a literal perspective you're right but they can paint a picture of someone's attitude/opinion simply and efficiently. As writing sins go it doesn't rank even an honorable mention on my list.

** *Finally.*

Nobody ever agrees when I say it. But *I agree with you!!* Mostly, anyway. I mean people definitely /do/ growl and snarl---I work with children, and let me tell you: this is a very real thing.

I think that's why I don't like when the terms are used figuratively or abstractly. Instead of communicating a general emotion to me, I just think of grown-ass adults legit /growling,/ and I nope right out of there.

*** Of course, I wasn't taking into account children. I was referring to teenagers or grown adults. Snape, for instance, is a character that I've seen "growling" a lot.

**** Totally! That's why I agree with you! If authors wrote children growling / snarling, I'd be completely okay with it. But adults? Nope.
