I'm looking for something where Hermione growing up as a muggle born somehow helps her become popular or something like that. I remember at Slughorn's Slug Club, Hermione mentioned what her parents did, yet no one but Harry understood. Maybe something where pure bloods (Or Slytherins) took more of an interest in Hermione because of that or a similar situation. Thanks for the help!

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** It's not a major part of the plot, but here she becomes a fashion icon when a muggle fad sweeps Hogwarts.
