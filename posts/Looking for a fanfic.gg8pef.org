** I literally remember nothing else... I think at the end their kids are shocked that their parents were part of a such a storied organization or something. It went through the different years like the first years had different leaders, so did the second years etc. It mightve been fem harry.. please drop the name!

#+begin_quote
  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.
