** Pretty accurate for 90's teachers, IMO, even in the muggle world. Not to say all or even most teachers acted like that, but if they did other teachers/the administration would not have given a shit that the teacher said something embarrassing or sarcastic to you or asked you a hard question you couldn't answer.

** It's pretty common in overpowered Harry fics that start early. I recall /The Sorting Hat's Stand/ is one of those, though I can't recommend it.

***** Most of the stuff is total rubbish, though, so I'm sure your answer would be better received if you actually recommended anything that you might have that isn't this bad.

This is what the recommendation threads are for, after all: so that someone would not have to swim in the dumpster for things to read.
