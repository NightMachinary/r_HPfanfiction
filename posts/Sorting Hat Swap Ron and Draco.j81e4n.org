This started off as a request for any stories of Draco sorted into Gryffindor, following the template of sorted into Slytherin in which the character has to navigate their way in a hostile house. The Gryffindors certainly have reason to hate him and treat him as a pariah even before he opens his big mouth: his dad is a famous death eater who got away with it and his aunt personally killed or tortured a number of their parents.

But then I thought it could go one step further and be a prompt too. When the sorting hat gets to the last two, Ron and Blaise, it realizes there aren't equal numbers due to Draco going to Gryffindor. So it simply throws both of them into Slytherin to even it out. Ron would of course face the same issues as Draco; he's from a famous blood traitor family and much like Draco he probably won't be able to keep his mouth shut about the negative opinions he has of his new house mates.

This could create an interesting duality and test of nature vs. nurture: A character of "good" blood sorted into the "bad" house and a "bad" blood character sorted into the "good" house. How would this change them, who they're friends with and whose side would they be on when Voldemort returns?


** I imagine, harry would not forget malfoys attitude on the train.

Ron and Harry's friendship will become stronger, as harry would be the only friendly face he sees for most of his time at hogwarts due to the weasleys being blood traitors

I imagine being in slytherin would push ron to practise spells so he can defend himself better
