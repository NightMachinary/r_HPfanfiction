** Well... it's not complete, but Prince of the Dark Kingdom has eclipsed the Harry Potter series itself in length. There's some romance going on, but it far from dominates the story. It's a rather interesting AU, where a sane... erhm, saner Voldemort takes over Britain, and enforces some changes, to say the least.

The Darkness Within and its sequels (longer than the books as well, as far as I recall) has a Harry raised by Voldemort, only to be captured by the Order. James and Lily are still alive, and has another child, so they try to reintroduce him to the family, and Harry is... less than cooperative. It's been a while since I've read it, and when I think back on it, I remember some things that I'd cringe at now, but I enjoyed it while I read it.
