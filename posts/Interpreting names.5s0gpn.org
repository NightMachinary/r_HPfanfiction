We all know JK likes to slip all kinds of puns and hidden, random meanings and word plays inside her names - for example, Albus Dumbledore is a white bumblebee. Dumbledore is an old word for a bumblebee, and JK named him that because he liked music, and she imagined him wandering about humming to himself.

Interestingly enough, his younger sister's name has multiple meanings, including old English/Welsh for silver - silver bumblebee, Greek for most holy, which is unlikely, and Hebrew - beautiful melody, or similar enough to create song of the bumblebee, especially if you consider it as a variant on Aria. Ari is also lion in Hebrew.

And, of course, all three are A Bumblebee. Kendra could mean knowledge, magical, power, or chief hero, but also high hill - combine that with Percival; pierces the valley. That's kinda neat, but probably not intentional.

Albus is now a white, probably noble bumblebee that comes from a hill, pierces the valley, and rules over wolves. Brian doesn't have a clear meaning, but probably comes from hill, which implies high or noble. Interesting considering the similarities to Kendra's meanings and origins.

Arabella Figg - might come from a fig growing ancestor, or might have Viking origins from vig, for war. Arabella - widely disputed, but could be a variant on Annabel, long associated with Latin orabilis meaning "invokable". Thus, invokable war. Given she was an undercover watchdog, I find this appropriate. Probably not intentional, but I like to think it was.

So! What other names are there?


** I only realised a few days ago that Madame Maxime's name is all about how big she is. Maxime being like maximum, and Olympe being like Olympus the mountain.

*** /cough/ it's Latin, actually. Matter of fact, his name is in the school motto: Draco Dormiens Nunquam Tittilandus.

*** Yeah, but I couldn't really come up with anything interesting about a river bumblebee.

That list has a mistake with Ginny's name, it's Ginevra, not Ginerva, and it is in fact a variant on Guinevere, along with Juniper, Jennifer, Genevieve, etc etc. It could also be a variant on Geneva. Regardless, most of these seem to come back to the Juniper berry, or tree itself.

To quote Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  In Latin, juniperus is combination of the word junio, which means young, and parere, to produce, hence youth producing, or evergreen.
#+end_quote

However, Genevieve can also come from Germanic roots, meaning 'wife' and 'kin' - possibly meaning wife who is also a relation? Regardless, as an interesting tidbit, St Genevieve's father was called Severus. Her feast day is sadly six days before Snapes birthday, or I'd have jumped up and down and declared this not a coincidence, but a massive conspiracy.

Taken from Welsh, can also mean white/fair spirit/fairy. I have no idea why white/light/silver features in so many JK names.

Anyway, Junipers are typically protective, sacred, and virtuous. Saint Juniper, "the jester of the Lord" is sometimes called the Saint of comedy, and was also extremely patient. Sounds appropriate for a sister of the twins.

**** I read somewhere that all the Weasley kids got British royal names and/or names from Arthurian legend. William, Charles, Percival, Arthur, George, Ginevra/Guinevere, etc.

And then of course we get Sirius Black and Remus Lupin whose names are basically black dog and wolfy wolf, respectively.

As I understand it, Molly means bitter, unless it comes from Margaret instead of Mary, in which case it means pearl. Pruett means brave or valiant.
