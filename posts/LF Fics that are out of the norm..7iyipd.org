** linkffn(Blurring reality) This one is very different from anything I have ever read before, but really good. Not slash, although the main characters are Harry and Tom Riddle. I know the summary sounds very silly, but it's not at all what you would expect it to be.

It's about a dance school putting on a performance called "the prophecy" thats basically the plot of canon events. It's a story about Harry who gets pulled into playing the main character for this play. Its all about double meanings and parallels between the plot, the characters performing the play, their canon counterparts, the events going on in the dance school and canon universe. As time goes on, the characters start losing their grip with reality and lots of supernatural type events start happening as the line between what is real and not becomes blurred. Becomes somewhat of a psycological thriller. Not complete and updates super slowly but very good and well written.

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.

** linkao3(Of Myth and Magic by Wonkington) is a very interesting AU that appears to be non-magical at the start. The pairing is HG/SS, and it's got some really excellent psychological thriller elements.

linkao3(A History of Magic by PrinceEdwin) is fairly short, and fantastically written. It's the only HP/SS fic that I've liked enough to read multiple times. It has some time travel.

linkao3(Session Transcripts by lastcrazyhorn) is fabulously and creatively written via counseling session transcripts. It's got a fresh take on a lot of characters.

linkffn(Forbidden by Savageland) is another HG/SS and is one of the most fantastic AUs I've ever read. The AU is hard to describe without spoilers, and the story takes place after the war with Snape presumed dead.

linkffn(The Young Adventurer's Club by artemisgirl) is another very unique story. It uses canon characters but puts them in situations far outside the lines of canon. Contains some time travel.

Hope some of these are new and enjoyable for you!

** linkffn(3853776; 10532942)

I happened to stumble across Night of the Anas and while it's short I really enjoyed reading from the perspective of (rather incompetent) Death Eaters that are not well known.

I'm not sure if you'd consider The Darklist to be out of the norm of HP fanfics, but it certainly is out of the norm of most slash fics I come across. I'd only seen a handful episodes of The Blacklist, so I'm not sure just how close the story follows some of the show elements, but I really enjoyed how Draco's personaity (based on the show's character Red) comes across here.
