#+TITLE: Voldemort blundered when he attempted to kill Draco over one too many failures, especially after Narcissa had sacrificed herself for him. Now he's out a body AGAIN, there's another Boy Who Lived, and he's unbelievably pissed off.

** The Dark Lord sent his minions to flight as bursts of sickly green light poured from his wand. The slower of his cretinous minions falling lifeless to the marbled floor as the rest of them stampeded the exits like panicked dogs.

In moments the room was silent save for the Dark Lord's ragged breathing and the distant cracks of apparition.

He ran a fine fingered hand over the smooth skin of his crown, for the first time morning the loss of his nose for he would surely be pinching it right now.

He turned, his robes swirling around his perfect form like smoke and strode out of the room. Let others deal with the dead. Disgusting things.

He prowled through the halls of Malfoy manor, generations of hidebound pure bloods fleeing their portraits lest they invite his displeasure. He allowed himself a smile and with the flick of his wand the double doors at the end of the hallway crashed open.

So this was /her/ room. The fatuous sow. He caught movement in the shadows and brought his wand the bear, but it was just her vanity mirror.

He was about to dismiss the enchanted object when it unexpectedly spoke in his voice, "[[http://youtube.com/watch?v=lD_ag67tH3I][This is getting out of hand..."]]
