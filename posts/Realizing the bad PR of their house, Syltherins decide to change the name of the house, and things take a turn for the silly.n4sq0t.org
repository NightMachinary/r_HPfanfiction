Syltherin realizes tying their house to Harry's muggleborn mother would be infinite good, so they push forward Lillypotter as their new house name. The Hufflepuffs hear and decide that if house names are gonna change, they wanna be Cuddle. Gyrffindor boys drink some beer and decide BadassExplosionSex420x69 is the best possible house name and Ravenclaw muggleborns want their house name to be in binary but it wouldn't fit on robes so they go with Fuck off I'm reading, feeling it best represents what they belive in.


** On Halloween night, all of Slytherin show up dressed up as Star Wars stormtroopers, and Draco - Chibi!Darth Vader - monologues to the full Great Hall about their Evil Plans.
