I'm talking like an op!dark!inheritance!lords!genius!god!MoD! Harry fic


** Good grammar makes things readable. It doesn't always make things enjoyable.

*** This. Even if the plot makes a reader want to gouge out their eyes, good grammar and spelling will at least make it easy to get the story across.

** A list of things I don't like in these stories:

1) EVERYONE IS HIDING SOMETHING FROM ME!!! EVERYONE JUST WANTS TO STEAL FROM ME!

2) REVENGE

3) GOBLINS ARE OUR BESTEST FRIENDS EVER

4) SHOPPING TRIP

5) TRAINING

6) I'M SO SEXY AFTER TRAINING, I ATTRACT A HAREM

7) BASH, BASH, BASH

8) DEFEAT VOLDEMORT, DUMBLEDORE AND THE MINISTRY THROUGH HAREM POWERED "LOVE" MAGIC

9) BECOME EMPEROR OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER

10) NO EXPLANATION OF HOW THINGS BECOME BETTER, THEY JUST DO AFTER A TIMESKIP

If you could put all of these together, you'd get your crimgy fic but if you somehow still make Harry obliviously cute and adorable, it would be readable.

** Here is a list of things that I find make a fic more readable.\\
- Paragraph spaces, intents if you can.\\
- Proper spelling and Grammar.\\
- Sticking with one character's perspective until a chapter break\\
-- If not a chapter break then at least split it up with a line.\\
- Realistic dialogue.\\
-- This means not things like "Oh they should know you are a professor because this and then I am a professor because of this and then we did this and this and then they joins us."\\
-- Legit just dialogue that isn't explaining the past or what is happening is good.
