Effective immediately I am stepping down, and giving lead control to [[/u/denarii]]. I wish you all the best of luck and hope you stop by and visit us often at [[/r/harrypotter]]


** Thank you for establishing this community and for allowing it to grow into its own. I'm sure many of us already visit the [[/r/harrypotter]] pages and we'll welcome anyone interested in seeing what other writers have done with JK Rowling's world.

Hopefully we'll point them towards the better ones, but no promises.

** Thanks for setting this place up. This is the sub that takes more of my reddit time than all but one other sub. What I find here takes up the majority of my overall internet time.

** Echoing those who've said thank you. Your hard work to craft the Harry Potter community across reddit has helped carve out a space for us. We hope you'll check in if you ever find yourself curious for some of the world outside JRK's books! (:
