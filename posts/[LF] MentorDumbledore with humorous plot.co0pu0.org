I can't remember the name of that one fic, the main thing i remember was that Harry was twinkling his eyes like Dumbledore and everyone commented about that. Please help.


** The Refiner's Fire and the sequel The Time of Destiny by Abraxan? [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2163835/1/The-Refiners-Fire]]

*** No, that's not it, i am sure that it was neither H/Hr nor H/GW, I think it was H/DG but i am not 100% sure. I remember that it had smart Harry. But still thanks for your reply!

**** If you're looking for a specific fic, you want the [What's that fic?] flair.

** I vaguely remember a fic where the plot revolved around Harry not being stylish enough to be the next Leader of the Light, with Dumbledore teaching him how to make his eyes twinkle and his spells look fancier.

Unfortunately I can't find it.

** I remember a fic where Harry says if he's caught Legilimenizing a person, he'll say it's Dumbledore's fault.
