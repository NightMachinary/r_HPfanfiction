I know some time ago there was a prompt for a Harry/Lavender premise, in which Lavender's name got drawn out of the GoF instead if Harry's (I am currently outlining my own fic for that prompt). But in general, I think Lavender suffers a lot in fics and the fandom in general -- probably because of the whole Won-Won debacle.

However, I do believe that Lavender can be an incredibly fun character to write about. It's been forever since I read the books or even watched the movies, but from my memory, I always imagined her to be a loveable, funny, giggly, bubbly and joyful girl. Maybe a bit ditzy here and there, but more like in a select few moments instead of actually being dumb. We all have those moments; I know I do.

Imagining her with Harry, which I never did before until I found that prompt, gets my muse into overdrive. They are so different, it would provide hilarious moments, especially if written from Harry's POV, with his dry humour and sarcasm once he gets into the relationship-y part. And before that, it would just be fun to have that giggly and bubbly girl building a friendship with quiet and shy Harry.

I don't know, I just see so much potential for this rare pairing, I'm surprised I found so little for it.

What do you guys think? Should there be more? Do you see as much potential for fun and greatness as I see in this pair?


** I've always imagined a Harry/Lavender pairing while they're in school. I don't see it as long lasting, but I can see it. She's /fun/.

I've never imagined a post war story, though. That I can see as long lasting.

****** I have been thinking about writing one, but I am not so sure when to set it. 4th year would be a bit trope-y with the Yule Ball, 5th year is rather bleak for Romance under Umbridge and 6th is her relationship with Ron and the can of worms that would undoubtedly open (especially since I refuse to write R/Hr, so the easy fix is out).

Post-war would work, but I dislike so much about the last book that I'd probably spend more time fixing it via flashbacks, exposition and so on than write about the matter at hand. I noticed that while trying a next-gen fic.

** I feel like this would be a relationship where, on the outside, Harry acts similar to Ron insofar that he is put off by her antics. But secretly, he enjoys how open Lavender is with her affection. Kinda like leading a starving man to a water reservoir.

I would love a postwar fic with that pairing, where they help each other heal after the war. There are two fics which go in that direction (one Harry/Lav and one Hermione/Lav), but they end up bashing everyone else and the HP/LB one makes the relationship very imbalanced.

Also, if you want someone to bounce ideas off for that fic, PM me. I was one of the posters in the thread you are referring to, and I have a few ideas on what else you can do with Lavender.

Kind of what makes this so appealing to me, though. They are so different that the possibilities go beyond what you usually see in the most popular pairings, like Ginny, Hermione, Fleur -- they all accept Harry's heroism with an aloofness, with a readiness which I cannot see in Lavender.

She was brave in DH and survived a feral attack from Greyback in the BoH (no confirmed death means she's alive! The Wiki doesn't count!), but before that she was a complete outsider from everything Harry was involved in. I imagine her to be a pampered, 'sheltered' girl (sheltered in the sense of shielded from anything evil, etc and not that she is naive and doesn't know what she's growing in her chest area or sth) who had a very happy and stable home life, completely different from Harry.

That's the appeal I see in her. She wouldn't be like "I understand Harry, you have to fight -- but I cannot let you fight alone!". She would help -- would want to help, it'd be her boyfriend after all -- but beyond all of that, she wouldn't care about Dark Lords and Death Eaters and school intrigues. She wouldn't normalize all of Harry's near-death-experiences as school adventures. She'd be a teenage girl in a teenage relationship with a teenage Harry. She would normalize being a teenager for Harry. Amidst all the crazy of Harry's life, she would be the 'normal' aspect.

**** She gets a bad rap because she's often at odds with Hermoine, the fandom's golden girl, about /a lot./ Hermoine sees her as stupid (because she believes in divination), shallow (because she likes clothes and makeup), and worst of all as competition for Ron's affections.

But let's not forget her good traits. She's upbeat, friendly (she tried to include Hermoine, who pushed her away), and most of all brave. She stood and fought beside Neville and Ginny and the Trio at the Battle of Hogwarts. She survived a werewolf mauling. She may appear bubbly and soft on the outside, but there's steel in the core of her character.

**** Frankly, I consider Tom Riddle to be one of the most complex and interesting characters in the story, especially since I find a lot of the canon stuff dubious at best.

Frankly, the idea that children born under a love potion are unable to feel love seems more like an old wives' tale than anything realistic, especially given the fact that love potions aren't considered a punishable offence the same way that the unforgivables are. Instead, I see most of Tom's flaws being the result of his upbringing at the orphanage (which typically does lead to less well adjusted children, especially those raised there from such a young age). Given that Tom was then repeatedly forced to come back to London while it was in the middle of a war, is it any surprise that he sought out immortality?

I'm not defending any of Tom's worse actions, but I dislike the idea that he's a one-dimensional character destined for evil, when he has the potential to be so much more than that.

As for the Lavender/Tom pairing, it's really well done. Lavender even realises that he's a young Voldemort at one point, but decides that she doesn't quite care because a) he's quite a looker, and b) she's already stuck in the past, so she may as well enjoy herself while she can. She even dissuades him from using horcruxes as she eventually manages to convince him that they'll only bring him bad luck

That, and I do have an interest in reading stories where the characters have a case of fatal attraction.

***** I hate the war trope. Riddle wasn't there during the Blitz as that only began after he returned to Hogwarts and by summer of 1941, most of what was left of the Luftwaffe strike force had been sent east. And by the time the V1s began to fall on London (June 1944) he was magically an adult and had committed four counts of murder already.

It's a cheap excuse and little else.

****** Obviously, Tom wasn't actually in London during the blitz unless the blitz lasted longer in the HP universe (which I did in one of my fics) or unless Tom went back to London over his winter break (which Carpe Noctem did). Tom would not have felt the war directly, though he would have felt its effects in some way. Not enough to justify his actions, but enough to give him some depth.

I will just admit to being a sucker for complex villains and fucked up relationships in fiction. It's a guilty pleasure.

Congratulations, you just opened Pandora's box of alternate history since you now need to figure out how that affected the Eastern Front (since you just shifted almost the entire German Air strength away from there). Because without Luftflotte 2, the Germans lack one of their core offensive elements, which would have devastating effects on German ground operations, which in turn means a very different course of the war. And that means a different order in Europe post-war and a very different balance of power during the cold war (with the Soviets most likely holding the entire continent) and a possible nuclear escalation over the fate of France.

Except that no one else became a dark lord due to the bomb nights. If anything, using the rather generic "I saw the horrors mankind can unleash" as an explanation for the Villain makes him feel cheaper. And even more of a hypocrite since they are the ones who bring death and destruction. The only somewhat logical conclusion would be violent pacifism (prevent war at any cost), but Voldemort is very far from that.

I'm in a middle of sorta writing a post war. mostly an idea while I write a few snippets here and there. Like a short exchanges.

It was an idea about lavender creating a little school, I guess a daycare. Harry comes along, sees the impact that it has and is really drawn to the things happening.

Harry wants to help out, and just has more ideas to make it better and straight up turns it into an orphanage.
