** I struggle not to laugh out loud when I re-read the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/538465][It's Tea Time stories by frombluetored]]. Harry and Ginny and their kids and friends are real and funny and hilarious. It's not a story that's necessarily a comedy - just the little interactions and conversations between characters make me laugh every time. (The first two parts are finished; the third is in progress but updating slowly. It is set post-Cursed Child, which I know is a deal breaker for some.)

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** If you don't mind Dramonie then Hot for Teacher. Albus Severus is hilarious as are the scenes between Ginny and Harry. Linkao3(Hot for Teacher by MotherofBulls)

** !linkffn(Oh God Not Again)

!linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)

These two are both classics

!linkao3(Lily Evans, Death Eater)

This one alternates between serious and hilarious. Death Eater meetings are quite laid back, actually.

!linkffn(Biting the Hand that Feeds You)

A rather over the top story about what happens when the ministry tries to appease Voldemort, with very poor results.

!linkffn(Adorable Violence)

A very Yandere Hermione is highly possessive of Harry.
