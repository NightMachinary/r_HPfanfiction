I can't seem to get enough of Sirius Black's charming and tortured-soul character lately.

I'm looking for good old angsty romances with Sirius, preferably completed please. Smut is welcome ;) Age difference is also welcome (obviously within the subreddit's guidelines, meaning no sexual content involving a minor). Preferably cishet (though a love triangle or threesome is always welcome!).

Thank you so, so much in advance! âœ¨

** Well, it's a one shot and I am not sure it is quite what you are looking for but *Twelve Grimmauld Place* by /Lady Altair/ was lovely and just what I was looking for with post Azkaban Sirius. It's a one shot - Hestia Jones x Sirius Black.

Here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4642802/1/Twelve-Grimmauld-Place]]

Then, there is *Of circuitry and circular thinking* by /Static Lull/. Which is a drabble series focusing on Sirius x Emmeline Vance.

Here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5632826/1/of-circuitry-and-circular-thinking]]

The same author convinced me of the supremacy of Sirius x Petunia (lol). So here are the two they have written:

*These delicate crimes*: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5990846/1/these-delicate-crimes]]

*You are the height of revelation*: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6034848/1/you-are-the-height-of-revelation]]

Also, there is a lot of Sirius/Lily out there, some of them actually quite well written and decently characterised - but I can't remember any at the moment. But these one shots/ drabbles made an impression on me because of the writing. So here you go.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

** I mainly read slash and I've got a Wolfstar series called [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/705045][Bound]] which would absolutely meet every of your requests but the fact that it's a slash pairing. It's one of my all time favorites and I'll just link it for the sake of it.

Basically, in this series, Sirius emerges from the veil when Remus is already married to Tonks. Characterizations are brilliant, so much raw emotions! Rather angsty but with a hopeful ending
