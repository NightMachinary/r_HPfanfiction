** Hmm, the only ones I can think of are child_otkw's, but they are not to everyone's taste. Linkao3(7040089) has Beauxbatons Harry but it's still set in Hogwarts and linkao3(24001843) is /going/ to be Fem!Harry at Durmstrang.

** Please read 'Consuming Shadows' by Child_OTKW on AO3. It is a bit slow, but such a fascinating read. An incredibly set-up AU and the author is fucking fierce in her intelligence. Would always recommend.

** Ok I just got done a 2 week reading fest of some pretty tough crap I list a few: This one is decent but short and not finished I like their take on the Mind Arts, the ICW, and the rest of Europe looking at the UK

Linkffn(12266465)

This one is really had a cool concept of elemental powers and a nice take on physical combat.

Linkffn(1779719)

And I'll throw this one in because the take on Central American magic is awesome

Linkffn(9018023)

Last one is incomplete just like the first one but the idea and the power in it is great as well as a changed Remus

Linkffn(11064921)

One more.... Linkffn(6754695)

  What if in Book 2 Dobby worked smarter and not harder? Inspired by a reddit prompt. Many thanks to my beta ekb1circloud, who has also contributed a few passages of content as well, I believe that makes him a co-author. I read an entertaining guest review, that made me realize that I have to specify this is an AU.
