:END:
A fanfic where regulars black (Sirius brother) has a son, Sirius doesnt know until they use grimauld place in which he was living by himself. Cant remember if this was purely an oc or self insert but leaning more towards oc most likely fanfiction.net but unlikely to be spacebattles or sufficnet velociety. Thanks for your help.
