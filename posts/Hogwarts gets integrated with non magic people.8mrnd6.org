Not sure if this exists but a story where non magic siblings or cousins like Big D go to Hogwarts and some classes are integrated.


** "Black Serendipity" by opopanax features a Hogwarts that becomes co-ed between Wizards and Muggles following the Second Wizarding War (since the violence and destruction was so widespread that it was impossible to cover up, and so the Wizarding World was forced to reveal itself).

  AU. When Al Potter becomes interested in the dark, deadly past of an old man in the neighboring town, it seems to be a hidden catalyst which brings to light many buried demons in the seemingly tranquil lives of the Potters. Will the family survive, or will it destruct? Complete.
