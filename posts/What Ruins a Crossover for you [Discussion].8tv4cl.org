For me, it's when one of the series is obviously just there to be presented as fodder for the other. Immediate drop for me, like with an HP/Smallville crossover I tried earlier.


** Business as usual. Like when Harry just joins in with the canon protags in whatever they're trying to do, and then manages to make no real differences whatsoever.

Give me a Harry with his own agenda and I'm in.

** Crossovers which involve more than one "crossed" character. I like my crossovers to be "HP irreversibly dropped into another world", not having the two worlds exist side-by-side. I just don't believe that it's possible for e.g. the MCU and the HP universe to exist in the same world and for this to make any kind of sense. Not only does it lead to all sorts of logical problems (especially with regards to powers/magic), you will often get huge thematic clash between the tone of the two worlds.

The exception to this is a fusion fic rather than a crossover, where the two worlds are synthesised to form a new, consistent world which draws on elements of each. But that's rarely done, and even more rarely done right.

**** Not OP, but I've read a couple of Anime crossovers where Harry ends up with a hot demon girl who is blatantly overpowered in the HP-verse and can trash Voldemort in 10 seconds flat. However, instead of accepting that HP is underpowered compared to literal divine creatures, here's a training montage so that Harry can bitchslap anyone in the Demon world with his OP magic... Wait, wasn't magic supposed to be underpowered?

You see the same issues with Biotics in Mass Effect crossovers, the Force in SW ones and so on. Hell, I've read non-crossovers with the same issues. One chapter has Harry slaughtering Death Eaters with a WWII service revolver, in the next one the Military takes rather high losses when they utilise tanks, planes and modern artillery because, well... reasons.

As for tonal ones, for example, Harry Potter isn't about getting rich from other people's mystery, so maybe a "Lord of War" crossover with Harry as international arms merchant wouldn't be a good idea. Same reason why Harry wouldn't get along with a ruthless Renegade Shepard (although a paragon one would work well with Harry). Also, despite what shippers tell you, HP is not about who bangs who, so a Sex in the City crossover isn't really that thrilling.

I know, but you are forgetting one thing, Hermione has magic. She can transfigure and conjure stuff. She can mass produce pretty much everything with the gemini curse/spell. She can enchant stuff to improve efficiency exponentially. She can lift massiv steel plates with ease. She can create hardened steel out of thin air.

******** Step one would be building some semi-modern steelworks and smelters with basic steam engines. Step two would be mining infrastructure to supply the whole thing, agricultural machines and basic farming techniques. Step three would be transport infrastructure, building materials and shipbuilding. Four would be a basic chemical industry (oil, fertiliser, gunpowder).

Hermione just has to jumpstart things, the workforce is already present. Introducing modern farming techniques would free up thousands of workers. In case you need manpower just go to Kings Landing and recruit the poor from Flea Bottom (and force them through a magical secrecy vow). The whole expansion can be financed with exports of food and high-quality steel (which is centuries ahead of anything else).

Sure, there would be some trial and error, but magic and a copy of the "Encylopedia Britannica" should be enough to allow someone of Hermione's calibre to get stuff done. Especially considering that she can use magic as a crutch.

- HP f*cking with Loki / HP having a daddy complex with Loki - in general any Loki-HP fiction is retarded

- HP OP as hell but limiting himself because of some moral notions.

- Most importantly - I hate it when HP is in the story but nothing changes at all. Its still just a boring retell of the canon story. No thanks.

- Elf Harry / LotR HP in general - HP magic is superior to any shit they have and still most crossovers are just gay-angsty-bullshit

- Deus Ex Machina HP without any explanation or build-up instead of "Hey he got magic, thats why"

- Authors that are too lazy to come up with their own magic and simply run along with HP spells and then make HP a super-human / giving him mutant abilities in order to keep up

- GoT stories with a Harry that doesnt use magic also suck. If I read a HP crossover I want magic in it!

** Pretty much everything that happens in the White Wolf of Westeros. It's a Witcher/GoT crossover. Usually I'm pretty tolerant of generic canon rehashes (as that's my specialty) but this story takes it way too far.

1) Geralt's presence changing nothing. Canon happens exactly the same despite some events getting warped or added. Nothing the author has added from the witcher universe has impacted GoT canon at all.

2) Geralt getting other characters lines, which still adds nothing. Think of the scene where King Robert commands Ned to deal with the Targaryen children, except that it's Geralt saying all the refusal lines.

3) Geralt doesn't just steal character lines, he steals plot as well, though it's thinly disguised as "fixing" the story to the author's whims. Example would be Geralt saving the butcher's boy from being killed by the Hound. Because Reasons.

4)Many lines of dialogue are lifted strait from the show, word for word, despite perfectly valid reasons for that scene to not even happen. Yet it does happen, and Geralt is conveniently there to witness it go down exactly the same.

5) Geralt telling people of his nature immediately upon meeting him. Seriously, he randomly visits Tobho Mott (because of course it's that specific blacksmith) and within an hour he's telling him hes from a different universe, and then he gives him a bunch of blacksmithing plans and otherworldly crafting supplies.

** The fact that it's a crossover to begin with honestly. I used to find crossovers interesting tangents to what could occasionally be a stale universe, but as I've grown older, they just aren't interesting to me in the least. If I'm going to venture into a fandom fanfic world, I want that fandom and nothing else. I don't mind hints to other fandoms but copypasta'd characters from other fandoms just isn't okay in my book. Just my opinion tho.

*** I've found myself to be the opposite. Unless the author is /really/ good, I'm generally not interested in pure HP fanfiction. I need a crossover to spice things up.
