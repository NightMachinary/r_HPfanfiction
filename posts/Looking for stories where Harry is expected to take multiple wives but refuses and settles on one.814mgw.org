I think we all know the type of story where for some reason (multiple lordships, marriage contracts) Harry has to be take more than one wife. Are there any stories where he gets into that kind of situation but says "fuck it, I don't care if the X name will die out if I don't take a second wife" or generally rejects a second wife because he is quite happy with the girl/woman he has? Obviously no slash and please no Hermione/Ron or Hermione/anyone from Slytherin in the background.


** linkffn(Marriage in Mind by AzarDarkstar) is the closest I can think of, not strictly multiple wives but definitely sticking by his choice.

  One Shot. AU. A marriage contract. They want him to sign away his freedom and his future and his life on a girl who didn't even attend her best friend's funeral. Harry has other ideas.

** Not perfect for your request, but somewhat related. Harry is less than pleased with a Marriage contract. Malicious compliance ensues.

  Unbreakably bound to someone you can't stand? How unfortunate.
