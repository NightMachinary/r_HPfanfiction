Just the title. ^^ If it's femslash, I'd particularly enjoy fem!Harry x Hermione or fem!Harry x Luna but I'll take anything~ Thank you!


** Not sure if this is still updated, but it is some pure fire dude:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29400924/chapters/72228117]])

You have preobably read these, they are very similar and both very good, archeologist is slight bloodborne xover, but don't worry about it. Note that these are both time travel fics with Harry becooming a woman after some sort of incident and the romance takes more of a back seat here:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318951/11/The-Archeologist]])

Decidedly not femslash, but good and timetravely:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22700143]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12744735/1/The-Last-Peverell]])

This list is almost all fem!Harry femslash, which is good as good cause it is very niche, however alot of it is in another language and/or is marked as 'yuri' which means it is probably more than a bit lewd (not 'shoujo-ai' which is tends to be wholesome):

  The Veil of Death can only reap one soul at a time, so when Harry follows Sirius through in a desperate bid to save his godfather, it only reaps the horcrux out of his scar before tossing Harry's soul back in time to the Marauder's Era. Waking up as a new person with sixteen years worth of new memories was not part of Harry's (admittedly rash) plan. Waking up as a girl, even less so. But if it will give him the chance to save not just Sirius but his parents as well, Harry isn't going to complain. Fem!Harry/Sirius Black Or in which Harry tries to help his dad win over his mom. Sirius tries to win over Harry. Voldemort is a total psychotic creeper. And Lily is just done with all of them.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

** The best fem!Harry fic, in my opinion, is linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) linkao3(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus).\\
No femslash, (unless you count Ginny with a crush on Lily [fem!harry]) but it's REALLY REALLY GOOD. VERY.

I also really like linkffn(When Harry Met Tom) linkao3(When Harry Met Tom).\\
No femslash, but also very good, but that's to be expected because it's written by the same author that wrote that fic up there.

Hope you check these out and please reply to my comment to tell me how good you thought they were!!

(P.S. they're both ongoing, and if the update date seems some time ago, that's because she [the author] has a lot of ongoing fics, and updates them in order, but it really is worth the wait 😁)
