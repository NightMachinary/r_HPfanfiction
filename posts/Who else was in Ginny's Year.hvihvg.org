writing a fic in Ginny's year and all I've got is her, Luna, and Colin HALP


** In canon, it's a very short list of known students: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Sorted_in_1992]]

** Not sure if she's in Ginny's year for sure, but Demelza Robins could be.

**** Source? I just did a search of the last three books and did not find anything about when she was sorted. The [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Demelza_Robins][wiki doesn't give a specific year other than 1995 or before.]] It's safe to say that she wasn't sorted in 1991 and we can probably assume that she wasn't a first year in the Half-Blood Prince (the only book she appears in). So, we have the options of 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995, though I'm guessing 1990 is probably out as well.

** I sometimes put Flora and Hestia Carrow in Ginny's year because they have some (if not a huge amount) of fanon built in. HPWikia puts them as being born on 31 Aug 1985 (or earlier) so it's not a huge stretch, even if the characters were only made for the movies and the actresses look a little younger than Bonnie or Evanna in HBP. If I'm also too lazy to come up with names that sound in-universe I go to the wikia, find characters that don't have definitive birthdays or years (basically characters that are noncanon) and use those names too. Or coming up with your own is always fun too!
