:END:
What is the dumbest side plot or story you ever read in a fic? Like side plots that just confused the hell out of you. Mine would be that Harry took a vacation to the Island of fucking Sodor! Like from Thomas the Tank Engine. And he goes more than once, the second time I think he takes Hermione of Daphne.


** I once read a fanfic where they wanted to make Snape headmaster for some time so they somehow needed to get rid of McGonagall. I think the side plot was her getting stuck in a foreign country with some random muggle named Garry Hotter who for some reason thought he was the next Harry Potter- I kinda forgot the whole plot but I found it h i l a r i o u s because the main story was super dark and tragic.

It was a great Snape fic BTW, if I remembered the name I would advise you to read it lol

** So, there's this story called Grimdark, and it's about a Harry that was sent to hell and they summon him back ten years later. But it's been 100 for him, and he has an army of demons and succubi and...

And suddenly, in chapter 26, you're greeted with this:

#+begin_quote
  The morning sun rose over the happy farm, Hogwarts. At the top of the barn, a tall, gangly, overimportant cock (who's name was Percy) sounded the morning wake up call.
#+end_quote

And everyone is suddenly a barnyard animal (well no, they're mostly kittens).

And it broke my brain.

** In The Merging where Harry takes a trip to an alternate dimension. Okay, it wasn't /dumb/ exactly, but it certainly confused me because it's so short and completely irrelevant to the main story and never comes up again despite having huge implications that alternate worlds exist and can be traveled to.

*** I read The Merging rather recently, and had to think about this for a bit... there's a chapter marked as an 'interlude' that the notes said could be skipped. Since I distinctly remember once reading an "interlude" that had all the students of Hogwarts as literal fucking kittens living in a barn, I decided to skip it and save my sanity.

And no, I'm not making that up. I'm also pretty sure that Albus was a goat.
