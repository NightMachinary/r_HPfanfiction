I've just read [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/478074/chapters/830006][serpens armarum]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5621051/1/Outcasts_Alley][Outcasts Alley]], and I am looking for more fics down that vein.

It doesn't have to have a nonhuman Harry, or even be Harry as the main character, just be in the 'kid runs off and meets interesting people' theme.

Anyone got anything like that?


** linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) is incredible and has a similar beginning.
