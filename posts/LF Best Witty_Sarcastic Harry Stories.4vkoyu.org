Basically, as stated in the title, I'm looking for stories where Harry has a really sarcastic inner monologue going on throughout the story. If I remember correctly /How Fleur Delacour Seduced Me/ was a fic with a good example of this. Harry is really sarcastic surrounding his own bad luck, and other stuff. Idk, fics that have Harry written like this always give me a laugh.


** Ruskbyte's Backward's Compatible, a great fic that was unfortunately abandoned.

** linkffn(In Which Sirius Can't Tell a Story to Save His Life by SilverWolf7007) has an excellent snarky!Harry.

linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) gives him some great one-liners as well.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Remus orders Sirius to tell Harry a bedtime story. Harry, however, is fifteen and would really rather just go to sleep. Oh, and Sirius's story sucks.
