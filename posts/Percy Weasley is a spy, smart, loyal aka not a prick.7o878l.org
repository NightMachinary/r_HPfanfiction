I love the character percy, I think he often gets the short end of the stick. So what are some great stories where percy is a hero, or a spy or even just an intelligent character. I know there are about five older fics that always come up in this category, but any new or even unfinished stories? Thanks for your help :)


** I like stories where Percy ended up helping a lot of people from inside the Ministry. It redeems him as a character and a person. Plus, it makes his involvement in the war a lot more tangible. These two are my most favorites. (I assume you've read them already though.)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11857153/1/Unspeakables][Unspeakables]] by Ebenbild is definitely another fic that is highly amusing and surprisingly well written. Basically, Harry and Percy time travel. linkffn(11857153) Status: Ongoing

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916711/1/Accidental-Switch][Accidental Switch]] by Myra109 is a bit over on the dark side of the spectrum and is very graphic at times. Not the best writing in the world, but the story itself is different. Basically, potion mishap with Percy and Fred switching bodies. linkffn(11916711) Status: Complete

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10706195/1/Re-learning-Affection][Re-learning Affection]] by Ki-hori-e-te-ao is a bit frustrating to me because the Weasley family is so broken at the beginning. However, it's a good read overall. linkffn(10706195) Status: Ongoing

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11769405/1/Dudley-Dursley-and-the-Deathly-Hallows][Dudley Dursley and the Deathly Hallows]] by Grey Streaked. This story is really from Dudley's perspective, however, Percy later becomes a important character as well. linkffn(11769405) Status: Complete

I'll try to find more later since my favorite folder is currently a mess.

Edit:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12157282/1/Percy-Take-the-Wheel][Percy Take the Wheel]] Kitty Smith. I almost forgot about this fic. This story basically put Percy in more of a leadership type role among his younger siblings. A fascinating and original plot. linkffn(12157282) Status: Ongoing

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11059263/1/Cold-Coffee][Cold Coffee]] by Dubious Writings made me cry a lot. Enough said. linkffn(11059263) Status: Ongoing

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
