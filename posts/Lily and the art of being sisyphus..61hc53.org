I just want to know since i've heard this a lot about the story, but the beginning doesn't seem like my type of story. Just to be clear i enjoy non godlike stories. It's just this doesn't seem like i could enjoy it otherwise, but at what point does eleanor become godlike/op etc...


** Not quite. That fic is pretty interesting because the overpowered parts are really secondary. The main point of the fic is the philosophy of it, which is a typical theme of the auther. Yes Lily is overpowered and godlike, but it never is easy to see, because the writer sees this as the default reality, whereas other fics make a note of how special the character is and compare and contrast their power levels. I personally enjoyed it. You may or may not, but it is well written enough that you won't feel total regret and dispair at wasting your time.

** Have you ever read Catch 22 by Joseph Heller? I've often thought of Lily-Sisyphus as the Catch 22 of the HP fanfiction community. It's a fic written, as [[/u/Dorgamund]] noted, to communicate a philosophical theme, that theme being [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdist_fiction][Absurdism]] as far as I can tell. It's not a regular story about a protagonist overcoming conflict. Rather, Lily herself is the conflict. Lily is the problem that all the other characters have to work to understand, and Lily has to work to understand them. She stands outside regular human life and looks in, seemingly incapable of connecting with regular people. She breaks reality without pause because "reality" does not have the same meaning to her. Her mindset means she doesn't look at /anything/ the way everyone else does, and this story is her journey through that mindset.

I highly recommend it, if only for the mindfuck. Catch 22 is also highly recommended.

*** That's a fantastic summation of the story, and now you've gotten me interested in Catch-22.

Anyway, OP: Lily is godlike from the beginning, though it takes a couple chapters, I think, for that to be clear. However, just because you have the ability to essentially overwrite reality doesn't mean that it solves all your problems.

The story definitely isn't to everyone's tastes. It's very much not your typical HP fanfic.

**** Yup. More power, more problems.

You should definitely read Catch 22. I need to pick it up again myself. I read it in highschool but could never quite wrap my head around it, so I wonder how I'll do now. Absurdism is quite the headache.

***** Absurdism was my favorite unit in high school English, but yes, it's definitely not easy to understand. I had a hard time in literature class, but at least with absurdism it was an interesting hard time, not just a slog through Hamlet's endless monologues.

** It's worth pointing out, that if you go in expecting any kind of cohesion or a tight plot structure (or any kind of structure, lol) for this fic, you'll be severely disappointed.

This story is pretty much random. Plot points are constantly introduced, mentioned once and then disappear without resolution. All the while you're left thinking "I'm sure that cool thing that was mentioned in chapter 3 will be brought up again soon!". But now it's 40 chapters later and it hasn't been brought up. Probably won't ever, either.

So yeah. If you want to read this, you have to consider every chapter an one-shot that is only loosely connected to the rest of the one-shots.

** If you want to be eased into the writing style of that particular author, I'd suggest giving Muffin's other works a shot first. They're a good deal less "random" but have a similar vibe. (Not to mention that Muffin's got the best damn Death Note fic out there)

What makes Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus worth it as a read is that the main character doesn't give a damn. Lily goes to hogwarts because she has nothing better to do, because, as it turns out, being all powerful from age 0 makes you a bit of a sociopath. The main violent villain is incapable of defeating her, so it's really more of a sitcom: Let's see how she gets out of this week's wacky situation.
