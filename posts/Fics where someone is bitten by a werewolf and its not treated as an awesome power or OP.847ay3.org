Wondering if there are some fics where someone (can be Harry Ron or anyone else that isn't Lupin) gets infected with lycanthropy and its not used as an OP powerup or treated as an awesome ability. I'll accept full on angst as long as its well written.


** [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=81213&chapter=0][Dudley Dursley and the New Normal]] might be what you're looking for, as long as you're okay with it being from Dudley's POV. It was apparently removed from fanfiction.net, but I managed to track it down. In it, the Dursleys were attacked by a werewolf while in hiding during Deathly Hallows with Dudley being the only survivor. It's about him learning to live with being a werewolf and adjust to his new circumstance.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Through a dark ritual, Draco Malfoy is sent back in time, from his seventeenth year to his eleventh. Now he has the chance to use his superior knowledge and skill to change everything and save all his friends and family, but there's a terrible complication: it turns out that not even time travel can cure a case of lycanthropy.

Did someone break out the cannons again?

Oh wait, you meant what OP is searching for is in the books. Oops.

**** I mean in the books it's shown that Lupin does struggle with it greatly, even going so far as trying to stave off falling in love. I mean if OP's just watched the movies, than I could understand where he's coming from, but if he's read the books...

Thanks,

***** I have read the books and i do understand it. The reason I made this request is because I've come across many fics where someone becomes a werewolf and and its treated as an awesome power up essentially.

****** Well in stories that's not exactly a bad thing. It depends on how it happens, and how does it affect the persons way of life. I mean if the person has a constant, ready supply of Wolfsbane, or maybe learns with the native americans how to accept the animal spirit, or even if it's a different type of werewolf, but I get what your asking for. Sadly I don't particularly like angsty stories, so no idea.

Thanks,

Warryn.

** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12032167/1/Moonlight-Mischief]]) A rather unusual story, you don't find a whole lot of non-humor, non-death-angst, non-romance Fred and George stories. This one is a pretty fun read, but it's incomplete.

  Between Quidditch practice, pranking, Hermione Granger, detention (or, rather, gettting out of it), and, not to mention, helping the escaped convict Sirius Black, Fred Weasley doesn't have time to be a werewolf. But such is his new life, and he can't laugh it off this time.
