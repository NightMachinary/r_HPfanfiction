*** Awesome, thanks! I haven't been on any of these before.

I was fairly sheltered in the fandom, honestly. Google mostly comes up with ffn results unless you're looking for specific sites

***** I've read Sunset over Britain, wasn't super thrilled. I'll check out portkey. I'm honestly kind of surprised I never see these other sites; most of my story searches are through google and I only seem to get ffn results. I remember when I was younger I got more diverse sites (SIYE, hpfanfiction, even Wattpad) but now I just don't see them.

** Sufficient Velocity. It's one of the SB trio (Space battles, and it's 2 offspring, Sufficient Velocity (SV) and Queery Quests (or something like that, QQ))

SV focuses more on Worm fanfic and cross planar (MtG style planeswalker) stuff, which I've come to read a lot since finding the site.

Originally I heard of SV after Shade Umbrus that Ravenclaw fic was posted there.

BTW, to read faster on the site you can set the thread to 'reader mode' on one of the top bars, or navigate via thread marks. Note, these things didn't exist pre around 2015, so you'd need to read between comments before then.

**** While it's been awhile since I haunted the place, I expect that you'll probably hate Spacebattles as well if you hate DLP. I recall the place being largely a circle-jerk club for JoeHundredaire fanboys and they'd need a substantial overhaul to overcome that inertia.

Other sites, if you're into canon pairings, are [[https://www.phoenixsong.net//][phoenixsong]] and [[http://www.siye.co.uk/][SIYE]], both of which have a significant amount of content not found on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. If you're into Harry/Hermione, some archives of the defunct [[https://Portkey.org][Portkey.org]] site are still around, which also had a great deal of content not found on the other sites.

You can find hgfan111's stuff on archive if you hunt around; there is also a lot that's not on the main fanfiction site.

***** Ohh I used to go on SIYE a lot. First site I ever found :) I think I used to go on hpfanficarchive? And whatever the other one like it was. I haven't been there in years. Forgot all about them.

I got bored of canon pairings years ago. It's more fun to read work that's more original.

******** Based on the fics I've read written by him, I'd say it has to do with his writing being a bit on the powerwanky, wish fulfilment side of things, which is something he has in common with a lot of the fics on spacebattles. Unlike SB however, his fics do have shipping in them.

â€‹

I personally like spacebattles because the writing is technically a step above other sites, and don't care for DLP, because of their harry centric obsession.

***** I mean something like DLP where there's the occasional good fic, but it's so buried it weird stuff like Harry/Lily that it's just not worth the fight. Especially since the good stuff is usually posted somewhere else too.

**** It tends to have a Military Sci-fi/Action Fantasy bent, so expect stories and fandoms focused more on action and adventure than on romance and/or drama. I'm not so sure how active the HP fandom is on SB and SV as I gravitate more towards Worm, Fate, and Kancolle on those platforms, but there is a very good HP/Fate crossover, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/reader][Swords and Sorcery]] that you may enjoy. (Fem! Harry, no pairing)

****** Not really.

There's really only the one Fate character who gets dimensionally displaced, and his personality and abilities are pretty well explored. You might miss a non-critical reference or in-joke here or there and the "Dimensional Counterparts" will be more like well crafted OCs than an interesting spin on a familiar character but that's about the worst it will be.

Caveat: The interdimensional mishap that starts the whole thing relies pretty heavily on Fate knowledge. You can pretty easily just handwave it as "A wizard did it" though as it's not critical to the rest of the story

**** Lot of gen fic, and arguably the site with the best SI/OC fics. Very rarely is there romance, or angst apart from maybe one or two writers. Also fix fics, AUs, crossovers, and strong protagonists, but the level of writing is good enough that it doesn't really matter. Stories like Ashes of the Past (pokemon) and This Bites!(One Piece) are on spacebattles, as well as the Harry Potter fics like Seventh Horcrux and Realignment.

*** In a similar vein Alternatehistory.com also has a subforum for "Fandom AH".

Both have lots of militaristic and historical fics. They tend to focus more on action and description of events.

** [[https://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/browse.php?type=recent]]

This site isn't bad. Not really any pairings with Snape or Malfoy in a generous light, the bashing stories are pretty numerous there as well, but it all depends on the author, but there's a good spread of stories that don't really fall under the Fanfiction.net rules for HP
