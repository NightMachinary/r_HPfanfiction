This is a story with Harry as the main POV, but will sometimes switch to Lord Voldemort or, as /she's/ known in this story, Emily Riddle. There is, perhaps, a more accurate way to describe how she prefers to be called, but I don't want to spoil anything.

As you can probably guess by the previous paragraph, this is a story with a female Voldemort. However, this is /not/ a story with a female Voldemort for the sake of plot convenience to ship HPLV. As a matter of fact, I'm fairly certain that HPLV will not be a pairing that actually happens. The story isn't finished, yet, though, and I wouldn't want to assume where the author is going.

In a nutshell, the story is heavily focused on Harry discovering the "truth" behind Emily's past, and his reactions and understanding to it. The story doesn't shy or explain away the death of Harry's parents. There's no plot convenient explanation that makes it okay. It happens, and Emily did it herself in pretty much exactly the way it happens canonically, if for not exactly the same reasons (the LV in this story isn't completely obsessed over the prophecy, or so it... seems). Nor does Harry ever forgive her for it or suddenly stop caring about his parents, like you see in many "New Light" LV stories.

Outside of a few ideological changes there's very little known canon that is changed, previous to Harry Potter's Fifth Year at Hogwarts after which, of course, the story is fairly AU.

I honestly can't recommend the story enough. The characters are fairly canon, I feel as though with the things that happen that, perhaps, this may have been how Harry would have actually reacted to things. How Hermione may have reacted to things. How Ron may have reacted to things.

But I can't carry on too much without spoiling everything. So I'll conclude this with a very large thank you to [[/u/TE7]]. You've done amazingly fantastic work and I can't wait to read your next update.

EDIT: I will say, be careful to whoever is currently getting ready to storm through this story. Chapter 29 (the latest, as of writing) is, perhaps, the largest cliff hanger I've ever read in my 12 years of my reading Harry Potter fanfiction. Goddamn it.

*** I probably read it over too long a time so no doubt I am forgetting the explanation for why this is plausible, but at the end of the last chapter...

[[/spoiler][Recalling how canon Harry was capable of throwing off Voldemort's /Imperius/ in the graveyard, it's odd that nearly a year later, a more powerful and put together Harry folds to Emily with a sudden, "Okay, fine. You win." Even if she were using the /Imperius/ while possessing him, it still feels off for Harry to go "poof, I concede."]]

[[/spoiler][It's hard to imagine, but I have to ask: was your point with the scene to just rub in his nose just how much of a pathetic, besotted idiot he is who never had agency, have him realize it, and then take the steps to kill himself? Because that's one way to read the scene. If so, Harry's grown nada as a character from the beginning of the story, in which case Emily may as well have just killed him in the graveyard. If your intention was /not/ this, then it feels like you're missing a beat or two, something to make a believable transition to a place where he can allow himself to submit to her will when the stakes are so high.]]

Just my $0.02.

**** I'd say read the scene closer and pay attention to the stage direction also the fact that Harry's thoughts aren't always Harry's thoughts.

There's a lot going on there that isn't overly apparent. I'm not sure how to spoiler text while on my phone. But the conclusion ‘Harry' jumps to is not the truth.

I'd also say pay close attention to what actually sways him to action.

--------------

[[/spoiler][It's entirely possible I'm wrong, but I'm around 99.999% sure that those thoughts at the end were Emily's, viewing /herself/ dying while possessing Harry Potter. Or they /were/ Harry's thoughts, but the mind meld (which was kind of subtle until Hermione pretty much spelled it out in front of Avery) finally completed and Harry could no longer tell the difference between himself and Emily. It's also possible that I'm slightly off on both of those thoughts. TE7 left it pretty open and kind of muddy, it seems, on purpose, near the end. However, it's fairly obvious that it wasn't Harry dying, no matter how you interpret it (Or, rather, Harry's body, at least. It's possible she took him over and killed his personality, replacing it with her own.) She was trying to force him to kill her.]]

***** Without getting into overt spoiler territory. What happens is exactly what Emily wants to have happen.

There's plenty of hints as to what's actually happening aside from Harry's incorrect assumptions and your own pointing out that it's never quite clear who's thoughts are coming through.

And I think it's also critical to look at just what finally persuades him. It's not torture, it's not the imperious curse, and it's not a hatred for her she tries to draw out by going comically evil sentences before.

***** Depends on the app, I suppose. Mine works fine with spoilers.

I counted at least six qualitatively different ways to interpret the ending in light of the data we were given, each plausible within the story and hints dropped along the way.

As a reader, I find too much ambiguity frustrating, a sign that I'm either the biggest idiot on the planet or else a sign that a good fraction of readers are not going to interpret the story the way the author intended.

It's a result of the serial nature of fanfiction. Ambiguity in published fiction hooks the reader and keeps them turning the pages to resolve their lack of understanding. In fanfiction you have to sit around and wait for the next update, your frustration growing the entire time.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** Nice title...deffinitely need to polish my Spanish (I knew that "sangre" meant blood, but I didn't remember the freaking first word...shame on me because it's one of the first words you learn when doing household items and chores (including freaking cleaning!))

So I'll check it out (if it's not in Spanish, mine isn't that good yet, so reading longer texts is hard - even if I sometimes can figure out what the writer wants me to comprehend (context explains unkown words and all that))

*** The story isn't written in Spanish, no. The title means "blood purity" or, literally, "cleanliness of blood". I assume it's just a reference to the stereotypical Death Eater propaganda. So far as I know it doesn't play a particularly important role in the story, nor is there a "Roll Credits" moment.

It can also refer to the act of cleaning, in addition to the property of cleanliness. So an alternative translation would be "Purification of blood".

***** *Limpieza de sangre*

Limpieza de sangre is also a novel in the Captain Alatriste series by Arturo Pérez-Reverte.

Limpieza de sangre (Spanish: [limˈpjeθa ðe ˈsaŋɡɾe]), Limpeza de sangue (Portuguese: [lĩˈpezɐ ðɨ ˈsɐ̃ɡɨ], Galician: [limˈpeθa ðe ˈsaŋɡe]) or Neteja de sang (Catalan: [nəˈtɛʒə ðə ˈsaŋ]), literally "cleanliness of blood" and meaning "blood purity", played an important role in the modern history of the Iberian Peninsula.

It referred to those who were considered pure "Old Christians", without recent Muslim or Jewish ancestors, or within the context of the empire (New Spain and Portuguese India) usually to those without ancestry from the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, Asia, or Africa.
