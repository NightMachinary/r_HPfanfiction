** This story is set in a very different time period, but it has Angsty Harry all throughout.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

  The Wizarding Wars are over, but the work of recovery has only begun. Remus Lupin is trying to find his place in an ever-changing world, and when he is invited to serve on a truth and reconciliation commission, he has to confront the truth that lives there---in the past and within himself.

** What did you think of Cadmean Victory? I've restarted it a few times by I can never seem to get past the Yule Ball or a few chapter after. It always seemed kinda flat to me. Does it get better? I've heard great things and I'm tryna figure out if I should just power through, so that eventually it gets good.

*** I also struggled to get past the ball but on my 3rd try to read it I got more invested into the characters like one might for an actual book. I found that if I read it slower and actually took it in more it was enjoyable. It can be quite difficult to get into but boy is it done well.

** The RSeries by Regulus, starting with linkffn(The Philosopher's Stone Retransmuted)

He's rewritten every year, starting with minor canon divergences that gradually increase until it's a completely different story. There's plenty of angst starting around book 4, to the point where I had to quit reading it at book 5.

Well, that isn't quite right. In general, it's fairly well-written up until book 5. It's not just angst, it's that the angst is caused by some absolute retardation of some of the choices the main cast makes. With no spoilers, if you read the series up until that point, there are some things that take place where the main cast is acting completely out of character from how they were throughout the rest of the series, and they're dumbed down to the point of being stupid whereas before they were relatively intelligent individuals, and all of this is to force unecessary drama that will obviously be resolved within the next book or two. It made me angry enough to rage quit the series, and I've managed to enjoy some poorly written fics.

So, well written? For most of what I've read, yes. Angst? Definitely yes. Well written angst? Fuck no.
