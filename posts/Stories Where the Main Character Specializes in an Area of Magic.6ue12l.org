I am looking for fics that the MC specializes in something. Linkffn(The Arthmancer) deals with Hermione specializing in Arithmancy. Linkffn(The Art of Self-fashioning) deals with an organic transfiguring Harry. Linkffn(Runemaster) deals in Harry specializing in runes.

There was even a Potter specializing in human relations wherein he was called Ambassador (not sure of the title of the fic but it was a hufflepuff harry).

So, care to share fics with that theme?


** Just posted this on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], but check out the Pureblood Pretense series - a lot on Potions.

** My current story, "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief", has Hermione learning (and specialising in) how to steal from the most secure places. It'll take a few more chapters until she's ready for a heist, though.
