** Regular members of DLP visit and comment here, so you might get a little grief for expressing your enthusiasm. It would be like saying 'Hey, did you realize that the Force Awakens is actually a sequel? There's this whole collection of old movies with related storylines!'

You are very right, but it's not news to us. Glad to see that you appreciate the value of the site.

**** To be fair, what Karinta said was completely true.

"Please don't rec that" - It goes against DLP culture to advertise its existence and attempt to gain new members.

"They're a bunch of cynical bastards" - Which is true.

"Tastes are highly idiosyncratic and unrepresentative of the fandom" - In a fandom full of m-preg, slash, incomplete sentences, and a bunch of other shit, I'd say it's a compliment to us by saying we're unrepresentative of the fandom.

So everything good: you guys.

Everything bad: someone else.

The bizarre attempts from that forum's members to visit other sites and brag about the inherent quality of the DLP Brand is childish. So far as I can tell you just have a different flavour of shitposter than can be found here. At the upper end of the spectrum, there is no difference in the quality of stories discussed here or there.

Your mods do come here and tell this subreddit's members to kill themselves in oblique ways, so I guess /that's/ different.

That's not what I said. Go re-read my post.

Again, go re-read my post. “It goes against DLP culture to advertise its existence and attempt to gain new members.” Quite frankly, DLP members do not give a damn about what other sites, including [[/r/hpfanfiction]], say about us. The only time we react is when people do shit like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3m6kb3/upload_dlp_fics_you_have_and_share_it/][this]] where they show complete disregard of DLP authors.

The only time I remember quality being discussed was during the WbA fiasco and the eloquent “DLP are assholes” thread. Other than that, we didn't talk about DLP quality unless it was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3m6wyo/a_little_clarification_on_what_dlp_is_for_please/][directly asked]].

Go look into my post history and you'll find that most, if not all, of my posts are helpful, insightful, and positively received.

No. DLP takes into account of technical writing, plot progression/pacing, character development, and a myriad of other factors in critiquing fanfiction. So, stories like 0800-Rent-A-Hero and Cadmean Victory (that are almost universally praised on this subreddit) are considered “almost recommendable” in DLP.
