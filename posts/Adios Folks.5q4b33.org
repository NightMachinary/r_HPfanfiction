*** He got trolled pretty hard by something called 'cramphater' who's post history comes off mostly as a teenager that thinks it's a lot funnier than it is. So he went and made the mistake of feeding it, and now he's salty about it.

That, and the below commentary discussing topics that are generally considered icky by most people, coupled with the defense of 'well I'm putting it in my stories!' which may or may not be true. But if he was looking for how other stories handled those topics with a scholarly interest he'd have likely asked for a discussion and not just for links to other stories.

**** I saw this happen live and the whole time I was wondering why GryffindorTom kept replying, it was really cringe worthy to see him keep arguing and his obliviousness to the trolling. I was reminded of the old quote(iirc by George Carlin):

“Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.”

**** Had you ever thought that maybe, just maybe, I could have been asking as a couple of my fics will be reaching the stage where a Love Potion is revealed, or a threesome is involved, and I wanted to look at other stories to see what people had wrote so I could improve my own writing.

Not all of the stuff I have been working on has been published you know...

which is the point? from what i've seen, your low public approval rating has to do with your preoccupation with rape and other generally skeevy plot elements

****** Preoccupation? Out of all of my storylines, I can count on one hand the stories that feature it that I've published (There is one I have not published yet as it is mainly just notes only, that being one where Harry is raped by Hermione as vengeance for Ron being killed in battle)

The first love potion storyline was to do with a fic where Lily and Sirius are in love with each other, but James, who secretly agrees with the Pureblood Supremacists, forces her to marry him, with Lily finding out a couple of times and James removing the memories.

The second one is where Hermione is potioning Harry, all because of family vengeance, a perceived wrong that the Potters did against her true great grandfather, Grindelwald, as in it, Henry Potter was the person who killed Grindelwald, yet gave the credit to his best mate, Albus Dumbledore. It involved her being adopted by the Grangers

The Third one would have been where Harry had a reason to potion Ginny, as he was in love with her yet was sick of seeing her with Dean Thomas.

** Somehow? I usually tag people on Reddit so I can spot coincidences, agenda-pushing, or just happy circumstances when I see people again.

The very first time I saw a post of yours here, you got the tag "pedophile rape addict". I can't exactly remember what you were suggesting or pushing or requesting in that post, but it was no good.

So, having an obvious warning flag flair, I've been particularly observant to whenever you pop up in a threat to constantly talk about the same, frankly disgusting, crap. Furthermore, in the last week, my [[/r/hpfanfiction]] front page has been full of red warning flairs, because you've been spamming inane requests for extremely specific fetishes.

That doesn't come off well. Goodbye, but at least you got an achievement: you are the very first person I've reached -40 negative karma rating for.

** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGcHNnI2mh4][All I can think of it this video]]. I'm not sure what prevaricated this, but I do remember your rather disastrous thread where you defended your exploitative use of rape centred narratives.

But I don't get why you would up and leave this forum, despite the echo chamber of recommendations, it's still a useful tool for finding new content that's been vetted by a community with decent standards.

Seems like cutting your nose off to spite your face.

******** I read that one too! Equally amazing.

It did give me a hilarious idea for a conversation between Voldemort and Harry in my current fic though. I don't think there's any way it makes it into the fic, but it's funny in my head.

On a side note, since after just reading commentary on OP's story, and his defense of 'it happens in real life,' has he ever written a fic where Harry is repeatedly gang raped by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle? Because you know, that happens in real life too.
