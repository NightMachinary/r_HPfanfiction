Fics where one of them dies at the DOM. Preferably Hermione or Ron.

Edit: It's the Ministry /Six/ in the title


** Ginny dies. Harry goes into full "woe is me, everything is my fault" but becomes determined to even use dirty tricks to defaet voldemort and his minions. Ron matures up way too much and becomes completely serious and hellbent on killing the death eaters so much so that people rhink he is gone dark. Hermione throws herself into research into protective enchantments and rituals so that no one else dies on her watch. Together the trio are more hardemed, darker and determined to dish out hell on voldemort and his army. Dumbledore doesnt like this. Nobody cares. Kingsley and mad eye become the leaders of the growing faction for aggressive and ruthless actions against the death eaters within the order. Mcgonagall secretly supports them and trains the trio. Harry convinces lupin to go to the werevolves and fights for them after hermione draws up a bill for werewolf rights for after the war. Weasleys call up their many weasley amd prewitt relations in different ministeries around the world and ask them for help.

Together everyone brings hell on earth for voldemort and the death eaters. In the end it was not even a battle. The light won without a single causalty.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

***** Ive read that fic. I think what i described is very very close to what happens in that fic with respect to the reactions of the survivors. Just that in the fic ron dies, in here ginny dies.

In general i dont like to kilk of any of the trio. They are too important to the plot. Side characters like ginny who are not as important can be killed off to inspire the protagonists to get their act together and destroy the evil. Those are the kind of stories i enjoy but they are very less in number. Unfortunately.

** Not exactly what you asked for but they all get defeated and captured by the Death Eaters in this fanfic. Twist ending though.
