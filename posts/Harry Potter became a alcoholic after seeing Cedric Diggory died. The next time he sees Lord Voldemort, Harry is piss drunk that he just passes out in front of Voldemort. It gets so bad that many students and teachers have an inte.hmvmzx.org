** Hermione sniffed the emptied mug. "This is Madame Rosmerta's brew. It doesn't actually contain any alcohol. Harry, how are you even getting drunk off this?!"

"I think that was our fault," said one of the Weasley twins, looking guilty for once. "It's a gag Transfiguration we came up with based on a famous Muggle book. A bloke there was turning water into beer."

"It was wine, George, not beer," the other twin corrected.

"Anyway, we thought you could use it for spiking the punch."

"That's another thing the Muggles do, right?"

"We didn't think Harry would use it this way."

"Water insho wine... I'm the Chozhen One, dammit!"

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.
