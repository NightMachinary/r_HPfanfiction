Book eventually becomes book for potions class. I believe the book was written under a pseudonym which is why Nobody knew the author.

I could be mistaken.

Unfortunately I can't remember anything else.


** Not sure if this is what you're looking for: Crumbling Pedestal

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1922112/1/Crumbling-Pedestal]]

It's an HP/SS slash, and Harry time travels to the founders era. He changes his name to Heru Slytherin, and when he comes back he writes a series of potions books under that name. He sends them to Hogwarts for consideration, but I don't remember if they were actually used.

*** Unfortunately that wasn't it. Good suggestion btw I already have that one faved

Harry may have had an affinity for potions due in part to his relatives treatment.

If you have any ideas later on please tell me.

For you and anybody else I have a gift.

Not sure if you care or not.

For every suggestion I give an upvote
