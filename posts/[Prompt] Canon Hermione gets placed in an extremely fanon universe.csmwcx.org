Where she's treated as the next Dumbledore, despite using her canon achievements, or treated as a traitor, despite having had her canon loyalty.

I recently read a fic where the author had Mrs. Weasley make out that 10 OWLs were unheard of, despite two of her son's achieving 12. I've also read fics that make canon Hermione try to frame Hermione as a traitor for her canon actions.

So this is just a canon Hermione dropped in those universes.


** Hermione stared into the mirror, one hand on her cheek. It was a startling thing, to wake up in a home that had been burned to the ground years ago, only to learn that the war that cost so much had only barely begun.

There was still time. Time to save them all.

So many things to do, but still she could not get over her appearance. Her left hand ran itself through her hair, which was both exactly as she remembered it and fundamentally different in a way she could not describe. Of course, she could describe it, that was the problem. Saying it out loud would make it real. And the whole thing was so ridiculous, even in the magical world, that she could only guess what the reaction would be.

Ginny Weasley leaned against the door frame, watching Hermione's examination of her own face. She cleared her throat, causing the older witch to whip around, wand in hand. Ginny raised her hands, as if in surrender, smiling at her friend.

"You okay, Hermione?" she asked.

Hermione frowned. "I think so."

An eyebrow raised on the redhead. "What's wrong?" Ginny could see the indecision on Hermione's face, and then the moment when the decision was made.

Hermione focused her brown eyes on Ginny. "Have I always been white?"

Quick, low effort response, first thing I thought of. If you define CC as canon, this works, barely.

*** He said canon Hermione in a fanfic universe, not fanon Hermione in the canon universe.

*** I thoroughly enjoyed that.

I may dislike how the narrative in the books treated Hermione, but she's miles superior to the movie and fanfiction versions.
