I'm looking for something written somewhat like hogwarts rift. Any suggestions?


** Can you be more specific? Is "Hogwarts Rift" a story? Do you have a link?

*** Sorry about that, it was late last night, and I wasn't thinking. It's a story on harrypotterfanfiction.com, link: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=116462]]

It's a really incredible story, and I'm looking for something written like it, not necessarily with the same general idea.

** I don't have recs myself, but people are always recommending novel-length gen fics here. Start with [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/19lg2h/so_im_about_to_give_up_on_fanfic/][this thread]] and go on.
