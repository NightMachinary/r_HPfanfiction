*** Depends Est wraps up very well, but there is an unfinished semi-sequel that appears to be discontinued. Don't be tempted by the sequel, it's frustrating.

**** I like the sequel for a good laugh, but it doesn't tie in very well with Delenda Est. Very disappointing follow-up.

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.
