** u/Lamenardo:
#+begin_quote
  Magical Vows: I'm honestly going to remove this completely. It's just way too convenient. What's to stop Sirius from making a magical vow for his innocence? Or Harry during his trial? Or so many other things? I hate them.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  Lily groaned. "I told you! I made a magical vow that you were the only man I've ever slept with! So ---"
#+end_quote

Ok, first up: I dislike in these stories how Lily is supposedly so baby desperate that she married at 18, and despite fighting a war full time, was so impatient to conceive, that she starts testing secretly for fertility within the year. Instead of, you know, talking about it with her husband. She's fighting a war, full time. Actively fighting battles. And she wants a baby so bad she essentially cheats on her husband. Even if she didn't sleep with someone else, she's still bearing a child that isn't his and making him think it is. And even when he's justifiably curious about the child's looks, she gaslights him and manipulates him into dropping it.

Secondly, violet eyes themselves are a cliche. What's wrong with green eyes? They're stunning enough.

Thirdly, I don't believe any kid would get away with speaking to adults like that. Especially in front of ministry officials, and visiting schools. Especially not the sex comments.

**** Ah, I suspect the eyes came from Delenda Est. I too thought violet eyes were a Black thing. As long as different coloured eyes are a normal witch thing, and not because she was magically conceived via a ritual.

I just think they'd assign detentions at least. Going on as she does should have her in non-stop detentions. I would expect Snape to do more than threaten her with a potion, only after weeks of harassment. There are ways a teacher can make a students life misery without detentions even - look at Lockhart's classes. If Moody can leave Draco a ferret, I can't believe McGonagall or Snape would not Silencio her for a class if she couldn't shut up.

****** Nice. To make it clear, I do like your story and I'm following it. And I actually don't mind violet eyes - since Hooch has yellow eyes, it could be a 'normal' thing for witches and wizards to have more than the standard colours for eyes. It's just usually whenever I see the protagonist have special eyes, it's usually because they're secretly part Creature, or something really specially and mystical, like fallen angel or super OP, non canon vampires, or Basilisk cursed.

#+begin_quote
  Iris Potter, the Girl-Who-Lived, gets thrown into the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Seeing the signs of a storm on the horizon, she sets herself on a new path. Featuring the beginning to a morally grey and powerful fem!Harry, a new take on Ancient Runes, animagus transformations, five mostly unique tasks, and a good amount of humor. No bashing. First of a multi-part series.

** The introductory disclaimer sounds pretty convincing. Of course it would be the best if:

#+begin_quote
  I might incorporate some kind of magical exhaustion (probably not)
#+end_quote

Was actually "absolutely not", but let's hope for the best.
