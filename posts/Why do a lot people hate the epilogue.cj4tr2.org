When I first read the epilogue ~10 years ago I really liked it. It shows that after everything they went through, Harry and his friends get to have their happy ending. After I went back to the fandom last year, I'm surprised that a lot of people seems to hate the epilogue. After rereading it again, there are some aspect that I don't really like, such as the infamous Albus Severus, how Malfoy is handled, and Ron obliviating a muggle. However, I despite everything still like the epilogue.

Sure, JKR can choose some other scene for the epilogue. An example that comes to mind is a Christmas Dinner on the Burrow a few years after the war, or maybe a scene of Hogwarts sorting in a distant future. I simply don't understand why some people hate the King's Cross epilogue that we have so much.

Some arguments that I've seen is that it's unrealistic that 'all is well' only 19 years after the war, but I don't think a simple scene of sending their kids to Hogwarts really shows the situation of wizarding world; maybe there's still a political struggle between the muggleborn and the pureblood, maybe the werewolfs are still being discriminated, maybe there's still some Neo Death Eater movements. It's just very unlikely for the adults to discuss the problem of wizarding world on a fairly happy occasion of sending their kids to Hogwarts.

Let's ignore the pairing in this discussion, since I'm pretty sure most people don't like the epilogue simply because of Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione ends up canon. Let's just imagine that everyone ends up with your favourite pairing. just keep the scene where our main character is saying farewell to their kids.

For the sake of our sanity, let's ignore Cursed Child and other information JKR released after the book came out. (e.g. I don't know that Hermione is minister of magic, Harry is an Auror, or Ron is working with George)

*** We simply have a quite different taste then. I personally like the simple and bland epilogue. Everything that happened after the final acts is open to our interpretation. It will make an interesting discussion within fans of the series and keep the fandom alive.

The 'kid story satisfying' is simply the problem JKR struggles within the last 3 books, we can't call Harry Potter YA, yet calling it a child story is not right either. My first introduction to the series is a children book, so I simply call everything a children book so I don't overthink everything. I don't want to drown in many theories about Manipulative!Dumbledore or how the worldbuilding is broken.

What do you think will make an interesting epilogue? I just realized that the epilogue is so /muggle./ JKR could still make a bland happy kid story epilogue with a more magical setting. Maybe a shopping trip to Diagon Alley or a moment in the Potter Household when Harry's child receive their Hogwarts letter.

  the problem with endings is that I'm not sure they can ever be enough.

You know, this make me wonder if people simply hate the epilogue simply because it is the ending of Harry Potter. It symbolizes that the series finally end, and that we won't have any other adventure of Harry and his friends. How the epilogue ends in a peaceful tone also emphasized that Harry's adventure is over.

Of course after CC, Fantastic Beasts, and other money grab release we know that's not the issue.

And we hate them because they're not Harry's adventure but Albus' and Newt's.

Huh, I've gone meta too far.

** I think you've hit on the most of them, "Albus Severus" seriously cringed me into another dimension. But I think a lot of it came from the growing up of the Harry Potter audience along with the tone shifts in the series. The first couple books were fairy tale affairs when the hero saves the thing and wins the day, then in the middle we went into a more YA/teen style. People at that age are usually looking for less traditional storytellings and endings. Then in the last book, after the muggleborn concentration camps and all the deaths, JKR basically wrote "everybody who was still alive lived happily ever after", which seemed like an abrupt turn from the last 3 or 4 books. Maybe some people view that as a nice completion of the circle, but for me it felt too neat and clean compared to what we had been involved with.

** The only thing about the epilogue I liked was that it took place at the train station. It is a nice call back to two important moments in the series - Harry entering the Wizarding world properly in PS, and the scene with dead Dumbledore in DH. To have Harry return to that place to send his children along the way is pretty cool. Also cool is that iirc Rowling came up with the whole thing on a train station so that makes it a little bit more interesting.

Otherwise though the epilogue is a big pile of nothing. I don't dislike it but it is very unsatisfying. Nothing happens. There is a sense of wish fulfillment in terms of the author but also in terms of the characters. If all is indeed well then Harry wouldn't be an author, would he?

I dislike the association of Snape and Slytherin with bravery in the epilogue. But Rowling shits on slytherin all the time. Its the same with the sometimes we sort too soon line.

*** What would you think will make a satisfying epilogue?

I think that if something did happen in the epilogue it only left us wondering what will happened next, but we can't satisfy that curiosity because there won't be any stories left. However, as I said on another comment, I don't mind a big pile of nothing. In fact, lately prefer fanfiction with a big pile of nothing on it, only some fluffy missing moments from the books or some fluffy Potter family moments.

**** I would have rather had nothing at all.

Maybe I should read the epilogue by itself and not at the end of deathly hallows because one can see the epilogue as a harmless bit of fluff.

Would enjoy reading some fluffy Potter family moments.

** I think you summarized it nicely. Personally I've always been sort of numb to it, after Harmony was rendered impossible a book or so prior to the epilogue, everything else about it slid right off my back so to say. The most it got out of me was a chuckle after reading the words "Albus Severus" put together.

One thing I will mention is that I take issue with James Sirius' name. "Sirius" I get, but freaking "James" again? Like dude, how many boys in your family will have to be named James? And if this one is the last (for a while at least), are you going to name your first granddaughter "Lily" to even things out? I mean, tons of cool people died too that you could honor, though I guess "Fred Sirius" doesn't roll off the tongue too nicely, but neither does the name of your other dumb child so whatever.

** Very honestly its like everyone getting settled with kids. I dont doubt at least some would have kids eventually but i doubt all would or that having to handle babies so soon after everything would make them happy.

But mostly how many kids they had wasnt what I cared about. I cared about them not the kids i didnt know. So i would have wanted to see what their lives were like now. What jobs did they have? Where did they live ? That sort of thing.

Seeing Harry teach his best subject ( defense) and knowing he was able to do it for years because killing Voldy broke the curse would have personally really happy even if they showed nothing about who he ended up with.

** I'm not a Ginny/Harry fan or a Hermione/Ron fan. I find it absurd that Harry would name one of his sons after two people who went out of their way to make his life miserable. I also didn't like the casual way in which Ron's muggle baiting was treated.

** Harry had no interest in becoming /anything/ for the Ministry, much less an Auror or Head Auror. His 'career counseling' interview was answered in a way to spite Umbridge, at a time when Harry could see little beyond his own angst and his inevitable fight with Voldemort. If he had to fight a Dark Lord, he might as well be getting paid for it, right? Like the Aurors do? And with his only experiences with the Ministry being his farce of a trial and the cruel bumblings of its incompetent Minister, there's no way he'd be anywhere near that whole organization.

Sure, some other shit happens before/after/in-other-places-in-the-books, but Harry as an Auror seems to have been taken directly from that one conversation, which is emphatically /not/ a good scene to get into Harry's own personal ambitions and desires.

edit: my entire view may be slightly tinted with Fanon.

** I'm of the very unpopular opinion that I loved the epilogue. I can clearly remember reading the last book, and getting to the final pre epilogue page, and thinking "if there isn't anything after this I'm going to start crying."

I connect very heavily to characters of things I read or watch, and become very invested in their happiness, so when there's an abrupt cut off with no sense of closure, or when the closure is tinged with 'oh yeah the world has still gone to shit and nothing was really solved though,' it's murder on me, emotionally. I have actually spent a significant amount of time full on sobbing at the ending to la la land, and get (probably) irrationally angry when someone dies as a shock death near the end of a story in a way that could have been completely avoided.

Because I'm so invested in the characters, all I want is for them to be happy and have a happy ending, not some 'bittersweet realistic' bs. Harry Potter more or less delivered exactly that in the epilogue, so my only issue with it is the whole ASP thing.
