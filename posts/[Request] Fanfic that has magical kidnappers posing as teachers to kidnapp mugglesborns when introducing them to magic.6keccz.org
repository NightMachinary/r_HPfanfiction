imagine when a random person comes up to your house and tells you of the world of magic. Then takes you somewhere in deep London to a dusty old bar. I'd think that's a perfect plot for a kidnapping.

Edit: not kidnapping in the sense "rescuing from muggles" but true kidnapping/slave trade


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]] -- Muggleborns are taken from their familes at an early age, have their memories erased and told their parents abused them. linkffn(11773877)

Because why bother posing as teachers? Maybe to get in the door quietly (except you can just apparate in disillusioned and/or at night), but after that just kidnap the kid and obliviate the parents (and modify photographs, destroy other evidence, etc.). Or just kill the parents, they're just muggles and dead people can't have their memories recovered.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

*** posing as teachers is more as a way to get the location of the muggleborn student, as I doubt the addresses or list of muggleborns is publicly available

**** I would think posing as teachers to get the addresses from Hogwarts or the Ministry would be more difficult - those are not muggle parents who don't know anything about magic, but wizards and witches who are familiar with the teachers of Hogwarts. Much easier to bribe someone, or sneak into a Ministry Office and get the adresses.

(You can also find muggleborns by checking on magic done in muggle areas.)

** In linkffn(Reign of the Serpent) muggleborns are kidnapped as soon as they show any sign of magic. But it's regular old kidnapping, breaking into the house etc.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.
