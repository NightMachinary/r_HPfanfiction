Well, I fell down the rabbit hole of another fem!Harry story -- linkffn(13197260) -- and I absolutely /loved/ the author's interpretation of Draco and how he deals with crushes.

So, as the title says, I want the best Draco/fem!Harry fanfics you all have to offer. Bonus points if Pansy does not get a redemption arc, because I am definitely /not/ a fan of her.

  Some may consider him useless, but Ludo Bagman has been absolutely inspired by muggle sports channels. As a result, a camera charm has been created. It is ready to catch all the action of the Triwizard Tournament and broadcast it into every home over Wizarding Europe. Now Harriet is on the big screen, and the crowd is going to see a lot more than they bargained for. FEM/Harry.

*** Have you read Ellory yet? [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11575984/1/Of-Caresses-and-Constellations][Of Caresses and Constellations]] is the only Fem!Harry/Draco story in their collection but their works are some of my absolute favourites in this community; I've read every single one of them about six times. I'm not even exaggerating.
