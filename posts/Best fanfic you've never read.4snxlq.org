**** I found the first one to be extremely trying. I didn't like Alex, I didn't like any of her friends, and EVERY adukt was a useless asshole who spent effort to make Alex's life even more difficult. It drove me up a walI. I mostly finished it in a huff of righteous protest. "Fine, I'll read it so I can be absolutely certain how terrible this is and warn people to NEVER read this fic".

I love, love, love the others. Love them. They're perfect and tragic and heartwarming and clever. I mourn the fact that book five is stalled. Even given my struggles with the first book, I'd rank Alex quick as the second or third best fic I've ever read.

Just a (passionate) perspective.

*** I'd agree with most of these, I somehow made it halfway though Methods of Rationality before I dropped it, never really got into Prince of the Dark Kingdom and haven't even read Emperor. It took me three tries before I finished Wastelands, it had some great moments but the parts of the fic between those moments weren't that engaging for me.

The only reason I made it through Renegade Cause was because I was on a trip with no Internet and nothing else to do in the down time. It took me over 200k words to finally get into it, I ended up really liking the second half but because of the first part I have a hard time actually recommending it to people.

** The only Sara's Girl fic I've read is /Turn/, which is one of my favorites. Yet to read the rest, but I'm looking forward to them!

I've yet to read linkffn(Wand and Shield), which is probably because I'm not all that interested in Avengers. Will make some time to read it in the future; I like the author's other crossover fic /The Wizard From Earth/.

linkffn(The Life and Times). Started it a couple of years back and couldn't get past the first chapter. I plan to give it a fair shake sometime in the future, but it is so fucking long.

/Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation/ is supposed to be well written and great, but evidently the author bashes Ron and Molly, which is a dealbreaker right off the bat. Fuck that.

I also haven't read linkffn(Vox Corporis by MissAnnThropic). I've taken it out like half a dozen times, but then I read the summary, which has to be the least interesting summary of all time. And then I read the author's note, which says that the story is based on movie "cannon" instead of book canon. And lastly, the thought of reading a 350k word H/Hr romance fic written in 2006 is like the least compelling thing ever.

Harry eventually has a romantic relationship with Draco later in the series.

It is a behemoth of a series with over 3 million words written in total. But don't read it for the slash. The first kiss between Harry and Draco happened over 500k words into the series!

All seven stories are in the author's profile on ff.net and the first one is called Saving Connor.

*** Don't let the slash hold you back because, at least though the 5th book, there isn't much of it in the story.

I've read through the first five stories of the series and I don't think Harry/Draco share their first kiss until the fourth story in the series and there are only chaste touches between them (arms, shoulders). By the end of the 5th book, there is still only kissing and minimal touching (the reason for this is in the plot). Most of their relationship in the early series is friend-like, with them being highly protective of one another.

Also, the relationship is not by any means the focus of the story as the author has so much (too much) going on in the stories plotwise.

  COMPLETE. AU to HBP and DH. Snape and his apprentices form a bond which may never be broken, not even in death. And at the end of it, Severus Snape is able to perform a spell that he has never been able to do before. Ok, it's not a million words. I tried.

*** It's definitely long as fuck, but it is rather unique. You don't have to worry about encountering any of the fandom's infamous tropes; there aren't any. The fic has other faults (I'm not fond of the ending of the second book in particular), but it is definitely worth a read, especially if you like mystery stories.

I'd say you should give it a go; you needn't read the entire trilogy if you don't like the first book.

***** Since it's so popular a lot of ideas and inspiration was taken from it and used in later time travel fics by others. I haven't reread it in years but I remember the writing itself being at least decent, the plot is likely going to be nothing new for you though.

Most of them have my notes and tags so you can sort and I also have rec'd any that I liked. My all time favorite fics have a tag too - you've probably read a lot of them but look through those first.

*** I have copies of Telanu's collected Snarry I can send you. I have mixed feelings about The Tea Series, mostly because it turns into a different fic about halfway through (going by memory, because I read it 10 yeas ago). But Telanu is a very good writer. The shorter pieces are lovely little tidbits, although a couple are quite melancholy.

If you have an email address you're comfortable giving out, I'm happy to share.

You could tell me it's the best story ever written but if it's slash or Harry with basically any other girl I'm not going to be that interested.

If you like Marauders era, this is good. There's some set-up, but it is very good. The length does get exhausting, admittedly, but that should not stop you.
