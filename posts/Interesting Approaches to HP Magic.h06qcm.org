I loved the Circle of Magic series by Tamora Pierce and I've always thought it would be so cool if Hermione's big bushy hair could store magic like Tris' could, or there was thread magic that meant Madame Malkin could be a badass fighter just using fabric. Basically, are there any fics that really focus on the possibilities of magic in HP in really unique, well-thoughtout ways?


** Linkffn(circle of magic)

Linkao3(circle of magic)

Edit: oh damn I thought that was a fanfic, damn I'm stupid
