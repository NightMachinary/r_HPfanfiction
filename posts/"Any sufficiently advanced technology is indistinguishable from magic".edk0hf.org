I'm looking for any fics that play with muggles somehow running into the magical world through their technological advancements.

For those who don't know, the quote is Futurist Clarke's Third Law.

â€‹

It would be something like "Muggle scientists invest invest teleportation but they find the field crowded because they run into the floo network" or "Muggle Scientists trying to create dinosaurs from fossilized DNA get a dragon instead".

You could either have this result in muggles discovering the magical world, or maybe the Oblivorators get dispatched because they detected magic but it turns out to be a big science experiment.... (and then maybe muggles investigate why everyone at a university seems to have lost the memories of the past year).

I don't think I've run into any of these.

BONUS: I have read a couple of fics that do a take on the contrapositive, "Any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from science!". These usually involve a person discovering the magical world and then applying SCIENCE! to figure it out. Yes I know MoR does this. It also has super-11 year olds. I'd be interested in any others people have (besides MoR), I'd take that too :P.

That is scary by itself. Any kind of experiment near that would be behind heavy-duty security with lots of notes and whatnot taken down. If all of a sudden they forget, but have all of these notes/journals/security videos? That would raise a storm by itself.

*** Hahaha, just picturing a wizard lazily waving his wand about in a lab. "Accio Notes" then getting crushed by several tons of servers flying at him.

**** I think they'd have enough experience to know that might bring heavy objects.\\
Imagine them just conjuring a wall of fire or something equally destructive then boredly shouting "Accio evidence" and waiting for everything to be nicely melted and/or burned.

*** A similar concept to this is explored in linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach), except with a commercial recording instead of a science experiment.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** The Arithmancer and sequels give applying-science-to-magic a go. Hermione becomes rather Sue-ish in the second book, but I find it's still a decent read if you mostly ignore her as a character, and instead treat her as a plot device.

Also, the third book has >! the magical world anticipating that ubiquitous cameras and immediate online publishing will eventually out them beyond their ability to undo, so they plan to bring down the masquerade!<, which is on point.
