Most of the good ones I find are abandoned, unfortunately. I really liked The Last Lion of House Reyne, A New World to Conquer and The Black Prince.

Does anyone know of a good HP/GoT fanfiction which is either finished or not abandoned?

No slash, pls

  Tywin Lannister was disappointed in the legacy that he had left, his first son was a glorified bodyguard, his third was a whoremonger and drunkard. His second son, he had the smarts of Jaehaerys the Wise, the strength of Gregor Clegane, but also had the cunning of a Lannister. His son's name would be remembered, Tytos II Lannister.

  Being reborn after my embarrassing fall at Godric's Hollow as the Potter brat was an interesting experience. Getting sorted into Hufflepuff, even more so.

  What if, that night in Godric's Hollow, Sirius Black had trusted his instincts, and apparated away with Harry to a safe place. What if, instead of chasing after Pettigrew, he had taken him to Black Manor, the safest place he knew in the world other than Hogwarts. What if, Harry grew up as a Black instead of a Potter, with all the love and purebloodedness that came with the title.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of dead things. He is the second son of the king, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might. Very Abandoned

** I'm hoping that The Brightest Sun isn't abandoned, but I'm probably SOL. 'For Myself' updated recently, but I don't really remember what's going on in that fic or how good (or not) it was.

  Elia Martell expected to die in King's Landing, but through some force found herself in the home of a war-weary Harry Potter. She just wants to return to Westeros; wants to see her family, wants the sandy dunes of Dorne and the peace of the Water Gardens. Aegon and Rhaenys are all she has, and for their sake she might have to reclaim a throne that nearly cost them everything.Harry Potter had died in his war and returned to a Wizarding World hell-bent on remaining in the throes of war-time politics. He was tired of Magical Britain, tired of fighting a useless war, but he has a son to care for and no force on earth would stop him from doing so.Raising three kids is hard, raising two of them to eventually rule a kingdom even harder, especially when you're trying to find a way to Westeros.

  Harry always knew that his luck might not be the best. But to be sent to another world so Death could have more entertainment from his life? He might as well use this chance for new life and live it by his rules. It is my work from another site. Someone recommended posting it here, so there you go.Warning: English is my 2nd Language and while I try to keep my work at the highest level I can, I will make errors. Sorry.

** Uhh, there was one where Elia Martell as well as her two kids get whisked away to Harrys doorstep moments before their gruesome deaths in canon. I don't remember the name but it was on Ao3 and fairly popular so it shouldn't be that hard to find Edit: Ah, nvm, just saw that The Brightest Sun (the name of the fic) has already been linked, my bad

  This world has no need for her, offers no destined paths and fated battles, for it is not hers to save. [Was never meant to be saved.] But Harry --- Harry, whose father was brave enough to face Voldemort head on, whose mother was brilliant enough to outsmart him, Harry, who has Lannister blood running through her veins and magic purring under her skin --- Harry will reshape it all the same.Elyanna Baratheon is born with the breathtaking, terrifying might that is a life free of a prophecy's shackles. Luckily, she's got twisted family drama, an ill-timed reawakening of the Magic of Old and the powder keg that calls itself the political climate of Westeros to keep her occupied.
