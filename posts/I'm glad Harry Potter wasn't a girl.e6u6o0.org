I'm really glad Harry wasn't a girl cuz if he were I'm 100% the Dursleys would be way meaner especially if she was in her period. Dudley would probably hide her pads and stuff just to be mean. Vernon would probably hide her feminine products as punishment. Imagine her having to tell Petunia that her 1st period started. Imagine them not getting her feminine products for a while and making fun of her/getting mad/hitting her for bleeding on stuff


** I mean, it is possible to start menstruating that young, but the average age is around 12, so she would have likely been at Hogwarts or with the Weasleys and had alternate sources of adult women to go to for help.

*** Yes, it's most likely she was malnourished, so it will take longer to start menstruating.

**** Still the small chamce that it does occur when at the Dursley's it would be a horrible experience. I am just glas that this is the reason the Dursley's would be extra bad and not something even worse but this would still make you want to murder the shits.

***** Yes it would be horrible. But in a developed country like UK, I expect there would be a class on these things in school.

** From NZ myself. We briedly looked at sex ed at the end of primary school mostly looking at what's what and that's when I was eleven. A female Harry would not get a lot of education on it before Hogwarts and I assume that it doesn't matter how many times a teacher tells you what's happening is normal and what to do that if the people you live with call you a freak for it and verbally abuse you for it thigs would be pretty tough. I bet the most commom advice given to young girls is that A) its completely normal amd happens to all girls and B) if you have any questions or worries to talk to an adult about it such as your mother or elder sibling. For a female Harry she wouldn't have anyone to talk to and being told by the Dursley's it's not normal would have an effect on her.
