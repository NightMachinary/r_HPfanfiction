#+TITLE: Promt: Ron (post book 7) comes down with a disease incurable by St. Mungos. Unappreciated by his wife, Hermione, he starts an illegal potions business and evades the suspicions of his brother in law, Harry Potter. That’s right. Ron Weasley is Heisenberg. Breaking Bad/Harry Potter crossover.

** Ron wants to provide for his wife Hermione, and his child Rose (or whatever her name was) so develops some crazy meth-like potion to pay for his cancer bills. Harry, an Auror, is investigating this case, but constantly refuses that his best friend will resort to this. Someone make this I don't have the writing ability

** Hear me out:

It almost makes more sense for Hermione to be Heisenberg. The names are similar, she has a muggle background, she has the intelligence, Ron has a canonical (though not to the levels of fanon) basis for neglecting Hermione's emotions, etc. Plus, she has that "hidden ruthlessness" that Walter White ended up having.

*** There's enough Hermione-centric fics. Ron can have this one. And one can argue that Hermione is just as bad at understanding Ron's emotions. She'll diagnose how people are feeling and then that's it. Like a monotone doctor giving you a checkup. Let's not forget the "I'm tall" conversation in the 6th book.

***** Seriously. Every time there's a cool prompt or possible storyline involving Ron someone has to say "Yeah that's cool but what if Hermione did it instead?" FFS go read a super!Hermione fic and let Ron fans have something, goddamnnit!

****** I'd have made this same suggestion if the OP had talked about Harry being Walter White, and I'm far more interested in Harry-centric stories than I am Hermione-centric.

I don't dislike Ron and I didn't make my suggestion because "Hermione is better." I made it because the story makes more sense with Hermione was the lead in my opinion and, to be completely honest, would likely be more interesting.

**** Almost all so-called Hermione-centric fics are romances in which she has no personality. Fics in which she actually does the sort of stuff that makes her an interesting character in canon are few and far between.

******* Sure, but the point of this prompt was for Ron to be featured in something interesting. There might be a lot of Hermione-centric fics where she "has no personality" but there are far more Hermione-centric writers than Ron-centric ones, which means there's more variety for Hermione.
