hi all.

i've been writing a teddy/victoire adventure fic with werewolves and dark magic and evil fortresses, but the fic is predicated on the fact that teddy and victoire had a bad breakup prior to the start of the story.

i do eventually want them to reconcile, but does that mean that they have to reconcile romantically? can they be friends and will that be satisfying fpr readers? i've written three endings!

looking for feedback from readers about this. thanks so much.


** That's totally up to you. How do YOU see them reconciling? As a writer, you need to really believe in what you're writing so it will come across as authentic. If you really want them to reconcile romantically, but you think readers want them to stay friends, then any attempt by you to write what you /think/ readers want will just ring false.

It's your story--write what you want to see. You're just inviting readers along for the ride.

**** Right? Hardly anyone in my real life knows I write fan fiction, so I know where you're coming from. I'm much more comfortable with Internet strangers. Good luck to you!

*** it's definitely a /big/ part of the story, and maybe the biggest part. the general idea was that the adventure (save the world, etc.) would bring them back together, but as i've written the story and the characters, i like the idea of victoire and teddy growing up and growing out of their childhood love. BUT IT MAKES ME SAD TO DO THAT.

***** I think that this is mostly due to the time constraints of fiction. Usually you have years between "loves" but it is really hard to convey that in writing because the main plot will be long resolved by then. Also, according to the commonly accepted theory of Checkov, you ought to only include things essential to the plot and "relationships which didn't work out" just doesn't fit in there. If the readers get invested into a pairing only for it to turn out insignificant, they will be pissed, especially since it is difficult to write a "good" ending of a relationship without turning the first love interest into a villain.

****** i totally hear what you're saying, and in some ways, i agree. i do wonder if you think that ending on a meaningful return to friendship or even some ambiguity is "insignficant" though. thoughts?

******* It really depends. I am not familiar with your works nor with the main plot so take everything I say with a grain of salt. If you start with an offscreen break-up and it is merely backstory, then I really don't care about it. But if you have some on-screen romance or a lot of focus on their mutual feelings, then there ought to be some payoff.

I am not a traditional romance writer/reader. I despise the "but will they end up together" type of stories. It makes a poor plot in my opinion because those stories tend to be riddled with unnecessary drama and angst. I prefer the "they get together and have to face some kind of problem together" because reading about a couple taking on everything from magical Nazis to an evil witch with daddy issues is a lot more than interesting than the stories where the reader can tell the outcome by page and age 5. You have to ask yourself what kind of story you are writing and which part romance ought to play. Then you have to pick whatever suits your plot and vision the best.
