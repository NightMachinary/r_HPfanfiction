I was wondering about Neville's interaction with the Sorting Hat. Maybe it went something like this?

/When Neville Longbottom was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The Hat took a long time to decide with Neville.../

Hat - Ahh, a Longbottom, haven't seen one in a while, your mother and father had the spark of a great witch and wizard

Neville - Yeah, that's what everyone says...

H - But where to put you?

N - Umm, Gryffindor??

H - Hmmmm, are you sure? Hufflepuff might be a better fit.

N - Uhh my Gran was really hoping I'd...

H - But what do /you/ want? In Hufflepuff, you would find happiness, friends and belonging, and out from your father's shadow, you could forge your own path.

N - And in Gryffindor?

H - In Gryffindor, it will be harder for you. But you have that same spark in you that I saw in your parents, and in Gryffindor that spark will be fanned into a flame. But, it will be hard, it will go against your nature.

N - Ok... So which one?

H - Which one do you want?

N - G... Gryffindor...?

H - Say it like a Gryffindor

N/H - *GRYFFINDOR!!!*


** I love the idea of exploring the conversation the sorting hat had with the students.

With Neville, I always saw it the other way. Neville knows his family history, but doesn't feel like he deserves to be a part of it. He was afraid of being a squib not too long ago, so he doesn't think he should be placed into his parents' old house, to follow in their footsteps, so to speak.

The hat can see the underlying truth. Neville contains the strength of character and the seeds of true courage that can make him a Gryffindor legend, but the hat has to convince Neville of that.

And of course, what the hat tells Neville in the end, is that the decision isn't based on family legacy or someone else's expectations, but on Neville and who he is and what he wants.

*** It's interesting to see people's different perspectives on the Sorting. Personally, I feel sorting isn't based on a person's attributes, but what they value instead. This is how we get Hermione in Gryffindor; she's smart and bookish, but she values standing up for what's right and being brave and that's what the hat makes its decision on.

Neville doesn't start out with your typical Gryffindor traits, but living up to his family's expectations and making his Gran happy means more to him than is own comfort, he chooses them over himself, values what they want more than anything else even though it's crushing trying to live up to his parents legacy. I thought it important that he make the choice to be in Gryffindor "it's our choices, Harry, that show us what we are, far more than our abilities". Sorting is an important crossroads, I think Neville would be different if he had gone into another house. No right or wrong here, just my rambling thoughts on the matter :)

** I liked the depiction of Neville's sorting in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/7/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Perfectly-Reasonable-Explanation][Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation]] - though with the opposite result to yours.

  From the moment the Hat went onto Neville's head, even without being able to hear any details, it was clear from his expression that he and the Hat were embroiled in a contentious debate. A minute passed, then two...three...four... The average volume level of the House tables gradually increased as speculation about what was going on spread. One of the older Ravenclaws further down the table declared knowledgably that he'd read in a book called Hats Off that this was called a 'hat-stall', and was very rare. Hermione would've immediately demanded to know where he'd found that book, but McGonagall had begun to aim particularly stern looks at the louder patches of conversation, so she waited.

  In the end, Neville folded his arms stubbornly, and as his face began to grow pale and a trifle blue, it was clear he was actually holding his breath, a tactic Hermione had heard children occasionally used but had never witnessed until now. Disapproval was warring with concern on Professor McGonagall's face, but she glanced at the Head Table and the Headmaster gave her a tiny shrug, his genial expression unchanged since the Sorting Ceremony had begun. Neville started to sway, and when it seemed he was about to actually pass out, the Hat relented, with a shout of "HUFFLEPUFF!" The boy released his held breath explosively, then took several great gulps of air, though he half fell off the stool in the process.
