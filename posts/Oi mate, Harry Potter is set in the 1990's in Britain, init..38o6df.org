As such, people don't say 'I could care less', or have Iphones, or make references to movies/music/books/games that came out in the new millennium. Get your continuity checked, mate.


** One of these days, I want to read a Harry Potter fanfic structured like a '90s sitcom. Like /Saved by the Bell/ or the /Fresh Prince of Bel-Air/ but with magic.

Kidding aside, though, I have read fics which do have '90s references in them, though, but they've always been jarring. I remember in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3951749/24/Harry-Potter-and-the-Quantum-Leap][one story]] Harry gets /Time Crisis/ for the Playstation, which somewhat ruined the immersion.

The good thing about the Harry Potter series is that it is primarily set in the wizarding world, which is deliberately anachronistic- it can resemble anything from Victorian England to medieval feudalism depending on the situation or author. Fanfics which introduce Iphones and so on are deliberately ignoring the timelessness of the series.

** Phrasing doesn't bother me at all unless it's way out of the time of the fic. Even then I could handle it by assuming that the wizarding and muggle worlds don't mix much and the wizards have come up with something first or never stopped using a certain phrase.

But when an author start whipping out iPhones, other technological advances, or blatantly wrong cultural references I'm bumped right out of a fic for a few moments. I recently read one where Harry took Ginny to a movie that didn't come out for several years beyond where they were in time. It bothered me so much I had to check IMDB to make sure and then substitute in a different, more appropriate movie any time they mentioned it.

If you were to write fiction set in ancient Rome, I wouldn't expect character to speak Latin (though if it were, as someone who studied Latin in high school, I'd be MIGHTY impressed with your fluency, especially since it should be set in vuglar Latin instead of the more often studied Classical) but I would certainly expect to find language befitting the world. Seeing "my 'brows are on fleek today!" or "OMG let's take a selfie" in your fic would have me running for the hills, much like they would if they showed up in a fic set in 1996 in a magical castle somewhere in Scotland.

If you mean suddenly switching to latin halfway through a paragraph, then no. It's probably better to just keep everything in the same language.

If you're using things that are obviously recent, like 'you only live once' or 'Oh Em Gee' or whatever else is popular at the moment, it breaks the disbelief because Harry and his friends don't talk like today's teenagers.

On the other hand, I agree if you overdo it with 90s British slang and expressions, it becomes difficult to read even if it's accurate. There's some stories I'm like, kay you can tone down the slang and phonetically-spelled accent and make that easier for the reader to follow.
