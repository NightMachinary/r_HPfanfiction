I'm looking for stories focused on the characters, not Harry wins the day with buxom arm candy.

Preferably light on the angst and without making Harry ridiculously overpowered or whitewashing the Death Eaters/Snape/Malfoy. No Hermione bashing, no harems.


** linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerspw; The Pureblood Princess; The Lies that Bind; The Merging; Trapped in a Broomcloset; Cage and Key)

EDIT: Forgot to give my opinions on them.

The Legacy is imo the best contract trope there is. The only one that even comes close, and that's a strech, for me, is Contractual Invalidation. The romance part is so slow burn, that they only start to interact and actually become friends halfway in. Harry may seem a bit OP, but you can clearly see he struggles sometimes when outnumbered.

TPP by TE7 is a really fun fic, somewhat cute, but with a horrible ending, not because its sad or anything, but because its really bad, though it closes the circle OK. I liked till the last 2 chapters.

The Lies that Bind is phenomenal. But there's a bit of angst. Sorry.

The Merging has Harry with a ramp-up to OP, but not that much, and there's drawbacks later on. Its Harry/Tracey.

Trapped is cute, 0 angst, and still being updated, and I love the author, she's really nice and takes time to anwser reviews (at least mine she responds.) and has a few other Harry/Daph with different set-ups.

Cage and Key is really sweet but unfortunately its abandoned. There's enough words to enjoy it though.

  A book left by Sirius opens Harry's eyes as he delves into the mysteries of magic, learns about the realities of a war, and shifts towards the Grey. Meanwhile, Daphne Greengrass is faced with an unusual solution that involves the Boy-Who-Lived, but could be more trouble than it's worth. And in the end, there is always a price to be paid for everything. HP/DG Contract, 6-7th year

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. But this is nothing to what awaits him in the future. A future that he will do anything to protect.

  It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways. Harry is prepared to do anything to protect those he still has left, even use the Dark Arts extensively if he has to. The question is; will he be the same person in the end as events, and a shadowy figure risk to change him? And how does the eccentric Daphne Greengrass fit in? Sixth year. HP/DG

Its a Harry-centric story but Hermione has a romance in it.

***** The only Slytherins I could see her paired with is Andromeda Tonks after the war, the younger Carrow twins (or anyone of equal background existence), or MAYBE Bellatrix Lestrange (the only competent Death Eater) if she forsakes Voldemort and joins Harry's side BEFORE the DoM battle (and is actually useful, unlike Snape). I've yet to find anything matching either of those criteria.

Mostly, I just don't see Hermione working out with any Weasley.

****** The only ones you can see her with are not in her generation, and generally on the other side??

I mean pretty much any named Slytherin +- 3 years who didn't take part in the Inquisition squad would be ages better for that match. Hell, give any of them a hidden book hobby (this is done with Dalphe a bit), instant connection.

Course I find the tendency to pair Hermione cross generation creepy. Sure, a few 'tossed in the past' can be fun, and who doesn't like the occasional "All you zombies" (and magic is great to explore those), but the sheer number of Snape/Hermione and Sirius/Hermione is downright disturbing.

******* The Carrow Twins are the year above or below (Hestia and Fiora, not the Death Eater ones), so certainly her generation.

Her own year is pretty much out because no one stood up against Malfoy and his goons or did something distinguishable. Lily Moon, maybe Daphne (although she was friends with Pansy).
