Hya, so... I'm trying to start writing my own fics but I must be a bit lacking in the motivation/inspiration department lately.

I suppose writing is a bit like juggling with plot, character/world building, style and editing but, in truth, I find it hard to learn to do everything at once.

I've never written anything of any size in the past and I'm really struggling to get going. I just get stuck refining the same 800 words and not knowing how to advance the plot, until I just drop the thing and loose all interest in it.

Coincidentally, I can't count the number of times I've wanted to rewrite some part of an appallingly written fic because I really thought there was something great in there.

​

So, to get to the point, if you are an author who has some interesting abandoned fic posted somewhere and up for full adoption (full rewrite ok, not just continuation), or a reader who knows of such, please hit me with your recs.

If I find a fiction that inspires me, I think this could be a great exercise to really get me going. I think the main appeal of such a project would be not having any pressure to find a good plot and just being able to focus on leveling up my writing and getting some feedback on it. Huh, writing is hard.

​


** You won't want to hear this, but I'm afraid you won't find it any easier than writing your own fic. If you are struggling with self motivation and self discipline, well, welcome to the club. You seem to be looking for a shortcut but there isn't one. It's hard work, it's frequently tedious and it takes a long time and considerable commitment. And we all start from the same place.

If you want to rewrite something that you think is badly written, just do it. You'll have to keep it to yourself, but the practice will be invaluable. Also writing detailed critiques of others' work is amazingly useful.

*** Yeah I think this is the best advice. A lot of fanfiction out here serves as a "rewrite" of JK Rowling's story and it's no easier to do that then to come up with a completely original book idea

**** I'm not entirely convinced this is a valid argument. My point would be that JKR's story is actually already a "professional grade" great story. All you can do with it in the best case scenario is make it different and still good (with infinitely many ways to make it worse on so many levels).

What I'm talking about here is rewriting a fiction with some good ideas and abysmal to okay execution. I think it's a completely different exercise.

***** I think it may be subjective, I find a lot of faults with JK Rowling's writing mostly now as an adult rather than as a child when I first read it

****** Well I can't argue with that. You can find flaws in any story (especially on the more plot-oriented aspects), but let's say JKR tend to be a little more subject to those among the very well renown authors out there... still, on a purely technical point of view the writing is up there... and even for the rest we're mostly talking about plot or world-building discrepancies. I mean we're talking JKR levels of bad not Fifty shades of Grey levels of bad... and what level of bad do most fanfiction tend to be ? ^^

​

Just sayin', I would be honored if anyone ever told me my writing was as bad as JKR's...

*** Oh, on the contrary, I'm entirely willing to hear this, I've even thought it to myself in the past. I've got a somewhat lengthy personal critic of The Changeling, by annerb sitting somewhere...this case is nice because, to me, it is one of the best poorly written great fanfics out there.

It's during my attempt to review that fic that I found myself drawn to the rewriting of short excerpts to try to illustrate my points.

The truth is, maybe I am looking for a short-cut because I find it hard to put down and develop the ideas I have for stories into words directly. I suppose I don't trust my writing enough, and I am kind of exigent with myself (I don't really see the point of half-assing stuff, even if I'm doing them for fun).

Just rewriting stuff for myself is what I'll probably end-up doing, but feedback is always nice and, as I am not a native english speaker, I don't have any friends who really are competent or interested in the English language...

So I guess my point is: if I'm going to rewrite something, I might as well rewrite something I can post and maybe continue on my own (to ease into the process), and have a chance to get feedback on it, no ?

Still, I just posted this on the off-chance that someone knew of a good fic I could have fun with... you never know if you don't ask, right?

** PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE ask esama if you can pick up any of their work! Even if not, read them because they are awesome and may give you ideas or just entertainment.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1358209][Master of Death]] - "Harry takes another option in the King's Cross Station, and changes the course of a world" Decides to raise Voldie's soul fragment in an AU time line.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9488711][Twist and Turn]] - HP inserted into Fantastic Beasts "Graves isn't Grindelwald's first unwilling guest. Who else has better cause to summon a Master of Death than the man who wants to take his place?"

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1141722][Safeguard]] - HP/Avengers crossover where Harry is a techno wizard trying to keep Jarvis out of the magical internet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5366507][Spellist]] - HP/Avengers crossover one shot "The new reality had no wizards or magical nations -- but it had a whole boatload of powerful and occasionally inept sorcerers. Who were usually semi-public and sometimes very popular in social media. How it worked, Harry had no idea."

There's a ton more - the Vampire D crossovers are really good.

*** As far as I can tell at first glance, only Master of Death seems to be definitely unfinished and abandoned. At any rate, I don't seem to remember ever reading any of their fic so thanks for the recs.

They don't seem to have put anything up for adoption but I could always try a mp...

**** The other person's advice (booksandpot) is spot on. However, if you are looking for ideas... I like their work because they tend to avoid common tropes and have good pacing.

If you want some advice based on my experience, I started writing fan fiction with a short (20k) story and daily (short 500 word minimum) updates before going back after the story was completed and merging chapters. That way, I didn't feel overwhelmed but got the feedback that kept me motivated.

***** That is actually a great tip, I had never thought of that... I guess it's really easy to get obsessed with chapter length and want to get that sweet 3k-7k range that all the cool kids are talking about. I guess it's especially a bummer for me because I tend to write different scenes and never succeeding in connecting them, so I never get a full long chapter I'm happy about and then I just abandon because I never get to the payoff of posting something.

​

I'm definitely gonna meditate on that, thanks a lot!
