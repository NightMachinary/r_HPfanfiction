:END:
Adult Harry travels back in time and ends up raising Tom Riddle. Someone from the Black family ends up obsessed with him and steals his hairs for a Polyjuice potion. He goes to the whore house and has sex with a prostitute polyjuiced as Harry. The first time he does it Black ends up admiring 'Harry's' scars and is curious how he got them when to his knowledge he doesn't do anything dangerous for a living.

#+begin_quote
  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

**** Arcturus Black uses transfiguration to make the male prostitute look like Harry in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453743][chapter 12]], and he thinks about using polyjuice the next time, but if that happens later on it isn't shown in the fic.
