Basically my plot is Harry's sent through a portal because whoops, they realized they may have banished the dementors to a place with sentient life and that's sort of unethical. He ends up in RWBY-verse. Are the hunters/huntresses able to see dementors or not? Maybe, maybe ones with certain semblance can, or maybe no one but Harry can. What's your opinions/preferences on this?


** That depends on whether it would work in the story.

*** Basically this. I think the question is outside of canon of both sources enough that either answer would be fine. When that is the case, the question should shift to be, "which option leads to the story I want to tell."

** The answer is yes for me, depending on the type of semblance unlocked.

Take for example Pyrrha's magnetic abilities. Said abilities would require a degree of interaction with Pyrrha's senses/brain to all Nikos to manipulate magnetic fields.

Dementors are basically that cold they freeze any location they find themselves in. Plants are covered by frost, water turns to ice, the works. This means that any conductive materials become more conductive in their presence-as in, they allow electricity to pass through with less impediment. There's also the question as to how a dementor floats, which may include a magnetic element to it as well. In short, whilst not necessarily being able to see dementors with her eyes, Pyrrha may well be able to 'see' a dementor through her magnetic senses-as in, she could see magnetic fields being distorted by the dementor or even see the magnetic fields the dementor is using or interacting with to float.

Nora's semblance may work as well if she can 'see' electricity passing through things such as a human body. Assuming that dementors actually possess something similar or identical to a nervous system to start with, Nora could potentially see the electrochemical reactions the dementor's body is generating.

In general, though, aura is touted as the manifestation of the soul in that universe. Souls are a dementor's food source, a delicious snack to them. It may very well be that a dementor can attack and suck out a huntsman's soul faster than they can be reasonably expected to react given that their soul is projected /outside their body/, within easy reach of a dementor's clutches.

It doesn't help that that bug-thingy Cinder used on Autumn also seems to partially replicate the effects of a dementor either, which could lead to people making the wrong assumption about what killed this or that hunter.

If a dementor /is/ visible to anyone with an unlocked aura though, the implications are pretty heady. Can a dementor be seen without having to activate your aura, thereby making you vulnerable in the first place? Can a dementor be fought with Dust ammo at all? Would using a semblance cause the same reactions amongst dementors as a patronus would? Hell, what if I'm entirely wrong and using Aura pretty much /is/ casting a patronus on oneself?

I can't wait to see where you go with this.

** Yes, but only because it would feel weird if hunters couldn't see them.

I don't like the compromise of only certain semblances, besides the obvious thermokinetic and empathetic semblances detecting the general area they're in.

And whatever you do, make sure it makes sense.

*** Why would it be weird? They're not magicals, after all. Muggles can't see them.

**** Why /aren't/ they magical? Let's drop a hunter onto HP!Earth.

They can obviously break (muggle) reality with aura and their semblance. They'll probably run afoul of the Statute of Secrecy quickly. Even if they can't do wizardry, they /do/ break reality, like every other magical being. Hunters can also awaken the aura of muggles, because muggles have souls. ^{Proof: Dementor's Kiss} Wizards would probably classify them as a new species. Sort of like vampires, able to convert others to their species, I guess?

As to the argument aura isn't magical on Remnant: Obviously not, a whole section of science hasn't been hidden by wizards trying to be secretive. Everyone on Remnant has no reason to believe it's separate from physics/science. And the only things they /do/ call magic are rare, powerful, and have reason to be protected.

And it's weird because both are kinda equivalent: a small part of the population being able to do things the larger part can't.

**** They basically are magical. Their magic just works in different ways and isn't called magic in-universe. In the Harry Potter universe, I have no doubt people would consider them some sort of magical creature.

** I would say yes, but not fully, like they see a large shadow, and a heavy outline. Probably how Squibs see Dementors.

*** Squibs /can't/ see Dementors.

I found this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/35bcff/squibs_and_wizards_a_continuum_or_a_dichotomy/cr3e6p6/][second-hand Word of God]] for you.

Specifically, "Arabella Figg never saw the Dementors that attacked Harry and Dudley, but she had enough magical knowledge to identify correctly the sensations they created in the alleyway."

** Honestly, I would say yes. Having them unable to see dementors would just be kind of silly imo. I would also go as far as to say aura gives them magic-resistance as well.
