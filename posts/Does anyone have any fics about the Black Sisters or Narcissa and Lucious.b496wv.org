  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** So not what you are asking for. But I often get my Black sisters fix from watching YouTube music videos.

Also there's some Harry Potter ASMR videos out there. I don't think anyone's done any of the black sisters. I feel comfortable saying this is some objectively good Lucius Malfoy ASMR. Highly recommend.

Slow burn Narcissa/Lucius but it's quite worth the read. It goes all the way from Narcissa right before she enters Hogwarts all the way to when the Dark Lord is first defeated. I really, highly adored this and there's even a sequel of sorts, although it focuses on Draco after the Second War. It is Draco/Luna which is a pairing I never thought about but it's written so masterfully and Lucius and Narcissa are mentioned a lot as well. The sequel's really a nice take on the post war time, with how now everyone hates the Malfoys/other former Death Eaters and how Draco is also traumatised from the war and feeling conflicted towards his family bc he loves his mom but isn't quite able to forgive his father. I could not recommend this enough. Features a quiet/cold Narcissa who's still ruthless and cunning and loving and the backbone of the Malfoy family and an ambitious Lucius.

linkffn(5614038)

Series of oneshots featuring the Black sisters, when they're young, when they're at Hogwarts, when they're married, etc. Really shows a nice dynamic between the Black sisters and also has their pairings as well (Lucius/Narcissa, Andromeda/Ted, Bellatrix/Rodolphus I guess haha).

linkffn(5341591)

Also another series of oneshots featuring the Black sisters but it's still such a fun read that I'd recommend reading both series. They each have their own charm â™¥

linkffn(6162671)

AU where Lucius is married but his wife dies shortly after Draco's birth. Narcissa becomes Draco's caretaker. Really a fun read although it's not finished. Narcissa is young and charming and gorgeous (and does she know it!) and Lucius is a cold, intimidating, grumpy bastard and it's done so well! Really all of this author's work is just amazing!

A while (a year?) ago, I went through all the stories marked Narcissa/Lucius on ffn and ao3 and read most of them (as long as they didn't include an abusive Lucius which I just don't find believable or incest haha). These are some of the best ones I can recall rn.

If you tell me what kind of characters you like, I could be more specific too! Because there are charming/outgoing/cunning Narcissa's and then there are silent and yet powerful and independent Narcissa's and there are powerful/charismatic/ambitious Lucius's, and then there are reserved yet charismatic Lucius's.

#+begin_quote
  Formerly titled "Sisters Forever." Individual pieces, ranging from 100 to 6,000 words, on the lives of the Black sisters, and how one man's rise to power, and the resulting wars, tore them apart. Can be read as a sequential story or as a series of one-shots. Rated T for mild language and references.
