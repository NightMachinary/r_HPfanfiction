:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok, I'm looking for this one fic I read awhile ago and I can't think of the title. In it, Harry has already gone through the whole saving people thing and being master of death and stuff for a very long time to the point he's disillusioned with the world. But then he gets transported back in time and his consciousness gets put in toddler him right after Voldie gets zapped by his own curse. So Harry now has to live his entire childhood over again but his mind is still that of the cold adult master of death Harry. This time around he decides to do things differently. There is an incident where he's talking to a snake in his aunt and uncles yard and notices, I think Lucius, trying to spy on him. So he decides to have a little fun. He makes it to where it's very visible that he can talk to the snake and then shoots a wandless killing curse at a mouse to give the snake a treat. Now Lucius, and the rest of the deathmunchers, are convinced that he's Voldemort possessing Harry. And he runs with it. In the fic I think it's revealed that Dudley is actually a magical child but he was suppressing his magic because he noticed Harry getting punished for his magic and is scared his parents will do the same to him. I think this fic was made long before obscurials were a thing so the only thing that did to Dudley was give him weight problems and a stunted magical core. Does this sound familiar to anyone?

***** Believe that is simply the character bracket implying that they are the main characters of that fic. I very much doubt that Harry would get with Lucius for a few reasons; A, he has watched his friends and family die over a long period of time and probably saw Lucius murder a few of them and; B, Lucius is married. Although the author might have gone a redemption arc for Lucius where Narcissa is the main reason behind Lucius committing those crimes and murders and joining the DE and Harry helps him get a divorce then they end up together.

******** isn't this story time travel too according to op? Kinda weird still, but it sounds like Harry is and adult, and Lucius thinks he's Voldemort(and therefore and adult in a child's body, which makes it weird but not as weird as it could be). Haven't read it, so don't know what age Harry's body is when the pairing happens anyway.
