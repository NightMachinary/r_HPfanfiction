** I can't believe I never thought about this before but in the past I often reject fics if I don't like the name of the main character, e.g., Jasmine for Fem!Harry. Now I realize I can just use an extension to replace the name I dislike for something else or download the Epub and edit it since I believe that format is essentially HTML (I use "ebook-edit" which is part of calibre). Now I have to go back and find those fics I rejected again -_-

  When Naruto died at the hands of a civilian during his academy days, so did the Kyuubi no Kitsune. Now here the Kyuubi was, reincarnated, and bouncing around in an eleven year old girl's body, while half the wizarding world treated her like the second coming of Merlin (whoever that was)... and the rest didn't know what to make of her...[HP/Naruto fic utilising dubious canon elements. You have been warned!]

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)
