I'm searching for the stories that are focused on a government agency, or anything bigger than single digits operation (like small, 1-2 person detective agency), that tries to uncover the mystery they stumbled upon but don't realize its Wizarding World. A good example is the cops from "Harry Potter and the Natural 20", their methods to bypass obliviators etc.

Not entirely what you are looking for, but a funny one-shot nonetheless. Dumbledore vs Inland Revenue.
