I recently finished the Never-Ending Road linkffn(The Never-Ending Road), which is a girl!Harry fic where her friendship with Hermione is one of the most compelling female friendships I've ever seen in a written work.

Are there any other fics that feature a strong female friendship? Preferably a fic looking at the friendship evolving over time. Any characters, any pairing.


** Dirgewithoutmusic has some great female-centric fics. In linkao3(7900501) Parvati and Lavender become good friends with Harry as well as Hermione.

  Peeves, though he was nasty about everything else--ickle firsties and orphan girls--got it immediately. For all six years of Harry's Hogwarts tenure, he dropped water balloons on the heads of anyone who misgendered her. Professor Binns never quite figured it out, but he didn't know any student's name. Nearly Headless Nick gallantly and somewhat awkwardly called her lady and tried to hold open doors for her, despite the fact that he couldn't open them. Snape called Harry "Mr. Potter" for all seven years that he was in Harry's life. Around year three, Ron stopped counting the detentions he got for his increasingly sarcastic responses to this.

** Linkffn(Yule ball panic by philosophize) and the sequels are femharry/Hermione fic that'll fit the bill. I find the whole thing a little preachy, and there's a lot of telling-over-showing, but it focuses a lot on Jasmine and Hermione's relationship, their friendship with the delicious, feminism and women's magic in general. It's not quite finished, but the author updates every week and is almost done.

I also can't leave without posting linkffn(Weasley girl by hyaroo). The friendship between fem!Ron and Hermione is great.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** Well, the best fic that I could think of was /Faith and Understanding./ Sadly, it has been taken down, but it was wonderful, chronicling the friendship of Ginny and Luna.

Ginny and Luna meet on the Hogwarts Express. Luna's reading /The Quibbler/ and mentions that above all else, she values honesty. They study together and sit next to each other in class. Ginny sticks up for Luna when she's bullied. Luna spends time at the Burrow one summer. They drive each other crazy. Ginny actually coins the term "Loony" but turns it around and uses it as an affectionate nickname.

And the tone...it just worked. Ginny and Luna train for Dumbledore's Army together in one scene, and then sprawl barefoot in the grass to watch the clouds.

To mention a fic that is still intact, /A Night Without Stars/ is fairly solid.

There's also /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection./ Luna's point-of-view of Order of the Phoenix. Considering it was written before Half-Blood Prince was even published, it holds up very well. While it's Luna-centric, her friendship with Ginny is an important sub-plot, the idea of friendship itself is foreign to Luna.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. OotP - DH will continue in a separate installment. Future Snape/Harriet.
