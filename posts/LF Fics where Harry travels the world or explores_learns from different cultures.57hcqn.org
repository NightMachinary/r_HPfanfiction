  What happens when you sacrifice the good of one for the good of the pack? Derek decides the sacrifice is necessary but Stiles is out for blood with or without the pack. Nobody expected Stiles to take it so far, or for him to shun the pack for their lack of action. Underestimated one too many times Stiles decides it's best to take matters in his own hands now that he has nothing to lose and is determined to succeed. EDITED AND UPDATED.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
