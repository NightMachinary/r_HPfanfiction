I understand why he'd be upset when he thinks its Harry trying to pull something over on him (such as stealing Snape's personal potions ingredients) and I know he hates Harry in particular. But he just seems really "rule-obsessed" in general. Which to me, is really weird for a Slytherin. I know Snape likes being in control and so that may take precedence over anything else. But you'd think he'd be more of the /"If I don't catch you, then its fine"/ or /"better not to cheat than to cheat clumsily"/ types. AKA if you're clever enough to game the system, then you /deserve/ to game the system. If you're GOOD at cheating, then go for it! But if you suck at not getting caught, prepare to lose hard! All's fair in love and war!

But he truly seems offended anytime someone succeeds over him or over anything else, even if its unrelated to him.

On this issue, Snape reminds me so much of Hermione or some overzealous Ravenclaw in his obsession with following the rules. But when you see how he broke the "rules" entirely inside his 6th year Potions textbook, it doesn't make any sense. If some new young genius started breaking potion brewing "rules" in his Potions class, would Snape care? Would he ignore the kid? See him/her as a potential future rival/threat that must be crushed early? We know he favors his Slytherins, but I can never figure out if he does that just as some kind of revenge against Gryffindors (the marauders) or to curry favor with Deatheater parents or both. We never get to see him interacting with Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw, so while I doubt he's ever "nice", we don't know how much of his vitriol is saved specifically for Harry and Gryffindor. With Hufflepuff being all about hard work and Ravenclaw usually being studious, you would think those houses he would get along with better than showboating Gryffindors.

*I guess if you took the four house professors and asked which one is probably the most relaxed about rules, I would expect it to be the Slytherin professor, just because their policy is all about not letting rules or anything else get in the way of goals.*

Also, as a Slytherclaw myself, I've always been pissed off by the way Slytherin is always portrayed in the books. Instead of a house of brilliance, cleverness, and pragmatism, it seems like a house established only on your "blood status" and not your intelligence/cleverness/ability-to-win, along with a Head of House who openly favors you and makes it ridiculously easy to cheat or win. I'd say Snape actually does his Slytherins a disfavor by making things so easy and favorable for them. But once again, everything is seen through Harry's eyes and we don't know /why/ Slytherin had won the House Cup for seven years straight. Was that all due to Snape's rampant favoritism or because a bunch of talented Slytherins were winning lots of points from /all/ their classes? /(I'm assuming the other professors are competent and can keep most cheating at bay.)/\\
The other part that irritates me is it seems like Slytherin house teaches you to ALWAYS "cheat" your way to success, which is really bad, long-term policy if you are truly ambitious and want to succeed long-term. /Dumb cheating/ only helps you win in the short-term. If you cheat on every test, then when you actually need that knowledge in a real-world situation, you are totally fucked because you never bothered to learn it in the first place! It's one thing to ignore rules that are stupid to begin with and being pragmatic about your methods, but then there's /stupid/ levels of cheating that are neither clever nor pragmatic. You're just taking the "fast track" to a very shallow and short-term goal, which will bite in you in the ass when the long-term goal arrives. How do Slytherins ever become "great" and powerful wizards if all they do is cheat their way thru life?

It makes no sense at all for:\\
1. /Dumb/ cheating (instead of pragmatism) to be so prevalent and encouraged in Slytherin because of long-term ambition.\\
2. Blood status to be soooo important and leaned upon at every opportunity instead of talent/ambition/intelligence/ability-to-win.

But this may all be because of the patented JKR Harry vision filter, with all of its hardcore vision problems.


** Snape cares about rules because of the marauders. They got away with "pranks" their entire time at Hogwarts and we're even lauded for it. I'm not quite sure it's actually rules but more getting one over on the marauders.

** There's one one-shot (which I can't seem to locate, darn it) which has Snape explain that the reason he coddles and favors the Slytherins is so that once they get out into the Wizarding World proper, they'll be unable to deal with the requirements for becoming things like Healers and Aurors, thus keeping them out of places where they could do direct damage. Instead, the vast majority of Slytherins end up in dead-end jobs due to pure nepotism.

He referred to it as his revenge on everything Voldie promoted...

** Setting aside the fact that Rowling wrote Slytherin house as the cheating-evil-bully house (or that's how Harry viewed it, if you prefer) which is a bit unfortunate since there is so much potential to have fun with the house if you play with its advertised attributes instead of its demonstrated ones, I think the main answer to your discussion is that Snape doesn't care about the rules at all /except where he can use them to get his way/.

It is established in canon that Snape is a petty, bitter man. I won't go in to the whole debate about how good a person he is since that isn't really relevant here, but those two characteristics are well defined. I believe that Snape merely used the rules to get Harry (and his friends) into as much trouble as he could, whenever he could.

I think the clearest example of this is book 4, in the hex fest between Harry and Draco. Snape sees the damage to Hermione and Goyle and decides to ignore Hermione's injury, while sending Goyle on to the hospital. He then proceeds to let Draco off the hook, while docking Harry and Ron 50 points each, and assigning them each a week's detention. Now admittedly, they were both shouting at him since he had just dismissed Hermione's with a cruel "I see no difference", but the point stands that he uses the rules to hurt those he dislikes, not to uphold the rules or standards of Hogwarts.

The fascist thugs have to come from somewhere, and the houses of chivalry, fair-play and intelligence are not nearly as well suited for that than the house of cunning and ambition. You obviously have outliners like Pettigrew, and you can make a case that loyalty to a bad cause can turn Hufflepuffs into good underlings, but Slytherin is far more obvious. And the ambition to purge a race based on a social-Darwinistic belief pretty much excludes you from three of the four houses, so the children brainwashed into believing this (eg Malfoy) are unlikely to end up anywhere but Slytherin.

**** I would say voldemort was a slytherin so in universe it became his recruiting ground

His followers where slytherins and there kids went to slytherin where they recruited other students and so on

if voldemort was in another house you might have the same stuff its all about how you frame it

if voldemort was a griff, it would be framed as the noble griff doors fighting to take back the world from the corrupt goverment who favours mudbloods

** There's a saying: “For my friends, anything. For my enemies, the rules.” I think, as other folks have mentioned, Snape is not such a stickler for rules because he genuinely cares about them, but because he can use them as a weapon on people he dislikes (like Harry). So the saying holds...except that Slytherins also seem to have very few actual friends in Harry Potter (I think the only genuine Slytherin friendship we see is Snape and Lily, and we all saw what a dumpster fire that turned into), so it's more like “For me, anything. For my allies, anything that won't get me in trouble and will indebt them to me. For my enemies, the rules.”

He is offended when people get things over on the rules only when, as you point out, they get one over on him as a result, or (and this is important) it's people he doesn't like/hates who are getting away with it. But he is quite happy to overlook things for Draco and his other Slytherins. He also has no problem with Dumbledore bending the rules for him (except insofar as he doesn't really like Dumbledore much and doesn't like feeling indebted to him).

** It only looks like he's a stickler for rules because he uses those rules to get Harry into trouble. That's it.

He doesn't care about rules or laws - he's a bloody Death Eater. Rules and laws lost their sanctity long ago in Snape's twisted world.
