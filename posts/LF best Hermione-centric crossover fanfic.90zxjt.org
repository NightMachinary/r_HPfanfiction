I think I read past through all Sherlock x Hermione fics. I've been scouring avengers crossovers tol. I find it hard to find another one that is well-written. I have read some of crossovers with SPN. As long as there's good plot and decently written, and mostly Avengers, SPN, Twilight and Sherlock related I'm up for it. I'm fine with Fantastic Beasts but I'm still not convinced that that's a crossover, just different gen. No Ron/Hermione pairings tho please. Thanks!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12888333/1/Champions-of-the-Two-Worlds][Champions of the Two Worlds]], linkffn(12888333), is a crossover with Warcraft and has Hermione as a main character. She, Harry, Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Neville all ended up in Azeroth and were trained by their respective hosts. Hermione became a Warlock, summoned demons, and was hilariously dark. Of course, others would have their moments too.

**** For reference, they're the kind of mad scientist that boost a rat population's IQ to genius levels, give them schematics on how to build raygun-level mad science tech and release them into the streets of Moscow in the name of research.

  When Arthas seized the Frozen Throne, he cast aside both his humanity and the remnants of Ner'zhul. The Guardian sealed away the spirit of the former Lich King in another world, entrusting them to Albus Dumbledore. Now, however, Ner'zhul has ensnared a new host: Lord Voldemort. With two worlds threatened, heroes are brought to Azeroth to cast down both Lich Kings once and for all.

  Harry was never the only person with a penchant for tripping into the most absurd of situations. Reincarnated!Hermione. Somewhat darker than the usual take on Naruto. Political machinations. Character progression. Strong friendship, no romance.
