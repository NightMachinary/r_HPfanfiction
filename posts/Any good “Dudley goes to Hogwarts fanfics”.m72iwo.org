  Harry Potter spent his eleventh birthday in a cabin on a tiny rock in the middle of the sea, listening to his cousin snore on the couch.When a knock sounded on the wind-swept, rain-drenched door, it was not a giant fist (or a half-giant's fist). It was a short sharp rap that sounded once, twice, three times before Minerva McGonagall simply charmed the lock open and stepped inside. "Apologies," Minerva said crisply, as Vernon raced out brandishing his rifle and Petunia pulled Dudley up off the couch and behind her. "I wasn't sure you could hear me over the weather.” The rain fell down behind the professor in a roar. She was perfectly dry.Minerva fished in her pocket without looking, because the only things allowed in her pockets were only ever exactly what she needed. “I've come to deliver this," she said, pulling out a letter and handing it to Harry, who was cross-legged on the floor, "because our owl post seems to have been unable to get through.”“And I've come to deliver this," she added, pulling out a second letter, "because Hogwarts by-laws require a professor to hand-deliver acceptance letters to Muggleborn families for their explanation and comfort."

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

  Ever since Petunia and Vernon Dursley found their nephew suffering from hypothermia on their doorstep, they have been raising young Harry Potter as their own to spite the idiots who left a baby out overnight in late autumn. As such, Harry Potter has grown up loved and supported, changing not only his own life, but the lives of those around him. None of Harry's magical accidents or Petunia and Vernon's previous experience in the magical world could have prepared them for the arrival of a relative that Harry never knew he had - or the discovery that the wizard who left Harry to die has been quietly stealing Harry's inheritance behind the scenes and squandering Harry's chances at a good life.Fortunately for Harry, his family is more than happy to support him, and his newly-arrived second uncle is hell-bent on correcting everything that one Mr Albus Dumbledore has done to screw Harry over.

  Suppose the Marauders torture hadn't driven Snape to Voldemort and he had been the better man. What would the future have looked like? Warning: may now contain DH spoilers.
