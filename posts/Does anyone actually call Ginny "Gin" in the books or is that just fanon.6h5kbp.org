Of all the nicknames for characters, I feel like this one was actually canon, but I don't have the time or energy to check.


** Harry stuck head in and conspicuously looked left, then right, the left again. Finding no foes, he proceeded to make contact with his target.

"Psst! Hey. Hey, Gin!"

Ginny looked up from the glass she was nursing in her lap and sloooowly turned her head until her scattered gaze found Harry. She shot him an incredulous look, then inspected her glass.

"No. Whiskey."

Disappointed, Harry withdrew, leaving Gin to her whiskey.

** Not that I could find. "Ginny" is already a nickname, so I suppose nobody saw any need to shorten it further.

** I think Harry used that as her nickname after they got married, and he says it in Cursed Child (from what I can remember of it). And since Rowling "considers" Cursed Child canon, then I guess it technically is canon and not fanon.

** The only reference to "gin" I can find is that Mrs Cole drinks a lot of it.

** No. The only "gin" mentioned in my electronic edition is the kind you drink.

** So we get canon from Harry's point of view, and he never calls her Gin, we see enough other Weasley-to-Ginny interactions in canon to know that they don't call her Gin, same with Hermione... the only time I'm okay with it is if it's a pet name used by either Corner or Dean, and just knowing Ginny's character it would probably greatly annoy her, or perhaps in an AU or post-Hogwarts story a significant other or even a friend or Harpies teammate has shortened her to Gin (I'm picturing a quiet reserved teammate of Ginny's who is also her roommate and has earned the right to call her Gin because she's a good friend that likely takes care of Ginny who has gone down the wrong path a few times in life).

But as others have answered, unless it's Cursed Child it's not a canon nickname

** Yes, but only if you consider Cursed Child to be canon.

** I hate "Gin" and "Mione".

It's NOT canon, and CC is NOT canon either.

** I don't mind Gin as a nickname for her as an adult because it does seem more grown up than Ginny. Ginny is a perfect nickname for bellowing into backyards with, it carries, but does seem more childish to me because of it.
