I gotta say, the movie robes are [[https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/15/50/980x652/gallery-1449847193-harry-potter-und-der-gefangene-von-askaban-emma-wa-20-rcm0x1920u.jpg?resize=980:*][really bad]].

I understand why the characters wear muggle clothing so often in the movies, because who would want to wear those fluttery tarps?

I always picture robes more like [[http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131112230959/elderscrolls/images/1/16/Mage_Robes_Male_1.jpg][this]] from The Elder Scrolls. I find that sort of thing much more magical than just large swathes of black cloth.

So, yeah, if you have any good fanart pages or other inspiration pics for how you think wizards dress, leave them here.

Thanks.


** I like [[http://thereisareaper.tumblr.com/post/132276464879/hogwarts-school-uniform#notes?ref_url=https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/harry-potter-hogwarts-robes-fan-theory/#_=_][this]] for Hogwarts robes in place of the "school uniform" look in the movie still, and the usual fanon charmed to change colour explanation.

In general (outside of Hogwarts) large voluminous sleeves in a much more apparent individual particular look. And of course we know dress robes, and can assume conservative and modern, and fudge has a semi-muggle look going etc. All with broad ranging differences.

** As much as I love the Elder Scrolls series, the college robes are too high fantasy for HP. Perhaps the standard mage robes?

*** True. I linked it as more of an example on how you can break up robes with belts and different ways to cut the fabric, rather than just one big piece.

maybe something like [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/87/f7/c4/87f7c4ff778e31d49f1778e480b25eb9.jpg][this]] fits better for HP

** There is actually a semi-famous British boarding school which wears almost exactly what I imagine robes to look like. Christ's Hospital students still wear the uniform as created in the Tudor period when the school was founded.

[[https://ta-images.condecdn.net/image/xJl2kO7P2ar/crop/1620/f/christs-hospital-1-tatler-3oct17.jpg][And this is what they look like.]] [[https://www.sussexlife.co.uk/polopoly_fs/1.3559965.1397556286!/image/1863895632.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1024/1863895632.jpg][Here's another shot.]] [[https://www.sussexlife.co.uk/polopoly_fs/1.3546356.1397230591!/image/3504805761.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_630/3504805761.jpg][And another.]]

Now what they're wearing is actually a coat and the slit up the front does open, however I imagine that it doesn't. I would further imagine that while there is a standard plain black robe, students from wealthier wizarding families will often have sets of robes in different weights for the seasons.

Dress robes may have a deeper neck cut for women, puffed or 'leg of mutton' sleeves, double sleeves as well as being made out of finer materials and with more intricate patterns on them.

**** Exactly.

And while they evidently can be worn over muggle clothes if necessary, it would make a lot of sense that (with a fully closed front) doing so would be uncomfortable for long periods leading to segregated changing, wizards mistaking nightgowns for robes and Snape having no trousers on underneath his robes.

They also seem to have reasonably deep pockets which are pretty invisible in terms of the line of the robe, which would explain where your wand goes if not 'in your bag'.

Plus, as much as I like the robes as drawn in the top post linked here the wide sleeves seem like a really bad idea given how cold Scotland can get. Cold wind under your robes is bad enough but cold wind right up your sleeves.

** I never had too much of a problem with the robes because they're not too far off to traditional academic gowns. My uni still uses gowns and aside from the colour they look pretty similar to the movie robes and they're actually surprisingly comfortable, warm and practical for Scotland. I know grown =/= robe but growing up they got blurred in my head when reading the books so I was always happy with them!

So the one on the left is the on they would wear to classes, one in the middle is the one they would switch to for dinner, and the last one would be for feasts and other formal events. Since the school was founded 1,000 years earlier, many of your nobles changed for dinner and such, so it made sense to me.

** I think I more or less agree with the convention in Fantastic Beasts that robes for adults are basically just tailored topcoats, and IIRC while the movie robes are inaccurate to the books (where the robes seem to be modeled after the long, flowing robes we traditionally associate with wizards), they do invoke a certain sort of nostalgia for people who went to private or boarding schools, and I really dig that. But maybe for a slightly gloomier Hogwarts, something along the lines [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bloodborne/images/3/39/Black_Church_Set_Bloodborne_concept_art.png/revision/latest?cb=20171212021838][Black Church Set]] from Bloodborne could fit, without the hats and adding house colors to the stole to lessen the obvious "this is a horror game" detailing. I realize it's far closer to priest's robes than wizard's robes, but I think it fits the austere look black Hogwarts robes would be going for.
