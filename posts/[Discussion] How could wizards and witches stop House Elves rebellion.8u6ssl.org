This question came to me after reading [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8tzxt6/houseelves_and_magical_slavery/][House-elves and magical slavery]] thread.

Let's imagine that House Elves got their freedom and some on them decided that Magical World must pay for all years of slavery and abuse and the only payment is death. Therefore they started House Elves Rebellion.

From the books we know that they don't use wands or spells to do their magic and their "apparation" can't be blocked (or Malfoy Manor had such protections).

How could wizards and witches handle such scenario? Are they doomed?


** By maintaining messy bedrooms. House-elf apparates in at night to assassinate you, sees the mess and gets distracted clearing it up.

That has potential, actually. When several violent incidents caused by freed elves prompts the Ministry to order them to be exterminated (or at least culled), a full-on rebellion in Magical Britain ensues.

Will the poor elves be cut down? Will they escape to another country? Will they rally and successfully depose the Ministry, installing an Elfengamot in its place?

Dobby handled Malfoy Sr. without any problems in CoS. Also he did manage to get the Trio our of the Malfoy Manor.

Apart from direct confrontation where's also assassination. Apparating into a house at night and leaving with with no one alive behind...

Thats because nobody bothered to defend themselves against house-elve apparition, not that its impossible for wizards to use defenses against them.

Wizards use Sneakoscopes, so they would be alert and able to confront the elves.

Wizards use wands and all had at least five year worth of formal magical education including combat magic, house-elves would not be able to overcome that advantage, especially while being badly outnumbered.

Incorrect. Malfoy both gets his wand out and the text directly says Malfoy realized he couldn't win despite having it (emphasis added):

#+begin_quote
  But Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm Harry Potter!”

  There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and /pulled out his wand/, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger. “You shall go now,” he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. “You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.”

  /Lucius Malfoy had no choice/. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.

******** What makes you think that Malfoy was interested in a fight, espescially one involving magic. He physically lunged at Harry because he was angry Harry took away his slave, but its unlikely that he would have done any significant damage, especially if he doesn't use magic.

He realized he had no choice because he had obviously no interest to duel dobby.

Because they obviously dont aim to include them, Hogwarts has over 100 house-elves why would they restrict their mobility.

Because Riddles followers had more experience with combat magic, while house-elves have literally none.

Hm, remember how elves can even get through Voldemort's defenses? If he didn't block them (if they can even be blocked) then no random wizard is going to know how to do it. Short of a Fidelius, the average wizard is going to be offed in their sleep if the aim is to kill wizards.

I am not, I am saying its no feat that can be used to talk about general fighting ability of wizards compared to house-elves.

Remember how the Hermione literally mentions that Voldemort wouldn't even consider house-elves as something he had to install defenses against.

We have no reason to assume that its a matter of ability, its literally about nobody having a reason to block house-elves. In a open rebellion of course wizards would use defenses that include them.

#+begin_quote

The average wizards is going to have a Sneakoscope at home to inform them of intruders so they wouldn't be asleep.

What I'm saying is that it shows wizards are not the obvious victory here. Malfoy either didn't think he could win (how the text presents it) or he didn't think he could win fast.

#+begin_quote
  Remember how the Hermione literally mentions that Voldemort wouldn't even consider house-elves as something he had to install defenses against.

And if Voldemort isn't why would any random wizard? More to the point, there's no suggestion wizards even know how to do it.

But Voldemort did have a reason, he intended for Kreacher to die there.

When have we ever seen the average wizard with a Sneakoscope? We haven't.

3. Congratulate self by having house elves make you a birthday cake

** Depends. Are the House Elves committed to winning? Well then it's very hard. They have powerful wandless magic and can steal wands. Any dwelling that isn't warded with, say, a Fidelius (or otherwise extensive defenses like Number 12 pre-OoTP) can be Apparated into by elves; even in DH Dobby could get into Malfoy Manor. Most powerful pureblood families will already be put out without having elves waiting on them hand and foot, whereas elves already take care of themselves.

Elves have never seemed to have an issue Apparating, no mention of splinching, so mobility seems to be in their favor in general since according to Arthur many or most adult wizards don't bother with Apparition. This allows for some fun, messy business such as intentionally splinching wizards combatants. Good luck casting with your arms left behind.

That's the worst case scenario anyway, assuming the elves have the will to do so (because otherwise calling it a rebellion would be a bit silly).

** House elves do not stand a chance. There is really no reason to suspect that you can't stop house elves apparating. If you couldn't people would be using house elves that way. If they were stronger than wizards magically people would be using them to attack others.

You could for instance have Kreacher just pop into the ministery or her home and pop out with Umbridge.

The only case of a house elf beating a wizard and doing any entering a home is Dobby. Dobby has been the Malfoy elf that is probably why he could enter the property without problem. He knew how the wards work.

Lucius was surprised by the attack of Dobby and than realised that he should not be attacking people in Dumbledores school.

This explanation fits far better into the books.
