** Manipulative Dumbledore: People noticed how ridiculous the Dursleys having Harry dumped on their doorstep was. Then we were told Dumbledore knew ahead of time it'd be a shit hole. Then we get to Hogwarts where, in the very first book, Ron speculates that Dumbledore intended for them to stop Voldemort all along. Deathly Hallows completes this by having Dumbledore, er, /predict/ how characters would react after he died (this is at least understandable without requiring ill intent).

Indy!Harry: People like wish fulfillment so they want him to take total control of his life so other things become possible in their stories ("Time to spend a summer running and using Occlumency to become stronger than Riddle!")

** It happens when people don't understand that JKR used characters as plot devices. Dumbledore did and didn't do everything so the plot would happen. Trying to make sense of it in-character leads to manipulative/senile/evil Dumbledore, or to some convoluted headcanon that makes needs tons of fanon to explain why "Dumbledore couldn't have done anything (else)".

** No, manipulative Dumbledore (not at the scale it happens in many fanfictions!) is more or less canon!

Dumbledore is not the kindly grandfather he passes himself of as! Sure he mellowed some with age and started forgiving stuff like murder (which makes him a very bad leader in war, since his troops die while the DEs they stunned are revived and able to continue the fight!), but over all:

He is a master manipulator and a politician! He could have been a Darklord, if his dumb brother (sorry, I don't like Abe Dumbledore at all!) hadn't started a fight (nobody is sure whose spell killed Adriana, but fact is: Her death derailed Dumbledore, but he didn't do a total 180 about face!)
