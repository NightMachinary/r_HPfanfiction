I prefer Harmony myself, because it just made more sense. Whether in the books, or movies, it seemed that Harry, and Hermione had great chemistry, greater then Harry/Ginny(what is their ship name anyway) anyway. Harry, and Hermione have spent so much longer together, and Ginny has always made me a little uneasy. She was a major HP fangirl, and sure she may have grown out of that, but it would still make me uneasy. Also I get the whole men marry their mothers trope here, but Harry didn't even know his mother until the end basically. Sure he's got a few pictures, and a couple stories, but pictures, and stories does not properly convey who someone is. So that as a trope, and reason fails utterly here.

Enough about what I think though. What do you guys think, and I have read stories with Harry/Ginny pairing, and I don't mind it too much, I just prefer Harmony.

EDIT: Holy crap. This still seems like a hot button topic, thanks everyone for your opinions, and I have to agree with the people shipping Harry/Luna. I do prefer Luna over just about everyone, but I was asking specifically on the above two pairings, again thanks anyway.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

** Well, i fall on the Harry/Ginny side of the line and here's why:

There was [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2004/10/28/dyou-really-think-theyre-suited-why-hermione-is-not-the-right-girl-for-harry/][this essay]] on HP Lexicon that did a close reading of the first 5 books to break down why Harry and Hermione might not be suited for each other. It still holds up 15 years later which stuck with me, From its conclusion:

#+begin_quote
  There is an old saying: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. In my opinion, the relationship between Harry and Hermione isn't broken. Hermione performs an essential role in Harry's life and gives him support he desperately needs, both as a motherless boy and as the target of a deadly villain. But Hermione isn't a superwoman. She can't be Harry's mother-surrogate and his sister-surrogate and his friend and his sidekick and his girlfriend. The demands of the different roles are incompatible. Harry will need to add more supporters to help him in his fight, not simply expect his first two supporters to meet his every need. And the ‘girlfriend' role is a natural one to add functions that Harry is mostly missing now.
#+end_quote

Also you have to consider if Harry is the right fit for Hermione as well, as Harry doesn't seem to go out of his way to think about Hermione, which this essay will go in great detail to break down. Ultimately, it is well worth a read just for its citations, haha.

As for Harry/Ginny, though this essay doesn't try to advocate for any one final pairing, there is one passage that struck out to me:

#+begin_quote
  Harry is desperately unhappy; he feels as though the memory of it was eating him from inside (OP575/653) [OP29]. But he continues to hide his feelings from Ron and Hermione. This is very reminiscent of Book Three, when Harry refused to tell Ron and Hermione that he could hear his parents when he was near Dementors (PA137-8 [PA7]/183-4 [PA10]). On that subject, it was Remus Lupin's calm listening skills that succeeded in breaking Harry's reserve (PA140/187) [PA10]. Here, Ginny is the one who uses good listening techniques to find out what is wrong with Harry:

  #+begin_quote
    Harry looked at it a moment, then, to his horror, he felt a lump rise in this throat.

    “Are you OK, Harry?” Ginny asked quietly.

    “Yeah, I'm fine,” Harry said gruffly. The lump in his throat was painful. He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made him feel like this.

    “You seem really down lately,” Ginny persisted. “You know, I'm sure if you just talked to Cho---”

    “It's not Cho I want to talk to,” said Harry brusquely.

    “Who is it, then?” asked Ginny, watching him closely.

    “I...”

    He glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening. Madam Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile of books for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott.

    “I wish I could talk to Sirius,” he muttered. “But I know I can't.”

    Ginny continued to watch him thoughtfully.

    (OP577/654) [OP29]
  #+end_quote

  Ginny employs several good listening techniques here. First, she waits for the opportune moment, when Harry is feeling emotional about his Easter egg. She speaks quietly. She watches Harry closely, gauging his emotions, And, most of all, she does a good bit of remaining silent. She lets him stutter and look around the room without saying something. Even after he speaks, she continues to watch him thoughtfully. These are the same techniques that Sirius used, the same techniques that Remus Lupin used, the same techniques that Dumbledore uses with Harry. Silence, patience, gentleness, watching him with a compassionate expression---these are the way to get Harry to talk. Ginny does not ask why Harry wants to see Sirius, or criticize him in any way, or tell him what he should do. She lets him tell her just as much as he wants to tell her, without pestering him for more.
#+end_quote

Ultimately just in Ootp, other than Sirius, Harry opens up to Ginny the most. Besides this scene, it was Ginny that could empathise with Harry's fear of being possessed by Voldemort, as she had undergone this very experience. So yea, a Harry/Ginny fan here

** I have no strong feelings towards Hinny, but between those two I'd rather see Hinny -- because to me, while there's no personality clashes in Harmony nor constant fighting like there is in Heron, the spark needed to ignite a romantic relationship simply isn't there. The books strongly implies that they love each other like you love your siblings, not romantically -- she's the sister he never had.

So I'd say Hinny.

As for the other parts of the trio -- I ship Ron with Lavender more than anyone -- it's not my OTP or anything, but I find it more plausible than any other common Ron ship. Meanwhile, I don't ship Hermione anyone specifically -- just not Ron or Harry (I mostly read fics shipping her with SS, but it's a consequence of me mostly reading SS-centric fics, not because I think he makes for the best shipping partner to her -- perhaps if he'd been her age, but he isn't).

** I don't much care what the pairing is, if it's done well. However, Harmony has to be done REALLY well for me to get behind it. Firstly, as someone else said, the ship name is grossly cute. But more importantly, I feel like Harry and Hermione have more of a brother-sister vibe than a romantic one. I love their dynamic when they can just be really close, supportive friends. I think anything can be done well, but I'm much less likely to read a Harmony story.

As for Hinny, I don't have strong feelings either way. If the author does something original with the pairing, I'll probably like it, but if they just get together because they were together in canon instead of having any real development within the fic, it seems lazy and annoying.

** Honestly I vote for Harry/Luna when she's either joking, a seer, a lonely girl clinging to her relationship with her crazy Father or something of the sort- hell, I don't even mind it much when she's batshit, I'm a Luna man and if she were real I'd change my name to Neil Armstrong and try to be the first or better yet last man to take one large thrust for man, one larger thrust for mankind.

After all, after the kind of life Harry's led I think he could use some whimsy in his life- even in canon when she wasn't busy baffling him she made him feel better and rather connected in shared problems.

Hermione is too domineering for my tastes- a nagger and control freak. How Harry can stand her after dealing with his relatives... That right there needs a degree in psychology to understand I think, or at least I sure don't get it, though between Hermione and Ginny, well, Hermione seems to grow up some and come to realize rules aren't everything and the world isn't completely black and white while we're never sure if Ginny is after Harry or The-Boy-Who-Lived.

TLTR: I'm a big fan of Luna, Hermione and Harry threesomes aka Lunar Harmony.

*** I know that this will probably get me downvoted into oblivion, but Luna does not work well as the main character/love interest because she is, at the very best, a believer in mad conspiracy theories, and batshit insane at the worst. I love her in small doses, but she cannot carry a story unless you are writing crack.

While Hermione's arguments were poorly made, someone seriously believing baseless theories (eg Goblin pies, heliopath army) unless proven wrong (and proving a negative is pretty much impossible) is not someone you would want to spend time with. Her creatures are one thing, as they may exist and/or may be metaphors, but her blindly believing what the Quibbler writes is not the sign of

An author can write those flaws away in various ways, but by doing so they take away what makes Luna Luna. You can argue that all she needs is some psychological help and I am inclined to believe that, but even if you "fix" her issues, she stops being the endearing character we all love in small doses.

Fuck people like that, everyone is entitled to their opinion.

I don't agree with ya mind, because we simply don't know enough about /why/ Luna spouts that stuff. Sure, it's logical not to date someone obviously insane, but it could easily be a young girl who lost her Mother whose just saying that stuff for attention or to bond with her probably genuinely crazy Father or /something/.

We don't know if we're wiping away Luna because just about everyone wears masks- you act different at work than you do at home probably unless you're the big boss- I know I do, who knows if crazy is Luna's mask? When she gets serious she ends up helping Harry every time, the Thestrals, helping him feel better at the end of the year and such.

Never said she needed psychological help though I think everyone at Hogwarts at the end did, I mean my god, they went through a war and I bet not one of them saw a therapist unless Hermione tied up Ron and Harry and dragged them to one.

*** I really like people's takes on why the Lovegoods are so strange. One fic mentioned that the Quibbler was a coded message for people who opposed the Ministry, sort of like a synonym word jumble proclaiming “Umbridge is corrupt!” which would turn into “Erroads are influencing you right now! Turn to page 4 to learn more!” Another good, albeit sad, one is that Luna's mom put an experimental protection charm on her family and it backfired, causing them to go a little strange. Since she died, there was no one who knew about it or was able to fix it since it was unique.

He doesnt like Hermione in a romantic sense, and from what I recall from canon he always wished for Ron to be there when it was just him and Hermione.

And Ginny, it just feels kinda out of the blue. They like Quidditch and thats kinda it. She can also hold her own, but again, not such an amazingly rare trait among the Hogwarts girls. I always like seeing a pairing with someone else. Especially Luna.

One thing that really grinds my gear is the argument that Ginny looks like Lily so thats why he chose her. Like, 1. If he wanted a girl with the same attributes as his mother, he would 100% go for Hermione. 2. Besides the red hair, we actually have no clue how similar they look. 3. That reasoning is so annoyingly shallow I just prefer to ignore it.

** [[https://owlpostagain.tumblr.com/post/129597015066/why-ronhermione-argue][This fantastic bit of meta]] goes a long way to explaining why I don't think Harry/Hermione works as a romantic relationship. In short, Hermione likes to argue, and Ron is happy to argue right back with her:

#+begin_quote
  “Poisonous toadstools don't change their spots,” said Ron sagely. “Anyway, I've always thought Dumbledore was cracked trusting Snape, where's the evidence he ever really stopped working for You- Know-Who?”

  “I think Dumbledore's probably got plenty of evidence, even if he doesn't share it with you, Ron,” snapped Hermione.

  “Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” said Harry heavily, as Ron opened his mouth to argue back. Hermione and Ron both froze, looking angry and offended. “Can't you give it a rest?” he said. “You're always having a go at each other, it's driving me mad.” (OotP, Chapter 12)
#+end_quote

Note that they are "angry and offended" after Harry reprimands them - to them, this was normal, acceptable conversation. It's also worth noting that even when they're arguing, Ron always respects Hermione's intelligence, taking it as a given that she's the smartest person around:

#+begin_quote
  “How would it be,” she asked them coldly as they left the classroom for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), “if I refused to lend you my notes this year?”

  “We'd fail our O.W.L.s,” said Ron. “If you want that on your conscience, Hermione . . .”

  “Well, you'd deserve it,” she snapped. “You don't even try to listen to him, do you?”

  “We do try,” said Ron. “We just haven't got your brains or your memory or your concentration --- you're just cleverer than we are --- is it nice to rub it in?”

  “Oh, don't give me that rubbish,” said Hermione, but she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard. (OotP, Chapter 12)
#+end_quote

Harry, on the other hand, doesn't like open conflict, and when (unintentionally) pushed too far by Hermione, he tends to explode at her, at which point Hermione wilts:

#+begin_quote
  “Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did ---” Hermione began.

  “CAN'T'VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR YOU'D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT /DUMBLEDORE MADE YOU SWEAR/ ---”

  “Well, he did ---”

  “FOUR WEEKS I'VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON ---”

  “We wanted to ---”

  “I SUPPOSE YOU'VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, HAVEN'T YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER ---”

  “No, honest ---”

  “Harry, we're really sorry!” said Hermione desperately, her eyes now sparkling with tears. “You're absolutely right, Harry --- I'd be furious if it was me!” (OotP, Chapter 4)
#+end_quote

And here:

#+begin_quote
  “/You don't know what it's like/! You --- neither of you --- you've never had to face him, have you? You think it's just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him, like you're in class or something? The whole time you know there's nothing between you and dying except your own --- your own brain or guts or whatever --- like you can think straight when you know you're about a second from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die --- they've never taught us that in their classes, what it's like to deal with things like that --- and you two sit there acting like I'm a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up --- you just don't get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn't needed me ---”

  “We weren't saying anything like that, mate,” said Ron, looking aghast. “We weren't having a go at Diggory, we didn't --- you've got the wrong end of the ---”

  He looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was stricken. (OotP, Chapter 15)
#+end_quote

And here:

#+begin_quote
  “You . . . This isn't a criticism, Harry! But you do . . . sort of . . . I mean --- don't you think you've got a bit of a --- a --- /saving-people- thing/?” she said.

  He glared at her. “And what's that supposed to mean, a ‘saving- people-thing'?”

  “Well . . . you . . .” She looked more apprehensive than ever. “I mean . . . last year, for instance . . . in the lake . . . during the Tournament . . . you shouldn't have . . . I mean, you didn't need to save that little Delacour girl. . . . You got a bit . . . carried away . . .”

  A wave of hot, prickly anger swept Harry's body --- how could she remind him of that blunder now?

  “. . . I mean, it was really great of you and everything,” said Hermione quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on Harry's face. “Everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do ---”

  “That's funny,” said Harry in a trembling voice, “because I definitely remember Ron saying I'd wasted time /acting the hero./ . . . Is that what you think this is? You reckon I want to act the hero again?”

  “No, no, no!” said Hermione, looking aghast. “That's not what I mean at all!” (OotP, Chapter 32)

However, I really like the idea that Hermione sees all the arguments as just an intellectual exercise and Ron just happens to be a willing sparring partner, rather than the arguments being an expression of tension between the two. If Hermione considers all the arguments to be simply an exchange of ideas then I can see why she'd be interested in Ron, as he's the primary person who seems willing to engage her on any topic of debate.

** I prefer Harry/Hermione, mainly because Ron/Hermione would be a disaster. Opposites attract, but not to that degree. The /only/ thing they have in common is having Harry as a friend. Otherwise they're polar opposites. /Starting out/ with endless bickering does not make a happy marriage, and I can't imagine why so many authors find it romantic.

On top of that, Harry/Hermione always had a solid friendship, except for the Firebolt incident where it turned out Hermione was completely correct the whole time. Ginny doesn't have much of a presence in the books other than as a fangirl and a maiden in distress (which would only exacerbate the fangirl problem). And if she looked like his mother then that would introduce some therapy-level problems. She marries him because she's a fangirl, and he marries her because she looks like his mother? Please, no.

A major problem with the story is that there are 3 main characters, and authors (JKR included) seem determined to pair everyone off. When the 4th character (Ginny) is related to one of the 3, the options are very limited. Throwing Neville and Luna into the mix would work, and would not be unrealistic since they all went to the Department of Mysteries together.

That would pair Ron up with Luna, and both the other pairings would be workable.

TL;DR: I don't care as long as Hermione doesn't end up with Ron.

** I am a hardcore Harry/Ginny fan. Contrary to what a lot of people think, I feel that the relationship developed naturally. Many people criticize the development of the relationship saying that Harry basically woke up one day, and fell in love with Ginny from afar. I have two things to say to that:

1. It did not develop as suddenly as it seems.
2. Even if it had, sometimes that's how relationships form.

With regards to the first point, if you read the books closely, from very early on, Harry takes note of where Ginny is. It's small things, like noting where in the common room she is, what she's doing, rarely specifically who she's with. One has to keep in mind that the books are written from a limited 3rd person point of view- Harry's point of view. We only see the things that Harry sees, and only hear about the things that Harry considers important. Over time, Ginny begins to spend a little bit more time with the Trio. Never enough to be part of group mind you, but she shows up more frequently starting in the 4th book or so, and her involvement increases throughout the 5th, particularly with the start of Dumbledore's Army. She's incredibly involved in DA, and that would have served time for Harry to spend time with Ginny, and get to know her better. We don't really know how much they interacted during these sessions, because we rarely see Harry actually teaching; most of the important scenes surrounding DA take place after sessions; we're told what happens in them and not shown. Then in the 6th book, Harry seemingly suddenly has feelings for Ginny, "like a monster in his chest." It only seems to come on strong and quickly, but I think it's important to note that this is also the first time in 2-3 years that Harry is not carrying a torch for Cho. And over the course of this year, Harry and Ginny spend a lot of time together because they're both on the Quidditch team. And I think THAT'S what galvanizes the relationship: the Quidditch.

​

With regards to the second point, I will refer to my own real life experiences. The girlfriend I had throughout my last year of school, is someone that I had at least known about, if not been friends with, since we were about 6 or 7. So about 10 years. And we had both been on the school's Cross Country and Track and Field teams together for 3 years before that; shared a German class for 5 years, been in various other classes together, etc. My point is that to me, at least, it's not like I liked her for all those years, but those feelings suddenly formed during my last year of school. I can't say with certainty why this occurred, I can just confirm that it was like one day I decided that I liked her. Very similar to how Harry's feelings for Ginny came about.

​

With regards to the Harry/Hermione ship I have one thing to say: similarly to [[/u/rosemarysbabykitten][u/rosemarysbabykitten]], I feel that Hermione works better as a platonic friendship, which is something that Harry needs in life, otherwise he only has Ron. Harry has many friends and acquaintances, but the close friends he has basically number two: Hermione and Ron.

** Harry/Hermione, although I am also partial to Harry/Luna.

I think for me it is less about how well Harry/Hermione fit together in my view, and more about how poorly Harry/Ginny do combined with the lack of development Ginny experienced, causing her to feel like a last minute addition just because 3 is not an even number if you catch my drift.

Harry and Hermione were ALWAYS a better fit in terms of personalities, life experiences prior to their awareness of magic and of course post magic, and in terms of their personal strengths and weaknesses. It didn't help that Ron often came off as someone with whom Hermione would never be able to live with long term. I think even proponents of Harry/Ginny will say that the likelihood of a divorce there is fairly high.

For those who argue opposites attract... this is true provided the opposites have enough similar personality traits to where its a complimentary situation and not a square peg in a round hole situation. Harry/Hermione had a good mix of similarities and differences. Ron and Hermione were literally strait opposites 90% of the time, and their similarities came out of their friendship with Harry... nothing more. Without Harry, they do not fit.

I also do think that Harry/Luna would have worked well (more so than Ginny) although I also think Luna would have fit Ron better than Hermione by far. Luna had the ability to make both boys think outside the box, and see the forest for the trees.

** I'm actually a neutral person in regards to ships. I feel Harry had the best connection with Hermione, Ginny, and even Luna and that I'm sure any of those 3 could have been written realistically. Hermione in canon never really learned social tact, despite any attacks on Ron to that behavior. She says things that offend Harry, she acts in what she thinks is the best course without advising, essentially emotionally manipulates Harry to teach, and reacts poorly to Harry beating her in potions and Ron dating Lavender. That being said, she's extremely loyal and will maim to defend Harry. Ginny is a rather supportive character, listening to Harry when things come up. Whether it comes to his need to talk to Sirius or book six and Malfoy almost cruciating him. Her only flaw is that she isn't characterized too much and that she was interested in love potions at Fred and George's shop. Luna is quirky and a bit gullible, but extremely open-minded. Her only flaw is that she's a bit too weird. If she was grounded a bit I definitely could see it happening.

Because as a kid I was a shy loner who would spend most of my time with my nose in a book and focusing on academics over socializing, I've always seen more of myself in Hermione than any other character in the series. As a result, I have trouble not thinking of the story from Hermione's perspective and in particular asking myself what I would do in her shoes. The truth of the matter is that if I was a woman, Ron would very much not be my type but Harry (and Krum) would be. As a result, I ship Harry/Hermione not because I think it is the best fit for Harry, but I think it is the best fit for Hermione.

*** THANK-YOU. Someone actually gets that there are two people in a relationship, and we should consider both of them when it comes to such a discussion. That's why I always preferred Harry/Hermione over Ron/Hermione, and Harry/Ginny. Ron, and Hermione act more like siblings than Harry, and Hermione ever would. While Harry, and Ginny is somewhat unhealthy on multiple levels, if Harry, and Ginny were maybe given a chance to grow, and develop as people, and actually explore other relationships first I could actually see a healthy relationship there, but Ginny, and Harry had just finished a war between a person that greatly effected both of their lives. Ginny had been a HP fangirl for over a decade, and considering Harry saved her in COS, I don't truly believe such a thing ever went away. After a war they should take time, even years to find themselves again before they would pursue a relationship, because of how this person effected BOTH of their lives. Two people in such a state should not think of pursuing a relationship, at least for the moment.

Harry, and Hermione on the other hand I could actually see working immediately after the war. These two people have trusted each other, and never abandoned the other. They've had fights, but the main one that people point to(broom in POA) was done because Hermione was worried over Harry, not out of jealousy, or spite. Their relationship would be a relatively healthy one. Most importantly is that while Voldemort has effected them both greatly, it's only by association that it affected Hermione to a degree, and even then she was never possessed bo Voldemort, nor did she spend her formative years as part of an insular society fearing even the mention of his name. Basically while Harry/Ginny is unhealthy, because of how broken they both are, Harry/Hermione is more healthy, because Hermione would be able to help, and support Harry, because of her distance from such a thing in some very important ways. Let's not forget that they're both muggle raised, both were bullied in school, and in general just fit better as a couple.

With that out of the way, I mostly go for more unlikely pairings, like Harry/Bellatrix, Harry/Lily, and Harry/Gabrielle. But I do appreciate level-2-contrarian approaches to Harry/Ginny. There's quite a bit of room for subversive dark interpretations of Ginny, with her unique position in the Weasley family, slight implications of queen-beeishness, and whatever she /might/ have retained from Tom Riddle.

Hermione, well... I like Harry/Hermione more than level-0 unironic fluffy Harry/Ginny, but often it seems to go along with Twu Wuv, mugglewank, and Hermione Solves Everything, all of which I hate.

** I have read too many Harmony fics to like that ship. Damn, how many fics have made me hate Harmony (wth even /is/ that name? *Harmione* makes at least a /little/ bit sense!), I can't even count. I get people who like Hermione as a character, I liked her in canon too, but fucking hell how people /murder/ that character!

Take for example Robst fic *Harry Crow*. One of the oldest, most famous Harmony fics out there. That doesn't have Hermione anywhere. Oh yes, there's a character with the same name, but she's a badass who is loved by (almost) every goblin out there because the plot demands it. She's goblinsplaining everything and when her dad (who is named Dan, /eurgh/) has ONE human emotion she gets hysterical and threatens to break off all contact forever and ever and ever. Oh, she likes books too. At least she has /that/ in common with canon Hermione. Canon Harry/Hermione makes sense, they have a similar childhood with bullies and stuff. They both come from Muggle upbringing. But I have rarely seen a fanfic that made Hermione (in combination with Harry) to be a true, real character.

That doesn't mean that I like Harry/Ginny (HINNY???) any better, though. But that's mostly because there's nothing that supports such a relationship, which is Rowling's fault. She dumped Ginny halfway through the series on the reader. At least book Ginny had a /bit/ of a personality. Fanfic Ginny often has none.

But, truly, none of them are interesting or realistic. I love reading fic with Harry and Hermione having a sibling relationship. Where Hermione is still canon and flawed but at least it work adorably in a big sister way.

With Ginny,... well. It's even more obvious that it's just a way to make everyone pair up with someone already introduced. That's all a bit gross, for me.

I don't even understand where the need for Ron/Hermione came from, in the novels. I really saw Hermione being alone and focused on her for a few years after the war. And then blossoming and finding someone fitting for her personality. (But I also cannot understand how she'd end up Minister, she's the girl who made literally zero friend all her school years.)

Anyway. I'd vote for Luna, too. It'd be less depressing for all parties involved and less incestuous in its aftertaste.

** You've got a lot of responses from Hinny shippers, so here's one from a die-hard Harmony lover.

HHr is the one I prefer, simply for the fact that it does make the most sense from a canon perspective. They spend the most time together, have each other's back, have at least a little in common (unlike Ron and Hermione who have nothing in common), and they actually seem to care for one another.

Now some will say that they treat each other like brother and sister. I'm sure there are some siblings out there that trust each other and like each other that much, but every brother and sister that I know of treat each other much more like what Ron and Hermione treat each other, esp. those close in age. They bicker and fight and are overly protective of each other. There's not a lot of bickering between HHr in canon that I remember. The only real evidence that Harry thinks of Hermione as a sister is that he says so. But I think that is just JKR being her wishy-washy self. There is a reason why Harry and Hermione look at each other at Bill's wedding when the magistrate says "and they will be bonded for life..."

There's also that Hermione doesn't seem to work with anyone else. Ron really does treat her like a sister, Viktor doesn't talk to her (just stares at her apparently), and Neville comes across as too soft, though in later books he might work as he kind of found himself. Don't get me started on the idiocy that is Dramione. Hermione might be able to forgive Draco for being Draco throughout the series, but she wouldn't forget his actions enough to start dating him. Same with any other Death Eater.

But even if you can't get behind Harry/Hermione as a ship, liking Hinny has always been gross for me and I can't understand how people want to read it. There isn't any evidence that Ginny actually looks like Lily Potter (as someone in this thread already said), but if you've read anything in fanon like "but they'll look just like James and Lily," you'll never read the pairing the same ever again. Even if Ginny doesn't look exactly like Harry's mum, she's still described in a similar manner: redhead, feisty and easy to anger, determined, protective, powerful. To me, the similarities are just too close and make it seem a bit incestuous.

Beyond that, there's the whole fangirl thing. Even as late as the sixth book (which is really the last we see of Ginny in any major form outside of a kiss in book 7 and the epilogue), Ginny is still showing that she *doesn't really know Harry at all.* She says that "I knew you weren't going to be happy if you weren't fighting him," or something like that. Harry doesn't want to fight Voldemort, and he is certainly not /happy/ that he has to do it. Even more, if Ginny really loved Harry and really knew him, she would have stuck by him no matter how much he tried to push her away.

Like Hermione did. Hermione was there and didn't care that Harry tried to push her away. Ginny backed out without a fight and let her grand hero go off to fight his own battles in hope that he'd come back to her. That's not the mark of the type of woman Harry needs, IMHO. He needs a partner, someone who will stand up to him and try to keep him from doing idiotic things, and when she doesn't succeed, she'll follow him into danger, hoping to protect him. If that doesn't describe Hermione, I don't know what does.

I know Hermione has her flaws, I'm not blind to those. But nobody is perfect, certainly not Harry. But I really do think that out of all the possible canon pairings, Harmony works the best.

*** This feels so weird to me bc I've been a die-hard Hinny shipper since I was ten and that was what more than a decade ago. Then recently I decided to go back and read the books again with an adult perspective and I honestly can't stop questioning Rowling's attempts at "romance." People keep bringing up that Hhr have no "chemistry," that they're "boring," that they're like "siblings" and I always bought into that bogus. I look back now and I see two best friends who fundamentally understood each other and always stood by each other even when quite literally their entire world was against them.

"I knew you weren't going to be happy if you weren't fighting him," that quote hits me so hard. It's just SO wrong, NO Harry is NOT happy fighting him, he's miserable! (I'm shocked that in HBP he wasn't dealing with PTSD and breaking down tbh) This just highlights that Ginny never really understood Harry....she just bought his "I'm a lone hero gotta do this myself" BS and backed down only to showcase her jealousy at the weirdest moments (that Cho Chang moment in DH...come on Gin theres a WAR going on, be possessive later). Some shippers say Ginny is fiery and strong so she can "handle" Harry, but where when it really mattered, did she stuck by him and do that?

But Hermione saw through all his false bravado. When Harry attempts to go the lone noble hero route, Hermione was there every step of the way and letting him know that it wasn't HIS responsibility alone. She doesn't let him wallow in depression, she pulls him out, she makes plans, she makes sure he isn't alone in the shit story that is his life and damn if that isn't the best foundation for a romance, I don't know what is,

Young me found Hhr to be boring and meh, older me can see the how easily such a relationship would work out and how well they would have suited each other....not as a bunch of teenagers still figuring out what they want, maybe not even during canon at all!...But after they become adults and have a good head on their shoulders, I can see it and I can see it lasting much longer than the explosive, unhealthy R /Hr and rather shallow, teenage romance H/G.

Wow, sorry for the long post. I should really make my own thread and see if there are others like me who've made such a drastic 180 on these opinions bc I feel like all the Hhr shippers when quiet after DH (at the time I rejoiced as a Hinny fan) but now I feel all alone in the ship lmao, 10+ years too later for the Hhr craze

**** Harry only came up for the idea of being an Auror to piss Umbridge off who was in the room during his career counseling session. After that, I think the reason he went with that was two-fold, first momentum (he didn't have any other ideas) and if he has to fight a war and fight death eaters, I think he just figures Auror makes the most sense.

And even if he thinks that he always has to stand and fight, that doesn't mean he enjoys it or "he is only happy doing it" as Ginny states. He does it because he doesn't know any other way. It would get him killed one day, and Ginny will be an enabler of that situation because she doesn't stand up to him and say "Hey no, how about not going out there and getting Ak'd in the back!", which is something that Hermione would say. Ginny knows the BWL, but throughout the entire series, Harry rails against being exactly that. He wants to be 'just Harry' not a hero from the books Ginny was obsessed with at a very young age.

Honestly, that's my biggest problem with Ginny as a love interest. JKR never allowed her character to grow past that young girl who saw Harry as the hero. Harry is so much more than a hero, and he doesn't want to be seen as a hero. Ginny never gets that in the books. If JKR had made Ginny a more interesting character, more of a main character, and had her grow like other characters in the book, Ginny might have made a good match for Harry. As it is in canon, she just isn't. She the fangirl to a guy who just simply hates his fame.

** Don't get mad - you asked, remember - but I have to say neither, I think they're both equally insufferable pairings and comparably shallow characters for what they are.

The conjoining into "harmony" makes me want to vomit, but Harry getting the hots for what is essentially a discount Lilly Potter almost out of the blue is equally disgusting. I'd honestly rather read straight up incest.

I know I ruffled some feathers here, but sorry not sorry :P

I like the unorthodox pairings like Harry/Luna or Harry/Daphne, although by this point there's really no such thing, everything has been done to death (especially the latter).

Also, the more out of the way a love interest is in terms of Canon, the more liberty I feel authors have to work with. Makes for more interesting stories, as opposed to yet another rehash of the "brightest witch of her age"/"bat-bogey wonder" pairings.

But, isn't it up to Author to fix that? I (regrettably) haven't yet read the books, so i can't have an opinion based on them, but i have read many fanfictions where the Author gives depth to those 2 characters. Isn't that the whole point of fanfiction? To fix what we didn't like in the original while providing new narratives?

** I really really enjoyed the development and relationship between Harry and Ginny in canon, it was very subtle and extremely well done. it fit really nicely with the third person limited viewpoint, and i feel that it grows very naturally. a little bit of what [[/u/FinallyGivenIn][u/FinallyGivenIn]] gets at. i have seen a handful of posts on the [[/r/harrypotter]] sub that point out every single bit of Harry Ginny that i might try and rummage out, really has some good growth.

however, i haven't read one good Harry/Ginny fanfic that picks up on any of the relationship dynamic and development. TBH from reading fanfics i think most readers only spot something when its written like a bludger to the face, and so by osmosis im really into my Harry/Hermione fanfics.

-------

When i first finished the series as a teen i was all for wailing that it should have been Harry/Hermione (and weirdly i read Harry/Ginny fanfics back then). then after some years away from the story and fanfics in my late teens, re-reading canon as an adult and a more discerning reader, picking up all the nicely done bits about Harry and Ginny - it was great. (and now i weirdly-conversely read Harry/Hermione fanfics)

​

edit: i'll refine that slightly, now i only read +well written+ adult sentence structure rather than YA fanfics that are horribly few and far between and i'll settle for whatever pairing they have.

A well written fic is so few and far between that i would be limited if that was all i read. There are a few fanfic authors that have made it big and quite a few that self-publish, Less than those i would say are actually tip-top quality writers.

*** I feel like I'm the opposite situation. Was a massive Hinny fan, but could never get into any of their fanfics bc most of them were so insubstantial and built on tropes and just felt...blank to me? Weirdly, I used to argue with my family and friends who thought Hhr was better ("Read the books, Mom! Ginny is better there, I promise!") and I never even really thought of Hhr as a couple. It wasn't until I unwittingly read a fanfic that included Hhr that I realized "damn, there is a lot of potential here" and I just got so excited about exploring all the complexities and subtleties of their relationship...the same relationship I always as a kid thought was sibling like and boring but which now seems to have the foundation for so much more that I ended up moving to Hhr just recently but it just feels /weird/ after shipping Hinny for 10 years lmao.

Do you have any Hhr fic recs? I noticed you said you read them more.

** I'll read Harry/Hermione stories, and I liked the pairing when I read the first 2 books or so and I fell out of that pretty quickly, but I wouldn't go out of my way to read the pairing now. I like it fine enough that if a story that seems interesting has it as the pairing it won't turn me off, but again, I don't deliberately seek it out.

Harry/Ginny on the other hand - I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of. In the books Ginny started out as a fangirl, who finally seemed to get over Harry and move on to be more than a fangirl, only for them to get together completely out of the blue in book 6. Like Ginny was barely a major character, she was just sort of there. And then suddenly Harry is like obsessed with her and apparently Ginny had still liked him all along. It just rubbed me the wrong way, how it was written. If they'd had more chemistry or if Harry had even showed more interest in her in that way before book 6 I think I'd like the pairing better. That said, like with Hermione if I see he's paired with her for a story I want to read it won't necessarily turn me off the story, but I will admit I'm a little less likely to read it

Overall though I'd much prefer to read Harry with pretty much anyone else other than these 2, though I'd read him with Hermione more than I would with Ginny.

** Im on the side of Harry/Hermione its not my favorite ship but i do like it and much prefer it over to Harry Ginny. Im not a fan of the men marry their mothers trope. You never really got to know lilly but looks wise they are both red heads and Harry looks like his dad. So I think there was the idea of the present to a degree reflecting the past. And idk just to recreate that i dont really like the idea.

But that's just why im not huge on Harry Ginny. I like Harry Hermione more because its based on friendship they have a bond that's based on a strong relationship thats been built up over the years. While Harry's relationship with Ginny was just as Ron's sibling. Not even a sibling he was particularly close to. Not till he started to see her as attractive. She developed more of a personality in book 5 but they still weren't exactly close till he hooked up with her.

Not that this is unrealistic or anything but in fiction i prefer romance based on some sort of strong bond that starts maybe even before the romantic feelings and not just the physical attraction. And Harry Ginny just doesnt give me that. Most of Harrys other relationships do even ones not explored that much like Harry Luna.

*** You, and JKR are completely in your right to believe that, but first of all I have two sisters, and one brother. Do you want to know who we acted like most of the time, if you guessed Ron and Hermione you are correct. Going off my own personal experience, Ron and Hermione act more like siblings, where Harry and Hermione act more like potential partners. You, and JKR can argue otherwise until the sky is green, but fact is that if anyone was going to develop a realistic relationship, it'd be Harry and Hermione, not Ron and Hermione, their relationship actually has a lot of the earmarks saying that it'll be a horrible relationship.

Also since were playing JKR said, did you know she said that the only reason Hermione ended up with Ron is as a form of wish fullfillment. I'll copy&paste the text just below. But suffuce to say that JKR herself stated that Harry and Hermione would have worked better. So from my own experience, and from the words of the author herself, Harmony is both the better, and more realistic relationship.

In an interview conducted by Emma Watson in 2014, the author told the actress that she put Ron and Hermione together because she wanted to see them together, but that in many ways Harry and Hermione would have been the better fit. "I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment," Rowling said.

***** Are you an idiot. Here i'll paraphrase the FIRST PARAGRAPH. "JK Rowling has admitted that she made a mistake by pairing off Hermione Granger with Ron Weasley rather than with Harry Potter in her best-selling books."

She states right there that she should of placed Hermione with Harry. She also states how it's a form of wish fulfillment, and other such things. Also unless Harry cheats on Ginny, it's kind of expected that JKR in her own words, made a mistake pairing Hermione up with Ron instead of Harry.

Just know that the only reason they're together, is the same reason there are so many horrible godlike Harry stories out there, and so many terrible stories in general, wish fulfillment. So the only reason Hinny is a thing is because JKR isn't good at relationships, and falls in to the trappings of what terrible writers do.

** Hermione of course. She's smart, hardworking, charming, funny, brave, loyal and most important of all she treated Harry as just Harry ant not the Boy-Who-Lived. Ginny isn't that smart, not hardworking, somewhat charming in that brash, tomboyish way, not as funny as Hermione and while she might be brave I suppose I hardly doubt she would be brave enough to withstand Bellatrix's torture without breaking down into a useless mess.

Hermione is best witch.
