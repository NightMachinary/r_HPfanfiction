Any fic where Harry,Sirius or Tonks don't accept Remus back?

I never liked that Remus would get away with excuse that because he was a werewolf, he didn't visit. Also in the last book when he wants to leave Tonks because he is a werewolf seems like a cowards escape.


** "Faery Heroes"

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

** Tonks drops him like a rock in this one (and its rewrite). Not quite the same. But close.

#+begin_quote
  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.

  The War is Over, Harry has won. But at what cost? At odds with Dumbledore, estranged from the Weasleys, betrayed by Lupin, Harry tries to carry on for his 7th year. Harry/Daphne. There will be Humor, there will be Romance, also Drama and Angst.
