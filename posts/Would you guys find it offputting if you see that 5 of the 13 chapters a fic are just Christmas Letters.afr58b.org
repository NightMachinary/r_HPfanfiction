If it makes any difference, the letter chapters are all just 1.5k-2k words long, whereas the other chapters are 4-6k words long.


** Yes. Letters are like flashbacks. Used sparingly, they can be a fun way to provide more context about off-screen characters. But I'd really rather be reading where the action is happening right now.

** I think it entirely depends on what kind of fic your writing. Without more information, It's hard to give an honest opinion.

*** The fic is written from the altering perspectives of five students, portraying their budding friendships, relationships and ideas about the world, with respect to the influence of a young Tom Riddle on them

**** Presumably each of those five chapters is one christmas letter from each student? I think I would find it off-putting. I would enjoy one chapter that contained a shorter letter (~300-600 words) from each, but I think having almost half of the fic be christmas letters (especially if the fic is not Christmas themed) would be weird.

I don't mind fics that are all letters, or fics that include the occasional letter, but it's such a drastically different form of story telling that I would probably not be pleased about it switching part way through

** I think I've read entire fics that were entirely made up out of letters. It depends on how well you can write letters and how interesting the underlying narrative is.

** That would be very strange to me. Couldn't they just be merged into 1 chapter? Furthermore, I don't think having each of the five MCs have a letter is the best way to tell the story.

** Not per se. I've enjoyed fics that are heavy on letters... but I would still have to be interested in the fic for other reasons: good writing, good premise, canon-adjacent characterization, characters I care about, etc.

** When you say Christmas letters what do you mean? Unless these cover different events rather than the same one over and over from different perspectives I would say it would be off putting. Even if they are different if they aren't action filled enough/really good plot advancement then it would be best to combine them into one chapter and reduce length if possible.

*** Yeah they're different events for sure, each chapter covers a different plot arc

**** Then it'll probably be okay, especially if you haven't put much future stuff in the prior chapters that the letters explain since it'll avoid the flashback thing that's not super popular as far as I'm aware.

** Not if they're well written. There are, after all some truly classic epistolary novels.

** I would find it not only offputting but it would warrant an immediate closing of the fic. Letters are pure "tell not show" and while one could work in a story - and even that would be stretching it as most letter in fanfics are pieces of utter boredome - any more would bore readers to tears.

*** I think you're cutting to the chase a bit early, mate. It's not like the characters are writing the intricacies of their plot arcs in critical detail to one another. There's something called 'reading between the lines'- you can show just as you can tell through letters.
