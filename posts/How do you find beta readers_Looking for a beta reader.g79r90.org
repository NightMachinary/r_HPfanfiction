Hey guys, this is my first post here so apologies if I'm breaking any rules or if there's a thread about this already, but how do you find a beta reader for your fics? I used to have my friend beta my fic but now that school is out I need someone who's pretty active online (she doesn't really go online often). If someone knows how to find beta readers or if someone wants to beta read my fic, please do let me know!!


** Well, the way I did it was just by PMs on FFN. I mentioned that I was not a native speaker, my to-be beta offered his services, and there you go. Obviously, that requires someone already interested in one of your fics with the skills and time required.

You also should tell what exactly you are looking for. Someone to help you with the plot, ideas, themes and the like? Someone who can Britcheck? Someone to find the mistakes the spellchecker missed?

It is also important that you and your beta have a similar outlook on the universe. If someone is a diehard Snape fan and asks me to beta their work, I would end up marking a lot of it as "to be reworked" because Snape would be, in my opinion, totally OOC. You don't have to agree on everything (preferred pairings, favourite divergence), but you should not clash over the fundamentals of your work.

** Well, you can post like you are doing, you can go to the [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] sub and enter yourself into their scheduled event (I forgot what day it's on, but the timetable is in the sidepanel thing), or you can go through the beta function on FFnet (check the top bar under the blue one and it's the last option from the left, then you filter through to get Harry Potter people and just go through profiles until you find one you like).

*** Thank you for the advice!! I think I'll wait around here for someone willing to beta since my work is currently on AO3, not FFnet. But I'll definitely post in th [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] sub, thank you!

** For context, mine is a Good Dursley Family fic - afaik, these are few and far in between and haven't been done in the way I'm doing it (so I took it upon myself to write it myself). I'm rewriting the entire series and am currently about more than a third through PS, and you can see what I've published so far on AO3 linkao3(Mr. And Mrs. Dursley-Evans' Very Extraordinary Morning; Harry Potter-Dursley-Evans and that Supremely Surreptitious Stone)

  Why were the Dursleys so mean?Harry's personality, his actions, his choices, even those in the later books, are all influenced by his upbringing at the Dursley's horrid household. Had he been raised differently, would he have made the same decisions? Would he still have been on the side of the Light? Would the story of Harry Potter still fundamentally be the same as we know it today?What if the Dursleys were good? And not only good but kind? And raised him right, in a loving household, as he deserved?Open the fic to see the real summary - this is just an introduction.
