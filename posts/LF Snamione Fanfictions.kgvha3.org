** Currently reading Self Slain Gods on Strange Altars by scumblackentropy on FFN. (Idk how to link, sorry.) It's not complete and hasn't been updated since 2013, but holy. crap. It's absolutely fantastic. So eloquent, true to the characters, and authentically emotionally raw. Honestly not hating having COVID and being under quarantine cause all I want to do is continue reading this story! It's my favorite HP Fanfiction I've ever read, without a doubt, to rival even I Know And I Cannot Know--Yet I Live And I Love.

Accountable by Dyce was my introduction into HP Fanfiction. Much like now, I was glued to my phone, reading through the night. The premise is controversial but I still think it's a wonderful story.

If you liked Pet Project, I think you will like Camerado by MillieJoan, where Snape teaches Hermione occlumency.

All these are slooow burns, and beautifully written.

** Chasing the Sun by Loten is one of the classics you seem to have missed out on :)
