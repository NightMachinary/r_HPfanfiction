Here's mine:

♡Harry changing his name for the lols (I see you sneaking your oc in there, you ain't slick)

♡Characters are fetishised (in any way)

♡Weak Harry that never grows (LET HIM WIN ONCE FFS)

♡When the story is great but one of the above happens


** OP Harry who somehow knows more magic than the teachers and can control magical creatures, etc. This usually also goes with evil Dumbledore.

** ---angst porn/abuse porn

---game of thrones level rape and misogyny

---feminisation of characters just because they're a bottom (this just in: anal sex doesn't change your physical make up lmaooooo). Gay men come in all shapes and sizes and that is a good thing.

---like, ridiculous levels of not understanding biology and sex misinformation. Soaping up a coochie is like the worst idea ever. Pouring melted chocolate on a cooch is also a horrifyingly bad idea on several levels. Making a woman wear underwear that is too small isn't hot, because she ends up too sore to have any sex with anyone. Blood is not lube! This kind of thing makes good smut immediately very unsexy and take you out of the scene because there is /nothing/ sexy about yeast infections

** ▪ Harry is heavily abused by the Dursleys. As in rape level

▪ Extreme Pureblood customs specifically in Slytherin house. E.g. if you sit in a slouched position at the Slytherin tabel, everyone will look at you in disapproval

▪ same as you, I don't like fetishised characters

▪ Dumbledore/Weasley bashing

▪ When Hermione and Harry mention each other a lot but not Ron but they are still best friends

** - Inconsistency (I just read a fic that couldn't commit to a last name for married Drarry. It was really annoying. Also in the same fic a major story point was a dept between Harry and Lucius + Draco. Halfway or so through the story the dept suddenly was "healed" and had "vanished", but the rest of the story relied on the dept being there.)

- Uber violence (sometimes I feel the authors need a few sessions with a shrink. There was one fic where Harry was negatively influenced by Grimmauld Place and he did disgusting things like ordering Kreacher to bang his head bloody until near death). I'm getting nauseous just remembering this. Needless to say I quit the fic once I realized how bad it was

- Just bad writing in general (no need to over explain, for example, or repeat situations and dialogues between different characters over and over again.)

- Characters crying all the time. I.e. Draco constantly being in tears for nor real reason. Where's his pureblood pride ?

** When unsafe/abusive relationships are romanticised. This is especially common in BDSM themed works. This isn't about characters in abusive relationships who can't/don't leave, either. This is about those fics where the author writes a relationship that is clearly abusive, while also portraying it as super romantic, or some kind of ideal.

For example: Dom beats sub, to the point of causing lasting damage, in an attempt to make the sub Safeword, all while knowing that the sub is so devoted to Dom that they would pass out in pain before Safewording.

The Dursley family getting off scot-free.

Dumbledore getting off scot-free.

Remus showing up after not even sending Harry a letter to see how he is and going on about how Harry is his cub and Harry not being slightly upset that he was basically a child slave in a cupboard while Remus wallowed in self-pity

Harry not even waiting for an apology from Ron and Hermione to forgive them when they blow him off.

**** They're probably used to reading books where “this is talking” and ‘this is thinking'. I feel like a lot of people find it difficult to go from “this” to ‘this' because their brains been trained to use the different quotations to differentiate between dialogue and internal monologging. Sometimes people skim over the characters internal thoughts, but generally everyone reads dialogue. Accidentally skipping past important dialogue because the quotation marks used made you think it was just the characters thoughts can get frustrating.

***** ...it's a bloody quotation mark mate, I grew up with (“), and found reading (‘) easy enough albeit odd at first. You either learn that people across the world do things differently and that's okay, or you stay the way you are and just don't read books with (‘). I'd like to point out, if you're the one tossing a good book away that's well written because of its quotation marks that's on you, not the author.
