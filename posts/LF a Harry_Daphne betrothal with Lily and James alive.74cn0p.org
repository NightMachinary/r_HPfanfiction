I read a fanfiction a while ago where Harry is betrothed to Daphne by James and Lily as he is the heir to the Potter family and all. Harry also has a younger brother here who dates Hermione and she really tries to poke her nose (not sure about this one?) into the matters and Harry's younger brother tries explain it all to Hermione.

Thanks in advance!


** Linkffn(7353678) sounds a bit like what you're after. Can't be sure though. I remember reading a bit of it a long time ago so I've forgotten most of the details, then again, I get irritated with almost any fics that feature Hermione prominently so I might have dropped it for petty reasons.

  Thirteen years ago, the Dark Lord attacked Longbottom Manor and was defeated by the baby Neville Longbottom. Or so said Dumbledore. The Potters have a huge secret, known only by their greatest allies... and a certain Dark Lord.
