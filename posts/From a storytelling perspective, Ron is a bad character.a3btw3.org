Before everyone grabs their pitchforks and downvotes, hear me out. This isn't about any personal aspects of Ron, his faults, flaws and whatnot. This thread is about how Rowling wrote the character and the events and actions surrounding him.

What do I mean with that? Well, when Harry fucks up, bad things happen. For example, he falls for Voldemort's ruse and as a result, Sirius dies. When he and Hermione are deceived, Harry loses the brother wand to Voldemort's and has to do with one which isn't matched to him. But when Ron fucks up, at the very worst he is given the cold shoulder for a short time (Harry and Ron gave Hermione more shit over the Firebolt). Hell, Ron spent the better part of six years at Hogwarts making fun of or belittling Hermione and somehow he still ended up scoring her. And the one time he really fucked up it doesn't matter because his light extinguisher is also a personal teleporter with unmatched tracking magic.

The obvious solution would be to include some consequences to his actions without just shitting on him for the sake of doing so (eg killing his father in OotP). Without going into shipping wars, maybe him getting anyone else could do the trick. He'd still be happy and have a loving wife, just without the implication that being mean to a girl is the best way to attract her. Maybe add an event during the hunt where Ron would have made a difference, but because he wasn't there a Death Eater survived and that Death Eater then kills another Weasley. Maybe there's a skirmish with Greyback but because Ron isn't there he escapes and later kills a few people during the Battle of Hogwarts who otherwise would have lived.

Your thoughts?


** For most of their schoolyard relationship Ron and Hermione lightly tease each other. Both of them went out of line a few times, but suggesting that Ron was constantly mean to Hermione is just not true.

Ron cut up her food when her hands were bandaged. He stood up for her to Snape in class. He calls her 'amazing' and 'genius' every chance he gets, and tells a psychopath to torture him instead of her.

The only times that Ron 'fucks up' are in Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows.

In Goblet of fire, he throws a 14 year old hissy fit after an argument. He didn't out of the blue say "you know what Harry, I don't believe you, so now I'm gonna abandon you". Harry calls him stupid for even suggesting that Harry did put his name in, and Ron has a poor reaction. He also admitted his mistake and apologised.

In Deathly Hallows he clearly was affected more by the horcrux than Harry or Hermione (as well as having lost a lot of blood from the splinching), and he immediately regretted his decision to leave when he disaparated away from it.

I'll say it again: If one horcrux can make Ginny try to kill people, it can make Ron chuck a hissy fit. The same horcrux made Hermione work into a dead end, and made Harry suspicious of his friends. It was only until after Ron destroyed it (by facing the fears and insecuties the horcrux used against him) did any of them come up with a decent plan.

Sorry, but while you tried to make your post seem reasonable and not a about the "personal aspects of Ron, his faults, flaws and whatnot", you immediately backtracked and did just that, with the same arguments that have been refuted time and time again.

To be fair, if you are basing your image of Ron from the films, or even most fanfic, you are probably right. But none of what you said applies to actual canon.

*** This still does not adress the fact that Harry's or Hermione's fuck-ups have serious consequences while Ron only gets the cold shoulder for a few days. It remains bad writing that he has no high stakes while the others do.

I am not arguing that Ron should be shunned forever or was a horrible friend. I am just saying that his mistakes have no consequences while Hermione's or Harry's do. I am not critising his character or anything.

**** All good dude, but I'm saying that the examples you gave either were false, or not Ron's fault, or in the case of the goblet of Fire incident, teenage boys being immature (go figure).

Hermione also doesn't get much consequence for her actions. In a schoolyard sense, her and Ron give each other the cold shoulder and hurl insults, but nothing major.

Its because Ron and Hermione aren't the protagonists. Being the defacto leader of the group means that he made the decision to try and rescue Sirius. So he feels that Sirius's death as well as Ron and Hermione's injury are his fault. He made the decision to go to the godrics hollow, and he looses his wand because if it. Hermione didn't make that choice, Harry did.

Ron and Hermione never make those decisions for the group, so there are no consequences to actions they never did.

The fact is, if Ron actually had majorly fucked up at some point in the series I would be agreeing with you, but he didn't.

The small and medium mistakes however, were certainly with their consequences. Every time he took a step too far with Hermione, he pushed her further away preventing them from getting over their issues sooner. Hermione did the same thing to him. After he didn't believe Harry, he was used as a test subject for the Harry to practice spells on, while Hermione wormed her way out. When Ron is driven away by the horcrux, he gets roughed up and his wand stolen by snatchers.

He does get consequences for his actions, but I fear you wish for him to be punished for things he never did, or weren't truly his fault.

Hermione does not believe Harry about Malfoy. Therefore she does not start another intelligence-gathering program like in CoS. Malfoy's plot succeeds and he injures innocents in the process.

  or weren't truly his fault.
#+end_quote

Neither of the other examples I provided were anyone's fault. Harry could not guarantee that Sirius was at the Ministry after all. I am not blaming Harry for what he did, but there still were consequences. Same with the fight at Godric's Hollow. And I am not blaming Ron for what he did. The reasons were understandable.

He deserted the only somewhat effective opposition against Voldemort for two or three months. Given the state of affairs in magical Britain, that seems rather major. And yes, the Horcrux caused this, that's why I am not suggesting any punishment for desertion or anything, but some consequences would be nice. Because while Harry and Hermione were miserable and hungry in the tent (idiot ball), he was comfortable at Shell's cottage.

****** Fair enough on he Malfoy front, but Ron didn't believe Harry either. So if it is partly Hermione's responsibility, then it was also Ron's.

When he left Harry and Hermione, he got beat up by snatchers, and had his wand stolen. If that's not a consequence, I don't know what is.

Edit - bad grammar

I doubt Ron would have been able to brew Veritasserum or Draught of the Living Dead while Hermione had proven her capabilities regarding potions in her second year (and with an O in Potions). Then again, poisoning Malfoy would have done the trick as well, so yeah.

Friends jab at each other all the time. I don't know what kind of schooling you had, but my friends and I insulted each other to high infinity all the way through school and it was glorious. Maybe you don't remember your school days all that well, but use "belittle" in front of a teenager crowd, and you'll be laughed at for being a pussy.

There's a difference between friendly, insulting banter and what Ron does (especially in books 3 and 4).

Not denying that. But a year later he throws a fit calls Harry a liar for three weeks and is jealous over an assassination attempt and yet is immediately forgiven. I don't know about you, but fourteen year me would have taken way longer than five seconds to forgive that.

**** Except that to 13 year old Harry, Ron is practically the only family he has. Would you forgive your best friend, one who you knew would die for you, and follow you into the heart of danger, for a two week hissy fit? I would, because brothers have misunderstandings, even though they would die for each other.

Also, Ron at no point called Harry a liar. He felt hurt that after everything, Harry would go ahead and put his name in without him, then when he tried to remain friendly he messed up by not believing Harry within the first 10 seconds, then Harry snapped at him and called him stupid, and then they didn't talk for 2 weeks before Ron sucked up his (considerable) pride and apologised in public.

**** I didn't say it was friendly banter either - I said teenagers insult each other all the time, and there are no hard feelings involved, unless one party is a thin-skinned pussy.

Hermione also has several bitch moments in her 3rd and 6th year. When it looks like Ron's pet rat is eaten by her cat, Hermione harps something along the lines of, "They're animals, and cats eat rats." In her sixth year, she sets birds on Ron for absolutely no reason, when looking at it from Ron's perspective.

Also, you're conveniently ignoring all the nice things Ron does in favour of the times when he's being a typical teenager. Look up the other comment.

No. From an adult's perspective, it's usually vile filth. From a teenage pov, it's ok, because they usually try to one up the insults.

Also, compared to the insults that were traded by my group in school, the book series is tame as hell.

Really? Because honestly, it has not changed much when I am out with my mates now compared to when we were 12. It's still the same jokes about fucking mothers, sucking someone's dick and black historical humour.

The book series is toned down due to the target audience. There was a Rowling interview where she said she had to write things out because they would not fit the target audience.

**** People who say that probably have never experienced friendly banter and try to tell themselves "it's just friendly banter" when acquaintances are insulting them.

I have friends with whom we tell each other much worse things than Ron says to Hermione, but if anyone of us ever showed signs of actually being upset by it (like Hermione is) we'd stop immediately.
