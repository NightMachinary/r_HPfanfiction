  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

** linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) - Harry in Slytherin semi-rehash of canon, but with more character. Since each year gets a corresponding number of chapters (e.g.: 4th gets 4 chapters), it starts off feeling rushed but later seems to drag a bit.

linkffn(Path of Decision by Lulu42) - crossover with the Endless of DC/Vertigo Sandman comics. Harry in Slytherin being influenced by immortal personifications of concepts (Death, Dream, Desire, Delirium...) makes for a heady brain trip.

  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Sandman Crossover COMPLETED!

** It somehow fits your request, I think. I'm in the process of writing my story, featuring a Slytherin!Harry. It does take place outside of Hogwarts mostly, though.

  Christmas, 1993. Harry Potter is spotted in the company of wanted fugitive Sirius Black, and is forced on a dark, treacherous path. He is pursued from all directions by a Ministry intent on capturing him, and a seemingly immortal Voldemort always looms in the shadows. The road ahead will be dangerous for Harry, and the toll will be higher than ever before...

** Linkffn(Harry potter and the tri-wizard tournament by drizzlewizzle) be warned, this is the fourth fic, I just couldn't remember the titles for the others. This is a great series that has just started sixth year, and has gone through a full book for every year. It is updated every two-three weeks on Friday, with occasional bonus chapters for special occasions. So by the time you read the other five (emerald trance is fifth year, and it is HUGE) we should be well into sixth year, which was fairly recently started.

  (4/7) Harry Potter is Slytherin's Tri-Wizard Champion. Witches want him. Wizards want to be him. Death Eaters want to kill him. Even though Harry's selection is an attempt on his life, Harry doesn't see any reason not to enjoy the benefits of being a Champion... especially when that means snogging shapely witches. But will Harry become distracted from his primary goal: survival?
