Set in the Marauders Era, obviously. Probably around 1980? Preferably Peter's POV.

Something along the lines of him being captured/cornered by Voldemort, and Big V either talking or torturing him into betrayal. Mental torture? Sure. Physical torture? Okay.

I'm fine with any sort of gore or disturbing elements, however no explicitly sexual things please. Not in the mood.

Thanks in advance :)

Not from Peter's POV, but Harry-Voldemort's perspective. There's a scene in Tread Softly that is exactly what you're asking for.

Here's what I wrote up about it to fit a request someone had about stories where Harry's mistakes aren't trivial:

Tread Softly by Dius Corvus (on fanfiction.net) is a time-travel story where Harry has a really hard time fitting in, makes terrible mistakes, and is even the cause of worse events. It begins with the side effect of Voldemort trying to kill Harry and a piece of Voldemort's soul (and memories) ends up in Harry. The resulting magical backlash sends Harry-Voldemort back in time to the year his parents graduate Hogwarts; Harry takes on the name Jonathan, attends another 7th year at Hogwarts where Dumbledore can keep an eye on him, and looks for ways to return to his future.

*Please note:* story features a scene of child abuse; a memory of some older students sexually abusing a much younger student at Hogwarts. It is absolutely recognized as abuse in the story, there is no excusing or sanitizing the violation and trauma.

*Major spoilers:*

Harry-Voldemort really fucks things up; he murders a classmate, kills the DADA professor while she is defending Hogwarts, is responsible for Snape being noticed and sought after by Voldemort in the first place, and causes Peter Pettigrew to betray Potters. The awful part of Harry learning how to get back to his time, while struggling with feeling that he doesn't have the power to change anything, is that Harry is so magically powerful because of his strength combined with Voldemort that he could have made a better future. Snape, already an angry, abused, and abrasive teen, ends up a broken and bitter man from his entanglement with 'Jonathan' and being enticed into the Death Eaters.

** linkffn(The Forsaken Fidelius) has quite an interesting take on this. Peter is actually loyal to James and Lily, but that doesn't mean Voldemort can't negotiate.

  Peter would die to protect James and Lily. But Lord Voldemort won't make the choice that easy for him.
