Olivanders blinked, as if bewildered for just a moment.\\
"One moment, please remain still." The wizened old man squinted as he extended a finger.

Said finger brushed his scar, as if wiping something off. Harry felt a chilling touch, then everything lifted. It was like bathing after a long time, of unnoticed filth being washed away.\\
Olivanders withdrew his finger, and wiped the lack ball of sludge into a small box.

"Apologies, but you had a piece of Dark Lord on your scar. Now, to find you a wand..."


** Now I'm imagining Aurors busting down the door to defend him from the Death Eater abduction... only to find him calmly wiping the blood stains off of said Death Eaters' wands before reviving and shelving them.

** I like the idea that there's only ever been one proprietor at Ollivander's for over 2300 years, either an immortal wizard or something pretending to be human, but either way mostly just doing it for the lulz. There's a wonderful little nod to such an idea in linkffn(The Trial of Dolores Jane Umbridge)...

*** he discovered a new way to create a horcrux instead of splitting his soul with murder, he pours so much of himself into each wand that a tiny part of his soul becomes part of it

#+begin_quote
  The trials of the Death Eaters and followers of Voldemort are winding down, but the Minister of Magic has saved the best for last. Former Undersecretary Umbridge is about to find out why crossing a bookworm is a very bad idea, especially this one.

*** I just read through this and I didn't see anything about Ollivander at all.

Edit: Nevermind I didn't see the chapters, thought it was a oneshot.
