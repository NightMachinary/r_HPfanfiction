** racial? Er.. your country of origin has nothing to do with your race. All you need to make Harry foreign is have Lily go have him in France because of the war. Plenty stories where he was raised elsewhere anyway.

  Parallel universe time travel? Natasha Romanoff has done it. But meeting Death himself who gives her a baby who's being hunted by terrorists? That's a new one. Simply put, she might need little Harry as much as he needs her. Natasha Mother Figure.

** Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)

When Voldemort was defeated in 1981, the death eater movement didn't fall apart. Instead, Lucius Malfoy took over and quickly installed himself as dictator of Britain.

The Weasleys, Harry, Dumbledore and most of the other good guys spent the last 20 years or so in France in exile. Now it's time to return to Britain and take their country back.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
