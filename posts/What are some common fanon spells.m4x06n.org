***** No it wasn't. You're thinking about the Disillusionment Charm - which I suppose could be classified as a kind of glamour but is not generally what people mean when they use it in fic.

#+begin_quote
  Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body, for it didn't look anything like his any more. It was not invisible; it had simply taken on the exact colour and texture of the kitchen unit behind him. He seemed to have become a human chameleon.
#+end_quote

I think what most people mean when they use 'glamour charm' is changing your appearance to look like another person in a very temporary, very shallow sort of way. Sort of like how makeup can be used.

******* Nope, neither that. It was [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Stinging_Jinx][Stinging Jinx]], which made Harry's face disfigured, but that was certainly not anything meant as a makeup. Which, by the way, kind of negatively proves that there were no glamour charms, because Hermione (whatever we think about her fashion sense, she *was* a girl) didn't use any of them.

** The Stasis charm is probably the fanon spell I personally see the most, by virtue of reading a lot of Snape-centric fics (it makes for a useful spell for potions). But I think the most common fanon spell in general is Tempus. Wards are even more common but isn't really a specific spell, but rather a group of spells. And it's arguably canon since while we don't see the term itself used in canon, we do see the effects of wards on canon, such as you not being able to Apparate within Hogwarts as a general rule, but allowed for the Headmaster.

*** Yeah. In re wards, the way people down their nose say wards don't exist in canon just makes me boggle.

It's like saying vehicles don't exist in canon, just cars and trucks.

** And often it is not that these spells are completely invented, but they are crazily overused. Most wizards are not capable of doing the Patronus Charms, but in most fanons it is done by everybody in their first year (yes, that's partially canonical, plenty of Dumbledore Army members managed that, but only in their fifth year). The same goes for even simple /Protego/ charm (according to George and Fred Weasley, many employees of the Ministry are not capable of that).

** Depends what kind of fics you're reading, but I see a lot of contraceptive charms. Maybe like Atocium statim which I just completely made up based on the google translate latin for “contraceptive immediately”

** Percutio - piercing curse

Everbero - bludgeoning hex

That's all off the top of my head, but generally any interesting combat magic is guaranteed to be fanon, since JKR had Voldemort pretty exclusively use the Killing Curse, and of course canon!Harry never escalated beyond the magical version of slap-fighting.

** The name of the Notice-Me-Not charm is fanon, though the effects are shown in canon.

Anything described as a ward is fanon, though again we see unnamed spells in canon that seem to have similar effects.
