I'm looking for fanfics where Harry is evil, so things like getting sorted into slytherin or siding with Voldemort or anything like that. Basically the original books except he is bad instead of good


** 1)Quo Vadis? It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way

2)legit evil Harry fic:

Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails Oceanbreeze7 Summary: Are you a witch or Are you a fairy? Or are you the wife of Michael Cleary? “The fairies will do wicked things sometimes,” Harry murmured gently, “Steal the milk when they get a chance, or skim the cream off the milk crocks.” “Do they ever steal anything more?” Luna asked him rhetorically. Harry couldn't answer.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming) - Warning - This is extremely graphic and the things Harry and Daphne do to people make canon Voldemort look like a saint
