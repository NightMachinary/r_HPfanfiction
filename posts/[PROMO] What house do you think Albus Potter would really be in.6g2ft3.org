I don't know if any of you remembers me, I was here not long ago and I posted about how I was writing a fic about many other magic schools (and not just the 11 J.K. Rowling confirmed, because there should be many more if we're talking about children from all over the world) and the adventures their students would have to face. I've finished an early draft and I'm quite excited about it! I've tried not to deviate at all from the Harry Potter books (not counting CC. As far as I'm concerned, that book could disappear from existance just like many characters did in its alternate timelines à la "Return to the Future") and to explore themes the books did too: family, love, racism (in a way), power, how past affects the future... I know how the main plot lines and characters will extend, except for one: Albus Potter. Which means that, as the main character from Hogwarts, it completely alters everything in the school's plot. I know what will happen in general to Albus, but the house he is in determines his character. Literally. In Cursed Child, he is in Slytherin, but aside from not considering that huge mess canon, I don't want to put Albus in Slytherin just to remark how different he is from Harry. I want a proper reason. In the epilogue, he expresses his fear of ending up in the Snake House to his father, and some people have taken it as a sign that he /knows/ he belongs in Slytherin, but, to be honest, Harry was afraid of being in Slytherin as well, and he turned out a great Gryffindor. I want to know what you think about it. Is Albus a Slytherin? A Gryffindor? Why?

PS: If anyone wants to check it out, I'll leave a link to the intro [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12489873/1/Albus-Potter-y-el-ladr%C3%B3n-de-fantasmas][here]]. It isn't a prologue or anything, just an author's note. It's in Spanish though, so that's a bit of a problem. If anyone you know wouldn't mind translating it, feel free to PM me.


** Is your story going to be in Spanish? :( I remember I wanted to check it out :( As for Albus, him being a Slytherin was one of the things I tolerated(liked?) in CC but I guess it depends on the traits he has in your story.

*** Unfortunately, yes. I could try and translate it, but it would take so much time, and to native readers, it would feel way too "technical", if you get my point. There's no way I could write how Hagrid speaks like, some translations would be terrible, and probably new words I'd need to make up would end up being a disaster once I had translated it. Take for instance the Pensieve. In the Spanish translation, it's called "pensadero". If I had to be the one to translate it to English, I probably would've gone with "thinker" or something of the sort. By writing it in Spanish, I can keep my writing as similar as Rowling's as I can, but the feeling would totally be lost if I had to translate it myself. I can get by with English, but I'm nowhere close to being a translator.

However, that doesn't mean I would never /ever/ translate it. If, by the time the first book is completed and posted, I hadn't had the chance to find a good translator, I wouldn't be against translating it myself.

If you want, I can help. I'm a native English speaker, and I've read the Harry Potter books in English first, so hopefully the translation process would go smoother.

I don't have any formal translation education though (besides being an interpretor for friends/family on trips) so if you want I can do a bit and you can choose whether you like it or not.

****** Yeah I speak Spanish. I'm no native speaker, but I'm comfortable speaking and I've read lots of young adult books in Spanish (Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, etc.) and taken a few literature classes in it (so we've read stuff like Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel García Márquez, etc.).

Feel free to PM me both (or just one if you want).

** I think that Harry fearing he is in Slytherin is different then Albus. Albus has a much clearer understanding of the houses and might see some Slytherin in him and is afraid that is where he'll go. Harry didnt have that understanding at 11.

However no where in CC does it show Albus should be in Slytherin. He had legit no traits of the house and the fact that Rose gets put in Gryffindor is ridiciulous. (Rose gets on the train and immediately sees it as an opportunity to make sure their social standing is secured. Thats SUPER Slytherin.) You can put Albus in anything but you just have to showcase those traits somehow. If you dont take any of CC seriously then putting Albus in Slytherin I think has something poetic about it and continues the last bit of the book series and I would personally do a Severus gone right kind of vibe instead of a more clueless Harry which is what we got for some reason.

** Well, if you completely ignore Cursed Child... Who knows? Albus Potter as he appears in the Epilogue doesn't have much of a personality. He could go anywhere.

That said, if you want to look at what would make for a better STORY, then Slytherin makes the most thematic sense. Slytherin means more challenge; even if Harry isn't going to disown Albus for being in Slytherin or anything, a lot of people will get really surprised that Harry Potter's son is in the house of his greatest enemy. Slytherin brings with it challenges and conflicts that would make for a more interesting story... plus, Albus in Slytherin is a good opportunity for a redemption arc for Slytherin as a house, and show that it doesn't have to be the "Junior Death Eater Camp" that Harry viewed it as in his Hogwarts days.

And, well. After all the worries about being Slytherin, it actually seems kind of anti-climatic NOT to put Albus in Slytherin.

I suppose putting him in Hufflepuff might also work, because that would come out of left field. "Not Slytherin, not Slytherin... WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HUFFLEPUFF?!"

The one house he should NOT be in is Gryffindor. Because Gryffindor is the least interesting option. EVERYONE else is in Gryffindor. Gryffindor is the "best" house, it's the house that gets all the glory and all the focus. Which means that Gryffindor is the "safe" option, the path of least resistance. Which again means that, for Albus as a character, Gryffindor is the boring option.

Put him in Gryffindor and he's just another Potter kid, there's noting unique or interesting about him at all. Put him in another house, and he becomes a lot more interesting.

** Well, putting someone in Hufflepuff pretty much guarantees you a bit of an underdog vibe if you want that.

** You're promoting an author's note? In somehing other than English?

Wait until you have a few chapters to promote your work.

*** It's mostly because I want to know in which house he'd be in, in a way that could fit this story. But I thought I had to add the "promotion" flair because I was talking about my own story and how the answer to this question could affect it.
