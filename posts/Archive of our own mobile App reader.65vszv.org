Hey all, I've been exclusively reading stuff off of fanfiction.net for years now, and a large reason are the e reader app that people have made to store and keep track of the stories.

Are there any apps like this out there that people would recommend?

Thanks much!


** I just download the AO3 stories using their simple 'Download' button. But I've never heard of an overall app.

*** I didn't realize they had a download button, I've not really been on their site, but see it on here all the time and it seemed like I was missing out on a lot of good stories.

Thanks for replying!

**** There are four options for the type of file to download: mobi, ePub, PDF, and HTML. I pick ePub so I can read it in iBooks, myself.

** I download stories as well, I just keep them all on my phone in iBooks and they're super easy to access and maneuver around once you remember which story is which

** Personally I just open it in Chrome. Once the chapter has been opened it doesn't need refreshed so no need to use mobile data. You can also use the open all chapters in one page option and get the entire fic. As long as you don't navigate away you can read it any time.
