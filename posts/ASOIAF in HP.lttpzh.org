HP characters had been put in Westeros a gazillion of times, but what would happen if it were the other way around? And I'm not talking about just moving everything about the to an HP setting and sorting Lannisters in Slytherin, Baratheons in Gryffindor, Arryns in Ravenclaw and Tullys in HUfflepuff... No! I say... imagine if several ASOIAF characters got their consciousness transported to the body of an HP character at the time of OotP, each one thinking that they're the only one that was transported. And we could end up with:

Jon Snow in Harry (because, why not?)

Ygritte in Ginny (I had to, sorry)

Arya in Neville

Ned in Sirius

Ramsay in Umbridge

Dany in Luna

Robb in Ernie Mcmillian

Cat in Molly

Brienne in Tonks

Euron in Voldemort (ASOIAF sexy witch-pirate Euron, not Show's Rockstar leather pants penis japes Euron)

Tywin in Lucius

Jamie in Draco

Cersei in Bellatrix

Tyrion in Dobby

Everyone else as their HP selves, because otherwise people find out what's going on way too quickly.


** Do they get magic power?

And Draco is going to shag Bellatrix?

**** Would they keep their HP counterparts memories then? Otherwise I have no clue of how they would be able to catch up to fifth year level, let alone the adults with magically intensive jobs like Tonks, and on the subject, what about the magic they /do/ have originally from ASOIF? Like, Arya's face-stealing, or Jon's warging (or his and Dany's affinity to dragons? Would it even cross considering that the type of dragons are different between universes?)

***** I think the most interesting way would be for them to have foggy memories. Enough to get by without being caught at first, but still needing to relearn stuff and causing a misunderstanding or 2.

I say yes to ASOIAF magic. Jon gets to watch Hedwig and Arya Trevor. Face stealing could be translated to something halfway to metamorphmagus. Dany would totally get affinity to dragons, though not mother-child levels

** Frankly the only reason ASOIAF characters are interesting is because they have power in their feudal system. Putting them in a HP-world seems silly because they wouldn't have any real power besides magic.

*** You should read ASOIAF again. Even when some people like Tywin turn around power (which I put here as Lucius)... that's not the deal with Brienne, Jaime or Arya.

It's hard to replicate the isolated refugee thing for Arya... But Draco seemed fitting for Jaime... who deals with honor and self-image.

Even in power there are many shades. Euron is not craving the same kind of political power Tywin has. Euron seeks a more otherworldly kind of power for himself, not some family name or institution. And he kind of control he wants to exert and fear he wants to provoke are more personal in nature. He could do wonders with Voldemort's skills and followers.

Ramsay likes a more physical sort of power. Not in paper but directly to feel a people's life and pleas on his fingers. He doesn't need the followers, but would love Umbridge's kind of localized power. And the blood quill.

**** Hmm I feel like Voldemort's personality was pretty bland in canon- he was just straight up insane. Euron could be the new and improved Voldemort. Fanon Voldemort.
