:END:
I am looking for a story and I don't remember a whole lot

It's set in the first year, Harry is a bit darker and much smarter than in canon. The only thing I can remember clearly is a scene where Harry is exploring the castle, he knows Snape is following him and he deliberately leads Snape into a more deserted area. Harry sets a trap for Snape and causes him to fall down the stairs, I think. Snape breaks at least a leg and as he is lying there Harry is just looking at him. Snape thinks Harry is insane and is afraid when he looks in Harry's eyes. I believe they talk a bit and eventually, Harry either goes for help or helps Snape to the hospital wing. I believe that after this Snape leaves, Harry alone. I may be mixing it up with another story but I think Harry may be handicapped in some way. He also may have figured out that Quirrell was harboring Voldemort, I think Harry calls but again I may be confusing it with another story.

I know it isn't much to go on but any help is appreciated.
