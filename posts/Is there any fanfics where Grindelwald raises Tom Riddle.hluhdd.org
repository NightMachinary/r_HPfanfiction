Like the title suggests. Let's say Grindelwald was never stopped, Albus just lets him go and Grindelwald eventually finds Tom Riddle before Dumbledore. Bonus points if there are any fanfics where Grindelwald becomes the Headmaster of Durmstrang and Gellert raises Riddle and taking him to study at Durmstrang.
