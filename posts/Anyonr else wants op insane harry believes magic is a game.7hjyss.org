I have been reading a few insane Harry's and videogame fics and my mind just went "wonder what awesomeness could be derived if harry went insane early on, thought his abilities was from videogames, saw gringotts, and went "ohmygod! A dungeon! Full of goblins and LOOT!", then went and got a party, and went and raided the shit out of gringotts?"

Anyone else feels like this could be the best thing ever? Anyone want to write this piece of awesomeness? /puppy eyes/


** I do. Won't write it tho.
