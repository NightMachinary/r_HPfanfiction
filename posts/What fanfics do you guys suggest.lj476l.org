I'm new to fanfics, and I don't know where to start

NO NSFW


** Harry Potter fanfiction covers pretty much every genre imaginable, so I'll ask you: What are you specifically interested in reading? Do you want to see events of the books through a different character's eyes? See a particular romance between two characters from the books? Find out what happened after either Book 7 or the epilogue? Or see more of the world outside Hogwarts or a more fleshed-out Wizarding World? Just some ideas.

**** The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks is probably the closest to canon of all of these. It's one of the first fics I read and a really well-written complete mystery.

Grow Young With Me is a highly recommended postwar romance that I haven't read.

The rest I'm gonna recommend are quite AU (alternate universe) meaning some important detail of canon has been changed and the course of canon is altered.

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, where Harry's twin brother is the Boy Who Lived, is always a good starter. It's incomplete, but it takes you all the way into fourth year.

Out of the Night will give you a good introduction to the independent Harry genre. It's also incomplete (unfortunately a symptom of a lot of fics) but plenty long.

Victoria Potter is a female Harry fic that is probably one of the most intelligently conceived things in the fandom. Features a really well-fleshed-out magical world and it's currently updating with two years complete.

I don't usually recommend this fic, but The Prince of Slytherin has gotten a ton of people into fanfiction these days, particularly fans of Sanderson/other contemporary fantasy. So go for that if you like long, epic stuff.

If you want something on the shorter, lighter side, or that sticks closer to canon, don't listen to me as my taste is pretty alternate universe focused.

  Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. AU world with a canonical tone. No canon rehash, no bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. Second Year complete as of Chapter 27.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
