First up, thanks for helping me out. Feedback is very important.

've been working on this plot for a while and I think I finally have it down. This is my first fanfiction and I want to write at least ten chapters. Can you give me your impressions?

It's basically going to be a romance story/tragedy about Bertha Jorkins and Chancellor Palpatine. It takes place right before Goblet of Fire before Bertha disappears. She's at the Ministry when she meets the Chancellor who is there on a diplomatic mission to discuss some things with Fudge (the Chancellor needs financial aid and Fudge agreed to loan them some money). While Bertha is at the ministry, she accidentally runs into the Chancellor and he apologizes and picks her books up. He loves her taste in literature and they immediately hit it off. They go to a coffee shop in London and stuff and soon they fall in love. But, Bertha is torn because Palpatine is a Muggle and she's a witch. The Wizarding World is too complex for him. Palpatine himself feels very sad that he can't use magic and feels unworthy of Bertha's love, but he's still torn between his political duties and his new girlfriend.

Things go wrong when the UK is ambushed by Krall and his swarm. They want revenge against the Wizarding World for the aurors destroying stuff on Altamid. Krall kidnaps Bertha Jorkins, leaving Palpatine distraught. Palpatine goes to Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix for help. Dumbledore sends Sirius and Snape to help him get Bertha back. They also forge an alliance with the Enterprise crew who are also tracking Krall through a wormhole. So, now Palpatine, Sirius, Snape, Kirk, Spock, and Uhura team up and pursue Krall.

They end up in Antarctica and get split up after their aeroplane crashes. Palpatine is alone, desperate and injured, but he manages to survive the cold for a while and find Krall. He sneaks in and rescues Bertha, but Krall shoots him and now Palpatine is injured and dying. It's up to Bertha to keep him alive until they're reunited with the others. Luckily, her love for Palpatine pulls them through the ordeal. They find the others and defeat Krall. At the very end, it's kind of bittersweet because Palpatine has to go back to his duties and Bertha knows that she can't be with him because of their differences in status. They embrace and kiss one last time and Palpatine leaves with Mas Amedda and the Senate Guards.

The next day, Bertha disappears. When Dumbledore informs Palpatine, the Chancellor is distraught and cries into his arms on his desk. He's never the same after that, but he knows that he will always remember Bertha Jorkins.

Thanks for your feedback.


** Alright, some rather brutal honesty is incoming.

This makes absolutely zero sense. Since you are referring to him as Chancellor Palpatine instead of Emperor, he is at this time the head of the /Galactic/ Republic, composed of hundreds, if not thousands, of systems and trillions of life forms (composed of a vast multitude of different species). Wizarding Britain (which I'm assuming is what you mean by Wizarding World) doesn't even equal 0.0004% of the population of Coruscant, the /capital/ of the Galactic Republic.

I have /literally/, and when I say literally I mean in the primary definition sense of the word, never read, seen or contemplated a sentence I have loathed more.

Palpatine is a /Sith Lord/. The only emotions he allows himself to feel are anger, hatred, rage, and fury. Every other emotion is turned into one of these to fuel their power. As the Code of the Sith says,

#+begin_quote
  Peace is a lie, there is only passion.

  Through passion, I gain strength.

  Through strength, I gain power.

  Through power, I gain victory.

  Through victory, my chains are broken.
#+end_quote

Love, friendship, companionship, are all chains to be broken, realized through their strength. Also, as I've said before, he is a /Sith Lord/. What the shit does he need magic for? He has telekinesis, limited telepathy, empathic senses, heightened physical capabilities (senses, strength, reflexes, endurance, hand-eye coordination, agility), real time limited battle precognition, foresight, can shoot lightning out of his hands, mind control, and /the list goes on/. What the shit is he missing out on? The ability to turn a cactus into a pumpkin? Whoop de fucking do. Doesn't need to worry about the Unforgivables. No way someone who is able to dodge blaster bolts and /lasers/ will be hit by a Killing Curse, the Imperious Curse would be thrown off very easily, and the Cruciatus Curse is just going to make him angrier.

... Oh, I get it now. You're just fucking with us.
