So, this time I am looking for a WBWL-Story where Harry's parents (or surviving parent!) admit they acted wrongly (which I've not found often so far! I can somewhat hazily remember one story where Lilly admits she never acted much like a parent for Harry because the BWL was always more important!)

So the stage is yours! As always:

Please no slash and only very well written Harry/Ginny!


** So my definition of well written is readable... which is not what others would consider well written. With that said how do you feel about unfinished stories?

linkffn(4019820) has what you want in later chapters. Mind you you've probably read that and the biggest complaint people have are that Ginny is a Mary Sue in the story.

With that said would have loved to read more along your lines though.

  When everyone thinks Harry's brother is the BWL, Harry rises from the shadow of the brother to become more than anyone expected. HG

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

**** It is not Harry/Ginny but it does satisfy your criteria of his (surviving) parent/s admitting that they are wrong.

***** I put this in not because I am especially looking for H/G, on the contrary: I am so fed up with this (to me!) out of left field paring (in canon!) that I will only read the fanfiction if it is truly remarkable! If it is not, I will simply not read this pairing anymore!

Hm...do I really need to make this more clear? Most people don't seem to recommend H/G to me, so it seems to work...hm...*shrug*
