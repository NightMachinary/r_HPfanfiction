OK, I don't know who was the first author to push this translation, but that is a bad one. A very bad one. In two ways.

The first is the fact that this translation is just wrong. Totally wrong.\\
/Vol/ can mean flight (as in, a flight of birds) or theft. I does not translate as to flee (which in french would be /fuir/, not /voler/)\\
/de/ can be translated as of, from, with, by, and several others. Interestingly, it's tranlated as /from/ when used with a depart point.\\
/mort/ is death, that is the easy one.

So, what does it means? It means that /Voldemort/ best translations would be "flight of death".

Now, let's see the second reason : Voldemort is not a funny scarecrow who didn't listen his french teacher, he is the fucking bogey-man that do come for you (and your family, friends, pets,...) if you dare whisper his name, and the general leading an army of such bogey-men (werewolves, dementors); he's the terrorist that put a society to its knees so efficiently that all but Dumbledore still fear saying his name ten years after his death; he's the handsome madman for which some among the highest starta of society damned themselves to years and decades of dementors influence, the assassin in the dark that reaches in the deepest fortress. He's Attila coming as the Hammer of God and leaving burnt soil where he passes.

[[https://us.123rf.com/450wm/grandfailure/grandfailure1511/grandfailure151100013/47848854-attaque-de-corbeaux-l-homme-fuir-vol-e-d-oiseaux-illustration-peinture.jpg?ver=6][He's the flight of crows that descend on you, and there's nowhere to hide, no way to fight]]

Well, that, and he's intelligent enough not to announce his one and worst weakness to the world. He presents himself, not as someone who flee death, but as someone who on his path defeated death and became a herald of death for his ennemies.

So please, please, this is a plea from a french speaker : stop with this trope (except maybe in some humoristic fanfic). Voldemort is not a comical character, he's the personification of the fall of the society. Against a society that's growing (see the Squib marches and Nobby Leach), he's the accusator; for the reactionaries, he's the light-bearer that will lead their armies; as a teenager and young adult, he's the tempting snake, full of unseen hatred and jealousy. Voldemort is the Ennemy, an eschatological figure, and the one that can fight him must go through death and resurection.

Making him "flee from death" destroys all that. It destroys the worth of Harry, the sacrifices of James, Lily, Sirius, Remus and Dumbledore, the passion of Hermione, the pathes of Ron and Neville.\\
And it sounds like a screech in a french speaker ear.


** It's been some years since I studied French, but I think your translation still /manquer le but./

First, we know that JK Rowling loves to play with names. Almost every single secondary character of importance, or places of importance, have significant names:

- Diagon Alley = Diagonally

- Nockturn Alley = Nocturnally "of the night"

- Madam Malkin's Robes = A Malkin is "an untidy woman"

- St Mungo's = [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Mungo][Mungo is a Scottish saint]] who was credited with restoring life to birds and being able to restart fires....basically sounds like he had wizarding skills.

- Umbridge = Umbrage "an offense or an annoyance"

- Severus = from the latin "to be stern," or "severe."

- Minerva = from the latin "for intelligence, or wisdom."

- Lupin = Lupine, "wolflike"

- Alastor Moody = Alastor was a epithet for Zeus that basically means "Scoundrel" and moody, as in "a person given to unpredictable changes of mood, especially sudden bouts of gloominess or sullenness."

- Pettigrew = Scottish slang for "a small man," an insult. We can definitely see that Pete Pettigrew was "small" in character (and in stature, and in his animagus)

- Sibyll Trelawny = Sibyl was a woman in ancient times who was thought to utter the prophecies of a god.

- Albus = white haired, fortunate

I could go on, I haven't touched "Malfoy" or "Nurmengard" or "Azkaban" or any of the many other names JK Rowling chose.

I would go with your second translation of /vol,/ and use "theft." Voldemort as "The Death Thief," is a closer translation, because he takes lives from his victims. He collects deaths and in so doing amasses his power. And as you pointed out--this makes him feared. It makes him evil. It makes him "he who must not be named" and there is no escaping Voldemort and The Death Eaters when they come for you in the night.

HOWEVER, I think the the most perfect translation is "The one who steals from death."

You are overlooking the significance of what drove Voldemort to create horcruxes in the first place! It was his disdain of his "weak" mother who didn't use her magic to save herself.....it was his fear of death....in fact, there are some powerful comparisons to be made with Dumbledore and Voldemort, both of whom quested to find eternal life (Dumbledore's ownership of the Elderwand, The Invisibility Cloak and the Resurrection Stone; or Dumbledore's +usage of the Alchemist's stone and his unnaturally long life+--this is perhaps a conversation for a different thread though.)

One who flees from death, or one who steals from death, either way you mince the translation--you cannot argue that Voldemort's overriding goal in the story is to survive. To overcome death (even at the cost of having a cursed, half-life). He spent his entire existence trying to avoid paying his dues to death. Death is no respecter of persons, it is the great equalizer between muggles, mudbloods, weak wizards, and powerful wizards: they all die. We all die. Even if we try to steal that which is rightfully Death's--eventually, Death will collect.

**** So just leave at "Stealing from death"? It lacks the artistry, but is a literal translation.

I maintain that in trying to translate something literally you end up missing a rather large and important part of translation.

How would you translate /Poser un lapin à quelqu'un/?

"To put a rabbit on someone" does NOT convey the meaning at all, it doesn't even make sense to an English speaker.

Or from /Pas piqué des hannetons,/ how do you get "Everything is going great!" To idiomize it in English you could say "It's going swimmingly," which likewise makes no sense in French...

With names, there will always be a bit of artistry in the translation. To say his name means "Stealing from death," and then shift that to "The one who steals from death" is not, I would argue, a "bad" translation (especially for a name).

Look at all the other names JK Rowlings chose--close, but not quite a literal translation. And that's okay.

Actually--if you don't mind--how did some of the other names get translated into French? Did she keep Umbridge or was it Ombrage?

***** Umbridge -> Ombrage in french. Not the best translation there is (I prefer Longbottom -> Londubat or Moody -> Maugrey)

And yes, you always lose something when you translate, which is why I just put an image in my first post : Voldemort evocates the murder of crow that projects its shadow upon you, flying over the land before it starts descending on you when you have nowhere to hide, no way to fight. It's death above, that is vaguely seen turning and cawing till it choose to plunge on it's prey.\\
And the name doens't have to reflect the goal: he does reflect perfectly well what he does to the society already.

It's suffocating and threatening. It goes excruciatingly well with what the whole society feels. Turning it into a clue and a joke all in one is just.... underwhelming. A waste. A mockery of the fight against him. It just feels like the author is a teenage who projects himself totally in the characters, and want to make them strong without understanding that it makes the fight and sacrifices worthless.

Yes, in some ways Voldemort is just an overgrown child having a temper tantrum at the whole world. But he is also the very intelligent man that subjugates a whole society, that makes it cower before his very real power

I would normally agree with you, except every single one of her characters (except perhaps Harry Potter himself) has a significance or joke behind their name. Even Ron, with Bilius (from bilious, "spiteful or bad tempered," which is clearly a joke as he's the most mellow and almost one-dimensional of characters), Hermione (meaning "well-born")....maybe Fred and George escaped her naming conventions (except they're Weasleys, "weasel-like," and that's quite a perfect moniker for two pranksters born on April 1st).

It may be perceived as weak or junior writing talent but I honestly think it's a way that JK Rowling projected adult humor into a children's book. The "inside jokes" with her names and characterization are quite over the top. That's what makes them work.

Now, as far as making it a trope in fan fiction? Eh. I don't know; I haven't read any fics centered around "The Name of the Dark Lord." I can't really judge if it's "obnoxious" or a "weak" display of writing talent.

But I still maintain that Voldemort--however you translate it (the "thief of death" or the "death that flies above")--is no more serious of a name than that of Tom ("twin," or "two halves") Marvolo ("ill will") and Riddle (a mystery).

Also thank you, I didn't realize rhe surbames for translated too (Londubat!).

But my point is that, while the heroes names hidden meaning are mostly positive, their ennemies names are negative in a threatening way : Bellatrix is the warrior, Rabastan and Rodolphus the snake and the wolf (and are brothers), Fenrir the wolf again, Alecto is a fury,...\\
Voldemort birth name is already somewhat dark; his nom de guerre takes him a step further: where in a child eye, Harry and his friends are courageous where the adults are not, an adult reader has a easier time understanding why the adults of the world are cautious and afraid.

Don't you think he would have chosen something more boisterous than 'flight' (which has connotations of escape and retreat) if that's what he meant. Like maybe defeater of death...

I'm sure JKR intended the double meaning, but I would posit that Voldemort isn't even self-aware enough to see his own obsession of fleeing from death as what it is. I think we are too much influenced by Dumbledore's psychoanalysis here. I wonder how Voldemort would describe himself and what drives him onwards...

It makes much more sense that Voldemort wanted to instill fear with his persona, not explain to everyone his deepest desires.

His name, with the death theme, is a mark of that.

My point is : you cannot translate Voldemort as 'flight from death' if you have any idea that translating means taking into account connotations and situations, you can only do it if you think that french is english with words in a bijection. Or if you want your Indy!Harry or your Super!Hermione to just make the plot appear out of their hat.

In this case, the connotation of vol/flight is just not the same in french and in english: in Le Cid, /va, cours, vole, et me venge/ (/go, run, fly, and avenge me/) said by Don Diègue launches his son Rodrigue toward a fight to the death against the father of his beloved, not from death but toward it. It is one of the best known verse of french theatre.

He used an anagram of who he was to fashion a name to become - in my mind other than sounding impressive it need serve no other purpose as his deeds would GIVE it meaning. However, JK played with names and their meanings over and over again in the books so as she knew his driving motivation was a "Flight from Death" she chose the name for him?

You're trying to understand Voldemort from an English Point of view, where the literal translation would lead to words that have different connotation in french and in english. Your knowledge of English, and the connotations of the english world of "Voldemort" is not wrong. But the name was not english to begin with. It was french. And the semantics, pragmatics and rules of English are absolutely not the same as those of French. They may look alike, as both languages strongly influenced themselves, but a lot of rules are still different enough to warrant French and English being different languages.

"Vol" and "Flight" not having the same connotation beyond a share of "Flying" is one of such different.

Before 1981, definitely not.

And if he knew any French, which would be a requirement for actually being able to pick his name apart, then /he/ would most likely stop at making sure that it doesn't mean anything totally pathetic because he only had a limited set of letters to work with and making it /sound/ bad in exchange for giving it some great meaning in French that nobody would get anyway because it would be in French is just not a thing that I expect him to do.

I have no doubt he did learn afterwards, either via his own research or via having one of his followers tell him. But this is a meaning that the people around him presume his name to have, not one that he actually chose when taking the name for himself and as such not one that actually is there.

Thank You so much for taking the time to write this up, I don't speak french fluently, but I live in Canada so i know a bit and I am working on becoming fluent. Anyways, this always seems to bug me when people bring it up in ff (and are being serious about it). I've even read some fics that take the idea that Latin is the root of some spell, connect latin to french and then try and claim waving a wand and saying /Feu/ will start a fire. That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Trying to translate something that may have roots in another language is incredibly difficult especially if it's unintentional and/or doesn't accomodate meaning and context. I can't just take a book written in German or French translate every sentence and then re-publish it in English, it wouldn't hold the same meaning hence why people take years to do so. Sorry, went a little further and off topic from what the OP was talking about but it's just an annoying trope.

**** Tom Marfuiro Riddle?

Armour Motif Riddle?

#+begin_quote
  "My name is Timor ^{~mumble} ^{mumble~} Riddle." the shade from the diary answered, mysteriously mumbling the middle.

  "I'm sorry, what?" Harry tilted his ear.

  "Timor ^{~mumble~} Riddle."

  "I...I still can't hear you."

  "Timor Rumoaf Riddle!"

  "...Wha?"

  "Look, one of my ancestors got drunk and had a thing against the Romanov dynasty, so he changed his name, and the damn name's been in our family tree ever since. Just drop it! Leave me alone!" the shade of Timor Riddle crossed his translucent arms and sulked.

**** Sounds like the name of someone I'd expect to crossdress. Probably because of the fuir--frill word similarity.

**** Not quite. Fuir la mort would be the correct one.

Fuir de la mort, could also work.

*** Frankly, it doesn't really sound good in french. 'flight from death' just don't translate very well in french.\\
/Fuit la mort/ is a possibility, but does not sound very natural.

Now, to the why of the result of google translate (and probably the why of the error in the first place): it is a word for word, technically correct, translation; google is just not good enough yet to take into account the connotation and hidden meaning of words: a /vol/ is 'flight' as in a 'flight of birds', not 'flight' as in 'fleing something'.

** I personally see the "Flight From Death" those who fear his name, he is death and the people who even fear a whisper of his name "fly" from his name they Flee from their Deaths

Voldemort doesn't run from death because he IS Death, Immortal, Immutable, Unending Death
