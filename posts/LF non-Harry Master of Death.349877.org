All of the MoD stories have Harry Potter unite the Hallows and become the Master of Death. Does anyone know of a story where someone else (and OC perhaps) unite the Hallow instead? And perhaps one that has a cool explanation for them?


** try this Harry Potter And The Elemental's Power [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4118383/1/]]

and this The Keeper [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4307907/1/]] the second i suggested is more what u asked

*** Right-o, So I read up 'til the third chapter of Harry Potter and the Elemental's power and I'll admit it's decent so far but I must ask, does it get more consistent? That's what's putting me off. One minute Harry is using his magic to terrify the Dursleys into submission and then all of a sudden he's back to being plain old Harry who allows the Dursleys to push him around.
