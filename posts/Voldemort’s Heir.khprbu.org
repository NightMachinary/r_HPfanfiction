Hey everyone! I'm looking for a few goods fics where Harry is Voldemort's heir. I have a few optional pointers that would be appreciated but aren't needed:

- smart harry
- harry joins voldemort on his own
- no relationships (but if there are no slash)
- manipulative dumbledore
- weasly bashing
- dark/grey harry

the only thing i really don't want is ginny and harry getting together.

anyway please link a few good fics below I'm dying for some good stories!

(if the flair is incorrect please let me know i just guessed it)


** Summaries are copied from works.

*For Want of a Soul*, by tiraen What if Arcturus Black, the Patriarch of The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, decided to interfere when his grandson was sent to Azkaban without a trial?\\
What if Sirius took guardianship of Harry when he was seven years old?\\
What if Sirius was interested in redeeming the name of his house?

A very different Harry starts at Hogwarts, making all new friends and enemies. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1071859]]

*Harry Potter and the Demon Inheritance*, by ZeldaZinklow Harry gets something on his 16th birthday that he did not expect and his world is turned completely upside down. He discovered both truth and lies, enemies become allies and people he once trusted becomes enemies. Harry's now got something he never had before, a choice to make his own path in life. Dumbledore bashing. Ron bashing and him being a little bit of an arse. Malfoy is a friend. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26841265]]

*Triple Trouble*, by E4mj Dumbledore would regret the decision to hand over the school letters to the house elves, even if it did save him hours in admin. Eleven year old Harry Potter was expected... Tom Riddle and Gellert Grindelwald... yeah, not so much. However that might turn out to be the least of the school's problems. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12983913]]

*Surrender*, by Sirensong39 Harry has had enough of the repeated abuse, the excuses, the yearly challenges. So when he's offered the chance to surrender and cease the constant pain and torment... he grasps it with both hands and won't let go.

Voldemort had given the offer flippantly, purely meant as a distraction so he would have time to think of something better. He expected a rant about how the Golden Boy would never join someone like him, he expected a fight, he expected - something. But what he got was the complete opposite.

A year after this exchange Voldemort comes for him, finally ready to make good on his promise, Harry practically runs to him. But both are going to find their expectations of each other crushed as truths come to light and manipulations are revealed. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18163526]]

*a wolf in sheep's clothing*, by veinsofelectric the ‘boy-who-lived' they call him, cursing or praising his name when they feel it suitable. then the boy meets a man who truly does not care for the boys status; the man then meets a young boy who does not understand nor bother for his own reputation either. unintentionally the man has just changed the world as they know it by changing the boys views.

and underneath the blue moon the start of something beautiful yet dangerous blooms. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23704723]]

*Harry Potter and the Mistakes of a Past Reality*, by the15thDoctor Harry Potter gets transported back to Dudley's birthday, right before he gets his Hogwarts letter. No longer being a naive eleven-year-old boy just glad to leave the Dursleys, Harry starts to notice something fishy's going on. With his second chance, Harry makes a series decisions that will change to course of history forever. AD/MW/RW/GW bashing. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7990540]]

*Bone of the Father | You Will Renew Your Son*, by CatNip_618 The first Occlumency lesson rips apart a life-long glamour and reveals who Harry Potter's parentage really is. It reveals years of lies by a twinkly-eyed Headmaster.\\
Order of the Phoenix AU. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24173476]]

*Harry Potter: Lord of Nothing*, by Tempest_Novastorm In the short time after Voldemort's defeat at the infant hands of Harry Potter, Snape and fellow Death Eaters gather at the Riddle house to find out what had happened. But what if Snape's grief-ridden mind gave him an idea like no other? What would Voldemort do when he returns, only to find the Death Eaters' loyalty have changed? DarkLord!Harry, Dumbledore bashing, Good Death Eaters. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19754857]]

*Harry Potter's Dark Life*, by Tempest_Novastorm Harry's life as the brother of the boy who lived, but the truth is opposite. A dark Harry, Wrong BWL, Dumbledore bashing, good Snape fanfiction. Pairings and Ratings may change later. Not your normal Dark Harry story.

Voldemort has a master, who is actually the one pulling the strings of what the Dark side needs to do to win. But of course, no Death Eaters know. Just who is this Lord... Curse? [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19755082]]

** I remember reading one where Lily was related to Voldemort and literally named Tom Riddle as guardian in her will. It started around 4th year and Harry ended up helping with Voldemort's rebirth voluntarily and went to live with him afterward, but I just can't remember what the title was. Moody was also revealed to be Barty Junior's godfather. And I also remember Harry and Barty Junior working together with Voldemort to get Harry to Voldemort for an alternative rebirth ritual they had to set up since discovering Harry didn't consider Voldemort his enemy. Also, Tom Riddle was considered to be a separate person from Voldemort since he had left a bunch of scientific work to be mailed to be published while he was incapacitated, so the Tom Riddle persona never actually disappeared from the public eye, he was just thought a recluse, I think?
