Title's fairly self-explanatory - I'm just looking for a story that goes into what went down at Hogwarts while the Trio were on the run. If it could be kept decently close to canon with regard to romance and all that, that'd be much appreciated.


** *Not From Others*, linkffn(11419408), is by far the best year 7 Hogwarts story out there. It has the fewest canon violations compared to other similar stories. I especially like how Snape was done here: not too nice, not too evil, just enough to maintain his cover and protect the students.

  She may not have been able to join Harry, Ron and Hermione, but Ginny refuses to go down without a fight. As war approaches, Ginny returns to Hogwarts to resurrect Dumbledore's Army and face the darkest year the wizarding world has ever seen. DH from Ginny's POV. Canon.

****** I agree, i read it right after a canon read through, and noted that everything specifically mentioned about the hogwarts happenings does in fact happen.

That said, its so dark and overdone that there's no way it would ever be what happened in canon, even considering the darker turn the later HP books took.

So everyone is right! Its canon compliant, since it doesn't once contradict or leave out something from canon. It isnt canon compliant, since the freedom taken to expand the canon hints about how bad it is at hogwarts goes so far past anything that would be allowed to happen in JK's world.

My vote, read it! Its dark and gritty, but an enjoyable story. It tells a story that fits canon in some senses, and turns the core of the DA into a BA resistance group. Those changes move some characters away from canon personalities, but generally not so far off that they are unrecognizable. Mostly, read it since as far as fanfiction goes its top tier.

***** Obviously the amount of out of character is a somewhat subjective thing, particularly considering the main protagonist is a /relatively/ small role in canon. So lets set aside our difference in opinion on the amount of OOC for now and focus on your other point.

You say that it claims to be canon compliant: I agree, it makes that claim. You argue that it is *not* canon compliant because it includes non!canon events. That, I think, is a misunderstanding of the phrase canon compliant.

Canon compliant does not preclude non!canon events. Lets consider a popular type on oneshot, a "missing moment". For simplicities sake, lets go with a missing moment between Harry and Ginny in his 6th year. They had a short lived, but intense romance that started after a quidditch match and continued until dumbledore's funeral. While we read that it was some of the best times of Harry's life, we see very few specific events that occur during a fledgling romance. So, perhaps a fanfiction writer takes it upon themselves to write about a walk around the grounds, which ends near the black lake. Harry and Ginny are holding hands, they skip some stones, snog behind a tree, and talk about their dreams and desires.

This "missing moment" is a non!canon event, it never is expressly described. However, it is still canon compliant in that it *expands on* an aspect of canon, namely harry and ginny's relationship, without introducing anything that *contradicts* canon.

If non!cannon events make a story canon divergent, then no fanfiction could ever be considered canon compliant. Obviously what authors and readers mean when they say canon compliant is a story that *expands on* canon through non!canon events *without contradicting* canon.

So, lets revisit what you actually might be referring to...

1) Are there any events that you can state were in canon that were supposed to happen at hogwarts or in the view of a PoV character during the DAYD story that were not mentioned in the fanfiction? Or,

2) Can you state how a specific one of the added non!canon events of DAYD contradicted canon?

If you cant do one of these things i dont see how you can make a blind claim that DAYD is not canon compliant. I would be able to understand feeling the story did not fit the /spirit/ of canon, but as that is a more subjective issue, much like "how much OOC is too much OOC", i would request that be set aside for now.

Im sorry if my reply seems excessive, but it bothers me when people make overarching claims that if true could be easily proven, without providing anything to back them up. Its like saying "the people shouting the loudest must be right, because they are the only ones i can hear."

****** I see what you're saying here, but I think there are some major factors that make it not canon compliant (WARNING SPOILERS):

- Snape: We know that at some point in her life, Ginny names her son after Snape. I'd assume that this means that he wouldn't expressly threaten her life or hurt her maliciously. The idea that she'd name her son after someone that sent her, Neville, and Luna out into the woods to fight werewolves is ridiculous. In this fic Snape is taken from being a complex grey character to being a mustache twirling villain-- no matter your opinion on the man's character, it's canon that he was received as a positive person (if not a hero) post battle.

- Krum: This is more of a logical WTF moment-- Viktor Krum would lose his life to save Neville and Hannah to rescue them from the Ministry... and then they go back to school without any repercussions?

- Magic: While I'm certain that magic is much more complex and varied than what we see from Harry's point of view, the magic used in DAYD is excessively different. Surely Hermione would have the equipment that Neville/Luna/Ginny/Ernie use to go after the sword, or have at least researched some of the complex spells that the Patils or Seamus does. Not to mention Neville and Luna doing wandless magic.

I see why the fic is popular. It goes about talking about Year 7 in an adult way, not glossing over the horrors of war. But at the same time, it ignores much of the world that Rowling built-- Neville /grows/ into a leader over the year, and just starting him as a war general is unrealistic.

******* Here we go! This is what i wanted. Because contradicting canon doesn't have to be a direct contradiction, it can be a contradiction through logical extrapolation.

- Snape: Naming future children after him is a good point, although i dont see an issue with him. Following harry's PoV, we see snape as a horrible teacher who aggressively antagonizes Harry and tries to get his godfather kissed by a dementor. He kills dumbledore. The only redeeming features he has are gained after death, when he is shown to have killed dumbledore on dumbledore's order, and been a spy for the whole time. To me, this would make me respect him for making hard choices, but would not be enough to overwrite 6 (7) years of horrible behavior, at least not enough to warrant naming a child after him. Sending kids out to the forest during a full moon to keep his cover during 7th year doesnt seem that outlandish, and still naming a child after him doesnt seem like much more or a stretch. And iirc, some DA members got the feeling snape was subtlely protecting them during the story, so there is still a shadow of grey in his character.

- Krum: yes, this is a weird and very hard to swallow scene. I admit it makes for good fodder when describing why you dont like the story, or feel that its progression isnt believable, but it does not make it canon divergent. We do not know if Krum lives or dies, he isnt mentioned past the 5th book iirc. So having him die, and Neville/Hannah live with no consequences is very much a WTF moment, but not a canon divergent moment as far as i can tell.

- Magic: Many liberties were taken with magic, i agree. The wandless magic would be your best point for making it non canon compliant, since its never used. An argument could be made its possible because of the harry/dementor wand lights up scene, but that still had a wand involved. So ill give you that, although wandless magic is a small canon divergence on the scale of most fanfiction. As far as fancy spells the patils/seamus used, they had the hogwarts library as a resource and a different focus on their learning. Hermione needed to charm her bag, pack horcrux research books, and learn how to hide while on the run in the first half of summer. The others had all 7th year, and possibly more help researching. The equipment used in the break in to snapes office was provided by the weasley twins iirc, and the golden trio had no way to get in contact with them while being on the Run.

- Neville: his character development is forced quickly, i agree. But since we dont know the specifics of what went down at hogwarts from canon, we can't say with certainty that neville wasn't appointed leader right away. He is the oldest remaining part of the ministry 6 at hogwarts, giving him more experience than others, and an "age inspires confidence" vibe to the younger years.

To sum up: i think your best point for canon divergence was the different magic system, particularly wandless magic. But since the magic system in HP is largely ill defined, its hard to say at what point additional HP spells start to change canon.

Many of your other points show liberty being taken with canon, stretching believability, but individually i dont see them as breaking canon compliance. Perhaps with more than 3 examples you could make a "straw that breaks the camels back" argument though :)

******* I think it's because so much of it seems so ridiculous and out of touch compared to the original text, sometimes even offensively so. A very basic example, Seamus suddenly talking in very poor Irish dialect, despite never having being written that way. Everything seems so exaggerated and odd that while I can certainly see it being an exciting and enjoyable story it's frustrating to see people calling it their headcanon.

Some parts I also found quite offensive, the portrayal of women and ethnic minorities especially so. There are ways of exploring foreign magic tactfully, and having multiple characters suddenly reveal stereotypical and exoticised talents in the first chapter is not one of them.

I have nothing against people who like it, at all. There's a place for super dark fics and it's popular for a reason, I see that. But I don't think it's a good fic, and I don't think it's a realistic portrayal of what would have happened that year.

******** Ok, so you dont like it. You think its not a good story, its not believable as an extension of canon, and it has offensive stereotypes.

Those are all great reasons why you dont like it. But they are not reasons that it is not canon compliant.

Seamus is Irish, and so an author giving him an Irish accent is not very farfetched, particularly considering how little he talked in canon. You may not like it, but its still canon compliant.

Different ethnicities and their magic were not delved into in canon. The majority of what we know about the patils are they are pretty, padma is smart and pavarti is pretty "girly" - they were very small characters in canon. You can argue (as a previous poster did) that the new magic is not canon compliant, but i would rebuff that the magic system in HP is relatively ill described, and its hard to draw a line where new spells break canon compliance.

Feeling that the story contains offensive descriptions, bad stereotypes and an unrealistic storyline do not make a story non canon compliant. Being annoyed that other people like the dark and gritty story of DAYD as their headcannon does not mean its not canon compliant. The only thing these things mean is that *you don't like the story*, which is a perfectly reasonable opinion that does not change whether the story is canon compliant or not.

********* Stan Shunpike, the Carrows, Mundungus Fletcher all talk far less than Seamus and have clearly written dialects in the books. Seamus does not. I don't disagree that as he's Irish it's likely he'd have an accent, but clearly it's not that strong, and it's something that's inconsistent with canon from the very start. You may like it, but it's not canon compliant. I know it's a really small example, but it's the first thing that bugged me.

I'm not going to go into why the ethnic magic was wildly offensive, but the fact that it was so ridiculous is another reason it's not very canon. I know you disagree, but plenty of people, myself included, consider tone and content of a fic to align with canon in someway. That doesn't mean it can't be a bit exaggerated or more grown up (angst and sex and so on), but it does have to be something I can reasonably see happening. And I'm sorry but that, along with the other ridiculous plot lines and reactions of female characters are just so wildly out of sync with what we can consider canon. The ethnic magic was contrived, had very little research behind it, and it seemed bizarre that all these students would suddenly be like "oh yeah, I forgot I have these amazing abilities that I never thought to mention before LOL". It's not that I don't like dark and gritty stories - I can recommend many, but I am not the only one that considers this one slightly AU at best.

Look, you asked why people are downvoting you. I'm not one of them, I tend to forget that the arrows even exist to be honest. But here's my answer - you're being a little difficult. People have different interpretations of canon, but when people request canon fics, they tend to want something that feels realistic and in line within the defined Harry Potter universe. We may disagree on that, and that's fine, but that's the reason people are downvoting you, and why this particular fic gets downvoted whenever people gush about how canon it is.

********** So when you say canon compliant, you mean more than just "a story that expands on canon without contradicting it". You also mean a story that has the same "feel" as canon, something with a reasonably similar voice that feels like an extension of canon in both its content and its writing. Thats where we differ, which is fine by me.

I asked why people were downvoting because at the time, my previous post was sitting at -2 with no responses, when all it said pretty much boiled down to setting the stage for a discussion about DAYDs canon compliance. I posited a definition for canon compliance (which it seems you disagree with slightly), and asked for specific examples of how DAYD voided that definition of canon compliance.

I wanted to know why no one responded, but still felt the need to downvote. I did enjoy the story, though because of how dark it is compared to JKs world i dont view it as my headcanon. But regardless of my opinion, i was tried to word my original post in a fairly non-biased way. It wasnt a ringing endorsement of the story, it wasnt an attack on those that think it isnt canon compliant, it was a discussion prompt.

Subsequent replies have pitted me as a story supporter (which i am) as i try to counter yours (and others) well reasoned replies, to discuss the compliance. An incomplete or wrong definition of canon compliance is a viable discussion point, since without agreeing on that definition, or at least considering the same definition during our arguments, we would be talking in circles.

Im not trying to be difficult by any means, i started being honestly confused (and tbh, a bit frustrated) by the non canon compliant claims that were being bandied about without any support whatsoever. Then i was confused why a post that presented a definition of canon compliance and asked for examples of divergence would be downvoted with no replies. Then i got into the discussion (which may be slightly out of place in a request thread) and was poking holes in reasoning in an attempt to reach the core truth about DAYD: is it, or is it not, canon compliant.

I take a broad view of canon compliance, since i dont feel any fanfiction authors can reach the same feel of prose that JK did and so i take a strictly factual view. If others don't, they should have (and still could) present a viable alternative definition of canon compliance that we could discuss, instead of downvoting a discussion prompt.

*********** People can't be bothered to try and convince you, so they downvote you. It isn't fair, but it's reddit. Where I and others have provided examples of non-canon stuff, you've disagreed in such a way that it's obvious your mind won't be changed - no definition of canon will ever match yours exactly, and I know you don't mean it, but you've come across as a little aggressive in the way you're trying to 'poke holes in reasoning'. People have given support, you've just disregarded it.

I think it's probably best we end it - we're just going to end up going round in circles.

************ Rereading my replies, i can see how they might seem aggressive. My friends and family like to have random discussions like this, and points/counterpoints tend to be worded in more forceful ways, which has bled into my wording for my replies. Its much easier to differentiate between strongly worded adamant arguments and aggressive arguments when you have visual and vocal cues to interpret as well as textual cues.

I can also see how i came across as unconvincable, though thats more by design. I worded my replies from a very hardline stance in order to better dissect the proposed reasons -- i may not have mentioned it enough, but i thought most of the points others made had some good reasonings, and had we continued for 1 or 2 more rounds hammering out those ideas and more i may have been convinced DAYD is not canon compliant. Obviously this backfired on me, because in a text based discussion people will stop trying to convince those they see as unconvincable since it takes 15 minutes to type up a well reasoned reply whereas in a face to face discussion it takes about a minute to reply, and you can see how they may react to a different wording/new idea without much cost.

Thanks for pointing this out to me, Ill need to pay attention to both of those things in future reddit discussions i take part in.

As far as canon compliance goes, unless the community has a somewhat agreed upon definition of it that i am unaware of (as we have both stated our versions which differ in key ways), any discussion of canon compliance like this will come down to an aspect of personal preference, which really isn't conducive to factual discourse as we have somewhat proven.

Regardless, i hope there are no hard feelings and i just want you to know: i enjoyed the discourse, and am sad my poor reddit discussion skills made you enjoy it less.

************* For what it's worth, I do think it was a shame you were downvoted so much. If I had my way, I'd scrap the system entirely, fake internet points don't matter and they just make people feel bad.

************** See, it wasnt so much that it made me feel bad (i know i put something like "laughing and crying", but that was more for flowery wording). I mostly just couldnt see a reason to downvote it. I know this sub has a "like the story/point upvote ,dislike it downvote" policy, which may not be ideal but is understandable. But when discussion /prompts/ are downvoted because you dont even want to take part, thats just a sad day for our little community.
