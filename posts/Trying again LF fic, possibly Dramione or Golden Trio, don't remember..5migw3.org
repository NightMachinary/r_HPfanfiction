The only thing I remember from this is a house party where Luna has found (and has gifted to friends) a new type of bird that, when its beak is pressed to vinyl, operates exactly like a record player. It then plays Tears for Fears' "Everybody Wants to Rule the World."

I've spent a year searching. I've hit Google, FFN, and AO3 (the only two places I could've seen it) with the lyrics, line-by-line - NOTHING!

Please, for the love of the Albus, could you help me find it?
