Fleur/Hermione: pretty much everything about them or just fleur in a femmeslash pairing (don't judge please, it's just a huge guilty pleasure of mine). But what I really want is a well written FIC without a lot of of Angst, just a laid Back story with reasonable lenght.

Bellatrix/Hermione: not overly angsty (well as much as possible, vivem the characters), specially the kind where Hermione goes back in time. Oh and where bellatrix isn't too mad.

I've read a lot of them on fanfiction.net and I'd like to know if there's more around.


** This is a super-AU that takes place in a high school in the US, and it isn't very long, but it is the only Fleur/Hermione I've read and it's pretty good.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/99714][Full of Surprises]] by Vipersweb. Other pairings include Harry/Luna and Ginny/Pansy.

It was decent, but it's the only Fleur/Hermione I've ever read.

For some reason, the https site doesn't work if the "www" is left out.

****** I totally forgot! Try this c2, it's got a dumb name but there were at least 4 or 5 good fics with the Fleur/Hermione pairing. I'd link right to them but I'm on mobile ATM.
