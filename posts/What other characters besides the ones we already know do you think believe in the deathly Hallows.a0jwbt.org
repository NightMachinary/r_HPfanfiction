Title


** Gregorovich knew about the Elder Wand, so it's possible that he believed in the existence of the other two as well.

Dedalus Diggle is eccentric even for a wizard. He strikes me as someone who could believe them to be real. But that's pure headcanon without any evidence in the books.

** Quite a lot of Knockturn Alley dwellers, I would suppose. For similar reasons, Gringotts --- they would obviously have kept /very/ close track of Invisibility Cloaks owned by their clients, and so it would not have escaped them that the Peverell/Potter line seemed to have an unbelievably durable one.

** I think the Deptartment of Mysteries staff would be an even split. I can imagine some of the muggleborns who hear about it after coming to Hogwarts might get excited about it, but forget about them by the time they leave. Weirdly, I don't think that Bathilda Bagshot does, even though she is the most likely to know the circumstantial evidence. No canon evidence either way, just my own feelings - I imagine she would be very sceptical about them being real. I also think some of the magical WWII veterans who saw Grindelwald with their own eyes might believe in the Elder Wand.
