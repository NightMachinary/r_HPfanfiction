Just that, looking for stories where nothing changes about Remus, except that he is instead a girl. I'm looking mostly for non-dark reads, and a F!Lupin X Sirius pairing would be loved. Anything like that around?


** Wow. I really would love to read that.

*** I did a little searching and came across this one. It has grammar/spelling errors (and in Chapter 5 I was really confused because the author kept saying 'couching' when she meant to put 'coughing'...) but if you can look past the errors its pretty funny and adorable. I laughed out loud more than once. I would definitely recommend reading it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4823551/1/A-Girl-Called-Remus-Lupin]]

**** I skimmed the first chapter but I think from-the-start-female!Remus is what OP may be looking for. It's certainly my preference over suddenly-female!Remus.

** I've read one, and liked it very much. Then again, I'm a sucker for fluffy stories. This one is a one-shot, I hope you don't mind.
