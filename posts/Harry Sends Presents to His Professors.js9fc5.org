:END:
I remember a fanfiction where Harry sends out gifts to all his professors. Will also take any recommendations for fics in this genre as well. The one I am thinking of he even sent one to filch.


** Is it this one?

** The only one I can think of offhand is the expansion of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/Enter-the-Dragon][Enter The Dragon]] (FFN original written by Doghead Thirteen, expanded on QQ by Dunkelzahn). After finding that a giant snake has been raiding his spider-stash, Harry confronts it and kills it by breaking its neck, then he drags its 60ft corpse to the great Hall to ask what he should do with it.\\
After getting instructions on how to preserve the meat, Harry decides that there is too much even for him to eat before it goes off, so he gives huge steaks of meat to the teachers and some other friends (including the Centaur Herd of the Forbidden Forest).\\
Dumbledore later uses the meat he was given as part of his moves to intimidate Lucius Malfoy into not being so obviously evil/law-breaking.

Note - The QQ version of the fic (at the time of writing) hasn't (as far as I can tell) gone near NSFW levels, but it does make references to things like brainwashing, slavery and human trafficking. As such, I am refraining from posting any links towards it.

** I believe this happens in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9969014/1/Seasons-of-change][Seasons of Change]] - linkffn(9969014) I know it starts with them giving out presents to the professors for sure.

  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.

**** Yeah, it's unfortunately not the fix I'm thinking of but also was never a fan of that fic because of the like, shame put upon Harry for not giving his relatives a present and also I dislike, his forced involvement of Dudley. Not to say Dudley is unreemable, but why does the person whom he bullied always have to be involved. It's just a toxic narrative imo.
