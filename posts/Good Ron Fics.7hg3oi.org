Hey, I tried to search for some but couldn't find anything. I've always disliked fics where Ron is completely bashed. I know he wasn't perfect in cannon but he did pretty fucking good for being a normal guy dealing with all the shit the trio went through. I'm not really looking for a fic where Ron is super powered or anything, just one that shows Ron being loyal (mostly) and pretty good friend I always thought of him in the books. Just a normal guy who tried his best to help even though his two best friends are technically more useful than him. I do prefer harry centric fics, but am open to more. Thanks in advance!


** My fic, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) and its sequel linkffn(The Chessmaster: White Knight) feature a strong Ron as one of the main characters.

Honestly doesn't show Ron in the best of light at times with his usual stubbornness but always with the best of intentions.

** If you don't mind an alternate take on Ron, I very much like the Weasley Girl series. The premise is simple: In this universe, Ron is a girl. Fem!Ron, with the imaginitive name "Veronica," is hotheaded and sarcastic like her male counterpart, but being the first-born daughter in the family means she has slightly different hang-ups and priorities than a sixth-born son would have. linkao3(6130632; 3721921; 3793561)

  AU, Sequel to "Weasley Girl." In an alternate universe where Ron Weasley was born a girl, and where Harry's first Hogwarts year turned out a little different as a result, the famous "Potter's Gang" are back for their second year at Hogwarts and hoping perhaps for a calmer year... ...but with a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light, it looks like this year will be at least as eventful and dangerous as the previous one. Second novel in the "Weasley Girl" Trilogy. Fem!Ron, everyone else is their canon gender.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

  February 29, 1980. Leap Day. At the Burrow, Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred and George, and (sigh) Great Auntie Muriel are waiting for the newest Weasley brother to be born. But something unexpected is about to happen. One-shot, prelude to the "Weasley Girl" trilogy.
