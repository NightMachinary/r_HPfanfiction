"/Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too --- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest./"

If you could control that, and deliberately miscast spells to do things like that, It'd make a hell of a battle style. Either crack or serious, you could use it in Combat, especially if you could conjure it on them, and not you.


** Could be amusing, but as far as I understand it, the point is that you risk ending up casting a totally different spell than the one you meant to cast. The point is, "failing" to cast whatever Baruffio was trying to cast is nothing more than successfully casting a Buffalo-Conjuring Charm. So you might as well just learn that spell.

True, Baruffio likely didn't /know/ the Buffalo-Conjuring Charm, and thus learned something new through his mistake, but you couldn't just randomly mispronounce existing spells in the hope that you'd stumble upon an existing, useful one that you were too lazy to look up normally; not only would this waste time, but if you're rushing in blind like that you might accidentally cast a spell that sets your hair on fire or kills all your loved ones in a 10-miles-radius or /who/ knows what.

*** "Harry, use the Metronome" Harry used Explosion! That WOULD make a great Crackfic...

I was thinking more playing on the fact that "I mispronounced a spell, but my opponent would just assume i mispronounced the levitation spell, not accidentally summoned a Winged Guardian" It's a less extreme example of "Silent Cast whilst saying the wrong incantations"

Unless the Buffalo-Conjuring charm doesn't truly exist, and can ONLY be cast by miscasting whatever Baruffio's spell was, and there are other effects like that, which would make a WAY better fic.

** I remember reading about Harry (it could've been from "The Life he Leads", but I'm not sure) where he was trying to learn to use Sonorus and discovered a "variant" of this spell by pronouncing the first syllable as the tonic, creating basically a grenade sound, which he then later used offensively. Could've been Path to Power. I honestly can't pin point where it is from.

** HPMOR and Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin both have something along these lines, but it's near the end/most recent updates in both of them, and they're pretty long.
