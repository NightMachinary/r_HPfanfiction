I'm quite interested in how authors tried to tie up loose ends before all was revealed in Half-Blood Prince!

It doesn't strictly have to be finishing the series, like the Psychic Serpent trilogy :) Thanks!


** One of the classic (older) stories of this type is sib's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]], a story that could well have worked as an alternative book 6.

** You didn't specify, so I suppose I ought to ask: have you any issues with pairings and subjects? I have a few pre-HBP fics to offer, but several focus primarily on pairings--specifically some Harry/Draco, a couple of Hermione/Snape, and one Harry/Ginny. Also I have a rec that contains a lot of graphic gore and violence, plus some Weasley/Dumbledore bashing.

**** Very well, but I have to confess it's been some time since I read the H/G and I cannot say how much focus the pair gets.
