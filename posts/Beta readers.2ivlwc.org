We hear a lot about writers on this forum, but I'm curious about our editors. Why do you all do it? What got you into beta-ing for writers? How do you choose the story you beta for? Have you ever quit on someone? Does it grind your gears when you read stories that are good, but are in dire need of a better editor? Tell me what it's like being the unsung heroes of fanfiction.

**** I like the feeling that I'm refining ore into metal; that by my own hand I am helping something transition from raw ideas into a clear, well-expressed product. To be honest, as a writer it is very very easy for me to fall into the trap of continually re-editing my own works rather than actually writing new materials or chapters.

** I did it for a while, but I had to stop when I could no longer give my authors the time to do a good job. In that experience though, I learned one beta isn't enough to do everything.

My specialty was in grammar, description editing, and aiding in plot development in specific shows. Grammar by far is the hardest for me. Having to tell someone a specific grammatical fix 900 times is irritating; but getting tot help someone's vision come to light is amazing. Helping someone make their creation solid and helping them make it better...there's nothing as cool as that. Being that cheerleader is rewarding.

I always suggest people become betas; everyone has something they can do. Continuity, grammar, keeping characters /in/ character, important details of cannon that need to be kept; everyone can do something. In the process of beta-ing, you learn a lot about how you can write, ways to improve yourself as a writer, and things that you should never do.

*** Do you ever miss beta-ing? It sounds like it was something you enjoyed, do you ever wonder about getting back into it?

**** I do miss it, and I have thought about it, but I have been neglecting my own stories for a couple years now. I need to get my own stories on a high priority before I can expect myself to put someone else's up there too. If I was directly asked,I would probably do it, though.

** I'm very thankful for my beta, but I couldn't be a beta myself. I would feel way too much pressure. I procrastinate enough on my /own/ stuff, y'know?

They really are unsung heroes.
