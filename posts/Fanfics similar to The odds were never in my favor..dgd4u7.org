I love this fanfic by Antony444. I like the premise, the setup and the ancient lore included in the story, basically its a step further from the normal Prophecy + Voldemort storyline. Can anyone suggest fanfics similar to the storyline, lore and plot in this? Thanks.

** A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh features a deep dive into history, and is far removed from the prophecy/Voldemort storyline. Unlike The Odds Were Never In My Favor, Long Journey Home is beautifully written with good dialogue. linkffn(9860311).

Murkeybluematter's Pureblood Pretense and its sequels also twist the storyline quite a bit, and feature a Slytherin Harry. linkffn(7613196). Also features really strong writing.

Flamethrower's Of a Linear Circle series features unique history elements and also a not light Harry: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028]]

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** I really liked MC/Potter-hero(-ine) universally perceived as a villain. That setup is almost absolutely perfect, later it seems to be moving suspiciously into super!Hero and daemonic!overlords territory which I really don't like, but the first two years were absolutely perfect. I guess the third year will be saving her Daddy from Azkaban, but I am afraid it won't be as good as I hoped for.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

** I think I may know a few examples, but could you give more details about why you liked the fic to help narrow it down? I know nothing about the plot or premise of this story, or what you specifically liked from it.

*** So its not centered around the Boy-Who-Lived storyline, but around ancient lore, like powers of darkness (like chaos, death etc) and powers of light (Michael, Horus etc) that each have Champions in form of wizards. Basically a part of a bigger plot based on mythology. I dont really know how to say what I like about it. It is just that the storyline is combined in such a way that I love it. If you have time then read it for sure.
