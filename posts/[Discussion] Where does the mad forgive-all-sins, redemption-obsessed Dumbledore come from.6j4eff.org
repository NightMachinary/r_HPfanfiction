In the books, he only tries to 'redeem' Draco, to stop a /child/ being turned into a killer, and also (and primarily, in my mind) ensure that Snape is the one to kill him and either take ownership of the Elder Wand or have its power broken through the fact that Dumbledore planned it all anyway. Obviously the Elder Wand plan doesn't work out (except it does at the end for Harry) because of Draco's disarming spell, but the redemption/murder prevention plan /absolutely/ works. In the books, Draco, despite his hilariously awful attempts at killing Dumbledore, doesn't succeed in killing a single person, not even in the events of /Deathly Hallows/, where the old man has no influence or hold over him.

What I'm interested in, though, is why every so often - take the currently-being-updated /Wind Shear/, (a thoroughly enjoyable read, regardless) for instance - a story comes about with this... /caricature/ of a moral high-horse-obsessed, ultra non-violent, forgive-all-the-Death-Eaters-no-matter-what (this last one isn't that present at all in /Wind Shear/, but is prevalent elswhere) version of Albus.

Okay, the Order of the Phoenix don't run about /Avada Kedavra-ing/ everyone they don't like in the books, but aside from deciding not to kill - or as many authors like to say because Dumbledore has forbidden/indoctrinated them into only using non-lethal force with the cunning application of grandfatherly looks, disappointed voices and spiked lemon drops - it's perfectly possible that none of them can actually cast the curse. As Barty Crouch Jr. says in the /Unforgivables/ lesson in /Goblet of Fire/, it takes real power to cast the Killing Curse, to the extent that he says the entire room of students could try at the same time on him and he doubted he'd get as much as a nosebleed. Instead of raw, arbitrary power, I like to think that the /Avada Kedavra/ can't be cast unless it is powered by sufficient hate, similar to the Cruciatus Curse not working with righteous anger for Harry against Bellatrix.

Am I alone in getting really, really /fucking/ sick of seeing these Dumbledore caricatures being shoved into every other story? Even well-written and otherwise perfectly enjoyable works have some sub-standard characterisation of the old man, but not so much for the other characters.

Got any funny/over-the-top versions of this Dumbledore so I can read, get my blood pressure up and then bitch about it online? Let me know in the comments!


** He allowed Draco to carry out his plans unmolested, even after Katie Bell was almost killed. Even after Ron Weasley was almost killed. He allowed Draco to let Death Eaters, including Fenrir Greyback, into a school full of children. It's pretty easy to turn that into an "it's okay to let innocents die so long as the bad guy gets reformed" mindset. It doesn't lead to great stories, but it an be found in canon, if you squint hard enough--just like most other ideas in HP fan fiction.

*** Indeed. It's hard to interprete the shitty plot of book 6 in a way that doesn't paint Snape as incompetent or evil for not telling Dumbledore about Draco's orders, or Dumbledore as deliberately choosing to save Draco, at the cost of risking innocents - he would let Katie Bell get cursed (she'd take months to recover, probably having to repeat the school year, if she didn't take permanent damage) and Ron get poisoned. In my opinion, it's just shitty plot railroading with no care for characterisation - like most of Book 6 - but those who try to make sense of that mess often end up with a Dumbledore who puts saving one sinner above saving a dozen innocents.

But I think you've hit the nail on the head - in trying to make sense of Rowling's plot decisions, whatever they might be - authors construct these versions of these characters to try and fit what /isn't/ a perfect plot, and then transplant these already flawed characterisations into their own work.

Otherwise, I don't think Snape knew the details either - he figured out that the necklace and the mead were Malfoy, and I think he has words with him at some point but Malfoy brushes him off (I'm not sure on any of this though, so if someone wants to look it up and confirm they can), but I'm quite sure that Snape's not clued in on the Vanishing Cabinet plan.

***** So... Katie Bell almost dying to a dark curse is not serious enough? Ron almost dying to poison is not serious enough either?

Dumbledore could have easily arranged an accident for Draco. Or tipp off Scrimgeour that Draco was acting suspiciously - Harry already suspected Draco as well. Aurors would have taken care of Draco, without implicating or threatening Snape. If Snape had to find out what Draco was tasked with, then they could have done so too. Even if he could withstand Veritaserum and Legilimency on Dubmledore's level, he would have broken down and taken a deal to save himself and his family, if the alternative was to die and have his family die for his failure. Or he could be killed easily, and see the Malfoys die at the hands of the Dark Lord.

Dumbledore was certainly not doing what he could to protect the school.

harry already came from a abusive family, had to defend his life multiple times and had to kill the first time as an eleven year old. He also has strong anger issues and was willing to torture opponents on at least 3 occasion and succeeded once.

Ron had to feel inferior to so many people during his entire adolescence and by associating with harry had to face many things no child should be confronted with, And even though he is a competent wizard himself he doesn't really get any recognition for the times he had to risk his life.

Most armies spend years training adults (18+) to be able to kill someone. That a 17 years old would hesitate to kill someone he thinks is an innocent is not astonishing. The adults (who lived thourgh a war that took families and friends from them) would be a little more ruthless seems quite normal (even if their reaction to Harry not trying to kill Shunpike is probably a little too strong).

** I'm 100% with you. This version of Dumbledore usually ends up extending to the Order with Mad-Eye being the war-hardened veteran who disagrees. I distinctly remember in DH where Remus tells Harry that if he can't bring himself to kill, at least stun (when he threw an Expelliarmus at Stan Shunpike). The Order isn't pulling their punches. I think this comes from authors wanting Harry to be the only badass in their story and not have to share that title with someone like Dumbledore, who Rowling created as a certified badass.

To me, Dumbledore always seemed receptive to humanity's faults and cruelties, and sought to inspire the best in them, rather than blindly pretend that violence can never be the answer, etc, and it's depressing to see an otherwise good story with strong characterisations settle for a second-rate Dumbledore.

** Regarding /Wind Shear/, it is probably one of the most believable non-violent Dumbledore : he is ninety years old, still sees most people as his pupils, barely more than children, and certainly is affected (and has been for a long time) by some form of PTSD (he still don't know whether he was the one to kill his little sister, that we know from canon, and is not a fighter, but a teacher who found himself with the responsibility to end a war through fighting against a man he once loved). This Dumbledore is already an old man who don't want to fight (and never had), who dread the idea that another war is coming, whose role (passion) as an educator is to teach and correct.\\
That's the stuff you make the most hardened pacifists with. The kind that just want to drive children to become adults, and will, under pressure (i.e. when the threat level against their pupils become too big), either shatter or lose it.\\
Canon Dumbledore seems to follow this model: he nearly lost it, but still (again?) restrained himself. The worst offenders (the Lestranges, or in his mind Sirius) he let rot in hell; others, those he can still think as children who misbehaved, he let go free with a tap on the hand.

I admit that /Wind Shear/ is actually a really well-written and enjoyable story, I think the fact that Dumbledore is still quite pacifist that set off my little rant, even though the story itself isn't anywhere near a bad enough offender to deserve my ire.

You're right, though, in /WS/ he's well-constructed, and his arguments are reasonable enough, which is already more than can be said for (in my experience) most similar versions of Dumbledore.

So far, he's extremely disappointed in the Wizarding World.

And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** Idiots who don't realize that Dumbledore knew Draco was a weeny, and not cut out for the Death Eater cause and decided to use his own death in an attempt to keep Draco from falling. Also idiots who didn't realize that all the times Dumbledore says he trusts Snape because Snape apologized or whatever happened only because he promised not to tell anyone the real reason Snape turned spy.

*** On the other hand, Draco might not have been capable of cold-blooded, AK-to-the-face murder, but he very nearly killed three people (arguably endangered /a lot/ more as well) while trying to get Dumbledore.

He also kept another person under the Imperius curse for months.

And he attempted to curse another student with the Cruciatus.

So he seems pretty capable of... let's say one and a half of the three unforgivables.

That was him panicking and flailing without a plan. To be expected, and frankly quite lower near casualties than I would have expected.

True.

Also true.

Harry's got him beat.

Draco's still a weeny.
