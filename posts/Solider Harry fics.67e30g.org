Into fics where Harry was/is a soilder or merc. I'm a fan of fics like Circular Reasoning and The other boy who lived.

Also a story that is similar to the premise of this copypasta:

#+begin_quote
  Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911. Here's why: Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead. Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it. Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12. And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal. Now I know what you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger? Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova. Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound. I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series: "Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1." And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

** You don't have to say a spell. Any wizard who managed to pass his sixth year DADA class can do at least a few spells with just his thoughts. He could simply jinx the gun with just a thought and cause the gun to shoot bullets backwards at the shooter, for instance. Also, wizards can just conjure small metal bullets and banish them towards the opponent, essentially stimulating the effects of a gun. And beyond all this, they have weapons like invisibility, teleportation, mind control, mind reading, memory erasure, etc.

Ooh and Tom Riddle grew up in a London orphanage in the middle of the Blitz. He knows what muggle weapons are. He'd realise what Harry was up to and would either adopt the tactics or counter them or both.

While I would /love/ to see a fic that handles the integration of magical and muggle worlds (Space travel! Free energy!), this kind of muggle wanking is ridiculous and, though I'm not British, the Murica wanking is insulting.

*** You're really overestimating Wizards and underestimating muggles here. It takes around .001 seconds for a bullet to leave the barrel of a gun and hit it's target after the trigger's been pulled. Soldiers are trained constantly on their reaction time, and can pull the trigger on their weapon even before their conscious mind has fully realized the danger.

Wizards, on the other hand, have to use their wand to cast spells. They usually have to use wand movements and incantations, and in no way can a sixth year student, or most wizards, cast a spell simply with their thoughts. They also have to point their wand at a target in order to direct the spell. By the time said wizard has raised their wand to jinx the soldier's weapon, they've already got three bullets flying at them faster than they can see.

Tom Riddle grew up in the middle of the Blitz, so he definitely would know what muggle weaponry was like in the forties. However, Harry Potter does not take place in the forties. It takes place in the nineties, when guns and aircraft are massively more powerful and accurate, and where there are radioactive weapons like nuclear missles that can irradiate the land around impact.

I get this sounds like weird, soldier worship, but it seems like you see wizards as these godlike beings who are unbeatable, when the truth is, most wizards and witches would die in when they come into contact with a muggle enemy.

**** I doubt it. This is a society which routinely breaks the laws of physics to cook their meals. The idea that they don't have some sort of enchantment or spell which negates kinetic energy is not only ridiculous, but also unrealistic. Projectile weapons have been used for thousands of years. What are the odds that in all that time, a post scarcity society with high levels of education would not find a suitable fix for it.

Even better, we actually do have a spell which works similarly. The Impervious spell, from how it is used in canon, seems to erect a miniscule force field, maybe half a millimeter over whatever you designate.

So given just a bit of advance warning, wizards become bullet proof, for all intents and purposes. Catching them off guard is a completely via option of course, but you would have to make your shots lethal on impact. With the ability to knit bones, replace blood on the fly, and repair damaged flesh, the only really dangerous injuries would be to organs, and even then, if you can teleport to medical aid, then even that is a bit iffy.

Nuclear weapons aren't going to be argued against because they are an extremely unwieldy weapons in asymmetric warfare. The Wizarding World lives in and around the urban centers of a major first world nation. There is no way someone is going to nuke London, unless they don't give a damn about anything or anyone in London, and they don't fear a nuclear response.

Explosives have quite a bit of potential, but how are you going to make it work. If Wizarding Britain is on a wartime footing, and everyone is using enchantments to stop kinetic weapons, then shrapnel becomes a non-issue. Fire could definitely be deadly, but it would have to be fast and intense, as flame freezing charms negate the heat transfer, which is really the dangerous part.

I have always held the opinion that the Wizarding World and the Muggle world have much different strengths and weaknesses, and a war between them would devastate both sides irreparably. There would be no winners in such a war. But claiming that modern technology would somehow instantly destroy every wizard while assuming the wizards are completely unable to retaliate is ridiculous.

Well, Canon facts spoke a different story. Wizards were afraid of Acromantulas, Giants, and Trolls, whose attacks were ALL kinetic based. They had existed for thousands of years along side Wizards, and yet no thing such as kinetic wards had EVER existed.

Furthermore, Centaur and Goblin attacks were also kinetic based. IIRC, Centaurs took down a quite a few Death Eaters with bows and arrows during the Final Battle. But compared to modern guns, bows and arrows are EXTREMELY underpowered. Wizards did show a significant amount of fear for Goblin weapons. Do you really believe Goblin axes were more powerful than, let's say, 50' caliber machines guns?

In addition, Werewolves were especially feared by Wizards. If they were really that SUPERIOR against physical or kinetic based attacks, why should Wizards fear them at all?

Finally, wizards and witches beat each other all the time. Crabbe and Goyle were famous for physically assaulting other students. We don't notice other kids, Hermione included, ever thinking about something like a 'kinetic ward'. Even Lucius Malfoy resorted to a punching and wrestling match with Arthur Weasley.

****** We can't actually argue this point here. This is another one of Rowling's inconsistencies. There isn't enough canon evidence either way, and the circumstantial evidence contradicts itself.

I could argue that highly magical creatures are resistant to magic, and extrapolate that to where werewolves and Acromantulas are capable of biting through such barriers. I could argue that if centaurs and wizards have been feuding for ages, why don't centaurs rule, as they are more physically fit with faster weapons that can be shot faster. I could argue that Death Eaters at Hogwarts didn't expect centaurs, and therefore didn't prepare. There are many arguments I can make.

However, that would be relying on circumstantial evidence, when we know that the source for all this evidence created an extremely vague magic system, with nonsensical rules that wouldn't make sense to have considering the society she created. Rowling has a huge amount of inconsistencies. I think we can just leave it as easily argued either way, and let someone write a fanfic on that premise.

******* The issue of this thread is not about 'Muggles vs Magicals' either, but about 'some wizards using Muggle weapons and tactics to improve their combat effectiveness against other wizards'.

Given that Death Eaters could be surprised to such a degree by bows and arrows at the Final Battle, I have no doubt that whoever struck with machines guns and bombs would be met with great success initially, until the other side adjusted accordingly.

Another interesting evidence was the success of Twins' Shield products, as they implied that most Ministry workers couldn't even bring up a good Protego. That should tell you the pitiful combat readiness of British wizarding world.

**** I think realistically that if there was a war between magicals and muggles, muggles would have good initial kill rate that comes with the first strike advantage. However once that is over there is little any army can do to stop an invisible attacker that can vanish in an instant.

Most big bombs including nukes are out since there is no government that can survive the backlash of nuking their own country no matter what the target.

And then consider possibility of mind controlling leaders, generals, or even regular soldiers to turn on their own team.

There would be heavy losses but wizards should be able to take out a lot of critical infrastructure that can cripple any initiative.

******* Well, fields are visible and you can map them. But if there are map coordinates that cannot be entered into any system you know there's a magical manor hidden there. Finding these holes is not difficult with a simple computer program (even by 1990s standards). Based on what we know about muggle repelling wards they make stuff look abandoned and force people to turn away. Getting a ruined manor into your bombsight is not that difficult. The fidelius can be found by similar means.

The MOAB is an invention of the 2000s. In the 90s you'd be using BLU-109, which are 2000 pound bombs with a reinforced casing and a time delayed fuse. While not safe to be used in inner London you can safely drop it on any manor since they tend to be in the rural area.

Which would be the method against the Fidelius Charms, if I interpret your comment correctly. However, the Fidelius Charm literally removes the secret space from existence. We even read that Grimmauld Place folds into existence in front of Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at it. The stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles inside hadn't felt anything.
#+end_quote

I mean, its all open to interpretation, of course, but for me that sounds like space is just expanding there. Which means that it wouldn't be quite as simple as asking a computer for coordinates and seeing where error messages blink up. No matter how small the difference, a computer fed with the current data would tell you that Grimmauld Place 11 ends at X.998/Y.998 and 13 starts at X.999/Y999. If anything you'd have to map the Earth in extreme detail and then check where the calculated surface bends to compensate for the imploded space a Fidelius creates for everyone who's not in on the secret. Which would be quite impossible, even with current tech, since currently the best we got are stitches together satellite scans. And even if it would be possible, the moment you read it and try to process the information, you can't hold the thought because it would compromise the secret.

The Muggle Repels is a different thing. I'd say that it wouldn't be advisable to let someone fly a mission over it, les the pilot gets repelled, but artillery or long-range rockets could surely be used to target these. However, there is always Protego totalum. If thats up, then any bomb would just hit the shield and plummet to the side of it, or detonate high up in the air. So we're still back at "has to hit by surprise". And there is still the fact that we /have no idea/ where any of those manors are, with the exception of Malfoy Manor.
