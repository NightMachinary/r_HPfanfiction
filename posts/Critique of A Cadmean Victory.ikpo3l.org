A few months ago I began to read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory][/A Cadmean Victory/]] because it is so frequently recommended in this subreddit. Yesterday I finished it, and here is a critique of it that I've been writing while reading, and a few suggestions of making it better. This is meant for those who have read the story and know what happens in it. If you haven't and are going to, I warn you: spoilers ahead!

*INTRODUCTION*

I am a very perfectionist person: I notice flaws more easily than merits. I have very high standards, and when I read a story and encounter things I don't like, I add them to a mental list of things that should be better. I don't have a mental list of things that are good. That's why this review appears to be just a long list of flaws and seemingly bitter complaints, and it's easy to come to the conclusion that I hate the story and just want to rub my bad feelings to the face of the rest of the world like some Mr Plinkett. This is not so. I actually finished reading /A Cadmean Victory/ despite its immense length, which is rare for a fan fiction story, especially one so massive. I had to find it sufficiently entertaining (although at some points only writing this critique urged me to continue), and that means I cannot give it a mark lower than Acceptable. (Exceeds Expectations would be too much.) Please, keep that in mind. I will do my best to point out things in the story that are actually good.

*GENERAL*

The prose of the story is generally good. Not professional level, and not impressive in any point, but better than the prose in more than ninety percent of fan fiction stories. There never was a moment when the writing was so clumsy or sloppy that it would have irritated me.

However, the overall tone and, shall I say, proportions of the story feel out of place. The beginning was rushed, as if the writer just wanted to get it over with and onto the actual plot. In the very first chapter Harry is first chatting with Hermione, then gets to the Quidditch World Cup, then has some insights about the Veela, then returns to the tent with the Weasleys, then the Death Eaters attack and Harry ends up killing Barty Crouch Junior. Too much was packed in one chapter, and as a result I found it impossible to immerse in the story. It was told in a boring, emotionless tone, skipping moments when Harry probably felt varying emotions. I almost stopped reading right then.

But later in the story the writer has no trouble using several chapters to tell about trivial things. For example, the first half of Chapter 68 is just light-hearted small-talk of Harry and his friends, Katie and Neville. At that point their friendship has been established long ago. That episode serves no function whatsoever, not the plot, not character development, not anything. Parts like it should be removed. The same applies to some of the romance parts. It may be nice for the writer to imagine all these lovely dates with a dream girl, but the reader just gets bored and annoyed. It's totally unnecessary to tell about furniture shopping in Chapter 74 when the story should be building up tension for the climax. I actually got so bored at that point that I stopped reading the story for two weeks and read two books before returned. And I returned only because I had already begun writing this review. As late in the story as in Chapter 94 the writer admits in a note that the chapter is mainly filler. Remove the filler!

Another thing where the writer uses too many words is the lectures about magic. Early in the story Harry and Salazar Slytherin's portrait discuss many topics of magic, and the discussions are far too long and thorough. The rituals and other magic systems are probably well thought out, but they were told in the wrong way. It is unnecessary for the reader to receive all the information that Harry does. I want to read a story, not someone's meticulously thorough deep-dive thesis about how magic works! Such knowledge has no applications in real life, and is plot-wise irrelevant even inside the story. Instead of the long dialogues it should have been told as a summarised version by the narrator, maybe spiced with some of Harry's ideas about them.

Another huge flaw in the tone is the fact that there are climaxes and anticlimaxes over and over again, and none of them seem to have consequences to Harry's mental state after the one in Chapter 1. In Chapter 35 he confronts Voldemort for the first time, and in Chapter 36 he is starting his relationship with Fleur, not shaken or traumatised at all. In Chapter 65 he confronts Voldemort again, and in Chapter 67 he is back at Hogwarts toying with his friends. In Chapter 76 he confronts Voldemort yet again, and in Chapter 77 he is having nice time with his friends in Diagon Alley. In Chapter 98 he confronts Voldemort once more, and Chapter 100 begins with Harry and Fleur teasing each other before the final climax begins abruptly, without much built-up tension. This makes the story feel disoriented, breaking the immersion, and the lack of mental consequences make Harry feel inhuman, like some kind of robot. More about that.

*CHARACTERS*

Characters are probably the most important part of any story. Relatable and likable characters make a story good even if the plot is not that good, and even a good plot doesn't feel like much if the reader is unable to feel its impact through the characters. Sadly, /A Cadmean Victory/ lacks this most important part. Let's analyse the four most important characters and find out why they do not make a good story.

*Harry*

Harry is supposed to be a slightly more introverted version of the character we know from J. K. Rowling's books. Until the summer of 1994 he has gone through all the same events as the canon Harry, but they have a different impact on his person due to his introversion. This starting point is a good one. I am an introvert myself, and I thought, “Good, relating to this kind of Harry should be easier!” But, like I said, Harry feels inhuman.

The main character of a story may be a hero in which case the reader relates to him, likes him, and hopes him to succeed. Or he can be a villain in which case the reader enjoys him being ruthless even though he is not a nice person. /A Cadmean Victory/ tries to combine these two types of main character, but fails utterly. The reader is clearly supposed to like and relate to Harry, but then Harry becomes a cold-blooded murderer. He murders Rita Skeeter just because she was being annoying and because framing the murder to appear to be committed by Death Eaters was strategically beneficial, but afterwards Harry is only concerned about Fleur's disapproval.

From that point on I could not relate to Harry, but I could not enjoy him as a villainous main character either. As far as I am concerned, at that point Harry is as evil as Voldemort, and the story is about a child who evolves into a monster. Killing Pettigrew at least felt like a justified revenge, killing Umbridge was kind of divine justice, and the killed Death Eaters can be considered casualties of war, but the Skeeter episode just convinced me that Harry is a deranged psychopath whom I would like to see dying as well. Furthermore, all the boring small-talk episodes after the murder got a creepy undertone. Here is Katie, a normal teenage girl, hanging out with his friend Harry -- who has murdered a woman for being annoying and felt no guilt or remorse afterwards. How am I supposed to enjoy reading about their day when all I can think is what if Harry snaps, kills Katie, and then feels absolutely nothing?

Harry totally lacks character development. The reader gets no such insight to his mental state that would explain him becoming a murderer. To put it simply, Harry is wildly out of character, but the reader does not actually learn what kind of person he is. There are more examples of this. When he finds out that he is Voldemort's Horcrux, he quite easily accepts the fact that he will have to die. However, for a few chapters he is absolutely adamant that “he will not become nothing” or something like that. In other words, he gets some morbid satisfaction from the thought that even though he will have to die, he will die in such a remarkable way that his heroic sacrifice will be remembered and admired. But the canon Harry was never a glory hound. I would be okay with this kind of mindset if it was explained well. It was not explained at all. I think the writer just wanted to create some contrast to the happier and more confident Harry he became, and thus he needed to have some moments of desperation and depression.

*Fleur*

It's generally awful to read a romance story where one side of the romance is a psychopath. However, /A Cadmean Victory/ at least has the merit that the other side is also unlikable.

Fleur's most important character traits are bad temper and jealousy. Whenever she has a disagreement with someone, she treats them with contempt, usually threatens them with something, and swears angrily. Whenever someone is even slightly interested in Harry, she gets mad and fantasises about setting them on fire. There are no moments when she expresses any empathy or goodwill for anyone but her family members and boyfriend. And then Fleur too becomes a cold-blooded murderess who feels no remorse after killing an underage bystander in his own home for the crime of knowing too much. Oh, and then she and Harry just go home and are jubilant about how much they love each other. How is anyone supposed to like and relate to them? /A Cadmean Victory/ is the only piece of literature I have ever encountered in which the good looks of a girl is more important and makes up for a vile personality, and I find it quite repulsive. At least both main characters are rotten apples, so at least I don't need to be concerned about it if they eventually kill each other.

Also, why is Fleur of all people Harry's love interest? Her entire personality and special Veela abilities are irrelevant to the plot. Nothing would actually change if she was replaced with some other girl. Is it just the fact that Fleur is the best-looking girl in the story? I dislike stories that feel like a personal fantasy of the writer.

*Neville*

Also Neville is out of character. In this story he is vengeful above all else: he hates the Lestranges and Crouch Junior with rage he can barely contain, and wants to kill them personally. That is both the total antithesis of the canon Neville and implausible too. Neville was too young to know his parents, so he should not be able to feel so strongly about their fate. He would be an interesting character if he had the feeling that he should hate the Lestranges and Crouch, but actually couldn't. Their crimes would be like the crimes of some random historical people committed against random victims: worthy of being strongly disapproved, but something he just couldn't take personally. That's just how emotions like this work. You can't form strong emotions based on stories you have been told but not experienced yourself. As a result, Neville is reduced to an angry and bitter sidekick who can barely keep up with Harry's amazing power and talent. It's a total waste of character that could be removed from the story without changing the plot. Neville has no impact in the climax of the story. He is present and told doing things, but then he ends up being irrelevant. Nothing was told about what happened to him afterwards which makes it feel that all the long chapters in which Harry trained him were pointless to the ultimate conclusion of the story and his own character arc, i.e. filler.

*Katie*

Katie was actually an interesting character because she felt like a real person and not a caricature like the three other most important characters. She caused a love triangle in the story, and I could empathise with her on some level. On one hand, I would have liked her to be successful in her love life, because she was a much more pleasant person than Fleur, but on the other hand, I would not have liked such a normal, likable girl end up with a monster like Harry. Her death was supposed to be a tough situation for Harry, but apart from one of Harry's brief fits of rage, there were no consequences to Harry's mental state or the plot. In the end, Katie felt like one of the many wasted characters of the story.

*ROMANCE*

Harry and Fleur initially dislike each other, but then find some kind of strong personal connection because of their similarities. They both think about the other one before the romance begins, but I never understood it how they turned out to love each other. And even stranger is how Fleur comes to consider Harry the most important thing in her life, so important that she has no problems with Harry being a psychopath who murders a woman for being annoying. (She even continues teasing Harry, taking the risk of being the next annoying woman to face the ultimate penalty.) It seems like the writer wanted to give some insight to their thoughts because that's what happens in good romance stories, but only made it even more confusing. In Chapter 64 Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised and sees himself with a family with Fleur. In Chapter 71 he is suddenly uneasy about being committed to his relationship with her. It seems that the writer wanted an unrealistically effortless beginning for such a perfect romance, but at the same time acknowledged that it needs some obstacles to be interesting to the audience. The result is convoluted and implausible.

The story would be much better if the entire romance was removed. The main problem is that romance and a total war against cartoonishly evil bad guys are quite incompatible genres of literature. Normal people are unable to invest emotionally in a romance if a mortal danger lurks everywhere and they know they are being targeted by an overpowered bad guy.

The lack of relationship dynamics also bothered me. Apart from Harry enjoying Fleur feeling jealous and protective, they are on a lovely honeymoon almost the entire time. They don't learn new facets of each other, they never face serious moments of doubt or willingness to end the relationship. In fact, the romance would be an interesting one if Harry and Fleur had vastly differing hopes and expectations. Like the following, for example. Harry is stressed about the war and seeks comfort from Fleur. She, being the older one of the pair and having no such personal concerns, is willing to get a closer and more intimate relationship, and is disappointed when he is emotionally unable to comply. She learns more about people and lets go of her non-empathic composure. Defeating Voldemort becomes a mutual goal for them, because they know their relationship can flourish only if Harry is freed from his emotional burden. At the end of the story, they have both learned much about each other and life in general, and everything is fine. That would be a story worth telling!

This is a friendly advice for all aspiring authors: if you don't have personal experience in romantic relationships, it's usually not a good idea to write stories about them. Of course, I don't know any personal details of the writer of /A Cadmean Victory/, but from the tone of the story I suspect he/she was around twenty years old when writing and inexperienced in romantic relationships.

*PLOT*

Divergence type fan fiction stories usually follow the Stations of the Canon, i.e. the events of the books. I actually like it, because I find it interesting to explore the ramifications of the divergence. /A Cadmean Victory/, however, is a bad example of divergence, because it follows the Stations of the Canon even after it doesn't make any sense.

At the beginning, Harry kills Barty Crouch Junior, and sometime during the next school year he kills Peter Pettigrew. Even though that should have totally derailed the canon plot, the Triwizard Tournament takes place with Harry as the fourth Champion, and he gets taken to Little Hangleton where he confronts the resurrected Voldemort and then escapes. The Ministry doesn't believe him and Umbridge is being annoying, there is the adventure in the Department of Mysteries where Harry fights Death Eaters and Voldemort, and the Ministry learns the truth. There is the Horcrux hunt and Dumbledore dies following the events in the cave, then the Death Eaters almost take over Britain, there is the break-in to Gringotts and the final showdown between Harry and Voldemort in Hogwarts. It's mind-boggling how little things change even though for Harry so many things happen differently.

Harry gets taught by Salazar Slytherin's portrait and does several rituals that make him more powerful, and he gets help from Fleur, but these things don't change the overall plot. It's unbelievable that someone is willing to go through the trouble of writing a 500,000 word story with own world-building and unique subplots, but then change next to nothing about the main plot. It was very disappointing and showed striking lack of creativity when compared to the more unique parts.

Many plot details were strange and annoying.

I never understood how Harry's name ended up in the Goblet of Fire. In one of the early Fleur's point of view chapters she witnesses Harry putting his name in the Goblet, but later Harry is surprised that the Goblet selected him. Did Fleur see someone who was Polyjuiced as Harry? It was never explained.

And then there was Peter Pettigrew hanging out at Hogwarts for some reason. I think he was giving orders to the Imperiused Ludo Bagman, but why was it necessary to do at Hogwarts? Wasn't Bagman in London most of the time? But the most annoying thing is that even though Harry sees Pettigrew on the Marauder's Map several times, he doesn't do anything about it. Yes, I get it he doesn't trust Dumbledore as much as he once did, but isn't capturing Pettigrew quite an important thing? Why was Harry unwilling to interact even so little with Dumbledore as telling him about Pettigrew's suspicious presence would have been? The entire Pettigrew subplot was ridiculous, like some kind of a side quest of a video game: Harry knows it is not necessary to act right now. Pettigrew will be there even if Harry wastes several opportunities to catch him.

A similar type of thing is that Voldemort repeatedly lets Harry go for no real reason. Yes, he wants to know how Harry would turn out given time, but considering Voldemort wanted to kill Harry when he was a baby it is totally out of character for Voldemort. He doesn't take the risk of anyone equalling him. Voldemort's stupidity also evaporates the tension from the story. When the reader knows that confronting Voldemort is not an almost guaranteed death, all those confrontations lack the necessary tension for an interesting adventure story. The story offers no surprises, the final confrontation will happen only when Harry is ready!

Harry's stupidity about important tools annoyed me. He totally wastes the final use of the Time Turner and the Felix Felicis for unimportant things even though he knew he was going to face Voldemort eventually. Any sensible person would have saved them for the confrontation.

*WORLD BUILDING*

World building deserves recognition, but /A Cadmean Victory/ creates several plot holes by taking Rowling's world into the wrong direction. Specifically, the rituals.

There are lots of rituals, far too many for any plot purposes. I guess the writer wanted some kind of explanation for Harry becoming so powerful so quickly. That is better than no explanation, but when there is a new ritual every ten chapters or so, it becomes excessive. Harry should have done them all at once. Alternatively, skip the rituals altogether and come up with something entirely else. Magic opens so many possibilities; why does Harry have to beat Voldemort with superb power? Some creative application of previously known magic would be much more satisfying and spare the reader of many boring scenes with loads of inconsequential information.

Perhaps the over-emphasising of power could be parallelised with a story of Harry Potter and Voldemort as weightlifters. Voldemort is the strongest weightlifter in the world, and Harry knows that if he is to win, he must become even stronger. Then the story tells about how Harry exercises and uses doping. Eventually he is stronger than Voldemort and triumphs. Not a very interesting story, I would say. The reader cannot feel Harry's exercising, thus making it impossible for the reader to attach to the story. But how about a story where Harry realises that he doesn't need to be stronger than Voldemort, he just needs to be cleverer, and triumphs by other means? (Actually, at some point of /A Cadmean Victory/ Harry does say that he plans to defeat Voldemort through cleverness rather than power, but nothing becomes of it.)

Also, there was no sufficient explanation to why so few wizards do these rituals. Yes, the ingredients are expensive and the knowledge was rare, but if a teenager can become the third most powerful wizard in a few years through them, I would think the wizarding world would mass-produce the ingredients and use all their time to craft more such rituals. Plot-wise, a good ritual requires a sacrifice that few people are willing to make. The Horcrux is a good example. The rituals should have made Harry less human. That would not even change the story as such a personality change happens regardless.

Then there is the fact that paintings are actually sentient. If they are capable of learning new things and interacting with living people like living people, why is it not customary in the wizarding world to immortalise everyone in paintings? If paintings are just as good teachers as living people, why are they not in charge of teaching at Hogwarts? Paintings should not be some kind of good Horcruxes.

*MISCELLANEOUS*

I found the direct quotes of thoughts annoying. Every now and then there is a short line in italics telling what Harry thinks. My problem is that usually people do not think in complete sentences. Thoughts are quick realisations and associations, and that is why it would be much better to let the narrator tell what kind of thoughts go through the mind of the main character. Direct quotes are okay if the character actually forms the complete sentences, for example when imagining a conversation, planning the line, or almost saying something but keeping quiet for some reason. This is just a minor detail, but when it happens over and over again for no good reason, it gets very annoying. It breaks the flow of the prose. Equally annoying is that usually the lines were so unimportant. If it is necessary to tell Harry's opinion about a minor detail, why not spell out every single thought that forms in his mind? Or am I to believe that no thought processes take place apart from the ones written in italics?

But this next thing is a positive one. There is more social interaction with less close friends, something the Harry Potter books lack for some reason. (The most glaring example of this is in /the Half-Blood Prince/. At the start of the year Harry hears that the parents of the Patil twins would like to take their daughters out of Hogwarts. Then, /just before Christmas/, Harry says to Parvati, “How're you? You're staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave.” So, apparently, Harry never exchanged a single word of small-talk with her in /more than three months/ before that?) Harry's friendship with Katie is interesting partly because it should have been in the books.

This next thing is quite usual in fan fiction stories. Characters teasingly threaten each other like this: “If you get into danger, I'm gonna hex you until --!” Does that really happen between teenagers? Is that their way of expressing caring without appearing soft or sentimental? I have grown to hate it, because it's like a trade mark of a writer who doesn't know how real people interact.

*CONCLUSION*

Why was this story written? I think every story has some kind of creative spark, some moral the writer wants to tell the audience. But even after reading /A Cadmean Victory/, I don't know what the moral is. It certainly is not that if Harry had been more independent, cunning, ambitious and proactive, everything would have turned out for the better, because it didn't! And it wasn't that even though the so-called Dark Arts give you an advantage in a war, they are not good in the long run. In fact, the only moral I can think of about /A Cadmean Victory/ is that it is okay to break into people's homes and murder them for petty reasons. No, I don't like it. Hermione is the voice of reason in this story, understanding Harry's fall, but at the end it turns out she was being influenced by the locket Horcrux. I'm probably over thinking it, but it's like a message to the reader: if you think Harry is evil, you're influenced by Voldemort!

This is a divergence type of story. That means this is an alternative chain of events to canon, and we can judge if this is a better or worse outcome to the starting point. In the end, what is better than in canon: Fred, Cedric and Snape survive. What is worse: Arthur, Katie, Hermione and Ron die, as apparently does every Hogwarts professor, Teddy Lupin never gets born, Draco dies and loses his chance to get redeemed, Harry's friendships with the Weasleys are ruined and Harry and Fleur become monsters. Good for Fred, Cedric and Snape, but overall I would say the outcome is much worse. So, apparently I read over half a million words and endured unlikable main characters just to learn that their sacrifice of their own humanity did not even make things better than the alternative. And there even was no clear or reasonable moral to the story. So, was this a story that needed or deserved to be told? If I could send a message back in time, I probably would advise my younger self not to bother reading this story.

Again, this does not mean that the story is bad. It just is not worth the trouble of reading over half a million words, because so much of it is filler and the important parts are plagued with flaws. Removing the filler parts, the inconsequential action sequences, the unnecessary lectures about magic and most of the romance parts would make this a solid 150,000 word story without changing the plot at all. Then just a little more thought to the plot and character development would make this story a good one.

Many people consider this a very good Harry Potter fan fiction story, even among the best. I would like to read their thoughts about the things I have pointed out.


** Solid review. To be honest, you rated it higher than what I would. I read it but I didn't enjoy any of it. It's average. And when it comes to fanfiction, where there are plenty of horrible fics to drag down standards, average is not enough.

** It's always interesting to see longer form critique or reviews of fanfics - it's enjoyable to see what other people like, dislike, focus on, etc. So thanks for that!

This story in particular is one that I couldn't get into myself - the start didn't feel great (it felt too 'lazy' to me), and Harry's personality was not for me. The way overblown fight that he and Hermione/Ron have was terrible - and Fleur's personality was also not to my liking.

For the 'lazy' start above, it's something that I'm sure others would be fine with - but I don't like the starts that go 'canon happened up until now, but Harry has had a different personality throughout that only makes things change now.' I find it a lazy way to start a story and handwave away the different characterization of Harry - in this case, a more reserved Harry ought to have had further changes in the past of the story. I'd find it much more fitting to have the 'backstory' change along with it - even if the story itself starts in 4th year with the plot the author is interested in. Eg, instead of Harry managing to turn into a magical prodigy in a summer, having him be more studious from the start of his schooling would make that feel more natural, and less of a power-up on the spot - even if it functionally gets him to the same point at the start of the fic.

But it sounds like that stations of cannon problem extends further than I'd read in this fic, so perhaps it's a bit much of me to complain about it being there in the backstory :P

** For me, the Graveyard events being shoehorned in despite all the AU changes was the moment I closed the fic, never to return. Up to that point I had many gripes but the fic had enough points to keep me entertained. Some elements I really liked, such as the signature butterfly spell. But staying on canon rails in the face of massive changes is a deal-breaker.

#+end_quote

You've repeated this point multiple times and I'm pretty sure it's wrong.

My understanding was that he went there with the intention of blackmailing her into doing something he wanted. While he was there he realized that his blackmail was not going to be sufficient. He decided that killing her and trying to frame death eaters for it was going to serve his goals.

I'm not trying to argue the ethics of that, but that is not at all the same as murdering her because she's annoying.

** Mostly agree with that review but...

Draco dies and loses his chance to get redeemed

????

He didn't deserve redemption in the fic nor did he get it in canon.

Dude let a bunch of DE's in a school full of children, including Fenrir Greyback, who is known for having /dubious preferences/ when it comes to his victims. He didn't identify Harry in Malfoy Manor, but he DID identify Ron and Hermione. Draco not being killed / thrown into Azkaban for life in canon is complete bullshit. Ron was right when he complained about saving him, Harry should have left him behind in the Room of Requirements.

Stop acting like it was all big bag Voldemort forcing him. Draco had no problems with the ideology or muggleborns being murdered as long as he wasn't doing the deed himself(and even that isn't sure, since he didn't care who got caught up in his schemes to kill Dumbledore and we don't know how he got the Mark). In second year, he wished for muggleborn genocide and delighted at the idea of someone going after them:

#+begin_quote
  Then someone shouted through the quiet.

  "Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!"

  It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat.
#+end_quote

And said

#+begin_quote
  "I wish I knew who it is," said Malfoy petulantly. "I could help them."
#+end_quote

While talking about someone that he thought was out to kill muggleborns.

In Year 4, he was relaxed when Death Eaters were going around torturing the muggles:

#+begin_quote
  Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned sharply. Draco Malfoy was standing alone nearby, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed. His arms folded, he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees.
#+end_quote

And thought that it would be amusing if they got Hermione as well:

#+begin_quote
  “Granger, they're after Muggles,” said Malfoy. “D'you want to be showing off your knickers in midair? Because if you do, hang around... they're moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.”
#+end_quote

Even implied that his dad was among them and he had no problems with it:

#+begin_quote
  “Where're your parents?” said Harry, his temper rising. “Out there wearing masks, are they?” Malfoy turned his face to Harry, still smiling. “Well... if they were, I wouldn't be likely to tell you, would I, Potter?”
#+end_quote

He was crowing about how the Dark lord would kill all the mudbloods and blood-traitors:

#+begin_quote
  “You've picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the train, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this!” He jerked his head at Ron and Hermione. “Too late now Potter! They'll be the first to go, now the Dark Lord's back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first!
#+end_quote

​

"But he was being forced"

No, he wasn't. Stop with that bullshit. He would have had no problems becoming a Death Eater if Voldy hadn't given him a suicide mission to punish Lucius. After Snape-apologists, Draco-apologists are definitely the worst.

***** So first off. From Pottermore: [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/chapter-that-made-us-fall-in-love-with-draco-malfoy]]

Secondly, again. Child. Its really easy to parrot things parents say back when you aren't seeing the outcome. It all changed when he was actually expected to be involved in it.

As far as the relaxed comment. We are seeing that from the trios point of view.

Look. Draco Malfoy is a shit. Undeniably. As a human being I can also accept that people are nuanced and noone is born evil. He was literally written to show that everyone had the capacity to change in the end. Not be good. Not be innocent. But to change. I get that his character hits hard for a lot of people. Its supposed to. Also I ask again what you would have done? ( I swear noone answers this question the first time.)

I'm not asking you to like him. I'm just saying he was a child for most of all this. There is a reason we don't try children as adults when they commit crimes.

***** The issue is that Draco is a child through (essentially) the whole series - and not just a child, but one that had been indoctrinated from birth. Like, all your examples are from when he's 14 and under - that's pretty clearly him emulating his parents, IMO.

That does not downplay what he did - but it does explain how he's heavily a factor of his environments, and the narrative in canon is set up in a way such that it's clearly meant for us to feel at least somewhat sympathetic at the end.

Obviously he'd have had no problems becoming a Death Eater if there wasn't something to shock him out of it - he'd been raised from birth to be that. That sort of indoctrination is a tragedy, and I don't understand why it seems like people /want/ to have characters like that be irredeemably evil, or dismiss out of hand any possibility of a more complete redeeming than in canon.

** My understanding is that the story is an inversion of the old Indy!Harry trope. Generally in those kind of stories we see Harry discovering that he was being manipulated, all his old friends turn against him, he inherits tons of properties and money from random families (which creates more content about shopping trips, political ramifications and economics in general than most would like to read), go to war with a ‘no mercy' mentality ending with him killing both Voldemort and Dumbledore through skill/power and going on to live happily ever after.

In this one while Dumbledore was manipulative he actually had good reasons for keeping secrets (the magic he was trying had very specific conditions), was trying to keep as many on his side alive as possible and didn't go on a killing spree because Voldemort was an actual greater threat if cornered (he /did/ petty much destroy the country) and wasn't looking for personal benefits over the common good of all citizens (a great falling of GreaterGood!Dumbledore), this culminated in the fact that when Harry /did/ confront Dumbledore getting the whole truth and killed him he found out that he just let his own paranoia control him making him kill a likable person that was trying his best the whole time to protect him while acting as a deterrent for Voldemort, leading him to feel guilty over it instead of victorious and having negative consequences on the war.

Harry's friendships weren't ended just because of the other's actions, Harry at one point recognized that the others were actually acting their age and that he was the one to overreact burning permanently that bridge. The effects of such a thing are seen over the rest of the story by the fact that even when Harry is actively fighting for them no one sees him as a Hero until his death (and presumably the deaths of many of the other students), always seeing him as a dark wizard and keeping him isolated.

One thing Indy!Harry stories always have are alternatives to dealing with the Horcrux in his forehead without him needing to die and Dumbledore's irrational unwillingness to do so. Instead, here Harry's way of dealing with the Horcrux ends being even worse than Dumbledore's to the point we literally see his soul being torn and from there on we can see how he quickly changes for the worse (this is mostly the time period in which he passes from ‘edgy teen' to ‘outright monster ‘) subtly bringing the question /'was Dumbledore's way so bad compared to this?'/.

Then there is his role in the war in which he acts mercilessly bringing death and destruction to the Death Eaters, and so prompting Voldemort to new heights of murder in revenge. Tonks is the most obvious example in which he only took the time to kill her as revenge for Bellatrix, but overall his actions killing Voldemort's power-base and resources (like Snape) prompts him to act in worse ways to get more supporters and take over the government quickly (Azkaban for example) which overall results in a bigger bloodshed than otherwise. Then there are Harry's own more questionable actions like killing a teenager for being in the way, the story in no moment tries to make it seem heroic or justified, making this action more monstrous than anything else, thus Fleur's and his own guilty-free acceptance of it take the air of them being monsters instead of killing monsters or fighting in a war.

The story completely side-steps politics in its entirety (which is fair, he /is/ still a teenager/young adult) and excessive money issues by making it so his inheritance ends being only the one his parents left for him and not including political positions in it. This was an actually smart move as it let the story focus on the combat part of the war instead as getting sidetracked every three paragraphs as so many others tend to do, plus eliminating the issue of a group of adults in a governmental position taking a teen seriously. Plus the only times that the story outright shows him buying things are either through Fleur or that one time for unicorn blood, both being used as devices to move the plot along.

Then there is the confrontations. Up to the end we can clearly see that even with all the rituals Harry did Voldemort is still clearly the superior in power and skill, subverting the common trope as Voldemort has the same advantages as Harry plus much more time to develop them and learn how they can be better used. In the end even with all the effort Harry spent trying to step out of Dumbledore's influence and plans he is still outmatched and sees himself forced to go with Dumbledore's plans to save Fleur, with the only difference his actions have caused in comparison with how it happens in cannon being a much greater death-toil and that his sacrifice ends protecting only one person instead of everyone as it did originally.

My take is that the point of the story was show the other possible result of the Indy!Harry trope, in which the final result is much more suffering and death for everyone than they would suffer and a much bleaker life for Harry himself (as by the end he was reviled by many and had only Fleur -his romantic interest- at his side instead of all the friends, family and a healing nation that cannon!Harry had, plus cannon!Harry also had a much lighter conscience after the war and was much more human).

#+end_quote

I can't say that I've read beyond the 4th year, but the depiction of Katie is one of my biggest gripes with how far I've read.

She wants to be Harry's date and she does not like the guy who asked her... yet she still goes with him despite knowing that she does not want to, that it will be less fun and that she is hurting Harry. A "realistic" teenager would have told the random OC to fuck off and have gone with their preferred date. And more importantly, it served very little purpose. Harry was already on his angsty trip, which was very annoying to read if I am honest. It was such cliché romantic drama for drama's sake.

*** Katie was the best written part of that story, but the author just temporarily replaced her with a pod person for some made up drama.

Like okay, Katie accepts some randoms invite, because she thinks Harry was into Fleur. That's perfectly in character for a teenager.

But then she sorted things out with Harry, figured out Harry was just affected by her allure.

And was like "I'ma still gonna go with that random dude, despite saying how much I regret accepting his invite, but I totes like you instead and you should just totally watch me go on a date with that other dude and be all into me afterwards?"

What?

The author could have just had the characters not talk things out and keep the misunderstanding going. I'd have gotten PTSD flashbacks into my own teenager years sure, but it'd have been a perfectly reasonable way to have their relationship fizzle out.

But he had Katie act as if she had taken an unbreakable vow or something. JUST TELL THE RANDOM GUY YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND!!!

I actually liked that fic overall, but when I think about Cadmean Victory, all the positives are completely drowned out by this scene. I am actually a little awed at how the author managed to plant such a long lasting emotional response within me, with only a few paragraphs.

** So...the first thing I want to address is that stories don't necessarily need a moral, and not all authors are trying to convey one when they write anything, let alone a fanfiction. In fact, I would say that morals aren't even the point of stories in general. Stories are far more than that and aren't really something you can pin down to a /point./ Stories fill a variety of needs in our lives, we use them to convey thoughts, ideas, memories, and yes morals, but they also are used to entertain, to escape, to find oneself, or even sometimes to feel a little less lonely in the world. Our entire lives are made of stories large and small, some intended to be stories, some not. There's not a /point/ to stories, they are, and they fill a different need for everyone else. This story may not have a moral it's trying to convey, and that's fine. It serves a purpose nonetheless. When I write anything, I never think "What do I want to tell my audience?" Most of what I write isn't even intended for an audience. It's a release of something bumbling around in my head, some idea I can't let go until I put it down on paper.

​

To address some of your more specific points. Mainly the thoughts that occurred to me as I read your review.

Tone: While I'm not sure, because I never asked and the author never said, but I interpreted the tone of those first chapters as directly reflecting Harry's mindset. It's not that he's introverted, though he is, he's broken and damaged, and doesn't actually form a "normal" emotional response to things. It comes across as unemotional because he /is/. He was affected and impacted by his life among the Dursleys and by Pettigrews escape more than he was in canon and in different ways that changed how he responded to the world, and it wasn't until he started growing and forming attachments that he started to gain those more normal emotional responses. However, the important thing to remember is those kinds of mental wounds never leave us. They become scars in our psyche that will affect us for years after the trauma has been removed and by years, I mean the rest of our lives. It never goes away, merely softens over time. So while he learned to have more normal emotional responses, they will still be blunted and withdrawn, and he will often relapse into what is pretty plainly sociopathic behavior. This isn't a protagonist you are supposed to relate to, but it is a lens into a different style of thought, informed by a different lifestyle(another thing we use stories for, to help us think in different ways due to the different lenses characters have). While I could be wrong, I do believe that even the tone of the writing itself is a literary device the author used to set the emotional tone of the story.

Neville: In canon, Neville visits his parents at least every Christmas. In all likelihood probably far more often. He has to deal with seeing them mentally broken and physically decrepit. He has to receive the same candy wrappers from his mother every visit and deal with the fact that his parents will never recognize him in any meaningful way. Not only that but he also has to deal with his relatives having unreasonable expectations that he live up to his father's name and he has no one to defend him. More than that, no one replaces the parental figures in his life, so he definitely would feel that absence keenly. To top all of this off, his grandmother made sure he knew that his parents gave their sanity to save him. My point to all this? OF COURSE HE WANTS TO KILL THE LESTRANGES AND CROUCH JR.!!!! OF COURSE HE FEELS AN INDESCRIBABLE RAGE!! THAT'S A FAIRLY NORMAL RESPONSE TO THIS KIND OF SITUATION! Not really out of character I think, and even if it was, it's fanfiction. The whole point is things are different, otherwise, it'd be plagiarism.

Harry/Fleur: Eh, yeah, they can be pretty horrible people, I'll give you that. However, there are extenuating circumstances for a lot of that. Harry is a sociopath, plain and simple, he doesn't really have a well-developed sense of empathy, and also lacks a firm moral compass. Fleur is not fully human(depending on how your headcanon follows) I don't know if the veela as a species were fully dived into in this fic, as it's been a while since I've read it, but we have no idea how that affected her thought process(I guess you could say she's a bit of a birdbrain). Either way, yeah they're messed up, but that doesn't mean they're unlikable, they just fill a different niche in characters than your bog-standard hero protagonist.

​

Side note: Fleur never witnessed Harry putting his name in the goblet, she saw him in the same hall when she was dropping her name in. That's all.

Romance: I completely disagree that all-out war and romance are incompatible, in fact, all-out war and romance quite often go hand in hand, even in real life. There's something about the threat of death that causes people to want to validate the fact they are alive, and love is a massive affirmation in that regard. As for their relationship, conflicting desires and doubts are something people have to deal with all the time. You can be sure that you want something(family with Fleur) but at the same time be uneasy about it. Quite often this turns into self-sabotage, which causes a lot of relationships to fail and combust. Lack of relationship development, I can see how that might be a problem, but the majority of their relationship is stolen moments, and quite a bit of it happens off-screen, I think most of the point here was to give Harry something to live for, something to strive for. It didn't need to show the development that wasn't the point of it. Furthermore, romance can be as much a literary device as anything else and doesn't need to accurately reflect reality, it really depends on what the author wants the romance to accomplish. Finally, it's the height of hubris to say that just because an author might not have a ton of experience in romance means that they probably won't be able to write it well, and also the height of hubris to assume what a romance needs in order to be engaging and worthwhile. For the first part, human interaction is everywhere, in stories and in life(which is really a bunch of stories in and of itself), there is plenty of inspiration there to be able to write a good romance even if you've never been in a relationship yourself. Second, romance comes in all kinds of different flavors and types. Not every romance will have the same trials and tribulations, and not every couple has the same issues.

​

Filler: Yeah it can be annoying depending on how it's done, but I personally find it has its place if done well, it's a step away from the action and the drama, giving a reprieve from the heavy hits. In an extremely long fic it's absolutely necessary for me to have this or I become emotionally deadened due to hit after hit after hit. Those steps out are a way to reset and recover from everything going on, so that when the calm in the eye of the storm is over, you are able to feel the full weight once more. Same for the characters.

​

Explanations of magic: This is an entirely personal preference, I happen to love fics with a detailed system of magic and that explain it. I love diving deep into that especially if it's off the beaten path of canon. That probably comes from a love of knowing how things work and it's something you find everywhere in fantasy and science fiction. Just because you don't enjoy it doesn't make it a flaw, it means it's not your cup of tea.

​

About the rituals: Ehhh most of what you said is a matter of personal preference but there's one point I would like to address. Why it's not widespread: This is a matter of control largely and I believe in the fic it actually used to /be/ widespread, a rite of passage for every mage. But it's easier to control a herd of sheep than a pack of wolves and demonizing a branch of magic designed to make you stronger is an easy way to remove the fangs and claws from potential wolves. There's also a matter of potential. Harry became the third strongest wizard because he had the potential to and the rituals helped him reach that potential.

​

There are a lot more points I could address but this reply is long enough already, and I feel I've made my point. Most of what you call flaws are a matter of personal preference than a poor writing style, and that's fine. Hell, the fact you posted it here so that we could have a group discussion about it is also fine, it's nice to be able to do so. I just dislike the insinuations that the author wrote a poor fic, or even just an "Acceptable" like it's some kind of objective evaluation when it's not. It's entirely subjective and I think that needs to be stated.

​

(For the record: in response to the question at the end of Misc.: Yes people do actually speak to each other like this and not just teenagers. Fear and worry can all too easily transform into anger which is a normal emotional response, and people even adults will say things like this. It's nothing to do with avoiding softness or sentimentality, it's a release of pent up emotions in an explosive fashion)

** That was a good review.

I've read lots of different fics. Whether I loved or hated them for any reason, these reasons are usually memorable.

Usually I read fics from my phone. I know I read this fic from start to finish, since my reader app throws me to the end of the story when I try to open it.

Yet somehow the only thing I remember of this fic was the WTF feeling.

I had to reread the final chapters to recollect whatever the hell happened. Then I saw that batshit insane ending, and the rest came back.

Now I remember I really struggled through the second half. I like longreads, but this one was WAY too long even for my tastes. Some characters acted in a really weird way across the entire story, and it only snowballed as the story progressed. Wanton murders are just icing for this bizarre cake.

I'll probably reread it at a later date, but only if I happen to hit a severe fic drought.

In binary terms of "recommend/not recommend" I'd choose the latter.

** Solid critiques of the story, you wrote a lot of the negatives so I'm going to focus on the positives and try hit on your points. You wrote a lot so I'm going to try and hit as many points as I can. It isn't a perfect story, but it is a very good story when you consider the sheer volume of fanfictions out there. Love it or hate it, it is objectively a better than average story. Subjectively is an entirely different matter. The issues you tend to have with them though are subjective issues rather than objective.

Pace: Fair point about the beginning being rushed, but there isn't really any winning here. Some people want a longer rehash, others want it to just get into the actual plot/divergence.

I wouldn't say there isn't character development in some of the chapters you have issues with, but again not for every, it's subjective. In Chapter 68, it serves as a sort of reminder and showing the lighter side to Harry. The furniture shopping showing there's more to life than what Harry is doing, just acting normal.

You're saying "Remove the filler" but reading it after the fact. It was on a pretty steady schedule when updated live and so fillers suck, but it keeps consistency. Sometimes when writing, I imagine you need to get towards lighter topics at times and things just flow, and rather then tossing it, just keep it in and give the readers something during normal update time.

The magic lectures were okay I think, but again, subjective and not everyone wants it. Rituals all at once, I thought it was better to spread it out, it sort of showed that it takes preparation, cannot be done on a whim or by everyone.

Mental state, didn't Harry practice Occlumency and do some sort of ritual that made his mind clearer? The Occlumency in the story was meant to be really helpful in dealing with situations like that.

Harry: I don't think you are supposed to like and relate to Harry, it may be how you read the story, but it isn't always the case. In this situation it seemed more like could you understand what Harry is going through and why he acts the way he does. It seemed okay given a 14 year old who has a lot of issues and is acting out with a not the greatest example of mentors.

"Harry totally lacks character development" I don't think this part is fair at all. Harry goes from feeling isolated and alone towards having something to live for. Your example about the Horcrux, that was Harry choosing to reject the path followed by Tom still and not wanting to kill someone to split his soul. Him choosing to switch and want to live rather than die occurs after feeling like he was walked all over and in a bout of emotional turmoil for him. I would say the character development is solid for fanfiction. You shouldn't be comparing him to his canon counterpart because there isn't a lot of similarities after summer before 4th year. His mindset of not dying for nothing is subtly pushed towards with Salazars mentoring, making himself a great wizard and remembered and all that jazz. This Harry is definitely more ruthless and is willing to do whatever he has to in order to survive being hunted down by what he percieves to be both sides. It doesn't come out of the blue.

For the other characters, I can understand the issues with them, and like you said you wrote more of the bad than the good for the stories. Just want to point out, you are comparing them to their canon counterpart and that isn't fair tot hem. The characters have developed in different ways and so will be different. I don't think they are wildly far off where they become Characters In Name either. Like with Neville, we know he gets compared to his parents a lot and sees them in the hospital. It isn't really fair for you to determine that he could not feel so strongly about their fate.

Romance: Again subjective, I thought it was okay when taken into the context that they are in a war where it is perceived both sides are against them, it's been a roughly 2 years total or so, and there isn't anything wrong with falling in love fast. It can happen even if it is rare. I thought it was better this way rather than make it about romance. The romance was more of a side thing, rather than the main thing and stories tend to have multiple facets with one main thing being worked on. When romance was in the story, it was meant to develop Harry and show different sides. There might be inconsistencies, but for teenagers main characters that isn't exactly so bad.

Plot: Harry was 4th champion and was explained why in Chapter 35 (explained by Bertha), resurrection was because Bertha and it does get explained why it turns out the way it did. i think this part was fine.

5th year, I'm not too sure why you would believe this would change. Harry is not liked by his peers, no one vouches for him really, it really should play out similarly to the book for the main points. I would love to hear why you thought 4th year and 5th year doesn't make sense to follow Stations of Canon. The main plot isn't what is meant to be changed. The story is more to show a different route Harry could take and where it leads to the similar finale even when worse off for all.

Bagman being around London most of the time - no clue, it could have been at the school to make sure everything is going well. Peter being around the school is meant to subtly hint that they are affecting things. Harry not talking about it with Dumbledore is because he doesn't trust Dumbledore at all anymore to do the right thing, and catching Peter is slowly lingering more and more before Harry really gets the chance to catch him.

World Building: Harry never does really equal Voldemort in pure power. In fact, the story showed that even after everything Harry did, he still lost outright. Voldemort only died afterwards because of (my theory) a Harry possession type thing that went poorly for Voldemort. Also the rituals aren't exactly common. Written work doesn't always get kept, and if it is written work for family, nothing too out of the left field to believe it stayed in the family.

Misc: "It certainly is not that if Harry had been more independent, cunning, ambitious, and proactive, everything would have turned out for the better, because it didn't!" It was not meant to turn out better. The title sort of gave it away that if anything, it would turn out so much worse. At no point was it the moral of the story to break into people's home to murder them. I would say the moral of the story is the opposite, being more open and trusting and you won't end up in a cadmean victory.

"I'm probably over thinking it, but it's like a message to the reader: if you think Harry is evil, you're influenced by Voldemort!" This is unfair too because the title of the story was to show Harry would end up with a victory in ruin, which is meant to show that all the path that he takes to isolate himself and not open up leads to personal ruin. This isn't a typical divergence type story.

Overall, solid story and people saying it is average would be rating it much more subjectively than objectively I think. Again I think there are definitely issues with the story and I have subjective issues with it as well, just focusing on the positives and different spins on things you brought up.
