I really hate it when someone asks something on here, then you spend a decent amount of effort to answer as detailed as possible... and they don't reply or even say thank you.

Makes me think that some people are just posting things for Karma. Can someone tell me why people do this? And I'm not talking about posts where people are joking, but a full blown question asking what you think. There wasn't even any other answers.

*** I guess you're right, but it just irked me because there was no other responses to the post - and it was 3 paragraphs of text... to be ignored...

** I've done a thing where I've accidentally hit the 'mark all as read' button instead of the new page button on the message inbox thing and had to go hunt down all the messages to respond to again - sometimes I miss some.

*** I see, I never thought of that - perhaps I should be less upset by a lack of response?

**** I wouldn't dare to dictate how you should feel about things - that's your prerogative to feel however you wish and it's perfectly valid to be upset by a lack of response to something you've put work into, no matter the circumstances.

'twas simply a suggestion as to why someone might not respond, and I'm sure there are many more. Life happens, y'know?

***** Of course, I do think I slightly overreacted. Simply because it's not something to get upset over, not really at least. Appreciate you replying to the post!

****** Fair enough. So long as you've come to a conclusion that satisfies you. Glad I could help. :)

** Different from what you actually asked but... with fic recommends I usually want to read the fic recommended, at least a chapter or two, before responding or even voting. Exception is upvoting when I've read the fic and intended to recommend it myself.

*** Yeah, I do this as well - but I upvote for the response as a thank you for them taking their time. If I do read it, say a chapter or so, I will usually go back and add a comment personally.
