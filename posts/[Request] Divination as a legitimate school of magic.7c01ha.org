** Well, I can only think of linkffn(11574569) But you have to get through the clich√©s of HP-Fanfiction first :D

I don't think that it's really developed in fanon, because the authors either bash the subject or let Harry take Ancient Runes or/and Aritmancy.

*** Truth be told I don't expect there to be a ton of fics that actually deal with divination. It's written off even in canon as largely worthless, and I expect any fanfic that deals with electives to probably pick the more "exotic" choices like Runes that we've only heard of (and have tie ins to other fanon tropes like the million fanon Wards). Just an interesting idea considering how it appears to remain a steady class when other subjects like Alchemy or Dueling are so infrequent or are lowered to just club status, so it would make sense that there is something more to Divination than what it appears as in the books.

As for Dodging Prison... I haven't wanted to fall down the cliche hole quite yet. Maybe one day.

**** According to Pottermore, Alchemy is a NEWT-only subject. I would imagine Dumbledore being the one to teach that class, given his work with Flamel.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** Read Mother of Learning by nobody103. It's a piece of original fiction, and it's /amazing/! A large part of it is Divination magic. It functions like a search magic. Helps you find the location of people and items, and you can defend against it, and it's fantastic.

Seriously, if you haven't read Mother of Learning

After some hardcore Dursley abuse (not gonna lie, pretty horrid stuff), Harry slowly develops prescience. Stuff like /looking/ at a moment and seeing all strands of possibility that may derive from it. Not only present moments, but also moments in the past, i.e if something happened differently in the past, how would the present be different.

** linkffn(Weres Harry) Future-seeing is only a small part of Divination. Divination is /any/ use of magic to gather information. Scrying is a form of Divination (And the Marauders used a crystal and scrying mirror to create a magical television.) The reason it fell out of favor was because the rich and corrupt started countering it to the point of such forms of Divination being useless.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
