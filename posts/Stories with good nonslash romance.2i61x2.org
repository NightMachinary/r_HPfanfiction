I'd like to read some good stories with romance in them. I don't care what the pairing itself is, straight, femslash, harem, etc so long as it isn't slash and Harry is a member.

Thank you in advance for any recommendations you have.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862145/1/Contemplating-Clouds][Contemplating Clouds]] is the cutest romance I've ever read.

*** Thanks. It was cute, but where it ended was annoying.

**** Agreed. Horrifically. Also if you want more LL/HP, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7245318/1/Sight-of-Spangled-Silver][Sight of spangled silver]]. It is a very difficult read, due to being entirely in Luna's head and not really describing any action.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7352166/1/Protection-From-Nargles][Protection from Nargles]] is one that is much more typical, and pretty good as well.

***** The sight story is more than difficult if the author intentionally left out words or not. Some of the sentences make very little sense. And hey. It's Luna. But still.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister][Unlike a Sister]] are the best purely romance stories that I've read. They're both H/ Hr. Vox Corporis is done, but Unlike a Sister updates very slowly.

** You might try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/386600/Deadwoodpecker][Deadwoodpecker]]'s stories, which tend to have strong romantic themes. She writes exclusively canon pairings. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4464089/1/Yellow-Submarine][Yellow Submarine]] would be a good start if you're after romance.

**** The scene with Arthur and his shed (you'll know it when you come to it) is one of the most memorable I've encountered in fanfiction.
