Hi there, Im looking for fics that maintain tension and intrigue. I really like Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw so something like that would be apretiated, PLS dont recomend anything that is less than 80.000 words or anything in wich the entire thign could be replaced with this

"Harry Potter woke up one day and willed his enemies out of existence" AKA Godlike Harry


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

I've said way too much about this fic, but I'm going to shill harder b/c I love it so much. Just note the first year is like negative quality until they try and save the stone from Voldemort. But the second is a really nice story w/ lots of twists and turns.

It's also WBWL so if you liked DP&SW it might be up your alley.

I know you said > 80k but if you're ok with 60k, linkffn(Elizium for the Sleepless Souls) is probably the single best thriller I've found in fanfiction.

*** I keep meaning to ask this each time The prince of Slytherin is recommended. The description of this fic has always thrown me and I keep hesitating to read it. For example.... Can you explain what it means when it says

"Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16"

Does this mean thats a sequal and the fic only goes up to Third year or just thats when the author starts writing year 3? Its a weird thing to state in the description either way.

Also, it says no pairings prior to 4th year, but shouldn't it be passed 4th year at almost 600k words? because if not thats an insanely slow paced fic, and if it IS past 4th year... why is no pairing listed? Ive always assumed its Harry/hermione because of the character list but.... (I ask partly because I generally dont read slash and not knowing the pairing throws me a bit).

**** The fic is at the end of the summer before Year 3. And yes, it's almost 600k words. I think the author put that in the description to mean that Year 3 is underway.

#+begin_quote
  because if not thats an insanely slow paced fic\\
  Not no. The author tries to have multiple plot threads going at once, so right now there's about 4 main plotlines happening simultaneously. The author is also super big on world building, which expands the story too.

  why is no pairing listed? Ive always assumed its Harry/hermione because of the character list
#+end_quote

Tbh I honestly have no ideas what the pairings will be. There's some small stuff (like implying Hermione has a small crush on Blaise), but unlike a lot of other fanfiction pairing has had little to no effect on the story (it's about 13-year old kids doing 13 year old stuff, so they have friends and the like but very little romance).

The older characters do have things going on (Marcus Flint for example, and Percy) but that's more to the side. The main characters are mostly romance free.

*** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin was kinda in my radar, I intended to wait until the author reached Year-4 but I may start it now... even if I know I'll be fustrated, I usually don't read fics with less than 100k but since Elizium for the Sleepless Souls is Complete I may read It, THX for your suggestions!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

***** I recommended "Emperor" a few days ago and was asked similar questions. Here are my comments about this story:

- It's extreme AU, even in Muggle world. For example, nuclear weapons were never developed.
- Not all parts are enjoyable for me, but some parts are very enjoyable.
- The amount of politics, strategies, and tactics involved is amazing. The author obviously knows his stuffs.
- This Harry would be considered OP in most other HP fics, but not so much in this story because one person's power mattered far less in wars involving thousands of wizards and millions of Muggle soldiers. He was quite bloodthirsty and loved leading his troops personally. His presence often gave them decisive advantages, but also caused severe complications a few times.
- The pace varies. Except for the early war in France, I think the pacing is generally good. The story has mostly covered years between 2008 and 2023.
- Character developments are heavily tied to the overall political and military environments. Harry, Neville, Ginny, Astoria, Gabrielle, and Xenophilius Lovegood are the 6 major Canon characters undergoing the most changes because of the new circumstances. OCs are very important, especially Harry's wife Ellie, senior advisor Albert Hughes, and SIS spy Josefina.
- A very interesting theme in this story is the constant and hostile factionalism in Harry's court, and how he balances and plays the factions to his benefits.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
