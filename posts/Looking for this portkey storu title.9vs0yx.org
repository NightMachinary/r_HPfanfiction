Please help me find this portkey story title.

Harry and Hermione will be together in the beginning. And they ll drift apart. Their friends try to set them up together. Explosion in a hogsmeade restaurant where they ll all have food. Draco Malfoy plays good part too. It's like Hermione will be helping him secretly without Harry or Ron knowing it. Drace saves his mother from his father. She doesn't like him that way. Just help me know the title of this story. Please.

Maybe the saving his mother is different one. But the hogsmeade explosion is for sure. Excerpt is they both(H/Hr)will hide behind some table and then go to retaurant for having food. There ll be explosion. I don't remember much.
