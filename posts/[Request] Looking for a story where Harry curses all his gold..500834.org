** I haven't read it, but I think someone on the Reddit rec'd a fic where Harry destroyed the Wizarding economy by making gold vanish from vaults in Gringotts using a wasting curse. I think Sirius' vault was used to introduce the vanishing gold into the high security vaults. Does that sound familiar?
