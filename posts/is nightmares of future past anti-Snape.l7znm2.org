could anyone tell me? I just know a spoiler about the dark mark so I'm kind of wary. it looks like it's going to be either anti-Snape or they aren't going to use his character much, if at all.

no other spoilers please. I don't really mind him dying or whatever if he is a normal character and not bashed. characters dying is normal.


** So. This story was started before we had canon evidence that Snape was a "good guy".(though obviously that's still hotly debated in the fandom itself) I believe it was around book 5? Don't recall exactly. So the author treats it as though Snape were the malevolent POS he appeared to be in those early books and wrote it as such. He's biased against Harry and Co. and lets Malfoy get away with a lot of horrible shit. However in more recent chapters where Snape shows up, it's moderated somewhat. However we don't see much of that as the author has been on a long hiatus due to health issues, and I think it's been a few years since a chapters come out. His character plays a moderately significant role in a few scenes, mainly as a minor antagonist, and a plot point for why they all need to learn certain magics. But he's not cartoonishly evil, just slightly more dickish than canon Snape, and a bit OOC (knowing what we now know about his history).

** Wasn't this the fic where Harry, (spoilers) after almost killing Snape, took pity on him and figured that even if he was a shitty person, his life hadn't exactly been easy, and decided to Obliviate him, fake his death, and basically give him a new life in some other country (whereas he never returns later in the fic)? Or am I confusing it with some other fic?

***** Not sure. Cadmean Victory has something like that, and it sounds familiar, but the Oblivate bit doesn't ring any bells.

** Snape is pretty evil in Nightmares of Futures Past. He's using invasive legilimency on the students and is pretty cruel. He's also not a major character,
