The best in my opinion would have to be Blaise/Harry, Hermione/Harry and Daphne/Harry. The worst I've seen so far is definitely Dumbledore/Harry.

On the other hand, looking at new fics I read a summary that boiled down to "Ginny is getting raped by Filch and then enjoys it"

So Ginny/ Filch would be the worst I've seen.

For best I would have to go with Harry/Fleur;Harry/Daphne;Harry/Pansy (But not those that include marriage contracts or something like that. Imma sucker for actual romance :P) and Harry/Katie.

**** I agree. I've been hoping that someone will write a story with it. I'd do it myself but I'm already so backed up on other writing projects that I committed to first. I've got a lot of ideas of how well it would work, but I am just overwhelmed!

Right now I'm working on:\\
- Harry Potter and the Great British Bake Off, which is partially written but badly needs revising and expanding on. I was hoping to have this done a year ago but I lost my muse for a year and a half and am still not as consistent as I'd like.\\
- Writing for a friend's comic series that we are producing. It's only a dozen or so pages, but it still takes a lot of editing to balance depth with conciseness.\\
- Working on a Hermione-centered fic that I started last year and have been slowly updating on Ao3. It's a fic that I'm using as a testing ground for various writing ideas, so it's not very good, but I do want to finish it.\\
- A rather more mature Hermione/Harry fic for a friend. I rarely write anything that even hints of smut/lemons, as I am quite awful at it, but my close friend requested it and I thought I'd give it a go.\\
- A Dean and Seamus friendship fic that takes place post-Hogwarts. I'm having trouble getting Dean's voice down but I like the plot and it's something that's been my headcanon for years.\\
- A Mass Effect slice-of-life fic. Takes place during Mass Effect 2. I've got it planned out but haven't put more than a dozen sentences on paper yet.\\
- Writing content for a Pokemon 5e module (Pokemon adapted for the D&D 5e universe). I am DMing a campaign and writing sidequests and story interactions. A group of about ten of us are working hard at producing content but creating a whole campaign requires so much work from everyone involved.

***** Wow. And I thought I was busy juggling my drarry oneshot (inspired by a reddit prompt the other day) and a writeup of my pokemon let's play.

There's a couple of fluffy oneshot ideas I might follow through with soon once I've reacquainted myself with the pairing and finished my oneshot (7.5k words in three days so far!) so it shouldn't take too long, provided I don't get distracted by [enter interesting prompt here].

** I'm assuming comedy-ships (Harry/Basilisk, Harry/Whomping Willow, etc) don't count.

For "worst", Harry/Snape is always an instant skip for me. It's 3 separate layers of "no thanks":

1. Snape is canonically the same age as Harry's dad.
2. Snape's his teacher, so that adds iffiness - authority abuse?
3. Harry/Death Eater, even if he's "redeemed", always bugs me.

On the other hand, the /best/ ships I've read are:

1. Harry/Ginny. Say what you want, I think they work really well together - it's not Ginny's fault J.K. Rowling didn't do that relationship much justice.
2. If there's Weasley-bashing afoot which is altogether all too common, either Harry/Fleur(or aged up Gabrielle) or Harry/Luna.
3. Harry/Ron or Harry/Cedric for slash-pairings.

** Worst (not most implausible, but the one most likely to end badly and yet remain technically plausible in the right circumstances) is probably diary!Tom/Harry.

Harry/Voldemort is not plausible. Harry/Tom is technically possible and I could see it happen as a result of an emotionally manipulative Diarymort. I've seen Harry/Snape suggested here too, but I think that ship has a marginally better success rate than Tomarry (since at least Snape had some redeemable qualities and was never the monster Tom already was when young).
