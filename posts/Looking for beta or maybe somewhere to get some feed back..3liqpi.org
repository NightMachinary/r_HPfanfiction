** Are you also trying to imitate the terrible spelling of fanfiction? (serious question)

If not, then you'll need to /really/ work on your capitalization/spelling and grammar.

Other than that, I guess I'm not a fan of this type of story, but oh well.

**** Eh, just the "fic about fic cliches" thing. Not my cup of tea.

That said, your chapters seem too short. Try combining multiple into one?

*** I'll second this. Obvious errors in the first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  well let's just say harry had bought a gun or five
#+end_quote

=Harry=

#+begin_quote
  Harry.. I know your in there.
#+end_quote

Complete the aposiopesis; =you're=

** My first thought is that the intro needs to be a bit more polished it is difficult to read and if the first few hundred words arnt well done, readers are less likely to continue. Also, make the chapters longer.

** The problem with satirizing the filth of fanfiction is that readers are never sure whether you're making fun of fanfiction cliches, or literally becoming one.

For example, my hope is that you are blatantly mocking ridiculous plot-pushing devices, like Hermione dying within the first few chapters, no-one caring. The fact that the characters are so OCC (Ron doesn't care that Hermione dies, Harry is a psychopath) to the max has got to be making fun of poorly-written Harry, right?

Except I can't tell the difference between your satire fic and the truly awful fics you're intending to parody. There's no "meta-awareness" within the characters to help the reader understand that everything is a big joke.

#+begin_quote
  perhaps that was a decion made in haste.
#+end_quote

No reader is going to guess that you are spelling stuff wrong intentionally. (At least, I hope you've spelled decision wrong intentionally.) If readers can't tell that you're attempting to MAKE FUN of poorly written fanfiction, they're going to assume your fanfic IS poorly written... and then you won't have readers.

If I'm going to read a parody fanfiction, I want it to be clever. Make fun of tropes without becoming one, grammar and spelling mistakes definitely included.
