I haven't seen this come up yet so I guess I'll mention it.

When writing/reading a fanfic with a younger MC (whether it's in snapshots or not), do you make them talk like actual children or not? Childhood was a long time ago for a lot of us (some more than others) and unless you have a younger relative that's between 3-8 or so, you can't really capture how children act. JK avoids this by having Harry at al start Hogwarts at 11, which gives a lot more flexibility. You can plausibly have 11-year-olds talking like teens or young adults (If they're especially precocious), but sub-9 years old is not going to work out. It might not sound like a lot but there's so much growth between each year of early childhood that can't be compared, and it's easy to forget (3 vs 5 vs 8) since we've long outgrown that phase. Thoughts?


** the inner machinations of minds of the pre high schoolers are incomprehensible to us mere adults

*** That's why they aren't really featured in media. HIgh school is the lowest they go. It's the time we have our most powerful memories, other than college.

** I barely remember middle school (and the few things I remember from my mind at my time can summarised by "OMG I was retarded", and I think this is the case for most people.\\
Considering this I can't ask author to make children really act like children, but I still prefer them to make a clear separation between children and adult. I really hate it when an author makes children acting like political mastermind at eleven, or when they start making long monologue and quoting obsure philosopher but nobody bat an eye at this.

** I think that this is why I enjoy adults in childs bodies, due to time travel or other shenanigans. There is now an excuse for why they seem mature, but on the flip side you can see an adult trying and failing to be kid.

** Tbh as long as they arent sexual like adults, I don't mind precocious children bc they certainly do exist, they just aren't represented in media so much. (e.g. only appearing as oddities in various documentaries about the smartest kids in the country/region)

Smart kids like e.g. Artemis Fowl do exist. Sure, they have absolutely shite skills in other areas due to putting all their eggs in one basket and minmaxing their skills, but to be a prodigy in one field may even require that for most. Add in a magical boost with potions and charms and politicking pureblood 11 yos aren't really a worldbreaker for me - esp if there's a hint of them being deficient in other areas, whether mentally, physically or socially.

*** I've always subscribed to the idea that wizards are just naturally /better/ than muggles, by virtue of having magic reacting to their desires. Not by much, but I could see a kid who really wants to grow up getting a little mental or physical edge from accidental magic.

** I always deal with it by giving Beverly Cleary a re-read. Childhood feels like such a long time ago, but I remember relating with Ramona Quimby so much when I was as young.

** This is a concern I had with my fic.

I tried to keep the language simple, though with some variation. For example, one of the main children was raised by the Malfoys, in a home where elaborate language is a thing, and therefore she picked up a bit on that, but without much excess. Whereas Harry, for example, has a more simple way of talking. My idea is that Hermione, too, has a wider vocabulary in this story, due to reading a lot (but she doesn't appear much to show that).

But language is not the only thing to pay attention. Since my story starts at first year, the children are not acting like people in the Parliament. The girl who was raised by the Malfoys (and Draco, to some extent) have a bit more awareness of politics, but that's not the main concern of their lives, not even by far. They are children, and act like it. If they plot, is because of childish rivalries, not because they want to take over Hogwarts (or the Wizengamont). And their plots are silly, and involve getting each other in trouble with family and teachers, stuff like that. But Percy Weasley, who is 15, is much more keen on gaining influence and contact with important people.

Children have more simple motivation and thought process. What is interesting is seeing how these develop as they grow up, and how a simple "I want to get the attention of my relatives" can turn into a destructive, relentless thing later on.

** As a result of my own experiences, I see children as tiny people who lack inhibitions to their emotional rationality. When writing them i basically just ramp up impulses and restrain self control. I've gotten some praise for it but then again that's from other adults also looking at children from an outside perspective and I'd bet a lot of them overlook how intellectually developed my child characters are on genre related suspension of disbelief.

I find trouble drawing from my own childhood experience because I was raised by a narcissistic parent and so had a lot more responsibility than other kids my age. I have very clear memories of the time period between six and eleven and I remember behaving like most preteen kids are portrayed in media. But that's also not a good perspective on a normal child's behavior. I had to cook for myself and clean up after my mother sometimes/make sure we made appointments so I was essentially behaving like someone five or so years older than I was. I remember thinking of myself as very adult and more competent than I was a lot of the time which lead to me fearlessly tackling issues I shy away from as an adult that's aware of my limitations. This meant I boldly approached social problems head on, and given resistance, physically attacked people twice my size and won regularly, something I'd never attempt today and that kind of boggles my mind thinking back on it.

On an entirely different note, I've never read a narrative that presented 5-10 year old white boys better than Lord of the Flies and I found reading it a great resource for recapturing a lot of playful behavior I didn't have in my personal childhood experience.
