On his 15th birthday, Harry wishes into existence a world where Lily & James are alive, Sirius is presumed dead, Voldemort is all powerful & er...Snape is Uncle Sevi? Can Harry change things back? Does he even want to?

A fanfiction that starts off sweet and magical but quickly becomes darker as the story progresses. A conceptualized idea of the dynamics between James, Lily, Sirius, Remus, Snape and all the kids had the Potters lived.
