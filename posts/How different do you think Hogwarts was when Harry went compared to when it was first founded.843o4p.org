Like when hogwarts was first founded I doubt that you could only stay there to study for seven years ,I think that is a more modern change mabye as late as the 1800s and before that you were a student at hogwarts for life.(and acording to the hogwarts protections you still are which is why it was so easy for Voldemort and the death eaters as ex-student to break them)

I also doubt the four founder taught each other's students. they probably worked more like four magic guild livening under the same roof for protection, with each founder as the grandmaster of there own guild. And it slowly changed over time into what it was during Harrys time.

I also doubt they had anything like the clearly defined class in Harrys time

What changes do you think were made to the way Hogwarts was run over the years since it's founding?

Like a big one that is a confirmed change is the hogwarts express (I think the reason they still take the express is because they use to take that route over several days/weeks by another methods of travel with route they travel being the first step to being keyed into hogwarts wards as a student. Although it's probably only mandatory for first years who haven't been keyed into hogwarts protections)


** Before the Express, students arrived using brooms, carpets, or any other method of Magical travel. After the Statute of Secrecy, brooms became impractical, the Floo was a security risk, and Portkeys could be missed or cause Portkey Sickness.
