Anyone know of any good Tom Riddle Jr./Hermione Granger romance stories? A story that is of a decent length in which Tom isn't a lovey-dovey idiot and it takes some time for Hermione to fully trust him. However, I'm not into any [suggested] rape or elements of the same nature. I don't really care how the two are brought together (e.g. time-travel) but I preferably would like to read where Hermione and someone else (possibly Harry or Ginny or Ron) go back with her.

  With the war looking bleak, the Golden Trio, Ginny, Draco, and Lavender go back to Tom Riddle's 7th Year to destroy Lord Voldemort once and for all. What Hermione DIDN'T count on, however, is a shared common room, a curse, and a crazy little thing called love.

  Hermione finds a curious diary and the boy it's connected to lives in the past. Tom pulls his new 'friend' underwing and her endless potential quickly makes her his favorite soldier. Unfortunately, protecting her when he's 50 years behind her is tricky at best. No TTs, horcruxes, or prophecy. Slytherin!Hermione/Harry. Tomione. Some Anti-Ron&Dumblehate. T at first, M later on.

** Check out linkffn(war paint by provocative envy). It's not the traditional kind of romance but I think it kind of counts? Their relationship is an interesting one.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.
