** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4gax5d/best_of_harry_ships/d2fyzcp][Here]] is the wiki thread of good Harry/Ginny fics.

Like [[/u/stefvh]] said, pottermum has a bunch. So does [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1816754/sbmcneil][sbmcneil]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] is also an H/G writer, though some of his stories just don't work right, and the ending always is unsatisfactory. And of course, there is our Lord and Savior of Canon Compliance: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]. Our own [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] has written a few that can be found over [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][here]].

A) It utterly sucks (terrible grammar, spelling, etc.)

B) You're obnoxious about it

** I'm told it's okay to self plug. I think this fits worryingly neatly into the period between DH and CC. It's a largely Harry-centric mystery Auror story rather than a romance but Harry/Ginny and their children are a bit more than background. If you think it's crap, sorry. If you like it, tell me :) Hope this works [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11662486/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Eversion-of-Magic][Harry Potter and the Eversion of Magic]]
