** Pretty sure it's Ingenio ab Artifex by JaimeJabs. Technically a violation of rule 8 (though very minor, literally doesn't go more than 'We went upstairs and had a great half an hour' level suggestive), so I can't link directly, but the author's profile is below. The Dumbledore thing happens about a third of the way into Chapter 5.
