In 'HP and the Half Blood Prince' it is mentioned that the leaders of at least the British Muggle government is aware of the magical world. Now, we know that a large government like the UK's doesn't let any potentially dangerous group exist without scrutinizing them, and governments have a stupid amount of resources to help them. However, from canon, we get the impression that the Muggle government rarely interacts directly with magicals. Now to the questions!

Going off of this canon information, what might the relationship be like? What are the reasons for the Muggle government being hands off? Is there any legal/bureaucratic link between the two or is magical Britain actually it's own country? What leverage do they have over each other? What are your thoughts?

Here are some ways that I see it potentially working:

1. Binding treaty: Somewhere in the recent or far past, a treaty was created giving the magical world complete autonomy.

2. Sovereign entity: There is no legal connections between the two, the Ministry of Magic is it's own sovereign government and not a subsection of the regular Muggle government.

3. MAD: the regular government has legal or military options against magicals, but magicals have a mutually assured destruction option that keeps the Muggle govt from taking action. Maybe the magicals are bluffing, but maybe not.

4. Hidden: yes the Muggle govt is aware of magicals, but in spite of all their resources the govt cannot get any information on them due to, wait for it, magic! so they have no choice but to be hands off.

5. Mutually beneficial: the Muggle govt gets certain benefits from the magical govt and in return the Muggles agree to be hands off.

Here are some fics that delve into what might happen if there was a connection between the two governments:

** The way I understood that chapter in canon, only the current Prime Minister is told about the Wizarding World, and he doesn't tell anybody because he is afraid that people will think he is crazy and he'll lose his position. So, I guess the muggle government can't scrutinize the Wizarding World as only one person knows about them, and this one person can't really tell anybody.

*** That's a fair interpretation of canon, thanks for the reply!

I my opinion is it just unlikely that the prime minister was actually intimidated enough to keep it a secret. Did he just say "I guess I know what all these random killings are about now, but by golly, there's nothing I can do about it". He doesn't ask around? Or try to get evidence? Visits from the magical minister seem to have the purpose of passing on information, so how does the Muggle minister explain where he has gotten his information?

** Some thoughts:

- The Minister for Magic (the Minister) may or may not be a part of the British state. The HBP visit is unclear, because we don't know to what extent it was mandatory, and to what extent merely Ministry custom.

- If the Minister for Magic *is* subordinate to the Prime Minister, it will mean that they are, formally at least, a member of the Cabinet (itself an executive committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council). The problem with this is that the Minister is not appointed by the Prime Minister (PM), who controls the composition of the Cabinet, but rather directly elected (in an election separate from the Muggle general election). Further, the PM has no control over the Minister's actions, nor does the Minister participate in collective Cabinet responsibility.

- However, there does appear to be some kind of link between the PM and the MfM.

- It should be remembered that the British executive government, while run by the Prime Minister in practice, is the government of the Crown (not the Monarch personally, but the "corporation sole" which constitutes the abstract idea of the Crown). No powers are /formally/ vested in the Prime Minister. He wields executive power from the Queen and legislative power via his majority in Parliament.

- This means that the Minister can be part of the executive government without being subordinate to the Prime Minister, if his executive power comes directly from the Queen, not the Prime Minister. The Cabinet and the Ministry of Magic could therefore be parallel British governments with responsibilities divided between them, with neither one superior to the other, but both subordinate to the Crown. If this is the case, it seems likely that the Minister for Magic (and maybe Ministry Heads of Department?) would be a member of the Queen's Privy Council, as the Cabinet is. The leadership of the Ministry of Magic would be an executive committee of the Privy Council, like the Cabinet.

- It is also possible, however, that the Ministry of Magic is empowered not by the Crown's executive prerogatives, but by the legislative supremacy of Parliament. Parliament could have passed secret legislation creating the Ministry of Magic and empowering it with significant authority to make secondary legislation on magical affairs. If this is the case, then the Minister for Magic is not subordinate to the PM (except to the extent that the legislation made him so), but would be, in theory, subject to the jurisdiction of the courts (as all secondary legislation is). The timing of the foundation of the Ministry of Magic (1707, according to Pottermore) makes it more likely that Parliament created it than the Crown, because this is post-civil war and therefore in the era after Parliament has established itself superior in authority to the Crown.

- However, it could be that the Wizards' Council was a part of the Crown and the Ministry of Magic continues with the same authority, simply having been renamed. If the Ministry of Magic succeeds the authority of the Wizards' Council, then Royal authority is more likely than Parliamentary empowering legislation.

- Of course, it's entirely possible, likely even, that wizards created both the Wizards' Council and the Ministry of Magic themselves, without any formal empowerment by or connection to any Muggle authority, Crown or Parliament or Prime Minister.

- If you disregard the Pottermore statement that Ministry elections take place every 7 years, separate from the Muggle elections, another route presents itself, which is the route I took in Alexandra Potter. In this system, Hogsmeade is a constituency in the UK General Election, and elects a wizarding Member of Parliament. By long standing custom, the sole wizarding MP is made Minister for Magic, a position which was created by Parliamentary legislation after the English civil war, pre-Statute of Secrecy (in which the royalist Wizards' Council was defeated by a magical-Muggle coalition led by Oliver Cromwell and the wizard Brandon Swann) . The Minister for Magic is empowered by Act of Parliament with the ability to issue decrees regulating magical affairs, and is not a part of the Cabinet, but is in theory subject to the authority of Parliament. However, given that Parliament has no idea the magical world exists, this oversight is entirely ineffective.

*** Thank you for such a detailed post! It seems you weren't kidding when you wrote in your FFN profile that you're studying British law. Some follow up thoughts on what you wrote:

I agree that there seems to be something linking the PM and MPM.

This is good to know:

#+end_quote

If this is the case would the MPM's visit be to notify the Queen, with the PM acting as an intermediary?

The suggestion that the MoM was established by the Parliament is pretty compelling to me.

Provided that wizards had been seen as a source of Royal strength, is it possible that the Parliament gave wizards autonomy in order to reduce the King's power? Or maybe granting them autonomy was seen as necessary since the Statute of Secrecy was enacted 15 years prior in 1692 [[https://http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/International_Statute_of_Wizarding_Secrecy#cite_note-QA5-1][HP Wikia]]. As the wizards retreated from society (probably happened gradually) it would have been harder to administer laws over them. By hiding themselves, it was inevitable that the wizards would become their own entity, so the Parliament sought to retain some hold over the magicals by being the power that granted them autonomy.

It seems the Wizengamot came before the MoM around 1544, probably earlier ( [[https://http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizengamot#cite_ref-BS_2-0][HP Wikia]] ). The mundane Witenagemot seems to have ceased around the 12th Century (need confirmation on that), so I'm guessing the Wizengamot goes at least that far back, but again probably further. The Parliament might have empowered the preexisting Wizengamot to be a legislative body like itself.

How are Pottermore and the like regarded as sources? I know that JKR had a hand in creating Pottermore, so do people accept it as canon?

#+begin_quote
  /Of course, it's entirely possible, likely even, that wizards created both the Wizards' Council and the Ministry of Magic themselves, without any formal empowerment by or connection to any Muggle authority, Crown or Parliament or Prime Minister./
#+end_quote

You really covered all the possibilities. A completely independent MoM is a pretty good option like you said. I think it's likelihood depends on the way wizards fit into the general society before the Statute. Were they mixed in with society to a degree, and considered themselves under Royal rule, and only withdrew for protection? Or were they already separatists and the Statute gave them the opportunity to cut ties? Wizards with a separatist mindset have no problem creating the Council and MoM as they wouldn't view themselves as being under any non-magical authority.

It sounds like /Alexandra Potter/ had a lot of thought put into it. I've put it on my too read list. Thanks again for the response!

** I think that the lack of Muggle involvement/knowledge could actually stem, partially, from a complete inability to detect and monitor wizards. They know wizards exist, they know some of what they can do, but they're almost totally reliant on wizards to initiate any kind of contact, and that's how the wizards like it.

It's entirely possible that the British Ministry is technically part of the Muggle Government, and that all wizards are subject to the queen, but that it is so practically irrelevant that the point is moot. It could be considered as something akin to a devolved region, but instead of being geographic in nature (like would later happen in Wales, Scotland and NI) it's based around wizards. Home rule for wizards.

Because nobody can do anything about it.

*** Good thoughts! I like the idea of the MoM being part of the larger British govt, but essentially be free to do what they want. But the Minister of Magic does feel compelled to keep the mundane govt inform of major events. Another commenter also mentioned that in canon the MoM had to notify the govt when they imported a dragon (I don't remember this bit, but I'll trust that it's accurate). Why would the MoM bother to inform the govt of anything or obey a regulation imposed on them?

It could be that you are correct in that the magic world is well hidden, but maybe because mundane govt prefers it that way. Maybe fearing social unrest, they have an agreement: "you hide yourselves, don't let things spill over to much, and in return you get to play at being a sovereign entity". But the muggle govt must have some leverage over the magicals that keeps them in line, encourages them to obey certain rules (tell us about events that might affect us, tell us when you bring giant flying lizards into town, etc).

**** Now that I think about it, the wizarding world seems like a case of "you obviously have control over yourselves, so just stay hidden and everything will be fine for everyone". I imagine there are bilateral agreements to keep each other informed of the crazy things - "Hey wizards, Russia is pointing six million nukes at London"/"Hey muggles, there might be lots of dragons we can't necessarily control here soon. NBD."

In my fanfic I've decided that the Muggle and Wizarding governments are inextricably linked, not that either side would acknowledge this fact nor do most people even think about it. But they're obliged to trade information, even if they don't always, and the Queen is the nominal ruler of wizarding Britain. The constitutional relationship isn't the same as the de facto relationship, but that is what the constitutional relationship is. Wizards just ignore most of the things, and the Muggles who know about wizards ignore most of the things, and everyone is happy.

Back to canon, the thing with magic is that even the muggles who know about it are going to be worried about what would happen if it got out. Fear of magic could have helped kickstart the industrial and scientific revolutions. Then, because the separation was so complete already, it was fostered by both sides because each side feared the other - Muggles didn't want wizards to know all of what they could do (which then kind of just exploded into the modern era) and wizards didn't want muggles to know all of what /they/ could do, either.

***** I like the idea of mutually agreeing to ignore each other. It's a good point that the legal relationship wouldn't necessarily be the de facto relationship, mainly because wizard's are hard to contact/find/control. Thanks for the post!

I wonder if the mundane government actually prefers that the magicals stay technologically and socially backwards? The Muggle govt might not like the idea of magicals having a steady population growth and developing technology comparable to our modern communication, military and manufacturing abilities. With the magicals current size and capabilities they are a concern, but imagine if their population grew to a few million and they had the large scale military power. Perhaps the mundane govt supports people and ideas that keep the wizarding world small and backwards? Maybe they occasionally enable a dragon pox outbreak or a dark wizard to cull the population and fund politicians who keep new technology out? Could be a basis for an interesting mystery fic "A group in the Muggle government has been watching the changes in the wizarding world. They see that the reforms made by Minister Granger after the war have been effective, too effective in encouraging economic and industrial innovation. As often happens after wars, there is a jump in births and the population is growing like never before. They celebrate the vitality of their world, but they didn't realize it would be their downfall".

Taure just posted on this thread, and wrote up an amazing explanation of various possible relationships between the two governments. It really gets into how the British government works now and in the past. According to their profile on FFN, Taure is studying British law and seems to know whats what. Much more informative than my hypothetical ramblings (I am not British, nor do I study parliamentary law).

There are fics that start with the muggle government or military creating a corps of magical people and using that as a lever to move the wizarding world into the open. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] is one such.

I imagine that any PM who decided to follow that path would quickly find themselves obliviated and confunded to the point where they won't even consider such a thing.

** The Ministry is magically bound to seek Muggle approval in certain matters -- a random smattering of interests from back when the geas was first created, intended to be updated, but the Muggles didn't factor in obliviation and confunding. Unfortunately, the wording of the geas left the exact party to seek approval from rather vague. This was partially intentional, what with the tension between Parliament and the crown, but only partially.

These days, whenever a wizard needs the Muggle Prime Minister's approval for anything, they exit the Leaky Cauldron, find the first Muggle they think looks sharp or impressive, and ask them for permission.

** /Shameless copypasta from [[http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/2kdw6u/the_wizards_from_harry_potter_already_had_a_war/][this thread]]:/

This may seem a little far fetched but certain aspects of the wizarding world strike me as odd. It is revealed that at the time of the fourth book the Minister of Magic was required to tell the Prime Minister that he was bringing a dangerous magical creature into the country (a dragon). Why would this rule exist? It doesn't sound like something the wizards would have made up. Their typical policy is to hide things from muggles. This sounds like a rule we would make. Taking this a step further to the Ministry of Magic in general. Why is it called the Ministry of Magic? That doesn't sound like a name of a government. It sounds a lot more like the name of a department. They call the head of this government the Minister of Magic. People in the United States don't call the President the President of America and in Britain the Prime Minister is simply called the Prime Minister. Why is this distinction necessary when wizards don't even seem to know what type of government muggle nations have? Furthermore, no elections are every mentioned. Where did this government come from? From where does it drive its authority? The most compelling piece of evidence is the fact that the wizards are generally lame now a days. Yes, Dumbledor is powerful but compared to the Peverells he is pretty weak. In fact much of his power came from one of their artifacts that now no one knows how to make. Even Nicholas Flamel could construct an artifact that no one was able to reproduce. The founders of Hogwards and Merlin were powerful as well. What happened to the powerful wizards? Why do wizards not experiment with magic more? One reason is that the ministry strictly regulates it. Wizards must register all spells, they must register as anamagi, and they even collect hide powerful artifacts like time turners (which by the way wizards can't make anymore). Another reason is a general culture of complacency and lethargy that seems to permeate the wizarding world. They are ignorant to muggle affairs and technology that may be to their benefit, they see no reason to advance magic or their rather antiquated culture. By and large they seem almost pacified. My theory is that some time near the end of the middle ages the muggle trials were more successful than the wizards were led to believe. We found some way to defeat the most powerful of the wizards (by some magical means or perhaps from trickery or shear numbers). Muggles killed the most powerful of the wizards, destroyed magical knowledge, and created the Ministry of Magic to keep wizards in check. The entire government is actually a clever plan to make wizards believe they are doing this to themselves. After centuries of living under this bureaucracy its policies have become part of the very culture of magic. The wizarding community seems to be withering and I think this may be by clever design. TLDR: The wizarding world is on a steep decline in large part because of the Ministry of Magic. My theory is that Muggles set this up in order to cause the decline and eliminate the threat of magic.

If anybody knows a fic with something along those lines, I'd be so happy to read it.

** I would imagine it's a case of the Queen and her heir knowing of their existence at all times, given her role as head of state and queen of the United Kingdom (of which Wizarding Britain would be considered at least a part of even if you separated them from their muggle counterparts). She's the one who welcomes/ratifies the PM to his position after all, it makes sense that she'd know in this situation. Perhaps she even welcomes/ratifies the Minister for Magic too?

After that I believe the Prime Minister is the only one in the government informed. Though if the situation calls for it, I wouldn't put it past them to have people in high ranked positions all over the government, armed forces and emergency services who know of the existence of their magical counterpart's world. They'd be safeguards more than anything else. All for the sake of keeping the Statute of Secrecy in place.

It would be minimalist though, so maybe at most five or six people excluding the PM and the monarch.

At least that's my interpretation of the situation.

*** Good point! Baring some magical explanation like "we removed all knowledge/memories of magic", I think the Queen would be aware. With the involvement of Grindwald in WWII, it seems likely that PM Winston Churchill would have known as well, whether or not the Ministry of Magic approached him. Churchill would be giddy at finding something new that might need blowing up. I agree with you that there would be safeguards. I imagine though that even the PM's security would know (wouldn't they need to recognize the sound of apparation or to dodge spells?).

** I think the big question between muggle and magical governments would revolve around the degree of mutual assistance the two provide each other.

Take military action for example-in a magic exists scenario, there are a number of threat vectors military commanders would have to take into consideration when planning out a campaign.

Between apparition, disillusionment and the killing curse, a rogue magical operating for the enemy could potentially throw what started out as a fairly straightforward military engagement into a chaotic free-for-all that results in the entire campaign being potentially jeopardised by one or more magical sources.

The only way they would have to actively deny enemy magicals leverage in the conflict would be to call on magicals of their own.

Now, in the case of the UK's armed forces, the likelihood of one or more fully qualified muggleborn having joined the military is considered fairly high in fandom, though that point is largely debatable given how many money-making avenues muggleborn could exploit in the muggle world without breaking the statute of secrecy/committing crimes.

These soldiers would be hidden behind falsified paperwork, memory wipes etcetera, but they would exist and could potentially come forward if approached by an 'in the know' intelligence officer.

This would then open them up for deployment as defensive assets meant to combat enemy use of magics in a warzone.

However, there are cases where magical combat organisations actively collude/have their own conflicts timed to coincide with their muggle counterparts'. Evidence for this is actually canon, with Grindelwald being active as a Dark Lord in Europe up until 1945 and being imprisoned in his fortress, Nurmengard, thereafter.

When this is the case and a military campaign includes enemy forces actively aided and abetted by magical ones, then the need for magical assistance from a trusted source becomes paramount to victory.

Which is when, in the UK at least, everything goes ploin-shaped.

See, magical-muggle liaison would be an issue in the Potter 'verse simply because neither side can see eye to eye.

One side views the other as backwards neanderthals scrambling to emulate success and the other side sees their counterparts as fictional and, in their fiction, more than somewhat vaguely evil (I mean, how many /good/ witches or wizards actually exist in pre-HP or D&D fiction? Not nearly as many as the evil ones...).

If both sides are forced to cooperate in a military campaign, I cannot help but see it ending badly, but nevertheless, the need for that system is there.

The same goes for economic, intelligence and border protection matters-with the wizarding community somehow managing to be so insular they have been completely bypassed by the 20th bloody century in terms of technological and social development (which is yet another plus in favour of the 'muggleborn don't stay unless they absolutely have to' column), it is actually questionable as to how closely they would be able to cooperate with securing a modern military without months and months of training.

Here is my opinion on the matter-the two governments don't so much keep each other at arms' length as completely disregard the existence of their respective counterparts until shit is well and truly fucked. A cooperative attitude would have resulted in more than the 'oh by the way, we have a superpowered terrorist mass murderer that can teleport and has hundreds of less superpowered but still violently insane teleporting minions following him running around the country. Have a nice day.' at the start of book six. Even then, Fudge's clear dismissal of the 60 million plus citizens of the UK's capabilities in actually defending themselves is /not/ the diplomatic approach when talking with the prime minister of a still very influential global player. He's lucky he didn't get a 'hey, you're right about that. I'll just get the president, who I'm sure has been briefed as well, to send over a couple of hundred thousand troops to do some 'exercises' in rural Scotland.' from him.

With relationships between them being so toxic, the government probably has resorted to maintaining its own hush hush magical force-muggleborn, werewolves, squibs, creatures willing to accept equal rights and six figure salaries in exchange for keeping the UK's economy, infrastructure and military from being subverted by magical influence. Basically, the dregs of magical society would be snatched up by the UK, given education, housing, muggle combat training and specialisation training in exchange for twenty years' service at her majesty's orders. Military would get the bulk of them. The rest would be assigned to the various intelligence agencies, such as the MI-#'s, the trade intelligence specialists, the guys that handle national security through Scotland Yard yada yada yada. As they marry and have kids, they'd then send them to Hogwarts under an assumed name in order to keep the charade going, which leads to their kids being treated like muggleborn too and ending up in the UK government's hands as special assets to the crown themselves. They then send their kids and, well, you get the picture.

Over time, such a system would result in there being two societies of magicals running parralel to each other. One calls itself the wizarding world, the other calls itself the Dentist Practitioners' Activities Oversight Committee and has its head office buried in an industrial Park somewhere in the Slough Area.

Thing is, with the amount of resources the DPAOC would have access to, it is very likely that they have started researching/creating their own magical setups anyway-and you can bet at least one asset has tried to build either a lightsaber, a space ship, the TARDIS, a sonic screwdriver or Raising Heart in his/her spare time... and succeeded.

So, to me, the UK government leaves the insular society of incompetents the hell alone and concentrates instead on growing their own, far more ambitious, hungry and lethal National Magical Defence Force in secret so that said Force can be deployed when the MOM once again completely fails to adress a Voldemort-level national security issue. As for Wizarding Britain, well they just keep on going for as long as they can until somebody points out the complete and total absence of muggleborn to the ministry-meaning no low-wage workers, acceptable targets for all the other downtrodden minorities or fodder for the local criminal organisations. THEN everybody is going to panic... and likely get a Nuclear Friendship Beam to the face.

I would read that continuation.

*** Agreed, I think it is very likely that muggleborns find their way into government work. If nothing else, they would be intelligence analysts or advisors on magical issues. Unless the MoM has some Big Brother system to track and prevent that sort of thing...
