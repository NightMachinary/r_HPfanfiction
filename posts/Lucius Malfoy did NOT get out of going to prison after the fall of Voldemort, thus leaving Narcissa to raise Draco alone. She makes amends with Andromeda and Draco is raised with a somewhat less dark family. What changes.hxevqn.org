** Hmm... well Lucius never drops the diary in Ginny Weasley's books in CoS. It may be that his arrest and imprisonment leads to a search of the Malfoy manner and the diary is found, in which case it's a matter of whether there's a ministry official competent to recognize what it is or cognizant enough to involve Dumbledore. Or if the diary isn't discovered, it gathers dust in the mansion until Voldemort returns, which means a delay in both figuring out the horcrux puzzle and locating them, especially since the diary is the most mundane/unremarkable horcrux and Malfoy Manor is the hiding place with the least connection to Voldemort. Ultimately it could make the Second War much worse and more drawn out. But Hagrid doesn't get sent back to Azkaban, so that's a plus.

*** Hagrid would also never become a teacher either, as that could only happen once his name was cleared. As for the horcruxes, there's more of a problem than just not being able to find the diary. If the events of CoS never happen then the sword wouldn't be impregnated with Basalisk venom, and they wouldn't have access to the fangs either. Without this they would have had an even harder time destroying the horcruxes.

*** Alternatively maybe Narcisa sells the diary in the blackmarket as she would want to prevent the Ministry from finding dark artifacts in her house right after Lucius' is arrested. From there the Horcrux hunt becomes much harder as they would have to track it down through the buyers, Voldemort would potentially become even angrier over it than Lucius just getting it outright destroyed. It's also possible that TMR manages to bring himself back to life fully.

** I am a big supporter of the fanon where when it comes down to it Narcissa is more dangerous than Lucius. Mind, this is the lady that was raised in a family where Andromeda was kicked out for marrying Ted, and her sister was Bellatrix. Her mother was a Rosier.

Narcissa is the woman who lied to Voldemort because she found information on her son more important, even though she were in no position to actually help Draco should he need immediate help.

A Draco that was raised by Narcissa alone would probably just as racist as the canon one, just more careful about shoving it in other people's faces. Unlike the canon one he could probably plan his way out of a paper bag.

Maybe less spoiled and more disciplined. Canon Draco was a daddy's boy after all.

** Draco would probably be a better person or maybe just a more dangerous person. It kinda depends on Narcissa and maybe Snape (I don't think he's actually his godfather but Narcissa did go to him to protect Draco in cannon).

Draco would either be stronger/ more mature because he can't hide in his father's shadow and in many fanfiction stories it's Lucius who turns Draco into a spoiled little toad lacking any skill. Or maybe Narcissa is the weak link in the family, I think in the books she was the one who blocked Draco from going to Durmstrang so him being sheltered, spoiled and entitled might be her doing.

We don't really know much about Narcissa, she might be a true black with an affinity for politicking and acting from the shadows, she might be a spoiled airhead of a pure blood princess, or she might be a somewhat normal person surrounded by terrible people, that never had much say over her life.

The diary wouldn't end up with Ginny. This could throw of the entire (horcrux) plot with Dumbledore taking longer to discover them and Harry and the gang having to raid Malfoy manor, or it could get fast tracked by the aurors finding it early or Narcissa finding out and reacting like Regulus.

Depending on how close they actually worked together, Fudge might 1. Not become minister 2. Be a better minister 3. Still be a corrupt and incompetent minister with different shady backers. (I don't think we know enough about this to say)

The war might start sooner and bloodier as I don't think there are any inner circle death eaters who have the same connections and soft skills to influence tyre ministry and the media like Lucius. (Partly head canon, but as one of Voldemort's top guys he'd have to be good at something, right?)

*** Plot-twist: Narcisa finds the diary, discovers what it is and very publicly goes to the Ministry to revel it while making up as much BS as possible about having been forced to serve Voldemort by Lucius.

After it everyone is even more certain that Voldemort is dead while raising Narcisa only a little below Harry on the fame totem. She uses her new political weight and becomes minister after Bagnold instead of Fudge. As minister she shows herself much more dangerous because unlike Fudge she has the brain to think her plans through and is discreet about her corruption.

Maybe she tries to get Sirius executed to get his inheritance but it backfires when Pettigrew comes up during the trial (potentially making them get closer as she would be the responsible for his release and she would be smart enough to not say just why she did it). Then she starts pushing the pureblood agenda (not slaughtering muggle and muggleborns, but establishing pureblood privileges and maybe something about traditions and the Dark Arts). Contrary to Fudge she would definitely not be hearing Dumbledore, so maybe a political Cold War between the Ministry and Hogwarts?

**** But what would happen when someone inevitably resurrects Voldemort? To me it sounds like he wouldn't be welcomed by Narcissa either, so I could see her going all "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" temporarily with Dumbledore and his ilk while dealing with Voldemort, and then once he's dealt with, go back to the previous status quo.

***** That's one of the ways it could go, alternatively Voldemort takes deep offense at having his Horcrux destroyed and kills her ASAP, potentially pushing a grief stricken Draco to Dumbledore's side.

Or Voldemort also could not come back to life at all. With Pettigrew at prison the only chance he would get at coming back to life would be Quirell and we all know how that ended. With Horcruxies being public knowledge Dumbledore could start the hunt much earlier, potentially with Narcisa's help to escape Voldemort's fury, so he would know how Voldemort stayed alive years before he would otherwise, has the governments (Secret) support, and have at least one year beyond cannon to figure it out before Voldemort's resurrection, potentially decades, to say nothing of Sirius and all the Black family's resources including their vast knowledge on such magic and the locket. On the other end of the spectrum if Voldemort does manages to come back he will be even more paranoid about his Horcruxies, which can make things much harder (maybe Quirrel takes it from Hogwarts and hides in the chamber? No reason for Harry to find it without the attacks, so it would stay hidden).

Only other scenario that I can think of is that without Pettigrew to the the ritual and his other followers enjoying a relatively low-risk political battle instead of the high-risk one Voldemort doesn't manage to return for even more years, maybe even decades, Hell, by the chaos theory Narcisa being minister could cause enough of a difference that maybe he doesn't even get to possess Quirrel in first place, which incidentally would prevent the Troll and potentially the trio's friendship. In this case chances are that he would have gone from merely crazy to drooling while staring vacantly insane and not be much of a threat. Hell, he only managed to come back after Narcisa died of old-age. Without the threat I also don't see Harry or the others going on to become Aurors or even being that invested in DADA.

** With Narcissa making amends with Andromeda, I can see Draco practically hero worshipping his older cousin, what small child wouldn't be obsessed with Tonks, and the 7 year age gap is just right for hero worship. This would then completely change his views on hufflepuff, resulting in him getting annoyed at Ron for insulting them on the Hogwarts express. It would also completely alter his views on blood purity.

Also, if things roughly follow cannon, apart from CoS, which can't happen without Lucius, things would really become interesting come book 5 when the death eaters are broken out of Azkaban. I'm not sure exactly how I think it will play out, but I think that's when things would start to get really different.

** Narcissa felt a cold chill overcome her as she Walked up the stairs with three guards thanking her. This would be the last visit the ministry would allow. A final goodbye bought with one last Anonymous donation, as The Malfoy name was as good as mud now. Lucius was in prison his bastard of a turn he had made a mess of his trial, And they hadn't even given him the Courtesy of a lifestyle like Bellatrix no her husband had been sentenced to the kiss. A sentence that would be carried out that evening as the Aurors Insisted There was no reason to wait they wouldn't want to risk the prison overcrowding as they moved Onto the next docket of Alleged death eaters.

​

The reality of her rapidly Changing circumstances made Narcissa want to scream, Her wonderful husband was going to be executed in the most gruesome of Way and she had One -year-old At home who could say dada yet, Crying every night for a father That could never come home. But what really terrified her what the harsh reality as the transport ship Had docked on this Godforsaken island in the middle of the Irish Sea With icy waves breaking over the rocks, Was that in just a few short weeks Her son Would most likely forget the man he was wailing for, As her journey to her husband cell came to an end the sinking feeling of the harsh reality came to arrest her little boy would grow up without his father. The man she loved so much, Lucius Malfoy Would just be a painting and a story to her baby boy. A father that lived on the wind rather than in corporeal form.

​

It made Narcissa want to cry, Even as she stepped inTo Lucius's cell And they said their last goodbyes.

​

The guards at least gave them the courtesy of turning their backs as they made love for the last time. In the hopes as Lucius put it, Of him being able to give her one last gift to remember him bye.

​

Narcissa left the cell heart broken but holding back the tears until she was out of his ear shot her husband wanted to go to the gallows dignified with his head held high as it was his last act and he asked of her To not cry in his presence As she cried he would too. And he would never be able to stop, Not even at the Dementor's embraced him.

​

So Narcissa left her husband for the last time in a cold Stone so that would be his final prison Until he died even if it was only for a short time.

​

But the guards didn't take her directly out of the prison instead they led her To a small office with warden embossed on the door. The name Tonks was written in black letters Etched into the wood. One of the guards practically shoved her in tears running down her cheeks she stumbled a bit but someone caught her. Familiar hands Steadied her shoulders And calm words were offered In the hopes of providing some comfort.

​

Narcissa looked at the woman before her and began to sob. Andromeda her sister was hugging her.

Narcissa let herself cry, For the first time in years taking advantage in the comfort Family could provide, WNile they waited for the sentence to be carried out.So Narcissa could leave and bury her husband and Bella.

Two people she loved would be dying tonight, And Andromeda was the only person she could lean on through all of it.

***** I would kind of love to see this role reversal. Especially, if Draco finds Harry before Ron does.

Before I get accused of bashing, I don't really think Ron is ever intentionally rude, but he can be careless about others feelings. Let's not forget about why Hermione was crying in the bathroom first year. This doesn't make him a bad person, a stupid eleven year old, sure, but not bad, and this is a role reversal scenario.....

So with this in mind, Ron rolls up, tries to nosily poke at Harry's wicked cool scar, without thinking about how he got it, and insults Draco, because he's "the wrong sort," (but replace bloodtraitor with a convicted death eaters son/future Slytherin.) Ron thinks he's being helpful, but...

Draco and Harry are both kinda uncomfortable, and Harry gets mad that Ron has insulted his new friend, so he kicks the Weasley boy out of the compartment.

Ron is super embarassed and storms out of the compartment. He just wanted a friend, and he's jealous of Malfoy.

I'd love to see this Ron try to prove himself more. He doesn't have the money or influence of a Malfoy, but he's a Weasley and they've got talent coming out of their ears, and this Ron is thirsty to prove himself even if its just to prove he's better than Draco Malfoy.

Harry and Draco end up in Slytherin, and Snape has an anuerism because the Potter boy ends up in his house and is friends with Draco, and the world is probably going to end because now he's going to responsible for both of them.

To make this scenario even more chaotic. All three of these dumb boys end up in Slytherin together because the hat sees Ron's ambition to prove himself and runs with it.

Ron and Draco fight over who gets to be friends with Harry. Harry get's fed up with both of them and goes down a walk on Halloween through the castle to clear his head. Ron and Draco come and find him just in time because Harry's bad luck causes him to stumble on a troll. They save him, and all become friends.

** The big thing is no diary for Ginny, that's very bad.

Dumbledore will have a harder time realising that Voldemort has horcruxes, and will be much less likely to realise he has multiple. The diary was very important there, not only is it evidence he made one, but it's intended to be put in danger, meaning it clearly isn't the only thing between him and death, because he'd never let anyone use it if it was.

And even if Dumbledore dies figure it out, perhaps via Slughorn, he'd probably go looking for another famous artefact rather than a diary, after all the others are all ancient and valuable, no way would he use a mere book.

Oh and they have neither a basilisk fang nor a basilisk venom infused sword, so destroying a horcrux is now extremely difficult, fiendfire is the only option, but that stuff is dangerous, Dumbledore can probably manage, though it's telling he chose to use the sword instead, but I doubt Harry, Ron or Hermione could do it safely.

This means keeping the horcruxes, with their insidious influence, around longer and probably trying to gather multiple before unleashing fiendfire somewhere relatively empty and fleein6.
