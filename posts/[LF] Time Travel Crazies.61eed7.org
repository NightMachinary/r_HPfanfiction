So I'm looking for a fic where Protag travels through time and after running around like a nut goes up to Dumbledore or his equivalent and is like I'm from the future (gives brief synopsis of hp books or plot whatever) and Albus is just like /stuns, calls St. Mangos/

Doesn't have to be exactly that, but more or less time travel where no one believes the protagonist. Doesn't have to be time travel either. But the idea made me laugh.

*** That sounds like it might be either A Little Child Shall Lead Them or Palimpsest.

** Hmm...I don't know about time travel, but I do know a story where Harry is sent to Azkaban at the end of book 2 (being framed for Ginny Weasley's condition) and Ron is sent to St. Mungos under the belief that he was thoroughly confounded by the Dark Lord Potter. It's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3595986/1/Fugitives-of-Azkaban][Fugitives of Azkaban]] if you want to read it.

I wonder how long a state of affairs with a time traveller being kept in St. Mungos would last for? All they'd have to do is report a few correct things like Quirinus Quirrel is possessed by the spectre of Voldemort, the Philosopher's Stone is hidden in Hogwarts, Barty Crouch is hiding his son under an invisibility cloak and the Imperius curse...

Admittedly, those do sound insane, right up until they're checked...I wonder if you could have a plot point along those lines, a first chapter from the time-traveler's viewpoint where they get committed to St. Mungo's (like Philosopher's Stone, Goblet of Fire and Half Blood Prince had first-chapter-different-viewpoints with Vernon Dursley, Dumbledore, Frank Bryce and Severus Snape respectively), then it's irrelevant for the next few chapters until some big reveal has 'wait, that guy at St. Mungos kept insisting that this was going to happen'...
