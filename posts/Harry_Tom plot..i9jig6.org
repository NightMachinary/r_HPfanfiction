So I've just had this idea to write a Harry/Tom story, about Harry being reincarnated during Tom's school days. I know it's a cliche, but I have a few ideas on how to make it different.

My problem is, if Harry manages to sway Tom Riddle, no major conflict in the future.


** There's always Grindewald to act as the antagonist. I recommend you to make Harry someone who can stand on his own; truly equal to Tom.

I can't stand seeing Harry as weak and Tom as a perfect charming wizard because... Let's be honest, do you thing someone as him would be interested in an unremarkable Harry? No way.

** 4 solutions come to mind :

- You could just end the story the moment Harry managed to "sway" Tom. Next chapter in an epilogue years in the future where Harry contemplate the changes in the timeline and how happy he is about it.
- You could make a Cursed Lover plot, a bit like Dumbledore and Grinderwald. Harry and Tom love each other, but Tom still chose to become Voldemort, and Harry become a leader of the resistance against him.
- Canon Voldemort could also have reincarnated into this timeline (into another character) and, after seeing how "weak" his counterpart became, chose to take the matters into his own hand. Harry and Tom now have to fight together against another Dark Lord who has decades of experience above them, and was not idle while they were having their school romance.
- In the absence of Voldemort, another unrelated Dark Lord make his apparition. One of his Death Eater who become in charge, a Dark Wizard he killed during his travels who attack Britain . . . (I don't really like this option but it's a possibility).
