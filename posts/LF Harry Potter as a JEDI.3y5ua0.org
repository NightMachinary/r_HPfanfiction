Hey guys, I would like to hear your recommendations about Star Wars and HP cross overs? I would like them to be novel length. I know I can just search cross overs but I want to read good ones. not tredge through the muck to find those rare gems if they exist. Thanks yall. and Merry Christmas!


** In addition to the ones howtopleaseme posted, here are two more that I remember dealing with this stuff:

linkffn(11576387; 7104491)

He's not exactly a jedi in the latter one (“Force Sensitive”), but it's close enough, and the former one (“The Katarn Side”) is still being written though by now I think it's potentially better than “Revenge of the Wizard” that howtopleaseme has posted which is written by the same person.

  At age eight, Harry Potter had an epiphany. He realized, with the utter certainty that only an eight years old can have, that he was a Jedi.

** linkffn(The Havoc side of the Force) and its companion linkffn(The Unsuspecting side of the Force)

linkffn(Equilibrium)

linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For)

linkffn(Harry Potter, The Jedi That Would Not Die)

linkffn(Revenge of the Wizard)

linkffn(Discordant)

--------------

My favorites are Equilibrium and I Still Haven't. Both have the same 'injection point'. Revenge of the Wizard is complete and very good. That author Darth Marrs has a whole bunch of crossovers, some of them are pretty decent. His WIP especially.

  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

  Ahsoka feeling abandoned, betrayed and disillusioned with the Jedi Order, decided to part ways. She left to find meaning and purpose in her life. She never expected it to come in the form of an enigmatic green eyed young man who had more than a passing interest in the past. She never imagined that learning about the history of the galaxy could be so dangerous---or magical.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
