This is both a discussion and recommendation thread.

I want to know what are the most unusual, but still fun or at least semi-realistic pairings you have come across in fan fiction stories. So for example, no Harry/Umbridge, but what about a Narcissa/Remus?

I will be blunt that as far as recommendations go, in that I would prefer non-slash pairings myself, but if it's a really interesting one feel free to recommend whatever as others may be interested.


** I think the most unusual pairing that is still very likely is Harry/Katie. Both are Quidditch players and fans, both have (in Katies case /seem/ to have) a lot in common in terms of their characters and they are close together both in terms of age and in terms of actual, physical distance with both of them being Gryffindors.

I also think there isn't much you have to change to make Harry / Parvati a thing. Give her some saving grace when it comes to the gossiping and girly-girl part and you can definitely write an interesting partner for Harry there.

*** Unusual in terms of not seeing it in fanfiction yes. Not really unusual in terms of the match itself. I would LOVE to see more Harry/Katie and think the shell is there for a very good relationship, even though we don't know a ton about Katie's background.

**** The issue with her is that it is difficult to write her without creating a Ginny 2.0 or throwing shade at Ginny by creating a "better" version of her because the only thing we know about Katie is Quidditch and Ginny didn't get much more than that in HBP (when she was the love interest, she was actually a good character in OOTP). Alternatively, you can go down with an initial big sister/guide role, but then you run into the same problem but with Hermione.

I've posted asking for Harry/Katie fics and someone said almost word for word what you said haha! I think I argued back that while I did agree it would be easy to accidentally create Ginny 2.0, I thought Katie being more of a blank slate would allow the author to take it in a completely different path if written so.

****** Might be. I posted a similar answer a few times because I doubt that most people read every thread.

The one thing you can avoid with Katie are the other Weasleys, but even then it kinda feels like you are throwing shade at them. You could make her talented in a certain subject, but that is rather one-dimensional (just like "Quidditch Girl").

***** Just write off Ginny's childhood infatuation as just that- instead of becoming Harry's girlfriend, just change her character a bit to have her grow out of her crush on Harry, and make them close but platonic friends when she finally realizes that he's just a boy instead of some knight in shining armor. That opens up space for a new ship without diminishing her canon significance or bashing her.

I don't see Narcissa getting together with who she was raised to see as a monster. She was too close to Lucius for that to be believable. Also, Lupin isn't the pinnacle of potential partners and his marriage wasn't exactly covered in glory.

If you want an unusual Narcissa pairing, try Narcissa/Sirius because both had a fit of teenage rebellion and the possible scandal made it much sweeter. They grew up with cousin relationships (one of their parents IIRC), so the leap to that is a lot smaller than to "let's fuck a beast".

#+begin_quote
  Remus and Narcissa could have gotten together during school (so before she was married), via a connection through Sirius as we know little about who Narcissa was as a child/teen. While it is assumed, due to being a Black, that she was raised prejudiced in favor of blood purity, her own sister Andromeda took a very different path and she could have as well when put in the right situation. We also DO know that Narcissa is not necessarily as bad as she may appear as a Malfoy, from her willingness to turn against Voldemort to protect family.

**** Narcissa was born in 55, Sirius and Lupin in 60. When Narcissa was at Hogwarts, Lupin was 13, 14 at most. And we know that Narcissa does not defy pureblood culture/mindsets until the very end, and even then she does so to save her child, who also is a pureblood. Lupin is not confrontational enough to pull a relationship with her (he would not defy the norms of society). Just look at how much he can reel the Marauders in.

Narcissa/Remus is not more believable than Harry/Bellatrix or Hermione/Bellatrix. It can be done, but it requires a lot of mental gymnastics and will never be a very serious pairing.

That said, perhaps if they somehow met when he was a fugitive in the wizarding world, and she nursed him back to health or something while he tried to be a father figure to Harry, all hidden away from others. Of course, this would require removing Vernon from the equation somehow... like an earlier heart attack death. And it would also require his face to not be broadcast in the muggle world or for Petunia to know the truth somehow that he's innocent.

It would certainly be an interesting pairing to play with.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

She fought Greyback (one of the boogeymen from her childhood) at the Battle of Hogwarts. She stood and fought when her friends were in danger.

You will find thousands of fics where everyone is behaving themselves, but honestly, how many stories have you read where they go on a pub crawl? Where Hermione or Harry let themselves be led astray from social expectations? (outside of crack or total OOC behaviour like Lord Potter-Black stories)

You sometimes see that kind of dynamic in unbelievable pairings like with Malfoy or Parkinson, but "Fleur the seductress" or "Tonks the bad influence" isn't exactly common. In fact, almost all stories have an inevitable swich where Harry "takes charge" and not a lot of fics where he is just along for the ride, too stunned by what is happening.

** Dudley/a witch. I vaguely remember one where he married an OC who didn't really know Harry at all, and was amazed to find out her fiance's estranged cousin was the Man Who Won, and I think Dudley thanked Harry because if it weren't for him, Dudley would never have given her a chance after discovering she was a witch. I have an idea her name was Melody....I should have a look for it.

But yeah, I think it's unusual, but semi-realistic at least. I believe there was another where he falls in love with a Muggleborn who was hiding at the same safehouse he was.

*** Millicent has been such an unlikeable character (theoretically) that while some fics do try and "change" or "reform" her, she is rarely paired with Harry so that would be unusual. Beyond the 4 you mention (and I guess Astoria), I don't think we know the identity of any other Slytherin girl around Harry's age. Probably one reason why some people turn Blaise into a girl, and more reason for time travel fics that pair Harry with a Slytherin girl.

There is a lot wrong with your post, but I will start by pointing out that Remus and Narcissa could have gotten together during school (so before she was married), via a connection through Sirius as we know little about who Narcissa was as a child/teen. While it is assumed, due to being a Black, that she was raised prejudiced in favor of blood purity, her own sister Andromeda took a very different path and she could have as well when put in the right situation. We also DO know that Narcissa is not necessarily as bad as she may appear as a Malfoy, from her willingness to turn against Voldemort to protect family.

And how you see Severus/Tonks as cool (aka possible), but Narcissa/Remus as a non-possibility, is beyond me o.O

you can invent a new personality for her as a teen, but you're basically creating an OC. what we know from her in canon is that she's stuck up, bigoted, cruel, and devoted her to husband and son. also you don't know when she was married.

******* Snape bullied children out of pettiness and despite owing a life debt to one of them (which is a big thing if you look at Pettigrew). He was unnecessarily cruel and called his best friend a racial slur while meaning it.

Narcissa meanwhile is a stuck-up bitch and the only wrongdoing we actually see her do is some rather forced collaboration with Voldemort, as opposed to voluntarily joining the Death Eaters and dooming at least one family by telling Voldemort about the prophecy. And you don't make the inner circle by printing motivational posters, so he had to do some serious shit.

Also, a good deed does not wash away a bad one. He still has blood on his hands, while Narcissa does not. And she was not stupid enough to play "chase a likely werewolf on a full-moon night".
