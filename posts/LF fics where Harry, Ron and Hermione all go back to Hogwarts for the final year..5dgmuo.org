Ideally with canon pairings, but not a requirement.


** Didn't you know? Killing Dark Lords is equivalent to graduating. It's an old law Harry's goblin banker told him about.

  What happens during the year after the battle ends? Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Draco pick up the pieces left behind in the post-war Wizarding World-a world where they are adults and Voldemort is gone in body but not in spirit... This is *mostly* based off of book canon and what JK Rowling has said in interviews. Rated M for some lemon-y scenes.

** Usually these are called "eighth year" fics and there's a tag for them on Ao3. But I've not seen any with canon pairings because usually if there are canon pairings, it follows canon (Pottermore I think?) where Ron and Harry don't go back.

I've read a BUNCH of drarry fics that are 8th year and a few are really great - here's [[http://archiveofourown.org/bookmarks?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&bookmark_search%5Bsort_column%5D=created_at&bookmark_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Hogwarts+Eighth+Year&bookmark_search%5Bquery%5D=&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=1&bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=0&user_id=katelawyer86][a link to those]] if you'd like those recs. I think there are also quite a few Draco/Hermione too but I've not read any that are memorable.

** How can they go back to school in such a hostile environment, unless you remove voldemorts influence, it would just be a run and hide story from the death eaters

*** I meant after Voldemort's been defeated. Hermione canonically goes back for her final year, after all.
