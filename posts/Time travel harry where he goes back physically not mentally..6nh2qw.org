Basically there will be two harry potters when he goes back in time.

Not needed, but he can replace the other harry or combine with him or other reasons, but as long as he can still at least keep his magical abilities it's fine.

Edit: Sorry it's my fault i didn't put this here, but could the story either be completed or have at least gotten past third year if not fourth.


** linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute by The Voice of the Nephilim) is really the only one I can think of at this moment.

*** That...might actually be interesting to read. Imagine something like '7 Hocruxes=immortality' or 'Quirrel not snape' or 'peter not sirius is guilty' etc..., but that might be worth looking into.

  Go back to the beginning, that was the plan. Stop Voldemort on the cusp of becoming a dark lord, stop him before he created his first horcrux and change history before it could be written. That was the plan, only Harry made a mistake.

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
