:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's a completed fic, where in the Order or something summons Canon!Harry to their dimension to defeat Voldemort apparently. In this dimension, Harry is a Slytherin and dating Draco.

Canon!Harry is the only Gryffindor they summoned. All I remember is that the dimension Harry was speculated to have committed suicide and Draco blames Snape for it, even tho it is apparently Dumbledore's fault. No bashing last I remembered but I could be wrong.

It's a completed fic with it ending that Snape follows Harry back to canon dimension. No romance at all despite the implicit reference to Dimension Harry's relationship.

Can't remember much beside that, but it's been only my mind for a while now. Would be nice to read it again.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.
