:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that it was immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry is hiding out at 12 Grimmauld Place, having gone there after the fight instead of trying to sleep in Gryffindor as he did in canon. Kingsley Shacklebolt, having been sworn in as temporary Minister, finds him there and cooks him breakfast and talks to him about what happens next. He specifically wants Harry to be in the public eye, because people are still going to be scared and shocked for awhile and they need something to rally around. Harry dithers on that, since he's dealing with losing Lupin, Tonks, and so many others.

Later in the fic, after dealing with the goblins. Harry decides to open a new wizard bank, using a cache of gold that he just happened to find at 12 Grimmauld Place in a hidden safe. Bill Wesley, having lost his job at Gringotts due to his association with the Golden Trio, is hired to help Harry start the bank and manage it.

#+begin_quote
  The morning after defeating Voldemort, Harry finds he wants nothing more than to be left alone. However, angry goblins, dementors, and a well-meaning Minister make this impossible, imposing on Harry more responsibilities than he wants... and then some.
