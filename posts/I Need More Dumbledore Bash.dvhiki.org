If you're a person who loves Dumbledore and his OOTP, then leave. This ain't for you.

Do you guys have any fanfiction with mature Dumbledore bash? I'm not looking for a fic where everyone is constantly yelling at/arguing with Dumbledore for no reason just to make Dumbledore haters feel good.

I'm after a fanfiction with legitimate reasons for Dumbledore being in trouble. Such as the hundreds of laws he probably broke to manipulate Harry into being his little dog. I LOVE Independent!Harry fics and I don't mind pairings as long as they're not completely unrealistic (Harry/Snape for example).

Pls! Send me your recommendations!

The first 7 chapters are rather dark, afterwards if cracky fluff. Dumbledore is the main antagonist but, as good crackfics should, it does not take itself very seriously.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
