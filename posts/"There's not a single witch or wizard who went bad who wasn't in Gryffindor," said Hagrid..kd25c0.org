If Harry is not champion, Hagrid would not be compelled to tell Cedric about , as he wasn't in cannon. Even when he knew at least Fleur had access to it.

He'd be supporting Cedric like everyone else and hanging out with his friends-including Hagrid, the man who he already helped smuggle a dragon out of the castle. I don't think the guy who couldn't keep his mouth shut about Fluffy would be able to resist bragging about his favorite creatures to his favorite students.

********* Suppositions. Hagrid doesn't reach Harry before in canon because he doesn't know earlier. Dragon's arrive 2 or 3 days before task. On weekdays. If Harry doesn't visit Hagrid in those 2 or 3 days that he has school work, there is not even a remote chance if him finding out. If he does, Hagrid spilling something is again more supposition than certainty. Hagrid is after all more focused on Maxime around this time than anything else. If Harry does find out, again supposition needs to align or things have to happen in a similar way for him to tell something to Cedric.

If Harry finds out it is more than likely that he does so in Hagrid's cabin, not out there looking at the dragon's. So it is unlikely he realizes Fleur knows too and even more farfetch to suppose he knows Krum knows too. If Harry doesn't perceive a disadvantage, he doesn't tell Cedric.

Despite the Hufflepuffs' best effort at provoking who they believed to be a deranged murderer and later on just sorta ditching their whole "Friendship is magic" thing because Harry got picked for a school contest.

Cedric was an exception, not the rule. I'm never moving on from the "Ambitious, brave, smart and leftovers" trope, even if it's a pain in the ass to write.

** You know as much as I hate to admit it huffelpuff is the most terriffying place for a dark lords to come from. It's not all that unreasonable either considering abuse victems often crave friends and family.

Firstly, hard work and diligence make for some powerful spells.

Secondly no one suaspects it so the teacher's won't be suspicious.

Thirdly the rest of huffelpuff is extremely loyal you already have an army prepared with little convincing if you play things right.

Last but not least huffelpuffs don't have as much muggles bias so won't be against using muggles resources and tactics; using gorrillia warfare and hiding in muggles world using all reasouses available.

** Well, brash obstinacy, a tendency towards impulsive decisions, preference for direct action, a complete failure to think more than 30 seconds ahead and massive, almost suicidal bravery do sound like the kind of traits a revolutionary movement would look for in its supporters.

Well that and breeding the kind of Dark Wizard who has spent so long not dying it's almost its own form of immortality.
