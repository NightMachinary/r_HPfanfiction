What character(s) did you hate in Canon and now love because of Fan fics, and what character(s) did you love in Canon and now hate in Fanon?

For me I hated Snape in Canon, and now he is one of my favs in Fanon, and Dumbledore I loved him when he was played by Richard Harris, but through fanon and Michael Gambon's portrayal of him, I now can't stand him.


** Hermione. Oh my god I hate fanon!Hermione. Canon Hermione can get on my nerves at times, but overall I loved her reading the book and identified with her a lot growing up. Fanon and Movie Hermione have almost killed that love at this point. It has stripped her of all her flaws, often to the detriment of Ron, Harry, and sometimes even Dumbledore, and made her almost unbearable. I literally sometimes have to remind myself why I liked Hermione in the first place, because I associate her character with such negativity now.

*** Yes this!

​

I started to dislike her around the third movie and it started to fester from there. She was turning into such a bossy Mary Sue. She never did anything wrong and when she did it wasn't her fault. Whenever something bad happened to her it wasn't her fault (almost always Ron's) and in the end that person would apologise or be shown to be wrong.

​

Then there was the Emma Watson portrayal. She was so shrill and sounded as if she was about to cry most of the time. She was so awkward and had a 'Holier than thou' air about her. I always saw Book Hermione as a nerdy girl who wanted to be helpful, but ended up sounding condescending by accident. Move Hermione was just an asshole a lot of the time.

​

Book Hermione was awesome. She was smart, but far from perfect. I especially loved the House elf rights movement. She was misguided, uninformed, but had good intentions. She didn't really win in the end, because that was a lost battle from start, but she got a compromise (I might not be remembering this part correctly).

** My favourite character in the books is Sirius, though he's not very well developed; but there is still an enticing hint of darkness about him that the films (after PoA ) seem to skip over. I think this must be down to the direction, as I'm sure Gary Oldman was more than capable of doing a better job of it.

Fanon is all over the place, making him everything from a playboy Lothario to a needy anorexic, and everything in between.

Yeah that'd be my observation too. canon!Sirius is interesting with a hint (or multiple hints) of depth and 'more', while fanon has a lot of 'more', it's just an incredibly mixed bag, rarely really getting to the depth part of it. Though the typical protective Sirius, trying to be somewhat of a father figure and a connection to Harry's parents while making up for lost times usually works okay.

** According to [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3vWAgfzMRwCcFaGFYPtok8TLPMcH0GpbWauvWtlNOg5vWwQ/viewanalytics][our latest survey]], most people here (~70%) do not consider Movies canon. I belong to this camp. For me, it's another form of fanfiction written by the screenwriter Steve Kloves, who pushed hard for a Harry/Hermione outcome, bashed Ron and Ginny, and glorified Hermione, Draco, and Snape.

Movie depictions of characters have no influence on my perception about Book characters. Similarly, fanon depictions of characters don't either, even though I may like or hate them in particular settings.

For examples:

- I hate Petunia Dursley and think she deserved at least a few years in prison for her child abuse, but the Petunia Evans in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]] is great.
- I hate Bellatrix Lestrange and think she deserved a lot worse than in canon, but the Bellatrix Black in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] is a fun character.
- I love Book Ron, but Movie Ron is a stupid jerk Hermione should never get together with.

**** Not necessarily. One of the biggest themes of the Series is Choice. Characters making different choices will sometimes have very different lives down the road, and exploring these alternate scenarios is exactly the purpose of fanfictions.

For example, if young Severus met some obnoxious Pureblood Slytherins on the train first, he might decide to follow Lily into Gryffindor, for he certainly had enough bravery.

Or if Merope had decided not to dope Tom Sr, Tom Jr or Voldemort would have not been born. The lack of Voldemort would have meant a drastically different Wizarding Britain. Some well known villains in the Series such as Barty Jr and Bellatrix might not have become bad at all. I like "Delenda Est" exactly because this fic doesn't try to whitewash Bellatrix at all. She remains a deeply flawed person, but instead of following a sadistic genocidal maniac all the way down the rabbit hole, she followed Harry and could put her virtues to good use.

The possibilities are pretty much endless.

***** Thanks Inq. [[/u/Fredrik1994][u/Fredrik1994]], I don't have a huge amount of time at the moment so I'll just go over the highlights of my opinion!

Firstly, I think both myself and [[/u/goodlife23][u/goodlife23]] agree that Ginny's character could have been better developed in the books, but if you look carefully there is a character arc there and there is a strong personality. We see her go from an insecure, stereotypical tween with grand ideas of romance to someone with resilience, the ability to stand up to Harry when he's being dumb, a good sense of humour, and assertiveness over her own sexuality.

What we get in the movies is someone incredibly passive and sappy. Many of the lines are just cringey, borderline subservient. There's a really wonderful piece of fanart on Tumblr that floats around pointing out that movie Ginny says "don't you trust me?" And gently feeds Harry a mince pie. In the books she probably would have shoved it in his face as a joke. She's more alike to Ron and the twins and that's why Harry likes her. As for tying the shoelace scene - ugh. Cringe.

Oddly enough, the only bit that felt natural in the films was the brief, desperate kiss they share at the battle of hogwarts. This was suggested by Dan and Bonnie and im really glad they did. But in general she just seems to be a bland girlfriend character with no chemistry. Think about how they get together in the books - a mutal moment of spontaniety surrounded by other people in a jubilient atmosphere. Compared to the film - a secretive, brief kiss at a moment of emotional distress with an overly sophisticated line. It's meant to be more romantic but it just comes across as cheesy.

** I tend to prefer canon, and lean towards canon-compliant fics. I tend to prefer shorter fics that focus on "missing moments." I also like different perspective fics--a good example is /Not From Others,/ which is the best Ginny-Deathly Hallows fic of the lot.

As a result, I don't love any characters that I hated in canon, beyond a few special examples--/Stages of Hope/ gives a terrific portrayal of Severus Snape if he never fell to the Death Eaters, but I tend to dislike most Fanon interpretations of Snape.

So for me, it's not so much "what do I prefer" from fanfic or the movies, but what am I willing to include for the books from the fanfics and movies.

*Harry Potter*

Where to begin? Fanon gets a lot wrong.

Harry is not one who wallows in angst.

He confronts authority when he believes it needs to be confronted, and he does not let personal affection get in the way of calling someone out, be they an authority figure or not.

*Ron Weasley*

Ron is not treated fairly in the movies. At all. Shame on Steve Kloves for what he did. Ditto a good chunk of Fanon.

That said, I do like it when Ron is portrayed as more willing to stand up to authority on Harry's behalf or even for his own sake. We see glimpses of this in canon, but it's rarely elaborated on.

*Ginny Weasley*

Not unlike her brother, Ginny didn't get much of a fair shake in the films. She's missing a lot of spark.

Incidentally, Ginny and Ron's entire canonical dynamic is all but absent in the films, but that's a story for another day.

So for me, my interpretation of Ginny is how it is in canon. I appreciate that fanon tried to add substance to her that the movies lacked, but there's a certain...element that was missed I think. Fanon Ginny is popular and sporty, but she doesn't usually have the nerve to stand up for someone who won't stand up for themselves.

*Luna Lovegood.*

For a supporting character, I'm surprised how invested in Luna I end up being.

Of all the deviations from the books, the movies treated Luna relatively softly. Other than minor physical differences--her hair color and small stature, I don't have much of a problem with Movie!Luna.

I disregard most elements of Sage!Luna (/Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection/ is an exception, as Luna barely understands the visions she gets). This was never a thing in canon. Fanon also depicts her as a victim of far harsher bullying than canon implies--and I also reject much of it.

So for me, Luna's mostly like she is in the books, though she keeps a barefoot habit whenever she can--it's a somewhat unique quirk in the Harry Potter universe, and it helps set Luna apart.

** I'll just list a few of the radical changes some characters underwent. All in all, I prefer canon interpretations.

--------------

Canon Dumbledore: a hyper-intelligent, decent person, who, when confronted with an impossible situation made an extremely difficult choice to save as many lives as possible.

Movie Dumbledore: Same, but with less nuance as to his motives. Decent acting all around.

Fanon Dumbledore: Depends on the fic, but he's either a Dark Lord, incompetent, or both. I absolutely detest most fanon Dumbledores.

--------------

Canon Draco: a straight up jerk with basically zero redeeming qualities.

Movie Draco: omg Tom Felton is hot. I don't prefer this version because it makes him seem more likeable than he really is.

Fanon Draco: Draco is either a saint or truly worse person in fanon. I do like giving him some iota of redemption, so that he's not just a big butt monkey.

--------------

Canon Ron: a funny, smart, loyal friend.

Movie Ron: a dumb boy who says dumb boy things and has had his lines stolen by Hermione.

Fanon Ron: actually worse than Hitler. Also a huge jerk - huger than Canon Draco. Might also be a rapist. Yeah, this version is the worst.

--------------

Canon Hermione: a smart, hardworking witch with, shall we say, some issues. My preferred version.

Movie Hermione: a funny, smart, loyal friend. She's basically Canon Ron with the natural smarts of Hermione.

Fanon Hermione: or, as called by everyone, Mione, even though Ron only did it once in canon, when his mouth was filled with food. She's the smartest, most perfect person ever. She's a natural leader. She can duel Voldemort no problem. If she has any flaws, it's that she always, always, follows the rules (canon Hermione literally committed a serious crime every single year, sometimes several). Yeah, not a fan of most versions.

--------------

Canon Snape: a disgusting, cruel man who, while redeemed by love, was still a piece of dog poop his entire life.

Movie Snape: Alan Rickman. This is one of the few movie depictions I prefer. Because Alan Rickman.

Fanon Snape: depends. He's either Alan Rickman or Alan Rickman But Hotter.

#+end_quote

Disagree on the decent person part, as well as the making difficult decisions part.

As a young adult, he was conceited, and resented the fact that his ailing sister prevented him from realising his brilliance. His neglects his duty as the man of the house and goes off to discuss daydreams with Grindelwald. In the wonky hallucination scene, he says he doesn't know if he cast the spell that killed his sister - which means that he did cast potentially lethal spells, in a fight with his brother and best friend. Oh yes, very decent indeed.

As a professor at Hogwarts, he sees the rise of Tom Riddle from the very beginning, and exacerbates Tom's attitudes towards the world around him. Because, you know, when you find that a 10 year old is a kleptomaniac and a burgeoning psychopath, burning his cupboard down is absolutely the best thing that can be done.

He suspects Tom Riddle as the mastermind behind the Chamber of Secrets, but doesn't do much - other than maybe share vague suspicions with other teachers. I'm not even going to suggest that he ought to have stunned, bound and interrogated Tom on a whim - but he could have trailed Tom under disillusionment charms to try and confirm if Tom was actually behind the Chamber, observed Tom's behaviour in the Slytherin Common Room as Tom gathered followers and so on. Instead, he just "suspects" Tom.

When Grindelwald was busy on his rampage, Dumbledore kept to Hogwarts like a good little teacher, even though he owed it to himself, his brother and his dead sister to bring Grindelwald to justice. I won't say that he had a duty to the world at large or anything so stupid - if entire nations depend on one man to save them, then they deserve to be destroyed.

As headmaster, he pretty much allows the blood purist ideals to take root, even though he himself is vehemently opposed to those ideals. This is something I cannot understand why he would do, giving second and third chances to students who would normally be expelled otherwise, although that is an assumption - maybe the students who became Death Eaters in their twenties were angels in school. But there were Death Eaters in school - Regulus Black, for one, became a Death Eater when he was 16, although Dumbledore couldn't have known that.

He also puts several students at risk when he decides to take on Remus Lupin as a student, which is mind-boggling. From what Lupin says, we get the impression young werewolves aren't allowed to study at Hogwarts. Why make an exception in Lupin's case? Why endanger so many students? If one student - just one! - was bitten, or mauled through sheer coincidence, that student's life would have been ruined, and Lupin would have been executed.

He places an orphan with relatives who are sure to despise and abuse him. He knows, or at the very least, expects this, as he says in OoTP. He gives Snape the benefit of the doubt when he hears the name of the woman Snape wanked off to, but throws Sirius under the train, even though Sirius joined his vigilante organisation as soon as he graduated. He cast aside a man he taught and fought alongside, at the drop of a hat. But hey, he needed the orphan to grow as unloved as possible, so throw this man to Azkaban, he's outlived his usefulness anyway.

All the shit he pulls during Harry's years at Hogwarts. This is insane. He goes through all of those hoops, like using an incredibly powerful artifact as bait for the most powerful Dark wizard of all time in a school, letting a 12 year old fight the monster of the Chamber, letting a couple of 13 year olds face a large herd of Dementors alone, the shit with the Tournament and the imposter, all of Umbridge, hiring and keeping Snape as a teacher, the attempts to redeem Draco Malfoy - it's insane.

When Harry returns from the graveyard with the names of several Death Eaters, does he move to eliminate them? No he doesn't, even though he knows that those Death Eaters will kill if left to their own devices. He just pretends as though everything is normal, and goes about life as usual. His mindset is, "We're technically at war, but I'm not going to actually kill these lieutenants Voldemort has, because that would make things easier!"

It can be argued that the prophecy was bait for Voldemort to reveal himself, and that the longer the prophecy was kept in place at the Ministry, the more likely Voldemort was to make a mistake. But...why not use a decoy? Why not tell Harry that he can remove the "weapon", take him to the Ministry (whichever way, with or without the Ministry's approval) and place a decoy in place of the actual prophecy?

The Occlumency lessons. Instead of leaving it to Harry, who is a terrible student, to half ass Occlumency, why not impress upon him the importance of those lessons by being present at a few of them?

As for making the difficult decision, he doesn't make any difficult decisions. He leaves the sacrifice to Harry himself. If anything, he's a coward here. Even though he knows that Harry must die, he doesn't have the decency to do the deed himself, like Snape does for with his own life - he leaves that for Voldemort, who might have prolonged Harry's suffering, or made a spectacle out of Harry's death. He even chickens out of telling Harry himself - he delegates that to Snape.

So yeah - Dumbledore isn't decent, and he doesn't make difficult decisions. Ironically, he takes the easy way out, instead of the right way.

**** You mean as a teenager of 18 years old, most brilliant in the history of wizards, he dared dream of a future for himself that contained more than the caring for a disabled younger sister and a younger brother who obviously had a very different character from him? That he dared, furthermore, to fall in love (which I'm quite sure was canonly stated had happened exactly once in his long life) with the only person he had ever met whose intelligence was almost on par with his, dared to be happy for 2 months in more than a hundred years. I'm supposing, of course, that you personally would never dream of (or never dream, for that matter) such disgustingly selfish ideas of having your own life, a career, or even falling in love. Yuck.

Aside from that, I'm surprised that you seem to know what exactly happened at that duel between him, Grindelwald, and his brother, as I was under the impression that no one but Rowling herself knows the details, and that you can safely say that he did something that made him, again, an indecent person.

As I have no experience with psychopathic children myself, aside from the one who I met in the closed ward of a psychiatry who destroyed his adoptive parents' car and then repeatedly raped his younger sister at the age of 14, I wouldn't know what the best measures would have been to impress a young Tom Riddle. I would only like to point out that Dumbledore did not, in fact, burn down any of his belongings.

You seem to have rather strong opinions on what who deserves, let's hope that you never get to decide the fate of any nation, or any community at all, since weakness seems to equal loss of right to exist in your books, and kindness equals stupidity and lunacy. Also, I'm very doubtful that it should be you who decides who Dumbledore owned what to and why. Again, I wouldn't presume to know what exactly happened between him and Grindelwald, or why not that what we might expect have happened in the time did not. That's for the next Fantastic Beast movies to tell.

It also seems to me that you value good teachers very little, I wonder why that is?

Dumbledore does not dog his students' every step, he does not dictate how their parents are supposed to raise them, nor does he expel them at the first chance. He gave Remus the chance to live a semi-normal life for a few years, something he had forever lost to no fault of his own at 4 years of age and certainly helped shaping Remus to the person he later became, which was wise, strong, compassionate and kind, a hero dying fighting the right fight. It might not matter a bit to you, but Remus Lupin's character was established to reflect the discrimination people with certain illnesses are treated with in society, and you are on the side of those who advocate said discrimination. You speak of the Death Eaters as people who should be fought against, but you're promoting suspicion, hatred, isolation, immediate harsh punishment to mistakes even of children, and discrimination of the disabled and diseased. And you call Albus Dumbledore indecent and a lunatic for his compassion, tolerance, belief in the good of men.

As you know fully well, Harry Potter was only forced to stay with Petunia and her family because they were the only blood relatives of Lily, and it was Lily's protection that continues through her blood relatives that protected Harry Potter until the moment he turned 17. Dumbledore certainly did not place him in their care because he thought they were the most suited to care for a wizard child.

You give too much credit to Dumbledore relative to Harry's adventures, he did not orchestrate most of them, least of all Umbridge and the Dementors.

Dumbledore had tried to act according to the law and in cooperation with the Ministry of Magic, killing multiple persons on the account of Harry alone, with no other eyewitnesses and Fudge denouncing the whole story would not only mean war with Voldemort but also war with the Ministry. I fail to see how that would have benefited anybody in any way. And let's not imagine he could have killed all of them at once with just a snap of his fingers. He's Dumbledore, not Thanos. One of them dead, and he'd been on the run from the law earlier than he had been, and the children Hogwarts less protected.

Hindsight is also 20/20.

I'm pretty sure that it was stated that A. Harry had to be the one to decide to sacrifice himself, not be told by Dumbledore to do it, and B. Voldemort had to kill him, and not any random person, not even Dumbledore. I'm not sure he delegated anything to Snape, if anything, he most probably did not expect to die that night on the astronomy tower, and Snape couldn't have told Harry much if he hadn't accidentally been there when he died, either.

So, nothing you said proves that Dumbledore is less than a very strong, intelligent, and most of all, decent person. But it must be fun to bash a person without whom everything since the beginnings of Grindelwald almost 100 years ago would have gone to shit, who worked tirelessly against evil and for the preserving of life and peace, giving his own life in its course, because you would have done it much better.

More like you didn't bother trying to understand a single thing in my comment, and proceeded to launch into a tirade against an evil internet user who dared criticise your hero. Your tirade wanders off on tangents several times, and you take a couple of shots at me along the way. When you do remember to make arguments in favour of Albus, they're paper thin. I have not said that Albus is evil, or whatever else it is that bashes his character.

Some of us don't abandon all duty and responsibility in favour of daydreaming. I've known several people who have done exactly this - put their own dreams and aspirations on hold, and worked like dogs so that their younger brothers and sisters could lead good lives. That is what duty to family sometimes means. I understand that it is the fashion these days, to run away from all responsibility as much as you can, but I've never been much for fashion. Between these things and caring for an ailing family member, I'd choose the latter every single time.

  Aside from that, I'm surprised that you seem to know what exactly happened at that duel between him, Grindelwald, and his brother, as I was under the impression that no one but Rowling herself knows the details, and that you can safely say that he did something that made him, again, an indecent person.
#+end_quote

Either you haven't read what I wrote properly, or you're just arguing for the sake of it. He says in the Flaw in the Plan that he didn't know if he cast the spell which took his sister's life. This does imply that he was casting potentially lethal spells in that fight. It may or may not have been his spell that killed his sister, but the very fact that he was casting potentially lethal spells in a fight against his brother and best friend speaks volumes about a person. And decency is not it.

To a take an analogue, he gets into a fight with his brother and best friend, and all three start throwing knives or pulling guns at each other.

  Also, I'm very doubtful that it should be you who decides who Dumbledore owned what to and why
#+end_quote

What a useless argument, much like the rest of your comment. Grindelwald was involved in the fight that took his sister's life, and runs off afterwards. Later, he becomes a dark wizard, starting to kill hundreds of witches and wizards, to the point where entire states clamour for Albus to join the fray. There is a moral responsibility there to his deceased sister to bring Grindelwald to justice, since they both share responsibility for her death.

  He gave Remus the chance to live a semi-normal life for a few years, something he had forever lost to no fault of his own at 4 years of age and certainly helped shaping Remus to the person he later became, which was wise, strong, compassionate and kind, a hero dying fighting the right fight. It might not matter a bit to you, but Remus Lupin's character was established to reflect the discrimination people with certain illnesses are treated with in society, and you are on the side of those who advocate said discrimination. You speak of the Death Eaters as people who should be fought against, but you're promoting suspicion, hatred, isolation, immediate harsh punishment to mistakes even of children, and discrimination of the disabled and diseased. And you call Albus Dumbledore indecent and a lunatic for his compassion, tolerance, belief in the good of men.
#+end_quote

You've gone on a complete tangent when you wrote this block of text. I was talking about how Albus exposed the other students to the potential risk of getting bitten or mauled by a werewolf, and you write praises of Lupin's character, which transforms into a jab at me towards the end. At least pretend like you're arguing, you know?

You can say that they took precautions, they were careful and all of that, but accidents happen all the time, even in spite of precautions. It would take just one such accident to ruin the life of another person - it can be a student, or a resident of Hogsmeade. All it would take is for one curious person to go snooping around the Shack when they hear the screams of Lupin transforming, and you'd have a feral werewolf on the loose. Albus' "compassion, tolerance, and belief in the good of men" could have gotten a lot of people killed or mauled for life. That it didn't is sheer luck.

#+begin_quote
  As you know fully well, Harry Potter was only forced to stay with Petunia and her family because they were the only blood relatives of Lily, and it was Lily's protection that continues through her blood relatives that protected Harry Potter until the moment he turned 17. Dumbledore certainly did not place him in their care because he thought they were the most suited to care for a wizard child.
#+end_quote

He condemns an orphan to ten dark years of abuse, neglect and hate, and he admits to it at the end of OoTP. That is not something a man with any decency does.

If you've ever bothered to read the books, and actually read them, you'd find that the blood protection isn't as useful or foolproof as you're making it seem. A six/seven year old Harry had to climb and hide in a fucking tree, otherwise he'd have been mauled by Marge's dog while the Dursleys and Marge laughed. All of that glorious planning would have been for naught if Harry had slipped and fallen, and broken his neck/had his throat ripped out by Ripper/died of some infection from bite wounds. The great blood protections do nothing against Dementors from attacking Harry and his cousin with impunity. It doesn't prevent Death Eaters from waiting right outside the boundary to ambush Harry.

#+begin_quote
  You give too much credit to Dumbledore relative to Harry's adventures, he did not orchestrate most of them
#+end_quote

Did he, or did he not store the Stone (or a decoy) in a school? Did he, or did he not, house a Cerberus in the same school?

Did he, or did he not, send Fawkes to assist Harry in the Chamber? Fawkes can travel past Hogwarts' protections just fine -- Dumbledore could have joined himself, and made short work of both the monster of the chamber, and Riddle.

Did he, or did he not, task Hermione and Harry with Sirius' rescue operation, knowing that they were going to be facing Dementors?

The only reason the Ministry is even able to foist Umbridge as a teacher is because Dumbledore was unable to find anyone else to assume the position, which is kind of unbelievable when you realise that Albus is a man with many, many connections, from being in positions of political power on a global scale for nearly fifty years. Ablus not being able to find a candidate for an open post is flat out unbelievable.

The Draco Malfoy redemption attempt is disgusting. The lives of Katie Bell, Horace Slughorn, and Rosemerta take a backseat because Albus liked playing games. One accident, and Katie, Slughorn or Rosemerta could have died. Rosemerta might even have been raped. Rape committed by juveniles is rape all the same, and juveniles are just as capable of it as adults are. Whether Malfoy actually does it or not, we'll never know. But he does cast the Imperius curse on her, and that's worth a lifetime in Azkaban.

#+begin_quote

  I fail to see how that would have benefited anybody in any way. And let's not imagine he could have killed all of them at once with just a snap of his fingers. He's Dumbledore, not Thanos. One of them dead, and he'd been on the run from the law earlier than he had been, and the children Hogwarts less protected.
#+end_quote

Only innocent lives. The Death Eaters kill during the war -- those deaths might have been averted if preemptive action was taken. That you can't see the benefit of innocent people living their lives in peace is quite the curiosity.

And why would he be on the run from the law when presumed Death Eaters start going missing? Not even Fudge accuses people of murder without sufficient proof.

#+begin_quote
  I'm pretty sure that it was stated that A. Harry had to be the one to decide to sacrifice himself, not be told by Dumbledore to do it, and B. Voldemort had to kill him, and not any random person, not even Dumbledore. I'm not sure he delegated anything to Snape, if anything, he most probably did not expect to die that night on the astronomy tower, and Snape couldn't have told Harry much if he hadn't accidentally been there when he died, either.
#+end_quote

This block of text proves yet again, you didn't bother to understand what I wrote at all, or why I wrote what I wrote.

The difficult choice that he supposedly makes -- he could have had the decency to end Harry's life himself. Like Snape says, Albus basically raises Harry like a pig for slaughter. Starved for affection, routinely exposed to dangerous situations with Albus' knowledge, and lives a pitiful life, all in all. All because of the horcrux in his head -- Albus could have given Harry a mercy killing, and prevented a lifetime filled with sadness and hardship -- but chickens out of that. Snape performs a mercy killing on Albus, but Albus himself cannot do the same with Harry.

Seriously, have you actually ever read the books? He has Snape tell Harry (indirectly) about the horcrux inside his head -- Albus does not have the decency or the courage to do it himself.

****** Are you trying to tell me that you and any person you consider decent have never been a child, nor thought of yourself, only ever of others? Trying to live your own life, or at least dream of it for a little while is what I consider to be human nature and you to be fashionable and human indecency. I suspect this is something two people will not be able to agree on since it probably depends on the society one lives in whether one views humans as individuals or part of a community first and whether the pursuit of happiness will be seen as selfish and evil or as the right of every man and woman.

Exactly, he said he did not know whether he cast the spell that killed his sister. But what happened on that day? It is said that when Aberforth confronted them because their plan would not have worked out for Ariana, Gellert was so incensed he used the Cruciatus on him. But that could not have been all. Have even heavier curses, maiming and killing curses been thrown back and forth between the two? We know that Aberforth was a few years younger than Albus and described as somebody who did not much care for school, could he have been a match for Gellert in a duel? What if, seeing as how they were about to kill each other, Albus tried to intervene and deflected a killing curse? Or what if he tried to attack Gellert despite the blood oath and triggert something that could have hurt bystanders? We were told that Albus was not only devastated by Ariana's death, but also didn't expect Gellert to leave after the fiasco. I cannot imagine that he would have tried Avada Kedavra on either Aberforth or Gellert, and none of us know what had happened on that day, which is why I initially did not want to speculate, as it is all eiter of us can do to speculate and it is a waste of time to argue about something neither of us knows, but there you have it, if you insist. My personal guess is that, if you must use that analogy, that Gellert pulled the gun on Aberforth and by going between them, somehow Albus misfired the weapon in Ariana's direction, if it was his fault at all, since we don't know that either.

Well, the wizarding communities are not nations, even though they look to be so. They are tiny and not very well organized. Still I cannot fathom why you should be the one to judge whether they deserve to survive or not. Who gave you the right to decide whether anyone or anything that does not belong to you personally gets to suvive or not? You also still do not get to decide what the moral responsibilities of Albus in the case of Gellert and Ariana was. This is not an argument, it is a statement of fact.

Yes, accidents happen at all times. Now, if you use your imagination, you can see what would happen to all things and all people if we stopped doing anything that might ever cause an accident. I dare say that as long as everything that exist is not yet wiped off the face of the earth, nothing can be completely safe. On such a worthless argument do you decide that Remus should never have gotten the chance to live a semi-normal life, not one day in his life after he was bitten at 4. What can I say to that? Would you also isolate children with psychological and physical diseases from others on the odd chance that it could prove harmful to others despite the fact that it had not yet ever happened? From the get go, he deserved a chance, in hindsight, nothing happened. Yet still you advocate discrimination and isolation of those with ailments, as I've said. At the same time you presume to judge other people for being morally corrupt and indecent because they have hopes and dreams.

Blood protection protected Harry from Voldemort and his followers, which would have resulted in his death as a young child. It did not, nor was it ever stated that it did, protect him from accidents and the fould moods of humans, nor was this ever the aim of the blood protection. Of course Albus, because he is kind of heart, would still feel remorse that he couldn't protect Harry from Petunia and Vernon, but he had to choose the lesser evil of the two, and he was right to do so.

He did store the stone at the school, because it was the most protected place in the universe of Harry Potter that we know, even more than Gringotts, where it would have been stolen.

He did not send Fawkes into the Chamber, as he did not even know the children were in the chamber until afterwards. I would like to remind you that he was rather surprised and touched because Harry "must have shown real loyalty (to Albus), nothing else could have called Fawkes to him".

He tasked Hermione and Harry with the rescue of Sirius, /not/ knowing that they would have to face the dementors. Only afterwards did it become clear that the person who fought off the dementors was Harry himself, before, it was unclear how it happened, and it was not suspected to have anything to do with their little time-travel at all.

You will believe what you will believe, but that was just how it was stated in the books.

Where did you get the disgusting notion of Draco having raped Rosmerta from? That is indeed disgusting. And I'm glad it's only in your head.

Albus was a man who believed in second chances. He believed in Hagrid, even though he did not know the truth of what happened back then, he gave Remus an education, he believed Snape, who served him loyally to the end, and he gave Draco a second chance, and Draco proved to be indecisive whether he really wanted to support Voldemort, and it was through his presence that Narcissa saved Harry's life and with it, the outcome of the war.

Believing Harry is one thing, murdering multiple people on his words alone another. Albus does not kill easily, nor does he kill preemptively (Riddle), that doesn't make him an indecent person, quite on the contrary. If you believe in preemptive killing as a solution to problems, it is not his decency we must question, but yours.

And what has Fudge not accused people of without sufficient proof? What have his people, like Umbridge, not done to reach their ends? Can there be any doubt that he would have pointed at Albus and his people if those accused by Harry have started to go missing shortly afterwards?

On the contrary, I do not think you read anything I wrote, nor what was in the books, /Voldemort had to kill Harry for the Horncrux to be destroyed, not Albus, and Harry had to be willing for it/. Since Albus had not ever been Voldemort in his life, he could not have killed Harry to destroy the Horncrux. Also it was pure accident, like I said, that Harry was there when Snape died, otherwise he would never have been told about the last horncrux and how to destroy it at all. I really wish you would read before you answered.

** Tonks. When I first read the books and saw the movies, she was just one of the background order members. And any interest I had into her character went away with the Lupin romance, or more accurately that she took him back after his runner and her general insistence to fight for the relationship after Lupin shot her down a few times.

I read a few fanfics where she was almost a Mary Sue, so I went back to the books and looked closer at the sections where she made an appearance. And I fell in love with her character in OotP. Until Hermione turns 18, she is the only badass woman who makes an onscreen appearance (Lily sadly does not). Everyone is losing their mind about Voldemort, doom and gloom everywhere, and in between is Tonks, doing silly faces and keeping her spirits high.

Hence why I consider HBP/DH a character assassination and really dislike the Lupin romance for what it did to her character. And Rowling's admission about her pining after her ex husband influencing the last book is a small mercy there.

As for Draco, fanon Draco is a bit of a mixed bag. A great lover in some fics, the same spineless coward in others. Too bad Draco's redemption in the books was basically unexplored.

Surprised no one has brought up Harry yet. Both canon and movie Harry had some serious British sass. But in fanon, that sass is missing in 90% of the fics. Instead, writers just love to portray him as the edgy, angsty teen from OoTP. Still, I love fanon disillusioned-with-the-world Harry.

  did you hate in Canon and now love because of Fan fics
#+end_quote

Do you mean this in a "fanon changed my mind about characters" way? If that is true, then zero. Possibly it made me hate Dumbledore a bit more, because some fics either accidentally (through Dumbledore apologia) or on purpose (through bashing) point out how truly awful he is.

If you mean whether I like some fanon incarnations of characters over their canon variants? Definitely, but it really depends. The only exception may be Snape, who's a very complex and interesting character in canon and is often turned into a very one dimensional caricature in fanon; or even worse he's completely disgusting, grooming a schoolgirl or -boy (Snarry).

Draco and Ron are usually better than in canon. Most people who love them and write about them at least acknowledge some of their issues and make an effort to have the characters overcome them, but I usually just prefer them to be absent from the fic (which is still an improvement over canon). Fanon Ron who never befriended Harry, aimlessly bumbling through school is almost my favorite character. It's such a breath of fresh air.

Hmm... who else comes to mind that's improved in fanon? Definitely Ginny. She's almost a non-character in canon and almost every story with her in a prominent role I've read made some effort to characterize her. Sometimes it's a bit deluded since Ginny's fans seem to think that that's actually in the books somewhere, but as a H/Hr shipper I'm not bothered by a bit of delusion.

I kinda hate fanon!Harry sometimes, especially when authors try way too hard to fix him, without giving him any proper character development in that direction. These are usually Harrys who feel very self-inserty, aka a thinly veiled attempt of an author to roleplay "what would I do as Harry? (everything correctly of course!)". [Meaning he's always retroactively correct through the power of authorial fiat.] canon!Harry on the other hand is a pretty cool dude, who makes gut decisions that he sometimes regrets and doesn't know when it might be better to just shut up. fanon!Harry is often just bland and one-dimensional.

Richard Harris did a wonderful performance of a kind and wise old grandpa Wizard. Which is why he was completely inappropriate for the role and would have been particularly terrible for the later books. I guess Richard Harris sorta works for a Dumbledore in a vacuum, when only looking at his characterization in Book 1 & 2 (as if he's not the same man who willingly placed Harry in an abusive home and later set Harry up to die). For Dumbledore as a whole Michael Gambon is much closer to how I'd imagine him.

I respectfully disagree. HBP has one of the dumbest Ginny quotes of all time, fundamentally misunderstanding the nature of Harry's character [and most of the rest is Harry just indulging in a teenage snogging romance that's uncomplicated with a girl that doesn't cry and allows him to unwind]:

#+begin_quote
  “But you've been too busy saving the Wizarding world,” said Ginny, half laughing. “Well ... I can't say I'm surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that's why I like you so much.”
#+end_quote

Every single thing here is wrong. It shows that they probably wouldn't do well together because she can't see through the Boy-Who-Lived and just sees him for his "saving people thing".. it also shows how her characterization is inconsistent, as the kind of character we imagine (and are told) Ginny to be wouldn't say things like "Yeah you have to do your duty and I as your girlfriend will demurely wait for you until you come back, gallant hero." Ginny is supposed to be the opposite of that.

I agree with you that we clearly understand what Ginny is supposed to be, but it is mostly done through telling (as you wrote "we learn about her second hand") instead of showing, which is why I claim she lacks characterization. I have similar feelings about Molly (just much more unfavourably): We clearly understand and are told (mostly through Harry's lens) that she's supposed to be some kind of surrogate mom for Harry, her actions just don't really back that up when evaluated from a grown-up standpoint instead of an abused kid starved for love and affection.

As for Ginny staying back while Harry is hunting Horcruxes, I agree that that's kind of against how she's characterized, but it's hardly the only time JKR was staining my suspension of disbelief a bit in her effort to make sure the final book would be a camping adventure focused exclusively on the trio.

I mean, they had a similar sense of humor way before being in a relationship, have an easy time making the other smile just by being around each other, like to do the same things for fun, can talk to each other about important things in a way that actually helps (see their conversation in OotP), and are physically attracted to each other. That's just about as perfect a match as you can get.

  When Ginny says that Harry wouldn't be happy unless he was hunting Voldemort she doesn't mean that Harry takes joy in fighting him, but rather that he couldn't sit back and happily enjoy leisure life with his girlfriend knowing that Voldemort is still out there killing people.
#+end_quote

Sure, that's the go-to excuse for that line... but it's the dumbest way to say this. There's no "leisure life with his girlfriend" on the horizon if Harry doesn't go after Voldemort. Not because he wouldn't be "happy" in that scenario, but because it wouldn't be. I have no idea why someone would say it that way, unless they really miss the point of why he's breaking up and going after Voldemort. If you go with your explanation Ginny is just really shallow and frankly stupid, because why the fuck would she muse about having a romantic getaway with Harry in the current state of war?! This doesn't even scratch the surface of the issue since there's an actual prophecy that flat-out says that it cannot happen ("neither can live while the other survives")

  but it's hardly the only time JKR was staining my suspension of disbelief a bit in her effort to make sure the final book would be a camping adventure focused exclusively on the trio.
#+end_quote

Sure, I understand the reasons. I understand why Dumbledore accidentally became a villain (because JKR wanted a downtrodden hero) or why Ron had to be a dumbass (dramatic tension). This meta analysis doesn't help to reconcile those characters though. It's about what's in the text, not what JKR envisioned and failed to realize.

name about 5 more conversations like this and I'll concede your point. Harry and Hermione probably had about 50.

Ginny only relates to Harry as prophecy-boy or her hot teenage crush. She'd be completely lost with war veteran hero who doesn't know what to do with his life now (Harry becoming an Auror just because that's what he's used to be doing is really fucking sad, really. Everything after HBP is a huge fucking tragedy, which is why in literary sense he should have died... not that I would have enjoyed that... seeing everyone around you die and suffer, being stuck in a teenage crush relationship for life because you never learned to assert yourself in relationships, your adoptive family almost exclusively relates to you through your prophetic existence, but it's barely their fault because you can't and aren't allowed to make an identity for yourself beyond that, constantly tip-toeing around your best friend, because this abused orphaned boy has money, railroaded towards your destiny, a pig led to slaughter and then you survive by a total fluke. poor kid. he'd be so messed up if he were real). But I guess because they both have been possessed by Voldemort once they can totally relate.

Yes, but /Ginny doesn't know that/. Harry never told anyone except Ron and Hermione about the prophecy, so Ginny has no way of knowing that Harry personally has to kill Voldemort and as far as she is concerned the only reason he personally involves himself in the war effort is because of his sense of obligation.

#+end_quote

If you don't do at least a little bit of meta analysis then pretty much all adults in Harry Potter are incompetent negligent idiots. With JKR you sometimes just have to accept that she cares more about plot and creativity than about keeping everything 100% logically consistent.

#+end_quote

Yeah, and they went oh so well, didn't they? Remind me again of how well Hermione managed to comfort Harry when Cedric died? Or Sirius?

Listen, the reason why most relationships fail is not because they stop being in love, or because they stop being attracted to each other, or because they don't have enough meaningful conversations anymore but rather because once the butterflies are gone they slowly stop enjoying each other's day to day company until being around each other is more of a chore than something they enjoy.

Which is precisely why Harry/Hermione would probably be a horrible idea. Pretty much every time in canon the two of them are alone with each other without Ron to lighten things up they both slowly start withdrawing and grow depressed if not downright abrasive towards each other. Why would they be any different in a relationship than at any of the times they were together without Ron in canon?

I'm not too sure about that one either. I personally much prefer the idea of Harry ending up as a teacher. That being said quite a few real life veterans end up as cops and aren't necessarily unhappy with it so who knows?

Excuse me but what? Wasn't it Harry who fell in love with Ginny without any real goading from her and then kissed her in the middle of the common room? How exactly does that show he's unassertive?

Okay, sure. I can agree to that. IMHO Harry shouldn't be in a relationship with someone who's more dense than Crabbe and Goyle combined.

I feel like you have even less respect for Ginny than I have if you think she's that stupid. And they certainly don't "understand each other perfectly" (as the book says) if any of your interpretation is true. You are just arguing that Ginny misunderstands Harry in a different way than I do.

Right, and Ginny&Harry only have butterflies and snogging. When they are gone, those fantastic conversations about nothing will suddenly be really about nothing and incredibly dull.

Any pair of tits would have cheered Harry up. He was escaping from the realities of his fate. He wants to be normal, he wants to have a girlfriend and snog.

No... you misunderstand. Harry doesn't have to do anything with Ginny. She's already head over heels for him. She's a free pass. That's why she's perfect. What does he do when there's a problem (cho cries, Voldemort needs to be killed)? Break up.

As you so wisely stated, it's not going to be butterflies in the stomach all the time and as soon as that happens Harry is going to break up, because he thinks something is wrong with the relationship. He's not in a serious relationship and I doubt his hormonal highschool crush will be the one to teach him emotional maturity.

You should check out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/398ckt/harry_and_ginnys_shared_sense_of_humor/][this]] thread about Harry's and Ginny's humorous interactions throughout the books. Note that these scenes start off way before Harry was even remotely interested in Ginny's tits.

He also never has moments like this with Hermione despite interacting with her so incredibly more often than with Ginny.

Now you're just making assumptions. Harry's and Ginny's shared sense of humor and shared biggest hobby already give them plenty to talk about and you can't know they won't have riveting intelligent conversations if they want to.

Meanwhile, we actually do know that Harry has plenty of riveting intelligent conversations with Hermione, but we also know that Harry doesn't really enjoy those without Ron around.

#+end_quote

Just because Ginny already liked him doesn't mean she's a bad match. And it's hardly an issue with Ginny in particular that he broke up with her to hunt for Horcruxes. He would have done that with literally anyone. Heck, he even tried to get rid of Ron and Hermione multiple times when he felt they would be in too much danger.

I think you're taking too much of your own perspective as a reader into acount here. For us as the audience it's easy to see that Harry is the chosen one who will ultimately defeat Voldemort. It was completely obvious from the very first book.

However, for his friends in universe he's just some kid who got lucky as a baby, and whom Voldemort is now obsessed with for that reason. He's pretty decent at Dada, true, but he's not the kind of person you'd normally look for to fight a civil war against a madman who is far better at magic than he is, unless you either know the prophecy, or are familiar with common story tropes.

** I wish the movies had kept the same Actors and Actresses for named characters. Susan Bones, Hannah Abbot, LAVENDER BROWN.../cough/ but generally I think casting was on point. If Gambon would have softened his voice a bit to mimick Richard Harris, at least until Dumbledore needed to sack up and be impressive again, I think I would even have liked him... but he DID make it super easy to see manipulative or evil Dumbledore.

My biggest casting WTF is Slughorn... I always pictured him as a nicer version of Vernon. Like the Walrus from Alice in Wonderland that was trying to eat the clams.

Also... Poor Bonnie Wright... She was cute as a kid, but she did not grow up to be the Ginny I picture in my head. Made it super easy for me to fall for Hermione or Luna or any other girl. I'm not sure I'd have continued being a Ginny Fanboy even if she'd been given more time and character development in the movies.
