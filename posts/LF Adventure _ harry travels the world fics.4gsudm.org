** Linkffn(harry potter and the forests of valbonë by enembee)

Totally self contained plot where Harry accidently ends up in some super dangerous secret wizard forest. Not much traveling the world however it's almost purely an 'adventure' fic.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

** Sirius raises Harry around the world in this trilogy-

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming]])

Harry joining a school which is a bit megaHarry but I read it early so I love it regardless. There is a bit of world travel in it and it explores an other culture. It's a trilogy but the last one is abandoned. It's still pretty sweet though.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]])

Harry and Dumbledore tour the world

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane]])

Bungle in the Jungle and it's sequel are written in second person, if you can get over that and the writing when it comes to women, it's a hell of a lot of fun.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.
