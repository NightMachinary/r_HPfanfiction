** It's all about execution (no pun intended.) You have to be a really good writer to pull something like this off without it being utterly distasteful and nazi apologia.

If carefully done, well researched, and not excusing or glorifying atrocities, it could be an interesting study of the moral and ethical implications of reincarnation and souls, what makes a monster etc.
