I've never understood the fanfic trope where only "light" wizards can perform the patronus charm. Like, "Oh he can't perform a patronus? Obviously he's a dark wizard. Because everyone knows only a light wizard could perform it."

Yet all we know about it, is that it requires a happy memory and is very difficult to get the hang of. So why wouldn't so called "Dark" Wizards be able to do it?

** It's all turning around [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i9h9at/the_character_of_hp_magic/g1flpsp/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][the nature of Dark Magic]]. Most contrarian teenagers reading and authoring fanfiction stories love the idea that the wrong is right, and that only nasty old codgers like Dumbledore stops people from using wonderful Dark Magic. I don't agree (as seen from the linked comment) and yes I am an old codger myself. I really think that Dark Magic taints your soul and yes inability to produce the super-light magic like Patronus may be one of (many) costs.

*** Okay so your comment was about dark magic being magic that takes from others while light magic is giving for others in a sense. Or atleast that's what I understood from it.

In that case, what do you gain from casting the cruciatus? Next, and I'm sure this has come up before, wouldn't intent be more important? Like it is possible to kill using a basic levitation charm, so would it have no effect? Also, suppose someone was about to kill other people, and you kill him to protect the others, does it taint you? How many times can you cast dark magic before the taint is permanent?

**** That was just my basic very general premise. There are many details where it gets muddy and where the theory needs a lot of development.

So, Cruciatus is certainly one such case. I am not sure how does it work. I could try something about energy for the torture coming from the tortured, so they are effectively made to torture themselves, but it doesn't for Muggles, who can quite certainly be tortured as well. (BTW, concerning this curse, I was working for some time for a professor of pathophysiology who was researching pain; there are medicinal situations where part of the nervous system is intentionally so overwhelmed with pain, that it stops working, and so it allows some horrible surgery, e.g. amputation, be done; I wonder whether Cruciatus was originally meant as something like this; the same goes for some variant of Imperio ... it could be deadly useful for medicinal purposes).

Concerning intent. Yes, that's another question. With my theory, Dark Magic would certainly not cover all bad magical actions. Mrs Weasley with her enchanted knives (normally, chopping vegetables) can certainly make a lot of damage if she wishes, and that certainly falls into the original Neolithic magic.

Concerning righteous killing. Yes, certainly it can happen (soldiers in war, self-defence), but I don't think even in such situations Dark Magic would be allowed. If I understand Bellatrix Lestrange correctly, you have to want cause pain for the joy of causing pain, not out of the righteous anger (how did Harry manage to curse Alecto Carrow? I have no idea, but it was just one bout of magic, effectively rather painful Stunner, not sure; or we will rather silently ignore it as one of many inconsistencies of Mrs Rowling). The same goes for the Killing Curse ... you cannot use it for good reasons, in Self-Defence. You have to have your soul tainted, you have to want to have somebody killed just for the Death itself. Yes, Snape could do it as the former Death Eater, but that's probably the only one from the anti-Riddle side. Soliders in war just have to use some other curse ... Reducto/Expulso/Confringo (I still have problem to distinguish which is which) to your head would do just nicely.

Notice, that for example we never saw Umbridge using Cruciatus. She was rather slowly making up her mind to curse Harry, and we don't know if she could manage to do it.

  (Sirius:) The Aurors were given new powers---powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the Dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects.
#+end_quote

(GoF)

That said, I also disagree on various levels outside of Canon objections. On the most technical level, this ignores -- or presents a too simplistic version of -- human psychology. Not everyone who wants to kill is necessarily evil. And not everyone who doesn't kill isn't evil. If a requirement of the Killing Curse /were/ a desire to kill, then, given the right circumstances, most people should be able to. People can be one thing thing one minute and something completely different the next. Yes, some people operate on absolute principles. And some of /them/ might even remain unwavering in adversity and temptation. But they'd be the exception, not the norm. Darkness is in all of us. And it is this darkness that would fuel dark magic.

But I don't think I agree that that is how dark magic works. I'm inclined to go with the phenomenological explanation Rowling gave us: Dark magic is intrinsically different in that its spells, used for harm, are difficult or impossible to heal or reverse. But they do not require different dispositions in the caster; nor (the Cruciatus curse aside, if Bellatrix wasn't lying) a special motivation, nor a specific mindset. The most striking example is Sectumsempra, which Harry uses without even knowing what it does, beyond it being "for enemies".

So, it seems to me that dark magic isn't metaphysically different. This also has the positive effect that it's not the arbiter over good and evil. It allows for the obvious truth of being able to do evil without dark magic, and also for the possibility of conflicted natures like Snape, whose actions cannot be compressed into a single bottom line of good /or/ evil.

I have never said that. I have said that according to my theory using Killing Curse is necessarily evil.

Crouch Sr. allowing use of Unforgivables. When Sirius talked about it, he was specifically saying that Aurors (I guess, those who followed this order) were getting really close to being as evil as Death Eaters. Or I would just put it among JKR's internal inconsistencies.

The same goes for Harry using /Sectumsempra/ without knowing what it is. It is just such world-building disaster, I would rather not talk about it at all. Whole seven books we are told (heck, that's whole purpose of Hogwarts as a school), that doing magic is much more complicated than just random waving your wand and saying random weird incantations. Heck, even with study most students don't manage even the most simple spells (/Lumos/, /Wingardium Leviosa/) on their first try. And that is not to mention whole theories about intent being significant (I am not sure whether it is or it isn't, but it certainly makes more sense than this scene). Here we have spell without any diagram for wand movement, without Harry even knowing what it does (so, whole intent goes out of the window), and it on the first try makes significant damage to Malfoy. It just doesn't compute for me.

** My headcanon is that the Patronus spell requires a memory of /love/, not a memory of happiness. Trying to use a hateful but technically happy memory causes the infamous backfiring we've seen on Pottermore and similar and is the reason the myth of Dark Wizards being unable to cast one.

I do believe, for example, that Lucius would be able to fuel a Patronus using happy loving memories of his family (no matter his faults, he always loved his family legitimately). This is also why I consider Snape's love for Lily legitimate (but very unhealthy!) and not pure obsession alone.

Harry fails to fuel a Patronus using happy memories of flying on a broom, which is almost certainly a memory fueled by pure joy. He succeeds using thoughts of his family -- a memory that is bittersweet more than happy, but very much loving.

This also explains why the Patronus is infamous for being difficult, yet Harry managed it just fine at thirteen. The reason is that people think the spell needs happiness, since that's what everyone else says about it, and when they try to use joyful but not loving memories without any effect whatsoever, they chalk it up to the spell being too hard for them. It also explains Hermione's issues with it, she has happy memories but gets too stuck on the happiness part that she picks the Most Happy(TM) memory she has, but one who doesn't happen to be very loving. While everyone else just decides to try different memories, she is utterly sure that she picked the right one and is frustrated by the lack of results.

** Given that "Dark Wizard" isn't defined, you'd first have to clarify what that is.

And in the likely event that that definition ends up such that Umbridge and/or Snape is included, then as per Canon, they /can/ produce Patronuses.

As a corollary, and more interesting answer to your question, here's something Rowling said in a chat:

#+begin_quote
  Samantha: Was snape the only death eater who could produce a full patronus

  J.K. Rowling: Yes, because a Patronus is used against things that the Death Eaters generally generate, or fight alongside. They would not need Patronuses.
#+end_quote

So, the "why" is meaningless, because they don't /need/ to. In other words, being a Death Eater (or a Dark Wizard, probably synonyms in the black/white world of HP) makes you impervious to Dementors.

** First of all, creating a Patronus (especially a corporal one) is supposed to be an amazing feat of Magic. The people using them in Canon are very talented wizard, usually in respected position like Auror (or at least, it should be the case if Harry had not managed to "teach" the spell to pretty much all the DA).

Then, the idea was that the Patronus is an incarnation of happiness, which attract dementors despite them being unable to consume it. The fanon idea is that the Dark Wizards are "corrupted" by the Dark Art and are unable to feel this "pure" happiness that is needed for the spell.

Of course, this is probably a fanon idea. Snape use the Patronus in canon and while he is on the good side, he is definitively a Dark Wizard. I think canon Death Eater never used the Patronus, despite some of them being able to, because they never had to. The Dementors are on their sides and they have other means of communication (the 2 use of the Patronus in canon).

​

PS : now that I think about it, the wizards being sent to Azkaban are probably unable to use the Patronus because all of their good memories (which could have been used to fuel the spell) have been consumed by the Dementors, and I doubt most of them have been able to create new one strong enough after their evasion. Did Sirius ever used the Patronus in canon?

That's a good question and one, given the lack of informations from canon, that is open to interpretation.\\
Personally, I would say no. Just like a love potion cannot truly create "love", I don't think the "Cheering Charm" can truly create happiness, but just an illusion of it. Such an illusion would probably not be strong enough to power the spell. You could probably try to use the memory of someone casting the cheering on you for a Patronus, but if it was to work, it would probably be thanks to the circunstances surrounding the spell, and not the spell itself (the good memory of a happier time when you could just mess around with your friends . . .).

****** While I can't remember if the spell is ever called a "Compulsion Charm", Canon has several instance where a wizard use magic to manipulate a Muggle:

- The Leaky Cauldron is enchanted so Muggle don't pay it any attention
- The Ministry enchanted the land around the Stadium for the final of the World Cup, any muggle coming near to it would remember he had to be somewhere else for a very important reason
- Dumbledore enchanted Mrs Cole when he went to visit Tom Riddle. She thought a blank page he gave her was an official document from a legitimate school.
- In the Epilogue, Ron admitted to Harry that he had to enchant his examiner during his driving test so he didn't dock him points for not checking the mirror.

Thanks to all these example, we know that the Compulsion charm, or at least a charm very similar to it, exists in canon (though the Leaky Cauldron one can also be called a "Notice Me Not" charm). But we don't know if the Charm works on magical (all the canon examples were on Muggles), and we don't know how strong it is. An Imperiused person could murder his family before killing himself, while (from what we saw) the Compulsion charm is more of a nudge in the good direction. It is unknown if you could use it to make someone do something he wowuld really not do.\\
Also, calling it a "bootleg imperio" may be a bit too strong. The "Diffindo" hex and the "Sectumsempra" Curse are both used to cut thing, but they are not considered the same spell at all.
