I've read a few where Harry was raised by Sirius and Remus so he never went to Hogwarts but I don't remember the titles. I'm looking for more like those where Harry or Ginny didn't go to Hogwarts but then meet afterwards somehow.


** Well, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2559745/1/Learning-to-Breathe][Learning to Breathe]]. Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, was extensively training in dueling, killed Voldemort at 16 (and has the mindset of a career military-type because of it). I had some problems with it, but you can judge for yourself. It fits what you're looking for.

*** I had a lot of problems with that one as well. Only liked chapter 14, honestly.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11054843/1/Homecoming][Homecoming]] - Very new. Only 3 chapters in, but it's got a lot of promise. Brennus is never disappointing. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]] - H/G meet in Harry's 7th year. Not 100% what you're asking, but very close. Another Brennus, so it's good. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2551291/1/][Meeting the Weasleys]] - Good story, and it's complete. Sort of. It ends at and ending place, but it's begging for a sequel that we'll probably never get. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7630045/1/][A Setup Gone Wrong]] - Ron tries to hook Ginny up with a friend. Ginny finds someone she likes better.

I love this particular trope. I wish there were more.

*** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=3685][Reality Bites]] - I don't know about this one. I can't bring myself to read it. Ginny gets persuaded to go on a "The Bachelor" style reality show. Guess who the bachelor is. I just... I can't even...

*** I have actually read Hail Odysseus and enjoyed it. Brennus is great and I didn't know there was a new one already. I also read A Setup Gone Wrong but I haven't read Meeting the Weasleys so I'll check that out. I remember reading one where Harry was living as Henry in a muggle village and he meets Ginny. They both think the other is a muggle and she even reads an AU version of the Harry Potter books. I just spent an hour searching but couldn't find it. Thanks for the links though! I'll share more if I find some new ones.

*** I stopped reading Meeting the Weasley's after the first chapter, when she's pregnant and they get married in 2 days. Never liked that setup.

It's called protection. It's not complete but it's pretty good

***** I actually just finished it and enjoyed it a lot. I noticed there is a sequel that was last updated in August of last year and I hope they continue it.
