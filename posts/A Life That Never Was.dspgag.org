This started as a prompt but it kind of grew/became fleshed-out as I put it down in text. So, uh, sorry.

Still, I thought it was unusual enough, so... uh.

â€‹

- Slytherin's basilisk also acted as a warden to some unspeakable eldritch horror.
- In the months following its death-by-Harry, the abomination becomes active since its were bonds broken.
- Harry and another victim (let's say Daphne Greengrass, given her current popularity, but it can be anyone but those Harry's close to, like Ginny or Hermione) end up being abducted, cocooned, and kept in a shared dream-state as it feeds off their minds/delusion like a parasite.
- In this dreamworld, the pair essentially grow up together: they meet, have character growth as they mature with 'age', graduate Hogwarts while dating/falling in love, end up marrying and having children. An idyllic life within the dream, even when something niggles in the back of their brains that something is /wrong/.
- Only for both to be cruelly awakened by Dumbledore after he either kills or seals the Horror away again, and have this life ripped away from them. They'd only been missing a few days.
- The focus would be the aftermath:

  - No-one understands why they're both hysterical and inconsolable after being freed, until they explain what they shared: Dumbledore in particular is horrified and sympathetic. They especially mourn their 'never-children', since it was all real to them regardless.
  - Their dream-life experiences left the two greatly matured since they lived a life -- they're not the same people they were before they were ensnared. However, due to being kids again, they've pretty much inherited a more child-like version of the personalities/people they developed /into/ in the dream-life than who they were before.

    - Pretty much take who you are now in your late twenties or thirties plus and then dump your personality/maturity back into your thirteen/twelve year old self, only modifying it so you're more kid-like since, ya know, you're a kid again with a kid's brain.

  - This alienates them somewhat from their friends, since to them it's like seeing two strangers walk about in their bodies.

    - Sad to say, I could see Harry punching Ron if he says something unintentionally offensive about why Harry's acting like someone's died when his kids weren't even real. Ron was a bit insensitive like that in the early books.

  - If Daphne were a cold bitch and a firm believer in blood-purity and thought muggles were animals, for example, her 'experiences' in the dream-life could have made her do a one-eighty or at least become a lot softer or tolerable, astounding and disconcerting her friends/housemates/family.

    - Same deal with Harry becoming more of a 'shades of grey' kind of guy than the 'black and white mentality' he had as a youngster.

  - They're still in love with each other and still act like a long-standing husband and wife couple, such as setting up dinner dates and the like, albeit with a degenerated dynamic because they're young, awkward teens again, on top of them pretty much both suffering from a large amount of trauma or even PTSD.

    - This baffles and frightens people even more.

  - It'd be pretty funny if Sirius was cleared by Dumbledore on accident as he tried to track down the missing students.
  - Dumbledore and Sirius are worried they'll elope to Gretna Green the moment they're both fourteen or fifteen. Their attempts to 'keep an eye on them' are hilariously easy to uncover and facepalm-worthy to the couple.
  - As you can imagine, this'd butterfly events like crazy.

    - For comedic value, I could see a subplot where Fleur develops an attraction to Harry because of how 'mature' he is, dismissing Daphne as a 'leetle girl'. Daphne defends her man from Fleur's attempts of trying to get closer to him.
    - On the downside, this could venture into certain unlikable fic territory that has girls fighting over a 'badass Harry' -- you know the cringey ones I mean. That's not the intention.
    - Harry and Daphne having to relearn everything they /thought/ they learned in the delusion, since it wasn't real/catered to them to keep them domesticated. That includes life-skills like managing a business, magic (could be a nice piss-take of the Indie-Harry stories that have ludicrous power-ups), et cetera.
    - This actually adds to the stress/trauma as it'd be like adults having to learn how to read/write again beyond a certain level.


** I must admit, this is a *very* interesting plot, fairly well-thought-out, with rooms for a lot of stuff. In my opinion, it is best if you actually try it out yourself.

*** Is that the one that ends up with Picard picking up the flute and playing it, or was it another one from the original series?

If it was that one, then yeah, I really liked that episode, because it gave me a new way of looking at Picard afterwards....

** Interesting plot, although I'd love to see some conflict from their child and adult mentalities rather than just having their childish personality from the dream.

This may seem a bit redundant as it's literally magic but, if you put a mind inside another body for all instances you become them, new neurons and pathways etc...

So it'd be nice to see the struggle with their adult mentalities and their childish personality, especially when their child personality would take presedence due to their adult mentalitites being nothing more than their mind. Perhaps a split personality?

** Reminds me of some coma patient scenarios. Live an entire life, with some weird stuff being "off", and then it turns out the life was a lie.

I remember a SS&HP fic that had a similar premise to this, more or less. Some creature, as part of killing their prey, induces a perfect life hallucination. It wasn't a Severitus, but it had some similar themes of it -- Harry's parents was alive (in this "universe", SS was ultimately able to protect the Potters and avoid their deaths -- /both/ of them), and SS becomes a honorary uncle alongside the Marauders. He was able to move on from Lily, so there was ultimately no awkwardness in that regard, thankfully. In the end, they get closer -- not father-son close, but more mentor-level close.

The marriage age in Scotland is still 16. I feel like the bigger issue you run into is that they are, for all intents and purposes, mentally adults in the bodies of children. They had children. Which means that they will be used to the idea of sex with each other. And very familiar with each other's bodies. Legal or not, they will end up having sex with each other. Because the hardware is certainly there. Which is all kinds of questionable to write. But everything else is utterly unrealistic if they were happy with each other.

Who cares about her peers. She is an adult, as is Harry. After living and fighting through a civil war and being adults for more than a decade, do you really think they would care what background character #5486 thinks? Harry has no family, and Daphne's is apparently a bunch of bigots who would not tolerate Harry. The only troubling disconnect I can see is with her little sister.

** Reminds me of the pillow world episode of Adventure Time, except that there's two people involved and they both retain their memories.

On an unrelated note, I think it'd be interesting if Harry and Daphne (or whoever else) retain all their knowledge of magic and spellwork, but not their abilities: it adds an extra layer of angst if they find themselves suddenly unable to do things that were second nature to them in the dream world.
