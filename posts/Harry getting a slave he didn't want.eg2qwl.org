** Self-recommendation of a work in progress. Greyback gives Remus a human slave, and Remus is like, “Gee, thanks boss, just what I always wanted,” while inside he's like, “Oh shit, this will make my spying job so much harder.”

  When a human is captured by werewolves, escape is impossible, but she might be able to accomplish one thing: kill Remus Lupin. He's the most evil werewolf in the pack because he's the best at pretending to be human.

** [[https://crys.fanficauthors.net/Chattel/index/]["Chattel," by Crys on FanficAuthors.net]], a continuation of Rorschach's Blot's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/41/Odd-Ideas][Odd Ideas Chapter 41]] set during an alternate Year Six:

#+begin_quote
  In order to rescue Tracey and Daphne from Malfoy, Harry must take them as chattel.

This's a good story IMO, where Harry acts quite upstandingly all the way through.

** You can try this fic. It's basically where Harry gets bonded accidentally to a bunch of Slytherins when he killed Voldemort.
