Not tired of Harry, tired of Hogwarts, of the sameness. It's annoying reading the same thing over and over again, even if it has differences. I actually get a headache just by thinking of reading a Years 1-7 story.


** Fanfiction= infinite possibilities

** You... you know you don't /have/ to keep reading HP fanfiction, right? Like, you can take a break or read other things, you know?

** Yes, I do. Which is why I read mostly non-Harry-Hogwarts-years stories. Marauders, post-War, or next-generation.

** Time to read something else then! Do most people here exclusively read fanfiction from this fandom and never anything else? I certainly don't.

** I read a lot of crossovers (particularly ones with Harry in the other setting rather than the other way around), and I read fics from a few other fandoms too. Keeps it from getting too stale.

** Ehhh not really

I mean, sometimes if I'm reading a certain trope I might get bored if many are following the same format but otherwise I haven't really had that issue

** Well it's not like I just sit there and read fanfics 24/7. I have to attend (virtual) classes everyday and work on homework, so I end up looking at fanfics about 2-3 hours a day, 4-5 days a week. It's important to not get sucked up into the fanfic (I have made that mistake) to the point that you forget you have a life to live irl.

** One of the reasons I don't actually like fics which cover the seven years over seven parts each 100k. Of course, getting tired of some aspects over time is natural. That's why I filter them out on Ao3 sometimes. Tired of dumbledore? Filter him out. Tired of eighth year fics? Filter them out. Tho idk why I just can't ever seem to get tired of Harry. I never read non Harry-centric fics.
