** Could you imagine Harry going to Brazil for some Reason and having all the snakes there basically worship him because the boa spread the word of his good deed?

*** I would love that. I can see it now... Slytherin's Basilisk: kill.... HP: Join me, the savior of all snakes, and we shall usher in a new era where all sneks roam free, and every danger noodle is worshiped as a minor deity. SB: Sounds good, my Lord. HP: /maniacal, but non-evil, laughter/

Or at least that's what I'd do.

  When Harry wonders what happened to the first sort-of friend he had, even if it was just a snake, he's surprised to get a mysterious letter from said snake, telling him about his life... honestly, he got to Brazil? Harry wondered if that was true...

** I just had to drop in and say that I love posts like this that ask for Fics that are so outside the box and unusual. Even if there are not any stories, you can bet someone will see this idea and it will possibly inspire something. Perhaps the Boa comes back to Harry as his familiar down the road, or saves Harry from Nagini or something.
