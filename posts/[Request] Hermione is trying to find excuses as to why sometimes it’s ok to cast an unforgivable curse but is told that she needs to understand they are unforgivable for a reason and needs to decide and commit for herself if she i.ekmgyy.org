** That would be refreshing. Usually, it's all "Unforgivables are banned by The Man for political reasons!" "Dark is not evil! You can kill someone with a Levitation Charm!" (For that matter, it's usually the Powerful!Gray!Independent!Harry doing it, and Hermione just nags and is generally useless and bashed.)

** for unforgivable curses anger only works momentarily and on only made bellatrix trip. Bellatrix stated that you need to enjoy the pain for the cruciatas(dont know how to spell)

this would probably apply to the killing curse too. murderous intent to commit the act as Crouch-Moody states none of the kids could do it in 4th year

someone imperio-ing you is probably the only excuse

*** Bellatrix said you need to want the pain actually, not that you need to enjoy it.

** I cannot remember where, but there was a fic where some healers were taught the killing curse as a means of euthanization in extreme cases. The idea behind it was that the killing curse was motivated by intent, and the desire to end someone's suffering would be seen as another way of manifesting the curse.
