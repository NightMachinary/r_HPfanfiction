Harry is the Master of Death, with powers unknown to all. He walks to his death in the Forbidden Forest, and takes the train back to his body.

Only, gasp, he's time traveled back to his 11-year-old body, on Sept 2, first day of classes. Harry quietly ponders what exactly this means, until he hears Fred Weasley causing a commotion.

It comes to be revealed that every witch or wizard who died between now and Harry's death in 7th year, has awoken from their death in this time.

Dumbledore and Snape have vast foreknowledge. Quirrel has just enough to keep from getting caught immediately. Perhaps they kidnap Lavender Brown so Voldemort can learn something of the future?

Is there a story like this? Could there even _be_ an interesting story, when Harry, Dumbledore, and Snape are so forewarned? What would Crabbe do, as an old bully in his little body? Does Sirius go insane from suddenly being back into Azkaban? Or is he saved by the new and familiar ravings of death-eaters?


** I think that Quirrell would die to massed spellfire from everyone that knew that he was possessed by Voldemort. Given that there were a lot of dead Aurors, and importantly Amelia Bones, there would be a lot of imprisoned death-eaters. Especially Malfoy. Add to that the absolute chaos that would run through the wizarding world as the people that didn't die try to come to terms with the foreknowledge of the people that did.

** linkffn(Too Many Travellers by Inusitatus) has Harry, Tonks, Cedric, Sirius, and Remus all appear in their younger bodies when Harry is getting sorted. It then gets rather cracky. That's probably the closest you'll get.

linkffn(Far Too Many Time Travelers by Lord Jeram) has pretty much everyone except Harry independently traveling back in time. It doesn't really match your plot, but it's at least the same general theme.

I also know there was a story I once read where after the war, Harry's entire class travels back in time to before their first year, and I'm pretty sure they arrange things to ensure that none of them are sorted into Slytherin. But I can't find it now, and it's not exactly a perfect match anyway.

  Harry letting himself get hit by Voldemort's killing curse had slightly different results in this particular AU!

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

**** No, I've read that fic and it's definitely not it. That one has four people traveling back and killing most of the Slytherins, but they also end up there themselves. The fic I'm thinking about has literally everyone in Harry's year coming back together. And then they all decide that the world will turn out better if none of them end up in Slytherin. The only other thing I remember is that Hannah has to be the one to convince the Hat to go along with the plan, which she does, except it swaps two students from the houses they planned. I don't know if the story even continued much after that.

** you could have voldemort and the death eaters come back as well. only they come back like half an hour earlier.

so during the chaos of everyone realising what happens

Quirrel escapes hogwarts and moves the horcruxes. people like malfoy and nott go into hiding. sirius black escapes Azkaban again getting out minutes before the death eaters get broken out by their friends.
