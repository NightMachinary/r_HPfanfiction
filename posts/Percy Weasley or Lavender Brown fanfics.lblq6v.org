I have been, for some reason, really getting interested in these two characters. I think that JKR's view on women really made Lavender out to be an uninteresting stereotype in the books, only obsessed with makeup and boys. I would appreciate it if someone could point me in the way of fanfics that explore her character more thoroughly and portray her as something other than an amalgamation of tired female stereotypes and bashing her femininity as other fics tend to do. I read a really well-written Lavender/Tom Riddle fic (weird, I know)a while ago that really changed the way I saw her

As for Percy Weasley, he's quite similar to Lavender in the fact that the fandom has reduced him to the barebones of his characterisation, and now in fanfic he is always the snotty, uptight brother and he never develops more than that. I think he is such an underrated character, and would love some fics that focus on him more. I don't particularly enjoy Percy/Oliver Wood fics though, the nerd/jock trope seems overdone.

I do hope some people have some recommendations :)

** For Percy, I liked these fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21294002][dawn is coming, open your eyes]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Dialux/pseuds/Dialux][Dialux]] (Gen) - You are not courageous. Your dreams have always been the bravest parts of you. [Percy Weasley, post-war, pre-reconciliation. The world is broken and he knows it better than most, but Percy's also broken as well. Fixing one might just mean fixing both.]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14033613][Percy Take the Wheel]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/KittySmith/pseuds/KittySmith][KittySmith]] (Gen) - A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/489003][Outside the Loop]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Demeter/pseuds/Demeter][Demeter]] (Percy/Kingsley) - Percy Weasley and the year that was. It's not easy being a prat.

For Lavender:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2385353][This Is Where]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Kicon/pseuds/Kicon][Kicon]] (Lavender/Parvati) - Various moments of Parvati and Lavender through their years at Hogwarts as they deal with self-identity, internalized homophobia, and a Hogwarts crueler than anybody could've imagined

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4666736/1/Tangled-Webs][Tangled Webs]] by Realmer06 (Ron/Hermione and Lavender/Seamus) - Everyone knows Lavender Brown. Or at least, they think they do. A look at Ron and Hermione's relationship through the point of view of one who has better reasons to watch than you might think.

** If you don't mind a little self promotion, my HP story ongoing has Percy as a fairly major character who's close to Harry, though it is an ensemble story overall.

  Harry had never really properly planned anything before. The fact that his first ever plan was risky and filled with assorted dangers was not actually deterring him as much as it should.In other words, this story explores how Harry's third year at Hogwarts might have played out differently if a little project management and an ambitious plan had been thrown into the mix.

** Here's the thing. Percy is not a main character in this one (and possibly doesn't even show up until few chapters in; I can't recall the specifics) but he was definitely the character that stayed with me once I finished reading the story. From what I'd seen, it's a unique take on him and his motivations. Expends on him without making him OOC. Vital to the plot, but sadly his POV is only shown between others.

Do note that this fic is a 3rd in a series and might not make too much sense without the previous 2, but Percy is only brought in in the 3rd one. Also note that it's slash, which I'm aware many on this sub do not like reading.

** First of all, there is Lavender Brown in the stories of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] (start with “Tales of the Battle” and go on). Specifically important for Lavender are “Hunters and Prey” linkao3(1857084), “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/104579][Muggle Interface Team]]” series (plus “MLT: Muggle Liaison Team by Northumbrian” linkffn(7071175), which looks like an abandoned first draft of M.I.T. stories) and the “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/107123][The Lavender/Moon Tales]]”.

The other interesting one is “My Life as a Teenage Gladiator by 1hellyeahz1” linkffn(13387005).

Also, I wonder how good will be “What Are We Supposed To Do Now? by char_03” linkao3(27637429).

Concerning Percy, I like most duo “Escape by SingularOddities“ linkffn(11916243), which is rather average Harmony story, but Percy's substory was so interesting, that the author rewrote it into a separate large excellent story “Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities” linkffn(12373273).

  February 2000 Newly Qualified (in record time) Auror Harry Potter remains obsessed with “The List.” The ten people still wanted for their part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Their capture is essential. It will bring closure to the events of the past few years. Harry has set himself a target. He wants to see “The Last Death Eater” and the other nine captured before the second anniversary of the battle. His attempts to meet his target will bring heartbreak, danger, pain, and a lifechanging injury for one former DA member.
