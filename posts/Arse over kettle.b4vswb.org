I keep coming across this phrase, and I don't know if it's a US phrase and that's why I've never heard it, or just something that Americans think British people say- but if they do they've never said it in my earshot!

Arse over tit would work instead though...


** Agree have never heard anyone say that. It sounds like they're getting the term arse over elbow wrong.

*** Looks like it is actually a US phrase:
