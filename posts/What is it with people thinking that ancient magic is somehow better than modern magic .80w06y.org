That would be like finding a Windows 95 (or older)computer and somehow expecting it to be better than the current computers in 2018.

So any storys were instead of finding some ancient magic. The main character uses modern magic knowledge and the ideas from modern muggle fiction to create new magic?


** Are you talking about just Harry potter or fantasy in general?

Because this trope has been around since as long as fantasy has been. From the sword that was broken in Lotr, to ancient Aes Sedai having more powerful magic weaves in days of lore (WoT), to Valerian forged blades lasting the test of time and being superior to modern blades(ASoIaF).

Fantasy for the most part has always had a nostalgic undertone. Where the world is generally worse than the one from eons ago and it shows prevalently in the form of ancient magic/artifact/weapon being more advanced and powerful than modern day equivalents

** It's a pretty standard fantasy trope. Pursuit of lost knowledge or artifacts of power show up in all kinds of fiction.

Ancient magic is usually seen as "lost" or "forgotten" and therefore must be special. Very rarely is it ever seen as obsolete.

Tolkien does it with the One Ring and with the magic weapons they find in the Hobbit. Moon runes on the map too. JKR does it. The Hallows are basically "lost" artifacts of power.

** My way of looking at it in the Potterverse is that /everyday/ magic is steadily advancing --- new handy household charms and the like are discovered every year. However, there have always been, throughout history, magical geniuses who personally advanced beyond their contemporaries' understanding and created magical items that can't be topped by even modern magic, whose secrets died with them. The average modern wizard is infinitely more polyvalent, adaptable and knowledgeable than one of the 3d century, but as far as big, flashy, powerful magic goes, Merlin is about evenly matched with Dumbledore, though Dumbledore /knows/ more things.

***** Well, we know magical power increases while growing up, though I'm not throwing my hat behind the idea that this is why Dumbledore is so strong. But for example, Crouch said in GoF that the reason he didn't have to worry about 4th years using the Killing Curse was because it "requires a powerful bit of magic behind it", meaning they lacked the magic power to cast the curse. But we know at least some of them could do it later, so the only explanation (that Crouch practically says outright) is that magical power grows with age, perhaps up until adulthood.

******* Also I should probably make it clear that I don't actually have any problems with magic getting stronger with age, I just don't think it's supported by canon. The most important part of using these sorts of concepts in fanfics (to me) is consistency. If all magic gets stronger with age, then make ab-so-lutely fucking sure that all magic gets stronger with age. If there are exceptions, stick to them. If only certain kinds of magic get stronger, stick to that.

But like all rules, even consistency within magic systems has its exceptions. If you're writing a story that operates on the premise that magic is most certainly /not/ scientific, then consistency doesn't really matter, yeah? But still, be consistent about the fact that magic isn't consistent.

Don't get me wrong, you don't have to (and shouldn't) lay out to the reader exactly what the laws (or lack-thereof) of your magic system are. They should be able to be deduced from information within the story. Show, don't tell.

to use the elder wand as an example

If we take Dumbledore's opinion that the Elder wand was Created by Antioch Peverell instead of a personification of death.That means that there's three possible answers that I can see as being the reason that the Elder wand is still the best wand after hundreds of years:

1. wand makes are incompetent being unable to make a wand better than the elder wand even thought its hundreds of years old and at least one wand maker that we know of has had the chance to study it.

2. the elder wand and other magical Artefacts can draw power from there legends

3. magical artefacts slowly get stronger with time so even though modern wand making is better than what it was when the Elder wand was made the elder wand along with being the best wand of its time has also survived for Hundreds of years with it slowly getting more powerful over time.

I prefer option three, if you don't like those options what is your Opinion on why the elder wand has still not been surpassed even though it is Hundred of years old?

Pretty much what you wrote out there.

#+begin_quote
  three possible answers
#+end_quote

The fourth could be that the wand is literally made by Death and its power stems from that fact alone, has nothing to do with magic getting stronger with age.

The fifth could be that the Peverell brothers had proprietary knowledge that they were unable or unwilling to pass on to others before their deaths, which allowed them to create much stronger wands than modern wizards could.

#+end_quote

There's no evidence to suggest the Elder Wand gained power over time, there's no evidence that it's any more powerful now than it was when it was created. Hence this line of questioning.

We want you to show us evidence, examples, or sound reasoning as to why you believe the Elder Wand (or any other arbitrary magical artifact) is A) stronger now than it was at the time of its creation, or B) is relatively stronger when compared to contemporary magic versus magic of its time. Following from that, we want to know why you believe the artifacts' magic has grown stronger, as opposed to any other explanation.

No, it can't. It wouldn't even be overinterpretation, it in no way derives from the text.

My theory works very simply.

It's hard to harm someone at Hogwarts because "the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them" and the "ancient" part is important because "time (...) matter[s] in magic". That means that the time is an important factor in the potency of those protections.

In your theory, time isn't a factor in the spells' power, but the proof of it. But that doesn't in any way correlate with what Snape says.

Seems pretty easy to see, for me. The reason time matters in magic is because old spells that still exist are, by necessity, more powerful than most magic, or otherwise they would not survived to become ancient. Snape's statement does not imply that magic increases in strength as it ages, only that older magic is stronger than newer magic. There are many reasons that could be the case, including my theory and yours. But nothing there suggests yours is more correct.

If so, then it means that spells get weaker in age then the ancient spells might've gotten much weaker by now and be almost useless.

But 2. is more important. As I said earlier - your reading doesn't in any way follow from what Snape said. Let's show analogical situation.

"You don't have to worry about ceiling falling on your head, this building is ancient. Time matters in construction engineering."

***** Well, it's not like we know much about Flamel --- maybe Death /did/ come by, but Flamel, knowing the old tale, turned down any "gifts".

But my personal theory has always been that the "Bridge" built by the brothers was actually the /Veil/ (a metaphorical bridge between life and death, or a "bridge over the river Styx" if you will). Death wouldn't care that some few wizards had escaped mundane demise, but to open a gateway between Earth and the Afterlife, /that/ was wholly unacceptable, and yet worthy of much praise. In exchange for the gifts, Death made the Veil one-way, though he did not tear it down for appreciation of the Brothers' mastery.

(Of course, this lands us back where we started because this assumes the Peverells were great enough to make the Veil from scratch. But I posted a direct reply to the thread above with my take on the whole thing.)

******* About Antioch: well, there's academic genius and then there's physical skill. Could be that, like I imagine Hermione or Flamel to be, Antioch was a genius when it came to designing a complex magical item like the Veil, but he just wasn't fleet-footed and cool-headed enough to be much good in an actual duel. In fact, perhaps this was a sore spot for him --- the one thing he couldn't master --- hence why he'd ask for that.

As for Cadmus asking for the Stone that would be a "downgrade": what I'm imagining is that Death came and explained he just couldn't have something like the Veil around, so he was going to destroy it/disable it either way, but he admired them enough to give them some lesser-but-still-amazing things in exchange. So Cadmus would have asked for as close as he could get for what they originally had, without going /too/ far and risking Death saying no.

** Well there is some evidence especially in Harry Potter that ancient magic is superior. If we take a look, the greatest wizard of all time is Merlin, and he lived at least 800 years ago, very likely closer to 1500 years ago. The Founders crafted Hogwarts and performed absolutely brilliant pieces of magic, which no one has replicated. Herpo the Foul created the Horcrux some 2000 or more years ago, and it's one of the best ways to cheat death. Nicholas Flamel made the Philosopher's Stone some time in the 1300s, and no one has replicated it. The three Peverell Brothers probably created the Hallows themselves, as opposed to legend, and they're immensely powerful and old. +Ekrizdris was of the 15th century, and he created the Dementors, which no one has found a way to kill yet.+

All of these people have great achievements that must require extreme mastery and skill in magic. At the same time, modern geniuses haven't seemed to produce anything as great. Neither Grindelwald, Dumbledore, nor Voldemort have done anything all that great compared to those before them, though Voldemort is called by Dumbledore the greatest Dark wizard of all time, but many people forget that.

But as wizarding society had to go into hiding, and humanity grew more civilized massive defensible structures were no longer as necessary.

In modern times we dont fear the dark like our ancestors did because we aren't attacked nightly by wild animals and magical beasts like trolls and ogres.

Wizarding society went into hiding in 1689. Long after castles fell out of favor as defensive structures! Wizards are extremely backwards, but I refuse to believe that they think Hogwarts is safe because it's a friggin' castle (more about that later).

Humanity grew more civilized? Sure maybe, but wars became much more dangerous and more large scale: Castles fell out of favor because of fucking canons, not because everything became super peaceful suddenly. Castles got replaced by star forts.

For the longest part of human history technological advancement (and advancement as a civilization as a whole) usually also meant advancement in weaponry and increased bloodshed. You have it the wrong way around. I hope I don't have to explain to you why the two World Wars didn't happen in ancient Rome, but your post leaves me entirely confused.

Do you actually believe people built castles to protect from wild animals and trolls and ogres?! No pun intended, but are you trolling right now? It sounds like you are confusing medieval times with the stone age or something.

There's a decent question somewhere deep, deep in there about why Wizards and Witches would built a castle as a defensive structure at all. I always imagined that the important defensive parts of Hogwarts are invisible and not the castle itself: It seems a common theme for them to imitate Muggle architecture and it may be more about form than function. Wizards and Witches can apparate: any type of fortified defense becomes immediately meaningless if it isn't backed up by advanced magical defenses.

There's also the possibility that Hogwarts was involved in actual Muggle sieges, but we don't really know how close Wizards worked together with Muggles at the time. As far as we know Hogwarts was always a school. Lets be honest here, JKR just wanted to have a cool old Scottish castle as her main setting and that's okay. Maybe it would have made more sense if it was build by Muggles and later hidden and taken over by the Magicals, but who am I to judge?

****** Ok first off no im not trying to troll and theres no need to get pissed. I was just sharing my interpretations of what i have read.

Yes people are shitting their pants over dark lords and have gone through multiple goblin rebellions. But the protections at hogwarts are massive defenses that generally make it seem like the most highly defended place in magical Britain, if not further.

I honestly dont believe any wizard who could cast something like that would price the spells well enough that anyone but the most wealthy families could purchase them. Not to mention if the spells themselves were simple enough that anyone other than a true genius at enchanting on par with the founders could understand and re-create them then how safe could they really be? I see the wards specifically as such powerful things BECAUSE no one else can figure out how to put them up and thus have no idea how to take them down. And because of how difficult they are to decipher or expensive they would be the general population would rather go with more easily understood and convenient source. Warding a family home on par with hogwarts would be like building you house inside Fort Knox, safe but entirely unnecessary and prohibitively expensive.

--------------

I also didnt know what year wizards went into hiding, interesting tidbit.

No i dont believe the castle was built solely for the purposes of defending from magical and non magical wildlife but i do think it was one aspect in favor of building a castle. When i think of the time Hogwarts was built i think its perfectly understandable why the founders would build a castle and layer it with enchantments. And yes part of this explanation goes off of fantasy logic rather than historical accuracy.

Quite a bit of the magical wildlife we see in the series are very dangerous but dont have much capacity to quickly or easily destroy castle walls, especially without access to magic. And when the castle was initially constructed swords shields and cavalry were the primary form of muggle warfare, not cannons.

Between 4 magical geniuses to quicken the building, the type of conflict engaged in at the time, and the types of magical creatures a wizarding population in a medieval setting could expect to deal with, I believe the construction of a castle was a prime choice especially with the added protections of the wards they would implement. Stone walls to protect against a small muggle force, or magical creatures, and wards to defend against siege weaponry, and attacking wizards.

--------------

Also Yes in general technological advances have gone hand in hand with warfare, something i am quite aware of. However something to think of is that while the magical world has had numerous conflicts and what they would call wars, they generally have to remain in hiding, which precludes them from massive displays of force except in the face of terrorist groups like the death eaters and Grindlewald's followers. This specific limitation is caused by the wizarding worlds retreat into their enclaves, before that other than skill what is to stop all wizards who are in battle from using massive firestorms, and explosions?

Im not saying that magic didn't grow in the years since the founders, and the retreat into the enclaves. Im saying the same applications of massive displays of magic would be more difficult and that magical growth would begin to lean towards precision and focus.

--------------

My conclusions and interpretations come from HP as a Fantasy series first and historical accuracy second. Ill admit i dont scour the lore with a fine tooth comb, i just read the books and fanfics, and watch the movies once per year. Im just a fan of fantasy in general and different aspects of fantasy tend to affect my interpretations of what i read.

Again, utter hogwash. Goblin Rebellions are canon and I'm sure they didn't just throw cotton candy at each other.

It is specifically addressed in the series that Wizards cover up their internal conflicts with accidents or natural disasters, even when Muggles are some of the victims (the gas leak or the destruction of the bridge).

For all we know there's just as much, or even more, armed conflict in the Wizarding World as in Muggle society.

At this point we just have different views on the series. I always saw the goblin rebellions as bloody but confined conflicts that never moved to muggle populated areas. Conflicts held within the comparatively smaller wizarding society.

And yes the Ministry covers up everything with obliviation and false stories, but without more specific instances than those which occur in the series my interpretation is that those coverups are very rarely needed.

You can't really blame them, because the overarching theme of the Books is the fight against an arch-reactionary government and a group of sadistic genocidal monsters. Those progressive elements of Magical Britain generally get pushed into background.

The Epilogue pisses off many readers too. It showed Malfoys getting off scotch free, Ron bragging about mind raping a Muggle (I suspect JKR hates DL testers in London), and no signs of progress at all. Maybe JKR wanted to play up some nostalgia, but significant amount of people actually hate the past, and especially what Magical Britain used to be like during Harry's time (I hate it too).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's]] postwar series differs from the rest in that he writes a fairly balanced and progressive Magical Britain after Voldemort's fall. Arthur Weasley became filthy rich by developing a magical version of the smartphone, the Ministry widely adopted cars that could now be used with portkeys, and Harry worked closely with UK government to stamp out magical crimes.

** You could either be referring to 'gets a super-power' or 'finds an old way of doing something'. Which one is it?

Finding 'ancient magic' is a traditional way to gain a superpower. Along with 'born with it' (Superman, or Creature-fics in HP-land), 'discovered it' (The Atom), 'Granted it' (Green Lantern) and 'extraordinary personality' (Batman). Finding 'ancient magic' is the general way to give bookish or brainy characters superpowers.

This is simply a way to give your characters super-powers. Generally no-one else will be able to use it, and it allows the characters to break some in-universe set of rules. As for why it is more popular in HP-fiction land? Well I guess an alien coming and giving him a ring for his bravery doesn't really fit the universe.

The other one is more nuanced. Often you will want your characters to approach the problem in a different way from the rest of society, and you have to give them a reason. You can obviously use the 'genius or extraordinary personality' route, but if you want your characters to be every-mans that doesn't work.

In this case, having them find an old way of doing things can be an effective way to make them approach a problem differently. And going against conventional wisdom /can/ work, amazingly well actually. When ideas are so bad/outdated that everyone knows they are hopeless so they don't bother planning against them, they can be an effective way to take an opponent by surprise.

Of course, with the 'ancient magic' route there is a shelf-life: Once you start using it, people will find out why it wasn't adopted in the first place and counter it.

To do this well, you generally set up the old system not as stronger, but weaker. The value of the approach is the characters doing things in an unexpected way, not that the approach is stronger. It would weaken over time as it became expected.

I'm not sure why it is used here though, if you want to have your characters approach the problem differently, you have this wonderful dichotomy of the wizarding world vs the muggle world you can use. Harry can approach problems differently due to his upbringing, no need to have him discover a reason to look at the problem differently.

**** My personal preference is for stories that throw science at it.

"You can't study magic with science, they are opposites!"

"Wait wait wait, That does't make sense. Science is just a formal structure for studying the natural world. It doesn't care what you are studying, as long as it is an observable phenomena. Lets take Lumos and record how bright it is. Now lets do it at different points in the day. After a big meal. After exercise.... what can we learn?"

** In my opinion, most fantasies use magic as a antithesis to tecnology, or progress. The ancient way of life usually is associated with wisdom, a close relationship with nature and Earth itself. So it's easy to see old magic as something more powerful, for many reasons.

In modern time, we can see magic being used to clean pots, to make food and folding socks (I'm looking at you, Tonks), we have magical tents and joke produts. For me, the way the characters uses magic is a reflection of the society they live.

In Harry Potter, the ancient artifacts are linked to magic itself (whatever that may be), such as the Hollows and the Goblet of Fire. Even the phoenix can be inserted in this category (being the only living creature imortal and all). The modern itens, in contrast, were made to facilitate life (Moody's eye; flying cars; a device that turn-of the lights; etc.)

** A little late to the discussion, but there's a real-world phenomenon that causes this: survivor bias.

Survivor bias is the phenomenon where, over time, "better" versions of things are more likely to survive than "worse" things. A stronger building's going to stand longer, a good technique is going to be passed on, a good tool's going to be made more, etc. Now, imagine a thousand years of failures and stupidity getting washed away while people try to preserve the genuinely good stuff. If we translated this to magic, a spell made by a one-in-a-million prodigy is far more likely to survive for a thousand years than the primitive versions of modern spells.

Further, consider that many of the spells in Harry Potter might very well have been ancient spells passed down for so long and so often that /everyone/ used them and nobody realized how remarkable they actually were. It's unlikely - the HP wiki has several examples of spells/potions/enchantments being invented/improved upon all the time - but there is a chance that "ancient magic" actually is good, if only because what they have left is the 1% of the 1%.

** I like how in the perfectly normal series Harry shocks a ancient animated mosaic of [[/spoiler][Merlin]] by using simple magic that was considered very hard in the past. For example levitating a couch took him a lot of effort and harry simply used his more advanced wand and just used the levitation charm and impressed him greatly. Harry also shocks him by revealing that time turners are giving out to children, when time travel in the past was considered the most impressive magic.

But it also has The magicals themselves getting weaker. With the average life span decreasing(Headmaster Dippet died in his 350s in canon) and less people having the ability of a metamorphmagus.

The greatest wizards are the Founders. The greatest artifacts are the old ones. Most of mandatory subjects teach nothing and the ones related with spell creation and curse breaking are for nerds like Hermione. The current greatest and most powerful wizard is more than 100 years old.

And absolute lack of common sense among magicians doesn't work well for them too.

** Two things, the way I typically see ancient magic being presented is that it's something akin to understanding the nature of magic itself; whereas with modern magic you have people using magic and utilizing it in the most efficient way possible to achieve results.

Also with ancient magic (at least the way I like it being used) there is a pretty big tradeoff, with modern magic it's quick. A simple incantation and flick (which can be simplified further with silent incantation). Ancient magic, however, is a slower, more deliberate measure, but with less reliable control. Trying to harness magic itself should be a powerful experience, but not something that you can just throw around willy-nilly.

** Not specifically speaking about HP but fantasy in general.

Some series base ancient magic off the idea that in olden times Magic was more well known, magicians didnt have to hide their gifts and so could practice their craft and develop their power in full without devoting time to hiding. Plus in most fantasy settings where magic is prevalent it makes sense for Magic to be a main component of warfare and so magic dedicated to pure unrelenting power and destruction would be more researched.

In some series including the HP fanfic community that idea comes through in force. That as we civilized and were required to go into hiding we could no longer develop or utilize the same massively powerful rituals as they were either deemed unnecessary or morally wrong in a civilized society.

Or that older rituals powered by powerful magical beasts are now harder or impossible to perform due to the declining populations of said beasts.

--------------

One of my favorite series runs off of this idea. In the Fate/Stay Night franchise Magecraft is substantially weaker than it was in ancient greece. Because in our past magical beasts, gods, and heroes were EVERYWHERE. The presence of these beings made magic more potent and destructive, as they actively generated more Mana than they could use.

But as the gods began dying, magical beasts were hunted to extinction, and civilization no longer needed as many grand heroes, the amount of magical energy in the world declined as there werent enough natural producers of mana to fuel those high end spells.

Now Mages have to keep their spells to themselves and can only do relatively childs play level spells. Magic in their setting grows weaker the more people who can do it, and without the powerful phantasmal beasts to gain high end reagents, or the power of gods to call on their society is crumbling. Thats why all mages in F/SN are so willing to do ANYTHING for more magical power no matter how depraved. They want to reach the core of all magic and kickstart a new Age of the Gods and gain an understanding of all magic.

** In the case of magic, whether in HP or Fantasy in general. The reasoning is that "ancient" or "Olde Magick" is better because people were finding new ways to use magic. And it was optimized for specific things.

So in HP where people have magic school, and only have to do certain spells to pass for a career. Their magic is for that, that's what they learn.

Like college now, we know much much more. But how many college students could be given a sword take on a knight or samurai of old even without their armor?

Ancient magic isn't better. Just stronger because it was for fighting only, now it's for versatile stuff.

New Magic, in this case would just be a college student teaching himself how to use a sword. He's definitely stronger than his peers. But better than proper sword taught technique? Probably not. Better to learn and adapt old spells, instead of reinventing the wheel.

** Personally I think it has to do with the legend of Merlin.

Merlin was/is considered the best and most powerful wizard to have ever lived, his life is shrouded in mystery but all agree that he wielded magic more powerful than any mere mortal could hope to.

By extrapolation that would mean that because that magic isn't around anymore, it must mean that magic has become more geared towards the common people.

This might be a bad example, but...

Not 10 years ago, awards at school and sports for kids were given out the the first, second and third place finishers. Now the awards are given to everyone who competed, to make people feel more included.

Taking that concept and applying it to magic /could/ be construed that magic has become simpler, easier to wield.

** I'm surprised this hasn't been stated yet but: we measure the greatness of magic by the actions through which said magic manifests. By extension, we determine the power and scale of magic by the magicians of the time. Well, the rise of bloodline superiority has led to increased inbreeding, possibly across the globe. Inbreeding weakens magic is a fairly good explanation that is even somewhat supported by Canon. Tommy Riddle case in point.
