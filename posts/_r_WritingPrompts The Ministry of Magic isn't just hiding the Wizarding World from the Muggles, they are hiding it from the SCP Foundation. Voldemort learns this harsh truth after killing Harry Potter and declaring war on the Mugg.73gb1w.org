*** Probably not. Or rather, it would kill 682, but he would come back to life with an immunity to killing curses AND the ability to emit lethal highly-destructive green flashes.

  *Notes:* One would think that putting SCP-682 in the epicenter of an explosion that can cause third-degree burns at a distance of 300 km is a good idea, but as long as there are odds of survival we simply cannot go through with it. Yes, it's a goddamn nuke, but if 682 survives and adapts we'd be boned beyond belief. O5-█

  "Killing curse if fired at SCP-682 by the SCP-4111-positive Dr. ███████ through SCP-4111-A into the containment chamber from a safe distance. Upon impact the SCP-862 body mass begins to rapidly deteriorate and turn to blackened as if undergoing necrosis. When approximately 23% of SCP-862's body-mass is affected the process abruptly slows before the testing chamber is filled with an explosion that severely damages monitoring equipment and injures several personnel. After containment is reestablished, containment area is found to be filled with large amounts of shrapnel closely resembling wood.

  *Notes:* We can hypothesize based on these results and previous experiments with SCP-4111 that SCP-862 somehow managed to change part of its body-mass to wood. Impacting a tree with the killing Curse is known to explode rather than outright kill the tree after all. Dr. ███████

***** That's a great solution. Incoming green light? Temporarily turn yourself into wood. Sure your arm or torso might explode, but hey, magic can fix anything!

*** Basically, think of it as an organisation the jails anything out of the ordinary, from a sword that makes the welder think it's awesome to a unkillable murder dragon, to a sentient computer to a weeping angel's uglier brother.

*** TL;dr explanation: The SCP Foundation is a secret organization that protects humanity from anomalous activity and prevents it from being discovered by the general public.
