We're finally back on track! And it only took me almost 3 weeks, goddamnit. I wanted to do batches of 5 chapters, but this seemed pretty long already so I cut it in half. Next part should only be a couple days up to chapter 10.

Link [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g52a12/a_subjective_review_of_partially_kissed_hero_ch4/][here]] to last part, if you want the others just search for them, the title is always the same.

Now, let's start with a short summary of each chapter.

Chapter 5

Harry buys some stuff (furniture, books and more kits for collecting stuff from the basilisk), and starts making a new basilisk in the chamber with the knowledge he got from the horcrux. He tricks Dumbledore into thinking he's learning healing and light magic by buying books on those topics for a few reasons, like appeasing him so that he doesn't start calling Harry dark and shoring up lacunae in Tom's knowledge since he focused on dark arts. He sends some letters to misdirect Dumbledore, while apparently having already sent the important ones during his trip to the ministry.

Shifting gears to actually doing stuff rather than wanking himself about his plans, he goes to the Ravenclaw common room, showing off the diadem, the sword of Gryffindor and Helga's cup, and announces that Luna is under his protection and that he plans on making a study group for everyone in a month or so. Everyone is suitably impressed.

Hermione is used as a convenient tool for exposition on how he plans to change his public persona, Ron is derided as a fake friend only after his fame with the usual arguments (the cabins in first year weren't full so Ron lied, the Weasleys being conveniently outside the platform for him), he hints at her that someone (Dumbledore) is evil.

Finally, one of his plans is revealed - Bellatrix escaped Azkaban thanks to a letter he sent her, which had an invisible rune that contained Pettigrew's wand. The letter is sent from 'Voldemort', and gives her the mission of protecting Harry, ostensibly because 'Voldemort' wants to use him in a possession ritual. He also says he took some stuff from her vault, including the cup, as necessary for the ritual.

Apparently this chapter was rewritten - in PL's words in the author's notes, he wasn't happy with the first draft as he actually ventured into angst, whatever that means.

​

Chapter 6

It starts with Harry +mentally masturbating+ thinking to himself about how similar Riddle and Dumbledore really are, with a side dish of examining the four Hogwarts' Houses and how they relate to dark lords. Despite basically debunking his own theory of 'dark' meaning selfish by virtue of Hufflepuff existing, he just shrugs and says fuck Hufflepuff, completely invalidating any pretense at thoughtfulness he may have had before then.

After the first class with Hagrid (no incidents mentioned), Harry is accosted by Bellatrix Lestrange. He fakes being possessed by making his eyes glow red and imitating Tom, ordering her to replace Filch through Polyjuice (that he apparently pulled out of his ass), so that she can be kept around. She agrees, and asks him if she can kill Snape. He lets her, as long as it won't mess with the deception, all the while internally musing how Snape is completely loyal to Voldemort, and how Dumbledore knows it, and how similar the two 'dark lords' really are. He also plans to paint the real Voldemort as an impostor.

Harry goes in the dungeons looking for all storerooms full of treasure, a relic of the times before wizards became spineless and gave up the economy to the goblins, and he gets his mitts on the Goblet of Fire which apparently has many useful powers that Dumbledore has probably already made use of for himself.

On his way up, he stops by the infirmary for no reason whatsoever where he finds Draco, Goyle and Crabbe unconscious and with all the bones in their bodies broken. He muses for a bit about how they are guaranteed to become Death Eaters in the future, then casts some spells at them and leaves. I'm gonna bet right now that it was him who did it with the time turner.

In the Great Hall, everyone wants to see the Founders' relics, since apparently he has taken to wearing them constantly. Ron and Hermione are angry at each other, as Ron asked if he could see her boobs too (from when Harry announced they were together to cover for Time Turner shenanigans) and she slapped him.

Apparently I lose the bet, as the trio were in the infirmary for being thrown off the train in the first chapter. Dumbledore and a group of aurors are waiting for them to wake up to get leads on who was responsible. Pomfrey is against waking them, since they are on painkillers and are still in horrible condition, but acquiesces to their request. Then, I shit you not, she slaps them awake with a fish. Give me a second, I need a break.

Ok, I'm back. The three are pretty incoherent, and start shouting stuff about the muggle dark lord Colonel Sanders and his accomplices that I'm too Italian to understand the reference of, which everyone there apparently take completely seriously. Malfoy manages to stick a chicken bone covered with something in Dumbledore, which makes the 'dark lord' black out.

​

Chapter 7

As usual, Harry is ruminating about his plans. He thinks to himself about how he used the time turner to live the day three times, this being the last of them, and how useful the invisibility cloak and Dobby are for slipping under Dumbledore's net. He also explains his plan for Malfoy's incident in the previous chapter, how he coated the bone in herbs and spices, put a single drop of basilisk venom on the tip, and also put a subtle dark curse on the bone, though he admits it's pretty unlikely this would kill Dumbledore.

The next day, Luna catches Harry before breakfast and brings him to a secluded room to talk in private. Here she lays out her plan to kill Lucius Malfoy (and possibly Narcissa, Draco and maybe Sirius) to gain access to the Malfoy fortune (her mother was Lucius' sister), and marry Harry to keep the Malfoy/Black alliance going after dissolving Narcissa's wedding. As a side benefit, Draco would lose most of his status. Her being a ditzy Ravenclaw is a facade, to appear harmless so that Malfoy Senior doesn't make her an 'accident' like her mother, but Harry placing her under his protection put her on everyone's radar. He says he has to think about it, mostly unsure about the marriage part, then instantly agrees to everything and starts calling her wife, with a brief thought of regret towards Hermione (whom he had started grooming).

Luna notes this (apparently she reads body language with the best of sociopaths) and decides he will also need a mistress to show off his wealth. Harry thinks about a few things, like how Voldemort sacrificed his sexual organs in exchange for eternal youth and the weaknesses of immortality rituals. They keep discussing his social standing and his fame as the BWL, and Luna proposes a plan to discredit Voldemort in the pureblood circles by fabricating evidence of him having a muggle grandfather. Harry counters by telling her about Riddle's story, saying they can easily track down evidence connecting Riddle to his muggle origins. This makes Luna horny.

In the author notes, PL shits on what he thinks canon Harry Potter is about - I would go and read this, because it's quite interesting to see how deluded someone can be. Actually, I'll just paste it here.

  Author's Notes:

  One insane idea is good, but they get so much more interesting when they can bounce reflections off each other in kaleidoscopic arrays!

  Harry Potter is one of those universes where catastrophe gets piled upon disaster for the main character and the abuse never seems to stop. Most of the victories he gains are just to have one source of pain or another stop for a short amount of time.

  He is outnumbered, outclassed, not given space to maneuver, and those he counts as allies all turn on him to one degree or another: Dumbledore won't listen, Ron has gotten angry and/or jealous enough several times to cut lose their friendship, Hermione picks Ron over Harry, and Ginny is at best a minor character who has little impact, while all of the adults of their acquaintance are Dumbledore's servants first, and Harry's friends a distant second.

  That is a world that requires serious powerups on the side of Light just to stay even, and I find it both wonderfully refreshing, and desirable in every aspect to see it happen.

  Having Harry achieve something without getting hospitalized for weeks doing so is a wonderful change from the original material.

  Of course, I love to see the light triumphant in any universe.

Ok, let's start the +nitpicking+ thoughtful critique.

Already, we're seeing inconsistencies with how time travel works. We see Harry being worried about meeting his time doubles, when in previous chapters he literally waved at one. On the other hand, the concerns about paradoxes is waved off in the same sentence as being for Hermione's sake, so who knows if we're actually supposed to take it seriously or not.

Harry knows how to make a basilisk from Tom's memories, but I'm gonna bet we're never going to see Voldemort with a basilisk. Or mentions of him using a basilisk at all. Why isn't Nagini a basilisk?

The Dark Mark strips away any and all mental defences apparently. So either Snape is actually on Voldemort's side, or Voldie just didn't care. From chapter 7, Snape is confirmed to be on Voldemort's side and working against the Order, though Dumbledore keeps him around for vague nefarious reasons.

Voldemort knows about the Black Library through reading Regulus' mind, but doesn't know much about its contents since Reggie wasn't very studious. There is no mention of Bellatrix, Narcissa, or even of Walpurga here.

Parading with the Founders' artifacts is straight up moronic. They have been lost for centuries, so it should definitely make a big stir that they were found again. The diadem and the cup especially, since all it takes is someone selling the news to a newspaper for it to get to Voldemort, and at that point he would know that his horcruxes are compromised. Bellatrix would have been a problem too if word got out that Harry Potter had the cup that was supposedly taken by Voldemort from her vault, but apparently that's resolved by simply making her an idiot.

Ron's bashing continues and is now acknowledged by Harry and Hermione, but it's still more of a gradual shift towards excluding him from the group rather than Sasuke-tier 'castrate him and steal his eyes' kind of stuff. It's totally going to get there, it's just that without the time loop stuff things at least have to have a pretense of consequences mattering until the author has gaslighted the readers enough for them to accept it.

​

For some more general criticism, it's really tiring how preachy this fic is. It seems like half the writing is just Harry thinking about his plans, and there is way too much exposition geared towards the readers on aspects of the books the author doesn't like, or some headcanon he simply can't think of a way to insert in the narrative. Some are pretty interesting, like the tangent on Voldemort's immortality, but it's just so boring to read half a chapter every time of Harry thinking to himself rather than doing anything. Especially since he's constantly repeating himself.

Another thing that bothers me is the constant delaying of payoffs. Every time something happens, Harry will do something mysteriously that will be explained later in the chapter, or more commonly at the start of the next one. I would be fine with this constant guessing game if it was handled more like a mystery, but it doesn't work for two reasons: first, we spend so much time exploring Harry's thoughts that the constant censoring feels artificial; second, the consequences of his actions are so poorly connected with what he actually does that the whole thing, thinking with the benefit of hindsight, makes little sense. The second one is probably the worst - it's not something easy to catch on a first read, especially if someone isn't paying attention and is taking what the author writes at face value.

As an example, let's take his attack on Dumbledore through Malfoy. The action and the (supposed) payoff both happen in chapter 6: in the infirmary, Harry casts some spells on Draco and his goons, and later Dumbledore and the aurors are misled about the attack by the Colonel Sanders stuff, and in the confusion Dumbledore gets hit by basilisk venom and a subtler dark curse. The explanation on the other hand, is in the next chapter: he thinks about what he did and why he did it - the spices are a diversion for the venom, and the venom is itself a diversion for the curse. The Colonel Sanders stuff is to muddle the waters, introducing a fictional third player to which to attribute the attack to.

Why, it sounds positively smart of him! Such a multi-layered plan.

Now, this doesn't work on multiple levels. First off, by putting the explanation after the payoff, you make the reader mistake what the payoff actually is. Until I read the explanation, I thought the Colonel Sanders stuff was the bit to focus on, but instead the important part is the curse, which is only introduced in Harry's thoughts in the following chapter. Second, well, is Colonel Sanders. Malfoy got thrown off the train by some unnamed students, and then got mindfucked by Harry into believing the existance of a muggle dark lord. But the whole concept of it is so mind-bogglingly stupid that no one would believe it - think about it, a muggle and his two conspirators entered the train unnoticed by everyone, waited on it for hours (during which time the train was searched by Dementors, that muggles cannot see), and their only move was to pick three 14 years old kids and throw them off the train before vanishing into thin air. But apparently everyone is just that stupid. Third is, Harry's plan requires a very specific set of events that are pretty easy to derail - Dumbledore has to be nearby when Malfoy is awakened and close enough that he can be stabbed, absolutely nobody has to do anything while Draco's trashing around semi-delirious from the pain so that he isn't restrained. Crabbe and Goyle don't even factor into anything, despite a quick mention of them being there.

The whole plan could come down as soon as Dumbledore reads the minds of any student who was involved in it, and he's explicitly called out as routinely using legilimency on the staff at the very least. That would tell him Sanders isn't real, so he would be more suspicious of mindfuckery and Harry's objective of laying low would have backfired.

This fic is infuriating. If someone presented it to me as lowkey crack I would believe them. There are just parts of the narrative that simply don't make sense, and the author doesn't even care to explain. The most blatant being Malfoy and company being thrown off the train for laughing at Harry, and again Pomfrey waking them up by slapping them with a fish. It's like the author wants the fic to be taken seriously, except on those very specific parts (whether it's just something about Malfoy or a coincidence I don't know yet).

​

Let's give a parting shot. Why are goblins evil? Hagrid says they aren't 'friendly', and he loves all kinds of dangerous beasts like acromantulas and dragons, so it's obvious that goblins are the most evil creatures in the world. Flawless logic, as expected by PL.

Goblins aren't people in his mind, they are animals ruled by their urges. That explanation was honestly sickening to read.


** I applaud you and I don't know whether or not I hope you finish this. I certainly tried, but I couldn't make it past The part where PL decides Harry needs his own village or something and he spends what I remember as like 3 chapters mentally wanking about how awesome the village and its defenses would be. In particular, I remember multiple paragraphs on the warding of the doors an how Harry had thought of every possible way to break down a door and came up with the perfect countermeasure for each At that point, it stopped being funny and I just couldn't anymore. Best of luck(?) to you.
