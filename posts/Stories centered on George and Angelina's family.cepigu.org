I want it to be realistic. I.e., something like Fred and Roxanne having to deal with the classic, "But your family's white, how can you be so dark?" question or people going out of their way to be nice to 'the interracial couple' and such. But I know it's an uncommon request, so I'll take what I can get.

Thanks!


** This one is just about their grief but something about it has always seemed so real and poignant to me that I keep going back to the story. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12898088/1/Tired]])

** There was wonderful set of stories about NextGen kids including Molly Weasley II. (I believe) who was deaf, but she could see magic. It was very sad and very well written, but I couldn't find it any more.

*** It's called Pieces: A Story Cycle and it's one of my absolute favourite fics. I've not come across characterization of the next-generation that good in many other places. Here's the link, in case you want to read it again! linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8985993/1/]])

**** Right, and other things by Realmer06 are also excellent. “Pawn to C3”, “Charlie Weasley and the Reason Why Not”, and “Roses Trilogy” are some of the best works I have ever read (all on [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Realmer06/pseuds/Realmer06/works?fandom_id=136512&page=2][AO3]]).

*** I don't really think race is gonna be that big a deal for them tbh. The wizarding world is small enough and the Weasleys are famous enough that most people they encounter will already expect Fred and Roxanne to be mixed race and it's just kinda not the thing bigots focus on there.

  Post-DH George Weasley/Angelina Johnson, prompted by Rowling's saying of the pairing that "maybe it's a bit unhealthy, but I think that they would've been happy." A writing challenge if I ever saw one.

** I don't know the nationality of OP, but I'm American. I would be interested to know if this would even be an issue in Britain? I remember that about 8 years ago, I RP'd Kingsley and in researching his background, I found that there did not seem to be the same prejudices against the African British as there did for African Americans. At least if I recall, correctly someone told me that it was more likely that his family came over as immigrants rather than slaves and so the weight of the history was not the same.\\
Note, this was before Pottermore and knowing anything about the sacred 28 or whatever the list of Pureblood families was called.

*** Race in the UK is complicated, because there certainly IS racism towards black people here, but it's not handled as the same way as in the states.

The UK does have a history of slavery to contend with, but as we were mostly facilitators of the slave trade, rather than having large numbers of slaves here ourselves, we have been able to distance ourselves from it. I don't think this is a good thing, but it is a reality. We also have a long history of colonialism, and the relationship with our former colonies can be quite complex.

During the mid 20th century, there was a large recruitment drive where we specifically encouraged migrants from existing or former colonies - for black people specifically, it's worth looking into the Windrush generation. We're in this weird position in that we specifically asked these people income here, they helped build and support our NHS and contributed massively to our society, and now all of a sudden we are treating them like absolute shit to appease a small group of people apparently emboldened by Brexit.

Up until about the 80s, interracial relationships did face prejudice - my very old grandmother still says she "doesn't have a problem with it" but feels sorry for mixed race children because she believes they will be made fun of at school. It's extremely unusual to hear anything more than that. The film This Is England is a good example of how race relations used to be in this country.

In the past 30 years, racism in the UK has been more preoccupied with religion (guess!) and country of origin than skin colour, though black Brits do still have a problem with racial profiling. There is nowhere near the same level of police brutality you hear about from the US, but there are still many controversial policing issues surrounding race.

The UK, despite all this, remains as (I believe) the country with the highest rate of interracial marriages.

**** Thanks for this, it is very helpful. Indeed, when I was researching Kingsley I came across Windrush, but for whatever reason did not feel like what I found gave me a good grasp of how his father would have been treated or how that would have effected Kingsley. Harry makes no particular comments on race that I can remember.

***** I am not black so I don't want to speculate too much, but he would have almost certainly experienced some level of racism - certainly casual racism, and possibly more serious/dangerous incidents. However, it wasn't like everyone was racist - the Windrush generation did make their homes here and were commonly in roles that put them in close contact with the wider community. There are some incredibly inspiring stories from that era.
