:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find 2 fanfics that I read a while ago.

The first was a Oneshot that had WBWL, Ravenclaw Harry who had to find a way to beat Voldemort (or something along those lines). Harry and Daphne dated and then broke up because he got distant, he won, and the rest was just the ending I think.

The second was a story where students were forced to live in each others homes for half the summer each and Harry and Daphne got paired up.


** Is the first one linkao3(in the claw of the raven) I haven't read it, but it's the only ravenclaw!Harry/Daphne I know of.

  When a more studious Harry Potter enters Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming

*** I've not read the whole series, this one is pretty good though.

But no, this isn't it, the one I was asking for was a oneshot, or at least very short.

  You've heard the phrase, 'Walk a mile in their shoes.' Well how about living in them? For 36 days over the summer of 5th year, that's exactly what two students will be doing. Join Harry and Daphne as they experience the ups and downs of each others home lives, but will their time with each other affect them for better or for worse? Non-Can.
