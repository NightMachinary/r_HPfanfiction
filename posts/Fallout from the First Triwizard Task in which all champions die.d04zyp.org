What were they thinking, holding a damned /bloodsport/ in a school with teenage contestants? And the canon tournament /is/ a bloodsport thanks to the dragons in the very first task. The organisers' security measures amounted to dragon keepers on standby and /one/ nurse. It would hardly be enough to protect any of the champions; they simply wouldn't be fast enough to reach them in time in case of any lethal situations.

So, Cedric gets a face full of dragon flame instead of just being singed when the dragon ignores the transfigured dog, Krum gets trampled and crushed when his dragon goes on an agonized rampage, Fleur successfully enchants her dragon to sleep only to breathe in the fire when the dragon snores and cooks her lungs, and Harry breaks his back and neck on the Horntail's tail.

Morbid, yes, I know.

I'd like to see a story about the aftermath; news stories, trial records, investigation report, interviews with the audience, witness testimonies etc.

A lot of stories are present in which one champion or hostage (second task) dies, or several champions are badly, even permanently injured. Sometimes a dragon gets away and kills many audience members during its rampage. But I haven't read anything with this premise so any existing fics would also be welcome!


** Isn't Harry destined to be killed by Voldemort? Is he possessing a dragon? Cuz that would be awesome.

I think a story where Harry wins the Triwizard Tournament by virtue of going last would also be pretty good.

Really though, if the first three champions who are grown adults get toasted by lesser dragons, who really has the heart to send poor little Harry out to face a Norwegian Ridgeback?

At that point, if they were mandated to make the Champions go through trials, surely they'd have Harry face the model of his dragon instead.

The prophecy was worthless drivel; it only became relevant coz Voldemort, Dumbledore and then Harry tried to make it come true. It doesn't grant Harry any sort of immunity from death.

They were already using Harry as bait in the tournament and as a patsy to draw away any negative press. The organizers are quite heartless enough already. And Harry faced a Hungarian Horntail, not a Ridgeback.

**** I mean, every 'true' prophecy Trelawney has comes true. She's clearly in a trance, and it's clearly magical in nature. The only thing we have to the contrary is Dumbledore's word.

"They were already using Harry as bait in the tournament and as a patsy to draw away any negative press."

Since when?

"And Harry faced a Hungarian Horntail, not a Ridgeback."

Right, yes.

***** The prophecy is too vaguely worded to be of any use except in hindsight. There are far too many possibilities that can fit it. And anyway, it would /not/ mean Harry is immortal unless killed by Voldemort.

Why was Harry even in the Tournament when his entry is illegal. The Goblet couldn't have forced anything and Harry didn't want to be in it. It was Crouch who forced his entry and everyone else who agreed. And Harry was the perfect bait; a world-famous orphan with no one to speak for him in the magical world. Harry was the one to draw all the negative press; no one talked about inadequate safety measures on the Goblet or during the tasks. If it looks like a duck, walks and talks like it...

****** Just because a prophecy is not particularly useful, does not mean it is not inevitable. 'One must die at the hand of the other', and all that.

It seemed to be the consensus that due to the vague magical contract, he would have to compete. The schools were looking at it as a problem to be solved, not some marketing ploy. The only one who was enthusiastic was Bagman, Crouch had at that point been imperiused anyway.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10362319/13/Bolts-from-the-Blue]]

This chapter of a one-shots collection has the first task going /spectacularly/ wrong. The Hungarian Horntail gets loose and goes on a killing spree which gets Ron, Draco, a ton of other Hogwarts students, the entire Durmstrang contingent, several dragon handlers, most of Hogsmeade, the other three dragons...

Unfortunately, though, it's only the event itself that's covered in the one-shot, and there doesn't seem to be a second part with reactions.

*** There's another story where Harry and Hermione flee the country, the first task sees Cedric get almost completely burned by the Horntail only to be told he still has to compete. They originally blame Harry for the tournament going wrong but switch to the foreign schools later.

Is that the one you were thinking of? That's the second chapter, which has Cedric drawing the Horntail and being thoroughly burnt.
