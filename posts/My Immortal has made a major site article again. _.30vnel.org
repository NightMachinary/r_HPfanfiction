** I've always thought My Immortal was a hilarious bit of trolling. The angry reviews on fanfiction.net were almost as entertaining as the story itself.

** The link at the bottom, about how fanfiction is becoming popular, was even longer and more fascinating, in a 'so this is how uninitiated people see us' type of way.

***** ............... wtf

But...... you know this is a parody right from chapter 1, at least. What makes My Immortal what it is, is that the author was attempting to write a real story. Kind of. With sparkles, sex and lots of mascara.

And now that I read more of it, I did run into this fic before. His chainsaw-sword's name clued me in.

** Wow. I've been in the HP fandom for about 15 years, so how have I never heard of this apparently infamous fic before? Reading through the article, I suspect it's because it was posted after I stopped using FFN around 2002 when the quality started going to shit.

I've read fics by crappy, young authors before. None were as bad as the excerpts I'm seeing of this fic. It's got to be a troll.

** It was pretty in depth but I don't see the context of it, or why it was written. I guess it's nice to have all the info in one place.
