Harry travels to an AU. In this one Narcissa getting attracted to him. Whether she is married (and still makes avances to him) or not isnt important. Also if Harry is of Adolescence (age around end of Hogwarts) or more of an Adult, doesnt matter.


** Try With a Little Help from My Friends by Kinsfire. Narcissa nurses Harry back to health after he is captured and then repeatedly tortured by lucy and the other deatheaters. It's a Harry/Hermione/Narcissa story.
