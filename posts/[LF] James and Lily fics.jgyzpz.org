Hi, I need some fanfic recommendations!

​

Is there a fanfic where James and Lily are alive, but separated from Harry? Or does something happen to 'separate' them but over time they get closer again?

​

Or something similar! (For those who are interested, I have some of that kind! I'll list them for you!)
