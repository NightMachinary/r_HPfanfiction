Like, why the suffix â€˜-itus' to mean he's Harry's mentor?


** It is after the person who gave the challenge 'Severitus'.

** Huh. I thought it meant that Harry was secretly Snape and Lily's child and they used charms to make him look like James. Which is 5000x worse

**** I find that the Latin word that means servitor is quite literally "servitor". It comes from the verb "servio, servire" which means to help. Also, I haven't found "severitus" in any dictionary, with the closest word being "severiter", an adverbial form of "severus" which means serious, grave, and the like.

*** I had always thught it was Snape/Harry, I think because I woud look at the characters and obly see Harry and Snape mentioned. A relief it was when I had finally realised what it really meant.
