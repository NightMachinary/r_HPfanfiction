Looking for stories where Harry stays in a Muggle Orphanage, would rather it be for the entire story, but at the very least until Harry gets his Hogwarts letter, maybe then Dumbledore himself either goes to see Harry and see what happened or Dumbledore sends someone to see.

They can then proceed to get Harry out of the Muggle orphanage. (But only after Harry gets his Hogwarts letter). Would rather him not be adopted by anyone and have him stay in the orphanage until they realize where he is at least.

Would rather not have Harry be sorted into Slytherin, just because he's in a Muggle orphanage does not mean he is going to end up like Voldemort. If he is sorted into Slytherin then please let it not have so many cliches as Slytherin Harry tends to have, please!

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if a bunch of chapters I'm sure it's fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash

Time travel story. Baby Harry gets sent back in time and grows up in the same orphanage as Tom. Extremely AU, great writing and plot though. Hints of slash but kept very G rated since they are both kids.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

** linkffn(5402147) Suits your request, but it's so AU that Harry can almost be considered OC. He's a Ravenclaw.

One of the best Tom/Harry I've ever read.

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.

  Harry was proclaimed dead when he was two years old and ended up in an orphanage. But that was only the beginning of his journey. While trying to find his place in the world of magic, he never forgets those whom he views as family.

  Here's an interesting fact that I just made up. In a strange universe slightly disconnected from this one, Harry Potter was born premature on the 31st of July 1980. In this story, he wasn't. Born 27th of September 1980 this is a Harry Potter with no scar, new classmates, a sinister looking wand, and somehow he's got a strange diary belonging to T. M. Riddle.

** Seconding the rec for Death of Today, and Twist of Fate isn't so bad either. Both are pretty heavily AU, though.

Harry Potter & The Untitled Tome has what you want as well - linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10210053/]]). Grows up in an orphanage, ends up in Gryffindor, also pretty AU.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.
