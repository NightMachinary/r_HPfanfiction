I just finished it tonight and I thought it was really well written. I like how the author handled both of their characters and made the plot unique.


** Half-Blood Romantic is really the only fic in the fandom to do Harry/Fleur properly -- that is, it actually addresses the elephant in the room, Fleur's relationship with Bill, rather than just handwaving it away. I respect it for that and if anyone asked me to recommend a Harry/Fleur fic, it would be my go-to option.

Unfortunately, I remembered mid-way through reading it that I actually have no interest in romance. I like a light sprinkling of it as a component part of a general story, but as the central plotline? I get bored. The non-romance elements of Half-Blood Romantic just aren't substantial enough to keep me interested.

** I'm not a fan of infidelity or open relationships as a theme (unless the bad guy gets cheated on). Yes, it happens in real life, but that doesn't mean that I want to read about it.

It was a unique concept and original plot, but as the "relationship" progressed further and further, I found it less and less appealing. Fleur comes across as a Mary Sue. Also, I hate slowburn fics and Half Blood romantic definitely falls into that category.

To be fair, she's a Mary Sue in canon too - incredibly beautiful /and/ the most magically talented student in Beauxbatons. Which is why so many people like Harry paired with her - why settle for less than the best?

She's cheating on her fiance, so it's not like she doesn't have character flaws.

Considering her performance, that doesn't mean much, especially since the whole "Veela are bad in water" stuff in fanon and she is just 1/4 of the real deal. I mean, quite often the best of something is not enough to make it and therefore does not imply overall quality.

Because that would be more believable, especially considering how the common headcanons play out: Harry is the bestest lover ever, all men beside him are pigs, the whole schizophrenic "inner Veela" stuff, Veela mates and so on.

****** Well, negative consequences isn't really the same as something being presented as a flaw. Honestly, neither is the action being stated as wrong depending on presentation. I'm not sure if I'm getting this idea across properly.

Does is feel like the author wants us to judge the characters? Like, are Harry and Fleur supposed to be bad people for doing this, or are they just feeling guilty so as to make the romance even more dramatic and tragic?

There's a difference between a character saying "Oh darling, this is wrong but I just love you so much! Kiss me!" and saying "We're kind of assholes, aren't we?"

Like, is there some convoluted reason why Fleur can't just leave Bill that's written in to keep the plot on track (the "star crossed lovers separated by fate" route), or is Fleur just getting it on with Harry without leaving Bill as an act of unjustified selfishness?

I'm still not sure if I'm making what I'm trying to say clear.

Yes, we're supposed to be judging them for what they're doing. It's not overly critical, because this story is from the point of view of Harry and he eventually decides he loves her more than he cares about the consequences, but the story does not in any way try to portray their relationship as morally okay.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

There are two reasons. Fleur loves Bill and doesn't want to leave him and Harry knows that if Fleur cheats on Bill with him that will hurt his relationship with the Weasleys. You also have to remember that this is a very slow story. It's something like 120k words, but they've kissed exactly once. Harry only admitted his feelings to her in the second to last current chapter. It's not actually at the point where she would leave Bill.

At no point I got the impression that it was actually a bad idea. Yes, it would fuck with the Weasleys and probably mess up Harry's relationship with them, but I just don't see how it would hurt Fleur since her relationship with Bill feels dead, more like lip service on her part than any deeper feelings.

Harry and Bill would be hurt there, but Fleur could just shrug it off since she doesn't get along with most Weasleys either way and has few other ties in Britain.

No, but that's because we're reading from the point of view of the guy that's she's cheating with, who is aware that what they're doing is wrong. There's a reason the story takes a novel's length to get to any kind of explicit mention of their growing relationship.

Fleur has flaws in the story, which is actually something I think the author did well, but you have to acknowledge them yourself as the reader because Harry isn't really going to. The entire thing takes place completely from his point of view and he's falling in love with her and the more in love with her he gets the more he wants to ignore any mistakes she makes or any misgivings he has about anything they do, including things not directly related to romance that he knows he shouldn't do but does anyway.

I actually disagree about this. I think that while reading you have to remember that even though it's not told in first person, this story is completely from Harry's point of view and he's falling in love with her. She's definitely not perfect: she's cheating on her fiance, she's extremely arrogant, she incorrectly assumes things about people and meddles and is then shown to be wrong, and when Harry starts learning more powerful spells she sometimes loses their battles. All of these things are character flaws or imperfections that the reader can notice, but Harry won't point out because he's either charmed by them, is willing to ignore them in his love, or actively wants them to continue, like with her cheating.

You need to look farther than her beauty and her talent because those are literally the base of her character. She's introduced as a part veela beauty who is the most talented witch at her school.

**** I know that the narrator is biased, but even the part where Harry has yet to develop feelings for her doesn't really pay attention to her flaws, or rather her flaws are inconsequential, like the typical Sue. At no point do her flaws lead to real problems (at least for her). And the cheating part doesn't really carry many consequences for Fleur since she doesn't get along with any Brit besides Harry. If anything, Harry is affected badly by her flaws, but at the same time, the author ruined that effect by having the Ron/Hermione relationship which puts distance between them and Harry, who obviously has no interest in thrid-wheeling.

He definitely does pay more attention to her arrogance and assumptions about people in the earlier parts of the story. The first part of the story is him going to her and telling her that's she's wrong about the Weasleys and that's why they dislike her and he doesn't agree with what she says about Malfoy when they see him in Diagon Alley. Her actions have consequences for her, it's just not yet the kind of story where those consequences are physical. Her attitude makes people dislike her and she's already made decisions that are going to hurt her position in the war.

#+begin_quote
  And the cheating part doesn't really carry many consequences for Fleur since she doesn't get along with any Brit besides Harry.
#+end_quote

That really has nothing to do with whether or not it she's a Mary Sue. And while her cheating, when it's found out, will have worse consequences for Harry than her, she will face consequences. The obvious is that she's going to be despised by the only people in Britain she knows and her reputation will likely be hit hard. Seeing as her entire reason for coming to Britain was because she wanted to escape what she felt was a bad reputation, I wouldn't say that that is inconsequential.

#+begin_quote
  That is considered a flaw nowadays?
#+end_quote

It's an imperfection, which is a point against her being portrayed as a Mary Sue, which is why I mentioned it. She's reasonably talented and powerful, but people can get the better of her.
