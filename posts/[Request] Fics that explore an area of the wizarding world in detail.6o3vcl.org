For example, there's an excellent (abandoned) fic about a clock and watch maker. Linkffn(1724293)

The arithmancer linkffn(10070079) is, funnily enough, all about arithmancy. It's written by someone who has a maths degree so is rather technical, but still very readable.

I'm looking for more well written fics like this, maybe about wandmaking or runes. I don't mind if they are oneshots or multi chaptered.

The many fics about pureblood politics and Lordships aren't of much interest to me.

Thanks

  Ever think of the Weasleys' clock? A wizarding watchmaker makes friends with our favorite twins in an answer to the Great Mary Sue Problem. Rating is upped one, just to be safe.
