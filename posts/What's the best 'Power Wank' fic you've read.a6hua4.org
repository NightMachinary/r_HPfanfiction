There're always fics out there that it's easy to tell that it's just a way for the author to make them selves feel powerful, loved, rich, etc. These kind of fics usually crash and burn pretty quickly but after seeing a few of these it left me wondering "Are there any good ones out there?"

So that's what I ask you all. Ever read a "Power Wank" fic you thought was actually good? And since "good" is subjective try adding the reason you think is good. I do accept answers like "I have no idea why but I couldn't stop reading" :)


** There is "The Silent World of Cassandra Evans". It starts out edgy-dark (Vernon cuts out Fem!Harry's vocal cords) and the first year at Hogwarts is not great for her either (Fem!Harry gores the Mountain Troll's eyes with a switchblade, scaring Hermione off). Since she is mute, there is very little dialogue and a lot of exposition. The relationships, later on, move too quickly.

HOWEVER

Once you get to around chapter 8 it becomes a hilarious, cracky, fluffy and at times utterly adorable OPHarry story where the opposition gets a proper buggering, Harry gets a goblin forged scythe as a weapon and it subverts a great lot of tropes along the way. Fem!Harry is revealed to have a trueborn sister (while Lily was just an affair) and against the odds, they get along splendidly. Hermione makes a comeback (and gets together with the sister), they take a bunch of first years under their wing and become recognised as their own Hogwarts House. Also, there is not a single "I will not be controlled" moment.

**** Just keep in mind that the first few chapters are neither well written (due to the lack of dialogue) and are far darker than the remaining story.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

** Defiance by Dark Lord Slytherin linkffn(12516323) it starts as a classic indy!Harry with a dash of Dumbledore's bashing, and Most Ancient and Noble houses but it evolves at least in my opinion in a fascinating story that greatly expands the universe and has a lot of magical theory in it.

  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU. Powerful! Harry, Harry/Daphne.

** I utterly love linkffn(Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse), it's a relatively inventive take on it and it's got a solidly powerful Harry with some epic battles.

  At a young age, Harry becomes Death of the Apocalypse. Now he must find the other Riders while keeping his identity a secret while still attending Hogwarts. Features an independent Ravenclaw Harry, no Golden Trio, and an attempt to not bash characters. Book Two finished.

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!
