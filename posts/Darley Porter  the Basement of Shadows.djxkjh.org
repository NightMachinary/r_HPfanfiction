Follow the adventures of young spellcaster, Darley Porter, and her friends Harmony Ginger and Rowan Measley, as they solve the mystery of the shadowy chamber beneath their high school gym.

(If you are hoping for context, this is a substitution for the Harry Potter books found in a videogame. I just wanted to see if anyone here can make anything of it.)
