Both Harrys maternal and paternal grandparents are only mentioned fleetingly in the books. Sirius mentions the Potters at some point, and Petunia describes her parents relationship with Lily. Where are the Potter/Evans family in the books or in fanfiction? Is there any fanficiton taking their storylines further?


** There are many fanfics that show us Harry's paternal grandparents... The maternal ones, not so much. We don't even know the names of Lily and Petunia's parents.

If I'm not mistaken, James parents were cited by JK only after the end of the saga, and even today, the fanon prefers to use the characters Charlus Potter and Dorea Black as Harry's grandparents (they are in the family tree of House Black), about the grandparents in canon, Euphemia and Fleamont, they are usually ignored by the majority. JK didn't even bother to tell us what family Euphemia came from... Which is good for fanfiction, you can make up whatever you want about her family, she can be a McKinnon, Gaunt, Sayre, Weasley, Crouch, Moody, whatever people want, it's a shame that they don't use that, it seems that we are all very satisfied with the beautiful, gentle and cunning Dorea Black from the fanon.

I don't think JK ever mentioned them in the canon, for the simple fact that any of them were alive, Harry wouldn't have grown up abused and neglected by the Dursleys and this make Harry an orphan without any relatives in the wizarding world.

*** well a few fics that have charles and dorea as grandparents are written BEFORE we knew of fleamont and euphemia. charles and dorea are mentioned in the books afterall, and even mentioned as having a child late in life with them also being in the right range of life to be harry's grandparents, but we know they are at least related (makes me wonder what happened to the now unknown cousin to james)

*** They use charlus and dorea so ultra super powerful Hadrian can claim the black inheritance and get on up on the little ferret boy

**** Name Hadrian doesn't even make sense, it bothers me, if you want Harry to be the diminutive of something, it should be Harald, Harrold, Harrion, Harwyn, Harrison or something more like Harry than "Hadrian".

** I am still confused about “Strong Blood by CooLibrarian” linkffn(7211094) ... it is either very original and brilliant, or completely crazy and boring. Perhaps both?

  Harry and Dudley learn about their muggle grandparents, and the struggles they faced while facing challenges of their own. Rated M for serious issues.
