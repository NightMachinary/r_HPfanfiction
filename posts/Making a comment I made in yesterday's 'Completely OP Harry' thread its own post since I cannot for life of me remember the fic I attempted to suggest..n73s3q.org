:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Parameters: at least 10 years old. /Probably/ H/Hr.

What I remember, I think:

- Harry and Tom are literal gods that have been fighting since the beginning of time. I'm not positive, but I /think/ Harry also answered to a God.

- Harry was always stupidly powerful whose power was stagnant, while Tom started out with basically no power but could accumulate it over time.

- They'd be reborn each time Harry defeated Tom, but the story is set when Tom's steady rise has equaled Harry's and is about to surpass him while Harry freaked out about finding a way to stop it from happening.

- This one is even less remembered, but I /believe/ it had a standard 'love conquers all' ending with Harry falling in love unlocked his ability to grow in power.

Not a ton to go on I know, but it's been a /long/ time. If anyone could help out, that'd be lovely.

Edit: I FUCKING FOUND IT. The Eternal Wizard by Defender Paladin
