I don't pay for Pandora so every 4 hours it turns off to ask if I'm still listening, but I still listen to it to go to sleep with anyway. This morning (after 6ish hours) it wakes me by playing a song that A) shouldn't have been on that station, B) was /perfect/ for the fic I'm writing, C) 20 minutes before my alarm, and D) a song I've never heard of in my life, but I liked it. Just thought that was funny.
