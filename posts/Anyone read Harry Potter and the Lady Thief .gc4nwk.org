To those who have not read it:

Hermione gets framed for a crime she did not commit and expelled and fined heavily enough to ruin her life. Through Dumbledores meddling, she finds a new path in life. Rob the purebloods blind.

Overall decent story, fairly well written, although with a strong focus on romance as Harry follows Sirius advice on women while Hermione focus for now on other things.

Currently bit more than half way through.

Eventuell Harry/Hermione

*For those who have read it and the reason I made this post (Spoiler)*

Will Harry get a wake up call and mature or remain like this through out the story. From my perspective he is a creepy, jealous, insensitive prick that cares more about snogging than his girlfriend, with zero introspection that treats his "best female friend" like shit for years. Will he get better or is the Relationship just forced regardless?


** Yes eventually he grows up a lot. He even tries to be civil with many of his slytherin rivals. And yes he does eventually see Hermione with more appreciation. I do think all characters have a larger ego than in canon though. This is a slow burn but its one of the better original strory oriented HHR fics out there.

*** Great, thanks. I'll try it again.It just feels like watching a burning plane bound to crash right now. Hopefully Harry atleast gets rid of his glasses or stops creeping on everyone he sees soonish.

**** I wanted to avoid the "From the start, Harry is the perfect boyfriend and Hermione the perfect girlfriend" trope. Teenagers rarely are, after all. The pressure and stress from the war didn't help, of course.

So, both of them make mistakes and have to grow up before they're ready for a lasting relationship. But they do grow up - and Harry learns with each relationship.

***** Let me preface this with saying that I really like your story. It's a great idea and wonderfully executed. My main gripe is really only with the Harry/Hermione dynamic. And my view is definitively tainted by how much I hate the way Harry used his glasses to spy on everyone.

But, From Parvati, Harry really learned the wrong thing and treated Ginny poorly, especially with blaming her. Of course the stress is a big factor here. However, I wish by now he made the realization and apologized properly (only at Chapter 44 now, Fake ambush at Longbottem)

Afterwards he jumped into the mess of a relationship with Romilda that was doomed to fail. Atleast he learned that there is more to a relationship than physical and he did apologize.

Next there are the interaction between him and Hermione. Harry is patronizing, often downright insults her, yet also has the gall to act jealous. Of course Hermione is acting, but he outright disrespects her because she is a secretary. And then is arrogant enough to think Hermione should come to him so he can date her out of pity (after all, she does not know how to behave, dress, and is just a poor secretary)

Both sides obviously have feelings for each other, but I'd have frankly expected Hermione to call out Harrys bullshit and disrespect. He doesnt even care enough to recognize how disrespectful and insulting he acts. Even if his action are out of course obliviousness and not malice, Hermione should not be just taking it. Even feelings mellow out after a while.

I understand the intent, but my own Interpretation of what is written does not seem to support Hermione feelings. Although obviously existant, they don't feel justified.

Again, this is purely how I personally am reading the portrayed relationship as of right now. Thanks for writing the story and commenting.

****** Well, from Parvati, Harry learned that he shouldn't let his girlfriend make him choose between his friends and her - which is a good lesson. However, he overcompensated, and when Ginny, quite justified, wanted more time with just him instead of just "snogging time", he thought she was doing the same as Parvati. Romilda taught him that he needed an equal partner, and Daria made him realise that he wanted a relationship, not just casual sex.

Hermione, of course, was jealous as well - from the start. Her antics in disguise at the ball didn't help Harry's relationship with Parvati. She doesn't call out his bullshit since she feels that's her own fault if she deliberately dresses badly and acts like a Klutz.

** Wait. Is this a Harry Bashing fic? I have come across it before and found that it was well written from the little I have read. I just couldn't get into the premise but I was thinking of picking it back up since I have nothing better to do.

*** It's not intended to be one.

I'd even admit that my opinion of Harry in this fic won't be the most popular one, but I do think it's a reasonable characterization of Harry.

But frankly, that's the only negative aspect and it's up to readers Interpretation. It's definitly worth the read.

** Hermione is the main character in the story and she must look good comparing to Harry. As result Harry is nothing but a macho with muscles in it. By the end of the story he also loses all self respect, because the girl has to get her prize boy.
