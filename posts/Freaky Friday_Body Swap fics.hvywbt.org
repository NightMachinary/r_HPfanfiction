Has anyone come across fic with a body/mind swap like in Freaky Friday? I prefer Harry/Draco or Hermione/Draco but really any pairing would satisfy me.


** A Freaky Friday more in line with the movie would be a Hermione & Rose swap. Were Rose has to do Minister of Magic shit, and Hermione has to do Quidditch.
