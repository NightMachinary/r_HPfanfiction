Like the title suggests, I'm looking for fics that have Harry being raised by the Weasleys, such as [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/Like-a-Red-Headed-Stepchild][Like a Red Headed Stepchild]] or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18890965/chapters/44840728][The Extra Weasley]]. It could either be that he gets taken in when he's young or leaves the Dursleys to be with the Weasleys after First Year, it doesn't matter.
