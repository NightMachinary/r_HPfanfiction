I thinking about writing about a Fem! Harry Potter (Jade Potter) x Susan Bones, but I'm having trouble writing where they meet. Like, do they meet on the train when they first go to Hogwarts and thus influencing Jade to go into Hufflepuff with Susan? Are they aged up and things stay the same as typed from above, Does Jade's Adventures's still staying the same as in canon? I know I still have the final say in what goes and everything, and if anyone has any advice on what to do let me know.


** Maybe they should meet in the entrance hall, or at Madam Malkins like Susan's there instead of Draco.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

*** I would say the first one. Fairly lemonish,. I would like to have a plot in it, so it's not all Lemon Without Plot.
