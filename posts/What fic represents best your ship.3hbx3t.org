I'm looking for that one fic that you'd use to convince someone that your ship is the One True Pairing to love and follow.

EDIT: Really? No H/Ginny? No H/Luna? No H/Tonks? No H/Giant Squid?


** Wastelands of Time features a magic flying battleship. I would probably enjoy living in a refitted version of it. Heck, I've got my eye on a couple houseboats right now.

But as for what you are really asking for, I haven't found /any/ decent HrHr fics. I might have to write my own.

I mean, you've got the smartest person in the school, the most dedicated, and all around awesomest, and who's around that can match her? An accident with the time-turner and you've got your answer right there.

I'm less in it for the self-smut. It's more that, usually, adding in another character of similar intelligence would diminish Hermione's portrayed intelligence, and I like reading about intelligent characters.

** As a Harry/Fleur shipper, it is rather....difficult, to say the least, to find a fic that supports this ship well. I have always loved the idea of Harry and Fleur together, not as a harem story or having Fleur as some bimbo sex crazed woman, but I see Fleur as being the right person to really bring Harry out of his shell and help him get over his fears, and abuse from the Dursleys'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters]] Letters is a good fic to start if one is interested in the H/F ship. I find it fun to read from time to time and Fleur is well written in here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/1/When-a-Veela-Cries]] Now this fic, I believe, is the best H/F fic out there. Granted it is VERY AU, however it is well written, the relationship between Harry and Fleur develops nicely and the author makes their relationship a good focal point without it being overly cliched and cheesy. The relationships that Harry has with Gabrielle is cute and funny, and Harry's struggle to keep the dark from possessing him provides good drama to this fic. While in this fic Fleur is not being sidelined, as many H/F fics have her do, nor is she being portrayed as a damsel that uses her sex magic to make Harry super powerful, also as some H/F fics make her out to be, she is actively fighting alongside the Order and she is searching for a way to remove the Horcrux from Harry. So far I have not read a fic that makes me happier to be a H/F shipper as this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8135514/1/His-Angel]] This one is my guilty pleasure, so to speak. It is the only H/F fanfic I know that is really really long, full of fluff and nice romantic moments between Harry and Fleur, some emotional angst, and has an interesting plot. Granted it may not be for everyone, there is some bashing of Hermione, Ron, and Molly, but overall it is a good romantic fic, in my opinion.

I gave it like three tries, even with the substandard writing. I just never could get past the Molly bashing.

I never even understood Molly bashing. She's a genuinely nice woman in cannon! Why people gotta be so down on one of the nicest (if misguided) woman in the entire series?

*** I came across this discussion tonight (I was bored and decided to kill time googling stupid stuff, like my story). Just wanted to say thank you for the comments. I've tried to stay away from most of the cliches that litter this pairing precisely because it's boring to read them.

Emerald Guardian - it'll be completed! I have two chapters left after the one I'm working on now for Part III. Then the resolution in part IV. So it'll be finished sooner rather than later.

Makinga... - I got a good laugh from your post. Funny thing is, Endless7 and I have conversed quite a few times. He even asked me to give that story a read and give him some feedback, but I never made the link you did. Interesting. BTW, I hope to have the next chapter out in a couple weeks to a month.

As to the question at hand: for Harry/Fleur, it's difficult. Letters is a great story, well written and fleshed out rather nicely, but Fleur feels a little too trivialized by the introduction of Daphne. The Lie I've lived is great, and Hat is brilliant, but Harry basically gets a Powerboost in an unusual way to make the relationship work. My fic's so AU, and I've built so much backstory to Veela, that while Fleur may still represent Canon Fleur, I don't think it's a fair representation of H/F as we commonly would enjoy it. Perspicacity's Dagger and Rose is also a very dark, very AU story where Harry is quite a bit different after a few things happen to him.

I'm trying to think through some other H/F fics, but can't come up with anything worth mentioning. I guess, if I had to pic anything, it'd be the first 5-10 chapters of The PRice of Being Noble. Not that I enjoy all the cliches and bashing, but there's an innocent sweetness in the relationship that resonates well (of course, there's also a harem, but I still like the Harry/Fleur element of it).

** I'll speak to the unspoken-

Harry/Ginny - there are many versions of this as it has the weight of canon behind it, but two stories come to mind when I think of the pairing: This Means War and the Refiner's Fire. The first is mostly comedy but it gives Ginny the spotlight she deserved. The latter is actually a better example of Harry/Muggle OFC, but that's only the prelude to the power-up that becomes the epic.

A third example would be Northumbrian's collection, its flagship story being Strangers at Drakeshaugh - this isn't Harry/Ginny so much as an ode to canon altogether.

For Harry/Luna, the tragic truth is that the gold standard hasn't been written. The closest to my mind is Browncoat, Green Eyes, which only honors the Harry/Luna relationship long after it's over.

The watermark of Harry/Tonks is HP and the Summer of Change. This somewhat dated and cliche-ridden action story nonetheless delivers the baseline Harry/Tonks dynamic: she's a bit foolish for her age while he's prematurely aged by his travails. Tonks steps into Harry's life to enable his departure from common school education and puts him in the magical special forces, as befits the hero he was up until the 5th book.

Each of these has a place in my heart as the ships I'd rather watch sail.

*** If you want to represent Harry/Ginny, there are so many better stories to choose from than Jeconais and Abraxan. Lets see.....

There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/386600/Deadwoodpecker][Deadwoodpecker]], all of whose stories are really awesome, and she captures Ginny's canon personality perfectly. She's probably my favorite author in the fandom.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][Little0bird's]] canon compliant tales complement Northumbrian's really well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4130255/1/Phantom-Limb][Phantom Limb]] is one of the best written stories in the fandom, and Harry and Ginny's relationship is portrayed extremely well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5189189/1/The-World-I-Leave-Behind][The World I Leave Behind]] is a bit on the angstier side, but it has some really interesting twists and turns, and some excellent action scenes.

Cwarbeck's romantic comedies [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=128876][Win a Date with Ginny Weasley]] and [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=128176][Advice for the Lovelorn Masses]] are both really good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] has the best characterization of Ginny ever, in fact it has one of the best characterizations of any fanfiction character ever, period. It isn't Harry/Ginny yet, but the relationship will be explored in the sequel and I am sure it will be awesome.

** I think it's a bit disingenuous to say that no other pairings should be loved/followed, but I really am a Hermione/Snape 'shipper. /HMS Prudence and Potions/, ftw!

I know a lot of people hate Snape, and cannot abide him in a romantic context. I know I couldn't see him in a romantic context... until I read [[http://www.witchfics.org/fr/][The Fire and The Rose]] by Abby and Anne (now going by Domina, apparently?), which opened my eyes to how much Hermione and Severus really do have in common and lets the romance and /ahem/ tension between them blossom organically without sending either of them into OOC-land. It's still my favourite 'fic for introducing others to the 'ship, and I reread it pretty regularly.

There are others that are fantastic as well, but that's the /one fic/ you asked for, OP. :)

** It's very difficult to decide on just one story, but if I had to for the Harry/Hermione ship it'd be linkffn(Vox Corporis). It was written before the release of Deathly Hallows, when Harry/Hermione shippers were still 'delusional' and intent on sinking with the ship. It has many of the Harry/Hermione tropes such as summer with the Grangers, friends-to-lovers, and will-they-won't-they shenanigans. Ron is still likable in this story and it isn't heavy on any sort of bashing. Romance is a very important aspect of the story, but it isn't all-consuming -- Harry still has to deal with Voldemort and does so pretty well. Some potential turn-offs in this story include a mature scene very early on, and the author admits to preferring many elements of movie canon.

Edit: sorry, couldn't limit myself to just one rec. A main reason being that Harry/Hermione stories are roughly split into several types:

- Stories written pre-HBP. These authors probably genuinely believed that Harry and Hermione would end up as the pairing. Examples include Lori's [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lori/TPOU.html][Paradigm of Uncertainty]], written during the three-year summer between GoF and OotP, and a personal favourite, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4098039/1][Harry Potter and the Fifth Element]]. It was written prior to HBP but incorporates a lot of elements from that book, due to the sheer amount of time (~9 years) the author took to finish the story.

After HBP and DH, many HHr shippers either became disillusioned with Rowling's writing or jumped ship, leaving maybe three types of writers who dealt with canon in their own ways:

- Retconning canon: these authors might have been disappointed with Rowling's treatment of Harry and Hermione or simply trying to write a different story using canon as a starting point. Retconning can begin as early as Harry's childhood (many of robst's works) and as late as the time Harry and Hermione spent in the tent during the Horcrux Hunt -- some of these stories may have been influenced by Steve Kloves' choice to add the dance scene. These stories also often use time-travelling. Well-written examples include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]] and chem prof's stories: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867175/1/Notebooks-and-Letters][Notebooks and Letters]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636819/1/Soul-Searching][Soul Searching]].

One danger of retconning canon is an author's belief that they know better than Rowling. This has often been pointed out to be the issue in the ever-popular HPMoR. However, this is also a problem when authors decide to overly bash on characters, mostly the Weasleys and Dumbledore. Examples of retconning gone too far would be, in my opinion, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4605681/1/The-Real-Us][The Real Us by Seel'vor]] and just about all of robst's works.

- Another type of post-HBP/DH story is the EWE? story. EWE for Epilogue? What Epilogue? and is characterised by authors writing a love story between Harry and Hermione as adults, generally ignoring the epilogue or even the canon ships. My favourite stories of this type include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late][Coming Back Late by alchymie]] and [[https://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6773][Life N.E.W.T.S]], one of several similar stories on Portkey. Honourable mention to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4418163/1/Fulfilling-Obligations][Fulfilling Obligations]], which I found a pretty good read but doesn't really show off the Harry/Hermione ship much.

- A special case of EWE fic I suppose I should mention is the affair fic. Considering Harry/Hermione is a ship built more on trust and shared experiences, reducing the pairing to just attraction feels like it doesn't do them justice. Although many stories are guilty of doing the same, affair stories seem to be the worst offenders. Nevertheless, there are still many great affair!fics, an example being [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister][Unlike a Sister by madharmony]].

- Finally, perhaps the vastest collection of Harry/Hermione stories: the Alternate Universes. Canon ships thrown to the wind while authors write dark!HHr, Ravenclaw!HHr, or even Fem!Harry. As OP asks for stories that can showcase the ship, I'd have to forgo many of these story recommendations simply because many AUs also portray characters as very different from their canon selves, thus some Harry/Hermione stories in AU might resemble Draco/Hermione or James/Lily or RavenclawMale/RavenclawFemale more. Some of my favourite AUs that I think still do justice to the HHr ship include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks by lorien829]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Unsung Hero by MeghanReviews]]. And I can't resist also linking Hogwarts Battle School, though I'm sure much of the sub is familiar with that story already.

I feel like the best-written pieces are definitely one-shots -- it's impossible for an author to put as much effort into every line and paragraph in a novel-length story as a 3000 word short story.

If H/Hr shippers spent more time actually building the H/Hr relationship than trying to put down the Weasleys for stupid reasons, may be there would be a handful of decent stories that could be read by those not drinking the H/Hr Kool-aid.

***** In the same interview-that-shall-not-be-named, Rowling also admitted her frustration at us H/Hr shippers who butcher Ron's personality or just hate him. I think the problem of bashing was present even in the earlier fics, mostly of Ron because he really is an obstacle to Harry/Hermione -- his canon characterisation would also react to that pairing harshly. And fanfic authors aren't known for realistic conflict resolutions, so bashing Ron usually ends up as the easy way out.

To be fair, that logic should be applied to more than just a minority of H/Hr writers. The Weasleys get bashed unnecessarily in a shit ton of fics for little to no reason at all by multiple authors. Most of them don't write H/Hr and just hate the characters.

It's far from a minority. Incompetent writers will always exist (though they're rarely as popular as Robst), but it is the fact that Weasley bashing exists even in those fics which are considered to be the best H/Hr stories that damns the ship.

Er. No, it doesn't. While Weasley bashing is present in other stories, there it is genuinely in the minority, and it is generally the badly written stories by incompetent authors that have Weasley bashing. Here, even otherwise well written stories (see again: Coming Back Late, Fifth Element, Temporal Beacon) stink up the joint by bashing the Weasleys.

********* Try reading Harry/Daphne, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Tonks or Drarry fanfiction. It's very prominent there and they're some of the most popular pairings in the fanfiction community. In fact the first time I looked for Harry/Daphne pairings on ff.net was back in 2012 and literally /every/ fic of that pairing had Weasley bashing of some kind.

But it's not just limited to Harry/any other non-canon girl. I've legitimately seen Harry/Ginny stories where every other Weasley character is bashed as well, usually by the lazy plot device of a mass betrayal or jealousy because of his fame/wealth etc.

I am not sure why you can't see the point here. The OP was naming the very best of H/Hr fanfics, /and even most of those contained Weasley Bashing/. That should tell you something.

  Unsung Hero by MeghanReviews

This one's functionally an OC, since he has no personality traits or background in common with any plausible Harry Potter. There's this paragraph:

#+begin_quote
  A month ago had seen the Potter twins turn seventeen and become legal adult wizards. Except they still couldn't drink firewhiskey. Only Harry had taken advantage of the change in their station and gone to acquire an Apparition, Side-Along Apparition, Portkey Creation/Removal, and Spell Creation license from the Ministry of Magic. While he was at it, Harry had also gone and bought a Floo Network Express Lane Pass. He'd paid for the licenses and the pass with the pocket money he'd been able to scrounge up for the last few years. His parents never gave him any galleons of his own.
#+end_quote

One gets the distinct impression that the author typed that out with one hand, ifyouknowwhatImean. Really makes you feel sad for the poor, neglected +Gary+ Harry.

And, of course, the author never wastes an opportunity to mention just how Scholarly this +Gary+ Harry is, especially how he is so much more knowledgeable than and gets better grades than Hermione in particular. It brings a tear to my eye.

With all due respect, that's a huge understatement. He is basically an amalgamation of Gary Stu tropes, and the only things he has in common with his canon namesake is the crappy childhood, the lightning-shaped scar. and Quiddich Seeking. In most ways that matter to the story, he is the very opposite of canon Harry. Consider that this fic's "Harry" is more subtle and ambitious than any Slytherin, harder-working than any Hufflepuff, cleverer than any Ravenclaw; none of which canon Harry is even close to being. On the other hand, canon Harry is braver than any Gryffindor, which this fic's "Harry" isn't.

More generally, this fic fits the all too common elevate-Harry/degrade-Hermione pattern for that 'ship, though not as badly as many others.

Harry/Tonks:

Hands down, best Harry/Tonks I've ever read. It made me fall in love with the ship. Sadly it's not complete, but there's still so much to read that I think it's worth it.

Harry/Fleur:

Also not complete, but the ONLY Harry/Fleur story I've ever enjoyed. There's also a bit of Harry/Luna interaction that is just too sweet to pass up. I highly recommend this one.

** My main pairing has always been Harry/Fleur, but lets be honest-that's a ship that needs some real delicate work. As was said on DLP, it is THE SHIP THAT NEVER SAILED. Except is has. Kinda. On like two voyages. It's in dry dock right now.

That said, my secondary pairing is Harry/Tonks, and the fic that /immediately/ comes to mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade Cause]].

So let me gush a little bit. This is quite possibly my favorite fic of all time. It's a toss up between Renegade Cause and Prince Of the Dark Kingdom. I think RC is much better plotted, has a better romance, and an extremely original take on new magic. PoTDK has better world building, wonderful characterization, and hands down the /best/ Voldemort in fanfiction. They're neck and neck, and I don't know which comes out on top.

Anyway, back to why this fic should be considered the best example of H/T: Both characters are extremely fleshed out without being really OOC. Even when they're OOC, the reasoning makes sense and the characters generally feel like their cannon selves, if forced into the situations they're in. The plot is /incredible/. You really get the feeling the author took the time to write out a timeline of what would happen from beginning to end, and it all ends up making sense. The romance is integral to the story, without taking over the entire fic. The characters are fleshed out and change throughout the fic, making for very interesting character development.

** My favorite ship alternates between dramione and snamione, depending on my mood.

For dramione I can't say I have a favourite fic although. When it comes to redeeming Draco after the events of the books (sans epilogue) I think linkffn(the die by colubrina) is my favourite, but I also really like the ones where they fall in love earlier and most of their public interactions are just an act on both sides, hiding their relationship for both their safety.

With snamione I tend to gravitate towards the darker fics, either set during the war with hermione becoming a spy (too) like linkffn(when a lioness fights) or after the war with them healing eachother's emotional scars.

** There are so few Hermione/Luna fics, especially ones that portray the ship with reasonable build up. But here are some stories that I think are pretty great (and converted me to loving HG/LL so much).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/305418][Abductive Reasoning by sable_tyger/lupinely]]

This is probably a good place to start. It's short but has a well thought out development for how the relationship could start. Fair warning, though: This has background HP/RW.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2573990][Crazy Little Things by dreiser]]

No brainer. This is probably the most well developed HG/LL fic out there. It builds up the characters and their relationship throughout the story, weaving the main plot and subplots beautifully.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/25270][Hermione Granger and the Amazing Outfits of Luna Lovegood by likeadeuce]]

Unlike the first two links which are set after the war, this one is set during Hogwarts. It shows a lovely contrast between Hermione's no-nonsense attitude with Luna's free spiritedness, and how their respective outlooks clash and complement each other.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/970216][Snapshots in Serendipity by airamcg]]

Another Missing Scenes fic of how Hermione and Luna could possibly have developed a romantic friendship during their school years. More canon-compliant than Amazing Outfits (if that's your thing), and has the bonus of also showing the story from Luna's POV since all of the other links I gave so far are from Hermione's POV.

EDIT: I forgot to finish a sentence up there.

** A bit late to the party on this post. However when you talk about ships and pairings, I honestly believe that the typical pairings don't work that well when you are trying to tell a good story. While admittedly I feel that in the canon world, Hermione would be the closest to a real romance Harry could have had, it leaves a lot to be desired. Although perhaps I should start with what I love to see in stories.

I don't want a story to have a pairing or love interest just for the sake of a character getting a happy ending. I like looking at the darker more adult side of the Harry Potter universe that a lot of people didn't get to see, and it was only alluded to.

With this said, I feel that a well made OC or a relatively blank slate of a character is one of the best ways to go in regards to forming a romance with Harry. The most exciting stories and romances I have seen are those that are often in conflict. Perhaps they have drastically opposing ideals and beliefs, and they are forced to find common ground.

Although throughout this the romance shouldn't BE the story. It should help enhance the story. An example story off the top of my head would be something like this, and it can be vague, it can be whenever, but lets start small.

Harry shortly after his trip to Diagon Alley on the train has recently had a visit from Ron, and Malfoy. In walks X girl. The introductions kick off. Ron says Slytherin's are dark. Girl remarks that a Gryffindor got her mother killed.

Harry's views are changed from canon. Moving forward Harry's choice to be in Gryffindor opposes his new found friend's Slytherin home. Yet the friendship remains.

Over the years their ideals clash. Keep the stone? Destroy it? Burn the book? Find out how it was made?

But then they can come together under dire circumstances, such as saving Sirius. However it doesn't change their relationship a day later which is them constantly being at odds.

As they continue to grow a romance develops between them, but one character is obviously on the light side of things, and the other the dark.

Then you can explore things such as the light going dark to save the darker, or the dark going light to save the lighter. Or perhaps one suggests something outside of their moral bounds, only to be shot down by the one that typically resides there.

Sadly none of the pairings in the Harry Potter universe really showcased a relationship like this. Although you could very easily make a story that likens Harry's future to that of Merlin's future. And then this love interest is his Morgana. The darkness to his light, the hatred to his love. The idea that he wants to save her before she goes too far, but perhaps she is already too far gone?

** The single fic that probably best represents the Hermione/Bellatrix insanity is linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds). A lot of people say that These Gilded Chains We Wear is the one to go to if you want Bellamione, but I honestly think it works far better as a ship if both Hermione and Bellatrix are somehow the same age (or even similar ages). Also, THAW is a slow-burn type of romance, and that's how the author got the ship to work in a realistic manner; it honestly wouldn't do to have two seemingly opposed personalities suddenly fall in love.

However, another significant factor in my decision is that THAW explores the canon!adult!Bella/student!Hermione side of the coin that is the basis of many other Bellamione fics. It shows plainly how the ship DOES NOT WORK in that context. There is very little in common at those respective stages of each character's life.

As for Ron/Hermione, which is (despite being a canon coupling) a somewhat rare ship in the fandom, I think nothing exemplifies it better than linkffn(Ron El Greco). It shows them probably in their mid-20s, I'd guess, with baby Rose as a plot point, but it's a near-perfect depiction of what they're like as a young married couple in that most of the books' character dynamics are preserved, with a fair bit of maturing on Ron's part. It's not a romance fic at all, really, and its central character is Ron, but it shows them as a couple. And a damn fine couple at that.
