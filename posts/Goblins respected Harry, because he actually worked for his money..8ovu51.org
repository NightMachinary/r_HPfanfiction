Looking for a fic where the only thing I can remember is that Harry might have had an inheritance, but he made his own money, because he couldn't access it. The goblins had some respect for him, because he didn't simple get money given to him.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Do you perhaps want a ...a...a wish fulfilment, budding necromancer, has sex with every fucking one and is long as hell fic?

Warning when I say everyone I mean everyone as in from amelia bones to perenelle flame.(also include women like bellatrix and narcissa.) Anyways for what you want it's an underlying tone of the fic, as in Harry works his necromancer skills creates a market and then earns the gold.

*** Noooo. The only thing that stood out in the story that i'm thinking of is that Harry actually stood on his own two feet. He earned his money, not inherited it. Where did necromancer even come from?!?

**** I mean while he did inherit something's most of his earning is based on the market he created.

And well what you asked for is like an underlying tone of a story that needs to supported by the plot itself. I mean I don't know if a story could be based around what you want itself.

No offence to writers if someone can do it, this is just what I think. And well I've never written a story in my life.

***** Trust me, i've read good stories based around just that. Also If I read a multi-million word story about necromancy i'd probably remember it. The largest story to date that i've read is Legacy(Naruto story), and I definitely remember that years after reading it. The whole sex slave thing that I saw highlighted has definitely put me off it. Thanks for trying anyway, but this seems frankly like a horrible story. Especially since it's nearing 3+million words, and yet is only on the third book, with such horrible tropes to boot, yeah...nope.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

****** Oh its most definitely horrible lel. But it was the only one where he actually earned it. Well except for linkffn(Core Threads) have you read that? It's some what basically Harry creates something sells it makes deals with goblin and none of them is because he has gold which may or may not exist in his vault.
