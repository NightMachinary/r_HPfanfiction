Is there any fanfic where James and Lily had a secret second child (either older or younger than Harry) who was unknown to the larger Wizarding World (including Harry) except for a few? (like Sirius, Remus and Dumbledore.) Maybe Harry and that child become friends before they discover the truth during their Hogwarts years or something like that...


** There was a fic where ginny was a potter.

Only 1 thing left to do...

Sweet home alabama.

**** [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister/_build/html/index.html]] but I am in the middle of complete rewrite as a screenplay ([[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister/brother_and_sister.temp.html]]). It will be much less chatty, and some unnecessary characters will be omitted.

** That'd mean he wouldn't have to continue living with the Dursleys because his sibling could maintain the blood protection. Hell, with the sibling being a closer relative and (eventually) regarding Harry as his own flesh and blood the blood protection could become stronger (expelling the "scarcrux"? Or even destroying all the horcruxes using the link of the "scarcrux"?).

** I read a Naruto/Harry Potter crossover where Lily had become an egg donor before having Harry and donated out of country so she wouldn't run into the kid, so Harry's half brother was Gaara of the Sand (green eyes, red hair). It's set at a point where Gaara is desperate to connect with other people and learns he has a genetic half brother out there. The writing is actually pretty good.

  Gaara and Harry would both move mountains for their precious people. Little wonder they're related. Look out, Wizarding World, the Kazekage is coming, and the Desert follows in his footsteps! Post Fourth Shinobi War. Grey!Harry. No Slash.
