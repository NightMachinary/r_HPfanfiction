any as long as long as it's following canon events, well written and I don't mind romance but not as the centre point of the plot.


** Self-insert fics don't get posted often on this subreddit (unsure if it's a lack of quality SIs in the fandom or just everyone's taste), but the high water mark for me is linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff). Female SI during canon years, but she's only tangentially related to the plot and tries to avoid it where possible. Very funny and a good exploration of how a SI would treat their time at Hogwarts.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.
