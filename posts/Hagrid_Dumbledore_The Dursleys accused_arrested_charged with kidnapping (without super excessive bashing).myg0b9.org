Basically, a headmaster, even if he's also whatever the Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump entail, doesn't really have the right to decide where a child should be raised, especially not by leaving them on the doorstop with a letter.

I don't really care if he or others go to prison or azkaban, I just want it pointed out that this wasn't ok? Also from the Dursley side of things, eventually someone is going to question the fact that they just had a kid appear out of nowhere, and want some form of documentation, a birth certificate at the very least, any sort of proof that the Dursley's actually have any sort of right to be considered Harry's guardians, especially since he wasn't born to them, I cannot imagine just suddenly being like, alright I have a kid now, will just go through life with 0 paper trail.

Who knows, maybe Dumbledore magic'ed up some papers and included those in the letter, but I still think from an investigative stand point, just, So you woke up one day, with a baby on your doorstep, with a letter saying it was your nephew and you never tried to confirm this, you didn't take the child to the hospital, call any sort of child welfare authority, how do you then enroll the child in school? How do you get child benefits for the kid?

That said, I'd prefer no fics that are like 'Dumbledore has been feeding Harry 147 different Unsmart Potions, Loyalty Potions, and Magic Blocking Potions and now that Harry's free from them he's the smartest person *in the Universe*', but everything else goes?
