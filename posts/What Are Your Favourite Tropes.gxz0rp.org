I've been reading a lot of time travel AUs and Severitus lately. If it's time travel or dimension hopping, LGBT relationships, psychological drama, horror/thriller, crossovers, etc, I'll read it.


** Triwizard tournament where Harry works hard and really is talented enough to compete in the tournament.

I would like it even more if most of them didn't involve Ron bashing. Even if they don't bash Ron, they still do their falling apart the same way as the books or worse. Is it so hard to write Ron as supportive? Really? I've only found one fic where that doesn't happen. But in that, there was no age line and both Ron and Harry put their name. And Harry was the only Hogwarts champion(also a trope I like, but sadly, it's almost non-existent).

*** Ooh, yes. I've never liked that Harry was thrown into such life-threatening situations as a child, and the adult witches and wizards didn't consider getting him proper training. He was a special case, so he needed more help than the average child.

Ahh, Ron bashing. It's easy conflict, and sure at their age it's common to fall out over petty bullshit. I can see why Ron thought in canon that Harry might've jumped on the fame train, but he knows Harry's personality and morals. I always thought it was a bit forced, just to separate them.

I've never seen a Triwizard Tournament fic that didn't vilify Ron, either. They must be rare, or posted on other platforms. I haven't read any fics where Harry is the only Champion. That sounds fun!

**** Take Petrification Proliferation linkffn(11265467) as an example.

The idea is that a basilisk slithering into the great hall and killing a generation of wizards by blinking it's eyes is a very serious situation. So as soon as Harry says he killed a basilisk in the Chamber of Secret the whole school is evacuated and the aurors called in. They conduct an extensive search to make sure there's no more, and find horcruxes, Scabbers, cursed DADA positions, Voldemort's real name, etc...

I also do love crossovers, but only where Harry is not 'shown up' by other characters but I also don't like where he massively shows up the main characters of those series either, if that make sense?

It's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but I like stories where Harry finds out he's ridiculously rich!

Yes, that makes sense. You're talking about Harry being the spotlight stealing squad, but solo. Crossovers are a delicate balance. I like when characters show up others, but only if it's relevant to a specific situation where their abilities are the best for the job.

Harry being absurdly wealthy are so much fun. Like Ritchie Rich!

**** Yes, exactly, with regards to crossovers. And the magic in Harry Potter can be so OP too, when you cross it with real-world-based series. I like crossovers because it's like "oooh what if they met" but I don't like "Harry shows up and solves all the problems because magic" and I HATE "Crossover characters show up and solve all the problems". But I do like "Harry shows up and improves things!" which....is pretty much what I don't like, but, like, LESS.

***** Right? Magic solves everything. I enjoy “What if?!” too, because it's a chance for some polar opposites to interact. I've noticed over the years, especially with popular fandoms, the crossovers can be cringeworthy... or I just happened to see popular badfic sometimes.

I think it's a deus ex machina thing. Problem can't be solved in canon, we'll find a better answer from a different canon! Whether it makes sense or not. Minor improvements are good, yeah. It's the plot takeover basically making Harry either a main character transplant, like all those “Harry is reborn as so and so from a franchise and fixes it!”

*********** I like most pairings as long as they're well-written and make sense. There's more tension with antagonistic ships and getting the relationship to work, so I enjoy some Harry/Snape and Harry/Draco, but they're not my faves.

Good Harry/Narcissa and Harry/Bellatrix are hard to come by! The only fic with Narcissa I've read lately was a surprisingly interesting post-war Hermione/Narcissa. I don't normally go for that, but the writing and slow burn romance kept my attention.

************ Best harry/bella I've ever read was linkffn(watching over harry) ron molly and Dumbledore dont come out so well but it's well written and they're relationship is adorable. Starts out with a fairly graphic bearing of harry by the dursleys but after that it has a good balance between lighthearted and serious. Also one of the first fics I ever read that makes merlin and morgana a semi important part of the story without harry being descended and/or Merlin's second coming

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.

************* I haven't read Watching Over Harry, so thanks. I like fics that aren't grimdark and angsty through the entire story.

I've read but not finished as it's WIP, a fic where Harry is Merlin and Morgana's son from the BBC series. Harry is sent to the future.

*************** It's been a while since I read it, but from what I can remember, the crossover was good. It involved Dumbledore trying to summon the Savior, so Harry was effectively stolen from Morgana. Her POV trying to get him back was one storyline and Harry growing up with James and Lily (knowing he was kidnapped) was the other. I might be wrong. I still liked it though, since the premise was a little unusual.

**************** Never watched merlin so it's about 50/50 whether I could get into it or not. Only time a crossover hasn't annoyed me to no end was when the writer made it a barely there sorta thing. The extent was a one off scene where it was revealed to the reader that harry was descended from edward elric and he used fma type alchemy rather than hp type and used kido from bleach as actual spells including the stupid ling incantation and such which in the hp universe would get you stunned minimum before you could finish

I read a fic awhile back that was actually written before ootp was released and the pairing there mirrored canon. Hermione and ron were together ginny had actually married neville but neville died in the war and the story picked up 8 years after book 4 and harry and fell for ginny. So some people must have seen it before it became obvious in the books
