So I know this question has been asked many times, but I was really hoping I could get some new answers! I've searched this subreddit, but sadly nothing has been new to me or hit the mark.

I really love time-traveling redo fics, where Harry, Ron, Hermione, or Ginny (or any mixture of the above) go back in time to redo their Hogwarts years, prevent deaths, and just generally do it right all over again. I've read all of the greats like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) and linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always). I think my favorite humor story is probably linkffn(Time Warp). I loved the way Draco was also sent back in time as well. Personally I think it's way better than linkffn(Oh God Not Again!)

I've found some recent time traveling stories that other's may like - linkffn(Back From a New Millennium) and linkffn(Harry and Ron's Adventure With Time Travel). But sadly, both are in progress and I seriously hate waiting for updates.

So, I was wondering if anyone had time-travel recommendations for me to check out? I prefer to stick to canon ships. I really don't like bashing, especially no Weasley bashing. Slight Dumbledore bashing is okay. Any fics where Sirius and/or Remus are let in on the secret are a definitely plus.

If anyone has any recommendations, please help a girl out. :)

(I really hope I've formatted and used the bot correctly. I'm still a little new at this! Don't judge, just instill some knowledge.)

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

Boy, that is going too far. Not only it's incomplete, everything so far has been happening exactly as in canon. I was contemplating wether I should continuing, till one of the twins talks about the other as "Gred". Yeah, no.

It's also just not that funny, but I guess that's just a matter of opinion.

** I love time travels, too. However, I generally avoid time-turner travels, because the paradox issue generally limits protagonists' actions and options.

My favorite time-travel is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], where Harry went back to 1975 and built a kick-ass team with Bellatrix.

If you want multiple characters going back, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5251301/1/A-Second-Chance][A Second Chance]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio]] are two nice ones. According to my experience, *We are the Golden Trio* holds the speed record in defeating Voldemort.

For Hermione back to Marauder era fics, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred Sixty Nine]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]] is probably the only finished Ginny time travel fic. Voldemort is not a major problem in this story, but rebuilding her relationship with Harry is. Similarly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]] has Harry finishing off Voldemort and his Death Eaters quite efficiently, but rebuilding his relationship with Hermione hits a big snag as result.

Finally, there is the 'Snape's 2nd chance with Lily' time travels. I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6548167/1/His-Greatest-Wish][His Greatest Wish]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][The Moment It Began]].

***** Do you mean OC or OOC? These two acronyms are quite different.

From the Books, we never know what Bellatrix was like before she joined Voldemort. But based on her sisters Andromeda and Narcissa, I doubt she was born evil. We know however that she was intensely loyal to the person she loved and very dedicated to the cause. Unfortunately, her love interest in the Books was Voldemort.

In this story, Harry got to her before Voldemort, and what happened next was quite credible and interesting.

** Man time travel/redo stories are in my top 3 guilty pleasures.

One that I just read recently and am eagerly awaiting an update for is linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel) and another is linkffn(0800 Rent A Hero) which isn't a time travel fic, but Harry does use past knowledge to influence the future.

linkffn(Boredom Is Deadly) is another really funny one. It's a crack fic, but it's a good read.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10807718/1/The-Hogwarts-Strike-Team][The Hogwarts Strike Team]] is a really cool redo time travel fic. I really like the premise: Voldemort had a contingency plan in case of his death that Harry and Hermione spend years and years trying to defeat before realizing they don't have enough time before the everything is destroyed. The duo (Ron abandons them) send their souls back to when they first met and start assassinating in cold blood and weakening Voldemort's future power base. Unfortunately it's incomplete at the start of the third year due to the author having trouble resolving plot threads. But with 200k words it's still a good read (also has a really cool Basilisk fight).

**** Yes it's H/Hr, though it takes a while for them to get over Ron's abandonment. Starts as a façade to let them spend time together and plot. Hermione uses Legilimency so sit in Harry's mind, so there's some (one-sided) mind/emotion-reading. But their relationship is more friendship/partners than romance.
