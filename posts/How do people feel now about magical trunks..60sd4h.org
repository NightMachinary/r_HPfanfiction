I know that most people seem to hate magical trunks that have a fucking mansion built inside them but considering how in Fantastic Beasts Newt's had a zoo built in his, have those views changed?


** My uncle had one of those. The charms failed whilst he was inside, we had to bury him in it.

** I like them - in principle. I always liked them in principle.

Yet I rarely saw a good use of them. Fantastic Beasts was great. Newt taking his laboratory / Zoo with him wherever fit his character nicely.

Its just that most authors using such a thing are often into one or more pitfalls. A) They're horribly uncreative about it. B)The trunk becomes a Deus Ex Machina C) The trunk is bought but then never used.

*** C is probably my worst peeve ever. A and B I can forgive, because at least the author is trying to shoehorn it somewhere in his story.

C is just blatant self-insert and wish-fulfillment. Author gave MC a trunk because he find it really cool, but it serves no purpose to the plot at all... why bother then?

** I think that live-in trunks get a bad name not because of what they do but because of how the fic writers use them. The way they use them tends to be about showing off how "independent" and clever and practical their protagonist is; how bumbling the antagonists (such as the Manipulative!Dumbledore) are, losing track of him like that; and they end up isolating their protagonist from other characters, so that he could "train", rather than actually do anything interesting.

It is often the case that once the protagonist finally emerges from his trunk, powerful and independent, the story cuts off abruptly, since the protagonist then has no clue what to do with all that power and independence.

My favorite use of live-in trunks is linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes), which is a spoof of this concept, because Harrymort is, in fact, rather paranoid and misanthropic; and his trunk keeps getting knocked over, spoiling the potions he's trying to brew inside.

** I'm fine with it as long as it's not some weird ass training chest where he climbs down stairs and has a kitchen and a bedroom and a training room. That's not how it works. Newt was able to do that because he was a fucking prodigy at charms. You can't just find a chest like that in a random store for a hundred galleons or whatever the fuck amount of money it is.

** I'm fine with them, but only if there's a good explanation for why more people don't make use of them.

Maybe there are a limited number of magical trunks in circulation, or maybe they're extremely expensive. Maybe they're regulated - after all, if the trunk breaks and dumps the mansion that was once inside back out into real space, that could endanger the statue of secrecy. Or maybe living in a trunk is just seen as tacky. But if magical trunks are depicted as better than traditional housing and storage, with no downsides...

And don't get me started on time dilating magical trunks.

Does “Newt was really darn good at charms so his chest is pimped out but don't expect such quality from generic store-bought stuff” count as a good explanation?

Because as far as I know it was made fairly clear that Newt Scamander really is quite good at charms and charmed his own “trunk”, so it being all that great doesn't mean every other trunk will be just as good.

Though, obviously, some fanfics do have things of this kind that are just nonsense.

** I always imagine the reason you wouldn't live in a trunk is the same why you wouldn't live in a wizarding tent. Also known as you can live in a bus/camper/rv/car but most people would wonder why you would want to.

*** I think you're closer, but not quite there.

I think people don't live in trunks simply because tents are a thing. If you look at what is happening at a broader level, a person living in a trunk is a person living in a trunk, which isn't something you would do. People in the wizarding world wouldn't really care that the trunk has a fully furnished apartment in it, it's still a trunk and why use a trunk when you have a perfectly good tent.

In a world where belief and symbols mean a great deal to magic, the purpose of objects themselves would mean a great deal to the people living in it. Trunks are for storing objects, tents are for a place to stay while away from home, and a house is where you make a home. Anything less than that would seem weird and unusual, no matter how 'functional' it would be.

** They're oddly annoying in fanfics still, maybe it's just that they're treated like a revolutionary idea when wizards are always making use of their bigger on the inside technology, such as their magical tent, Hermione's bag the ford anglia's car boot and other ministry cars. I wouldn't be surprised if much of the wizarding world hides in small spaces.

The really annoying plot device that is regrettably canon (which I don't mind so much in canon) is the room of requirement, the room that gives you whatever you want.

** I never hated the idea of a magical trunk with a mansion or other such large location within because expanded trunks were cannon, and there was NEVER a "limit" on it.

So all Fantastic Beasts did was confirm that such a thing is reasonable and possible within the context of the magical world.

That said, they are rarely used all that well in fan fiction and that may be the issue.

** Hate the "mansion trunk" trope, I love Magical Trunks as long as it's a small part of the set up, like you can't enter the trunk but it holds a Mobile potions labs, "library section" where two shelves sit inside the trunk and move around holding all the books but it's not like Hogwarts Library with stacks. The trunk from Mountain907's story is a perfect example of a great trunk

**** I searched "Trunk" out, yes that I feel is the perfect way to handle a trunk, it's a storage multitool/mobile command center but nothing more, it's not a home or place to sleep. When you need it it becomes a desk, it becomes a nice wardrobe to hold your clothing, it has a small cooking/storage station for your potions, it has a small magically expanded bookshelf, shit like that I like

** I don't have a problem with them, because honestly it fits into the world even before fantastic beasts. If you can enchant/charm a tent to hold the eight people they brought to the world cup, and it might not be top-of-the-line, but it might be, since it was lent to them by Perkins who was an employee in the Misuse of Muggle artefacts office.\\
Though just because something is in Canon doesn't mean I like it, but I do like magical trunks, I would just have them be expensive (Which would make sense why everyone doesn't have one).

** I never have read anything that ever used it in an interesting way...and I hate how often they get used. They also have an ungodly amount of time spent describing it.

In fact the only time I've ever seen one of those done well in anything is the Sapient Pearwood Luggage from Discworld.

I haven't seen or read Fantastic Beasts, but knowing he had a zoo/lab doesn't bother me. It even makes sense for an exploring character whom presumably is moving a lot. A school kid it doesn't.

** From a world building perspective I consider a nice kludge to better understand the economics of the world. The current exchange seems totally borked, so its hard to make sense of some things. But maybe urban dwellers can purchase tiny little flats and really make them nice with magic trunks for storage, not to mention just expanded rooms.

From a fanfic thing, its a good way to give the character some much needed privacy and a place to get things done. I bet nearly every canon rehash has to abuse one of: Room of Requirement; Chamber of Secrets; or a magical trunk. You just gotta have a dojo somewhere!
