Fics in which an adult Harry takes the role of a guardian/parent/educator/sensei/(dubious)role model. Preferably they take place after the war with Voldemort has concluded in some fashion (either utter defeat and time travel, as an exile in another world, or as the winner, as long as Harry stays a late teen/adult and had gone through the experience of war).

As long as Harry is the adoptive (literal or metaphorical) father (or mother if fem!Harry) figure of an defined character, as in not just some OCish Teddy that stays in the background, but preferably someone with a solid history. Examples would be an AU kid Harry, Hermione, Neville, Tom Riddle, Anakin Skywalker, Naruto, Raven (any DC or Marvel character), heck even Draco Malfoy (don't know why he'd bother), none of which are blank slate.

Harry could adopt someone with the cliche blood adoption ritual to save them from mortal peril, or he might just be there for them as a role model to teach and guide them and be the favorite uncle, or anything in between.

  Post-DH, Pre-Epilogue. The Wizarding world is slowly recovering, and Hogwarts is re-opened. Harry Potter struggles to become a good DADA teacher, but it's hard when a large portion of his mind is commandeered by four familiar Marauders. Slash and het.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

You have to register but its well worth it. It's a post-war Harry where he returns to Britain from overseas with a son, and gets caught up in the drama of post-war Britain. H/Hr.
