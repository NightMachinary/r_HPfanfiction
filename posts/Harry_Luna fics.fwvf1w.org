** Well, it takes a while for Harry/Luna to happen, but if you were bored anyway I'm guessing you'd be happy with a long fic? linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has Book 1 (years 1-4) complete, Book 2 is actively updated. Between them, they're close to 900k words.

It looks at first like simply fixing up lots of things from canon, but keep reading and you'll find that the opposition has been level grinding too.
