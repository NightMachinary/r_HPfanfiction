I'm just curious because I've seen so many authors use this trope. Dumbledore was the Supreme Mugwump and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, kinda like the president so there must be at least a salary of some type. Not only that but he was also headmaster and previously a professor. I don't believe he was after galleons or sickles he probably has plenty of those. But other than the Cloak (which he returned) I don't think the Potters had much to offer to one of the most influential wizards in Europe.

If it's just for the sake of bashing, at least explain what he's stealing from the vaults.


** good comments here already, but i think something that has some text-based evidence is that harry is extremely vulnerable to financial abuse. he has no idea he has any money, nobody explains to him how much he has or how to manage it, and the fact that the control over his vault is given to him via key, which is delivered in a very unsafe manner. literally anything could have happened to his inheritance between his parents' murders and his arrival in wizarding world 9 and half years later.

*** Also, if you calculate how much gold is needed to reach something similar to the book descriptions, you need thousands of golden coins. Even with the official exchange rate, Harry would be bordering on being a millionaire. And as you said, no one bothers to do any educating.

And the key thing, if you pay attention to canon, Harry actually rarely uses his key. I think after PS, the only scene is at the start of PoA. Other than that, someone else (mostly Weasleys IIRC) do the business transactions.

And just in general we can probably assume he has enough to live comfortably off of his inheritance. As far as I know, we're never given any reason whatsoever to think Harry has any need of additional money and even when he gives away a lot like after the tournament I don't think anyone ever acts like he gave away something he might need in the future.

*** Yeah that's an interesting point you bring up about younger authors using the idea more often. I've seen it quite often on ao3 with tags like ‚Äòevil!dumbledore or manipulating!dumbledore'.

I won't deny that's he's not manipulating but he's not as evil as everyone makes him out to be either. Also regarding the ‚Äòdark arts aren't bad and dumbledore is keep people stupid'. This trope surprised me when I first started reading ff because despite dumbledore being in a position of power I doing he could influence generations of people and families into believing a whole branch of magic is evil. If this belief is well known I don't think he would have been the supreme mugwump for international wizards with those kind of beliefs. There must have been some kind of research to back those ideas.

Not only that but the dark side aren't traditionalist there just racist lol. Most of the authors don't even know the origin of Samhain and think they can just use random gaelic/gaeilge sentences to summon and contact the dead just to be traditional.

The comments you made made me laugh tho! üòÇ

***** I am actually writing a serious theological essay on that verse (and the other similar ones), so my conclusion is that it is like Hagrid's opinion on Blast-Ended Skrewts, this verse has been unfortunately (for thousands of witches) seriously misunderstood.

However, even if I could imagine the relationship between the Magical World and the Church around 1700 might be quite frosty, I can imagine that with the influx of muggleborns and half-bloods to the Magical population (remember, well until the Second World War, most of the Muggle world at least pretended to be religious), there are now at least some families which are keeping their faith around. Maybe in minority, but [[https://www.firstthings.com/article/2014/01/on-creative-minorities][that makes it even more interesting]] (BTW, Rabbi Sacks was seriously awesome British Rabbi and died couple of days ago).

********* For what it's worth, christianity managed the best part of fifteen centuries without any witch-hunting of note. Something changed around the mid fifteenth century and magic went from 'the folkways we use in daily life' to 'sinister things inspired by the Very Devil'. From 1450-ish to 1750-ish is the usually accepted period, with a /huge/ peak between 1600 and 1650. Mostly during wartime - the wars of religion of the 16th and 17th centuries being particularly noteworthy - and /much/ more in areas where there were tensions between the different sects of the religion, where any departure from orthodoxy could be seen as evidence of deviltry.

I'm choking down the urge to /really/ get into this, but the executive summary is that christianity - whatever the scriptures may say, depending on which politically-edited translation is in force at the time which is a whole other rant for another time - has been a non-witch-hunting religion a lot longer than it has been panicking over the occult. A lot of first millennium accounts of the doings and deeds of bishops in particular have a lot to say about their magical feats, and some of them draw a distinction between those and miracles.

** I do think it is stupid but, It isn't hard to question why Dumbledore has Harry's cloak, or at least why he didn't give it back right away. It establishes that Dumbledore has possessed Harry's things and isn't too bothered about returning them. We know Dumbledore is responsible for Harry being placed with the Durselys. A place that Harry rightfully hates. We know Dumbledore keeps Harry from talking to his friends or living with Sirius after fourth year until the end of the holidays.

Dumbledore repeatedly makes decisions on Harry's behalf that cause Harry short term suffering for some longer goal. Dumbledore therefore using Harry's resources to defeat Voldemort at the expense of Harry's immediate spending power fits. The cloak provides evidence that Dumbledore takes/possesses Harry's things.

I personally put a lot of the cause down to teenage writers struggling over their parents making decisions for them. Everyone reaches a point where they think they know what is best for them, or at least feel that even if they're making a mistake it should be their choice. They chafe under authority and feel they aren't respected. That's normally around 15 ish, the same sort of time a lot of these Indy!Harry fics start. Should Dumbledore be making decisions on Harry's behalf or should he respect Harry's desires? Why does Dumbledore get to decide these things for him?

*** I don't think the Dursley's would have allowed Harry have anything magical let alone a invisibility cloak. The cloak was given to him by James and he gave it back to Harry in his first year so I don't know why people would make this into such a huge deal. He gave it back to Harry despite him being an 11 year old boy in a magical school who went after a troll with his best friend.

I also didn't like the idea that Harry couldn't communicate with his friends or Sirius during the summer so I can't argue against that. He did say it was to protect him and although that made it true it made Harry lonely and angry (not healthy mentally).

I don't think Dumbledore would have known the extent of abuse Harry suffered. And also I'm not excusing Harry's neglect at awful and I believe it was horrible but remember dumbledore was born in 1800 and grew up in a time where corporal punishment was common in schools. Idk this is just a thought, and I'm not justifying any of the abuse Harry went through but it could be a reason behind Dumbledore not caring much of Harry's living situation.

And yeah I agree the authors probably put in there own feelings in writing authority figures. Also Harry was a teenager so although he thinks he knows what's best it may not be the best decision to make. And in return Dumbledore may not make the best decisions either. It goes both ways.

Literally nothing would have stopped them from doing this, no matter the protection. They did this with the Fidelius Charm too. That's like saying walls on a house are useless because a bear can just chill outside. Like, yeah, but /they can't get in/, which is the crucial part.

#+begin_quote

...Why would it? Wormtail and Crouch Jr didn't attack Harry at Privet Drive. Why would a protection over Privet Drive protect Harry at places that, you know, /aren't Privet Drive/? Again, that's like calling the walls on a house useless because a bear attacked you while you were out pissing in the woods.

Your entire complaint applies to every protection. It's the same thing with the Fidelius Charm. Harry would have to stay inside the bounds of the protection or it's useless.

And there's an argument to be made that the Privet Drive protection did protect Harry outside the house itself. If it didn't, Voldemort could have easily snatched Harry when he was out on one of his walks.

#+begin_quote
  And as soon as the Dursleys leave to do the shopping, you have hostages and/or targets
#+end_quote

Except this didn't happen. Death Eaters had 16 years to try this and clearly something stopped them. Voldemort had 3 years to try it too once he was resurrected, and yet he did not.

From a Watsonian perspective, this means that there was clearly something stopping these things from happening. Clearly, the protection worked --- it worked all the way until the protection collapsed when Petunia and Harry both left the house.

I said that Voldemort (or anyone else for that matter) could do it. This is the ability/opportunity angle. And if Voldemort was rational, that is exactly what he would do. But Voldemort is not exactly rational, is he? After all, he could have simply walked into the DoM at night and picked up the prophecy and left without anyone being wiser (the likes of Arthur Weasley would not even be a speedbump).

This is why Voldemort would not do it, which is not the same as him being unable to.

#+begin_quote
  Privet Drive's Protection is not the same thing as Lily's Sacrificial Protection
#+end_quote

If you want to split hairs... The sacrifice actually roasts Voldemort in PS, the house one is useless since the protection on the Tonks house has exactly the same effect on Voldemort (turning away his entire force). And the blood protection was useless after the graveyard, so there was absolutely 0 reason why Harry had to stay at Number 4 since, as the Tonks' house demonstrates, there are similar protections which achieve their goal without child abuse. And if Dumbledore was competent, there would be no need for Lily's protection either.

#+end_quote

I don't agree, but even if I did, your argument still fails under this assumption. Because if he wouldn't do it, then the protection is clearly sufficient enough. /It worked./ No matter what argument you try to toss at the wall in the hopes of something sticking, it will always come back to the fact that /it worked./

#+begin_quote
  After all, he could have simply walked into the DoM at night and picked up the prophecy and left without anyone being wiser

He'd risk detection and thus exposure to the wizarding world. This was pretty explicitly said in the books.

#+begin_quote
  And the blood protection was useless after the graveyard
#+end_quote

No, it obviously wasn't useless. It clearly worked. The Death Eaters and Voldemort weren't able to swarm the Dursley house in DH until the protection collapsed. As it stood, though, it kept them out. It wasn't useless. We see it working, for fuck's sake.

You keep repeating this everywhere but you're absolutely wrong. There is ZERO reason Voldemort wouldn't have just kidnapped Harry while he was at Privet Drive if the protection didn't work. Zero. So, /clearly/, it did work.

#+begin_quote
  the protection on the Tonks house has exactly the same effect on Voldemort (turning away his entire force).
#+end_quote

The protection on the Tonks home kept Voldemort out for less than ten minutes. There's no telling if it would keep Harry safe for sixteen years.

I've seen another user go through this very argument with you before too. And you never gave a valid counterpoint to them either. You just disappear, only to bring up the same false statements to others a month later.

Again, what gives? Why do you do this? Are you hoping the person you're arguing with just doesn't remember canon and so you'll come across as correct? It's not as if you're just forgetful; no, these points have been refuted to you several times before. You're /deliberately/ arguing points you know damn well are wrong or nonsense.

Here I am wasting time on you again, knowing you won't take in a word I've said --- no matter how thorough my arguments are, no matter how many direct quotes from the book I provide, you will ignore it all and continue to be a bad faith actor.

Maybe. But the Fidelius Charm had /just/ failed the Potters when he was put in the Dursleys home, so maybe they weren't willing to try it out again.

Moreoever, who says you can just put the charm on a random house? We don't know if that's possible. All uses of the Fidelius was put on places that were owned by the family using them: Potters, Blacks, Weasleys.

And Dumbledore would have to find someone to trust to take care of Harry too. He'd be busy. McGonagall would be busy. Hagrid is an idiot. If Sirius Black was a Death Eater to his eyes, there'd be no one worth trusting that could do it.

And, that begs to question as well. Umbridge was able to find out where Harry lives, she must have had access to his files. So, does that mean, if Lucius had thought of it, he could have had easy access to Harry's files, and knowing where Harry lived?

The whole thing was a mistake. imo what Dumbledore should have done, since Harry was such a high risker of potential attacks, was have the official story be that Harry lived with his Muggle relatives in his files, but he actually lived elsewhere, telling Harry not to tell anyone where he actually lived.

It's trivial to come up with a good reason for this though. The cloak is literally one of the single most powerful magical items in existence (even if it's uses are fairly one note). Dumbledore having it to study isn't unreasonable even during that period of the war as it wouldn't have been useful to hide from Voldemort. As for giving it back right away, would you immediately give back an object of that importance to a kid you know practically nothing about?

Rights to something kind of go out the window when you're talking about an item of the potential importance of the cloak that belongs to a child. Dumbledore knew the three Hallows existed and were quite likely the most powerful magical artifacts ever created. Even something as apparently useless comparatively as the cloak is not something a man concerned with the fate of the world is going to part ways with lightly and that really is not unreasonable.

Comparing something like the cloak to a common object (even one worth money) is so ridiculous it honestly comes off like you're not arguing in good faith. You might as well be telling me with a straight face that it's obvious a weapon of mass destruction should immediately be given back to a child if it belonged to their parents.

He knows that they are dead and keeping the cloak is withholding it from the estate. Even if James had agreed to lend it to him it still has to be returned to the estate when James dies.

Like imagine if your mom died. You can't just keep her library books, they go back to the library.

And it's not a defence to say he could have just never told anyone he had it.

That's basically withholding it from the estate (again) and unlawful possession.

It's basically not okay. And then acting like it was a gift is not okay. It's very manipulative.

There is clearly a way to deal with estate law in the wizarding world, that's clear because Dumbledore himself left a will and left clear wishes for how he wanted property dealt with and the ministry stepped in to handle the administration.

Like, think about it this way. Dumbledore wrote a will wanting it respected for his property. But Dumbledore had no issue doing what he wanted with James Potter's cloak for a decade.

Basically Dumbledore just did his own thing outside of general concepts of morality which is why many people (not just little kids) have issues with how he behaved.

And you have to consider the implications of giving an orphan something that belonged to his father at Christmas time. I mean, yeah it seems manipulative to me.

Like think of summer before second year - Harry is locked in his bedroom being told he can't go back to school and being somewhat starved. His friends rescue him. He misses the train to school. He has no home. He can't think of anyone who can help him.

He takes the flying car to school.

And there's no indidcation Dumbledore did that.Or that Dumbledore did anything with it at all. Or that James did not authorise him to do or not do things with it. ALL we know is that James left it with Dumbledore for some unspecified purpose that may or may not have been of a scope covering the intermediate ten years.\\
Any reason is completely made up by fans. And those same fans seem utterly incapable of thinking up any non-sinister reason.

Now Dumbledore waited some time bfore handing it over and dared not to reveal himself as the giver directly. Again I read a lot of fan-made reasoning behind that and again those fans seem incapable of portraying this in anything but the worst possible light. On the other hand, it might - /might/ - be for such simple reasons as Christmas being the first plausible time for this item to be placed into Harry's hands without raising questions, it being just another gift instead of some artifact that draws attention when Harry suddenly gets it on a normal schoolday. His broom certainly did. Same with the not signed note. Harry getting something from Dumbledore draws the wrong kind of attention at the wrong time. Harry getting a mysterious item from a mysterious friend of his parents far less so. And it doesn't draw the line back to Dumbledore. Once the attention to the mystery cools down it doesn't matter anymore if Harry reveals that the cloak had been in Dumbledore's possession.

There you have it - a /non-sinister/ version of the events. Not handled ideally by Dumbledore, but not sinister. And I'd argue that Dumbledore shouldn't handle it ideally anyway, that he should make mistakes and show his biases.

As for "But Dumbledore should have trusted Harry to keep the secret!" No, he damn well should not! Harry is 11.

It's more difficult to set up the characters slowly realizing he isn't a good guy, but stealing right off the bat gives them all reason to be suspicious from day 1. I see it as a shortcut on character development and on shortcutting getting to an established place with characters. That's not to say it isn't done well sometimes or a valid thing, someone else already pointed out Dumbledore does things the faster way rather than through correct channels, but it's a really easy way to get the reader against Dumbledore.

** The reason the "manipulative Dumbledore" trope exists is because of the genre shift in the series. Many British children's stories have an 'orphan trope,' where they're raised by an evil family and end the book escaping those circumstances, giving them a reason to go on an adventure. The Dursleys start off comically evil and are basically meant to play that straight. By being evil, it makes Harry being whisked away to fantasy magic school stark and helps the story stay very grounded in Hogwarts rather than "the real world." The issues pop up because no one else uses the orphan trope with an evil family, then has the orphan goes back to the abusive relatives at the end of the book (although PoS at least makes it seem like Harry will have an okay time because he can do magic). Tropes in a children's book don't work well when the books shift to being more YA as Harry gets older. So you can't really reconcile the kind of comically evil/spoiled Dursleys at the beginning with real characters an legitimate child abuse when looking back at it. At the end of the day, JK Rowling just didn't think about it enough.

That also leads to Dumbledore's year 5 explanation and people's problems with it.

I wasn't ralking about legal fees though. It's fairly clear throughout the books that Lucius Malfoy bribes people to get his way most notably when he is seen handing Fudge a bag of coins by Harry.

** Because it's a convenient foil as a way to show how bad an evil/manipulative Dumbledore really is. Even the greater good Dumbledores are easier to portray as being in the wrong if they're pre-empting Harry's death with vault theft. It's a very easy way to simplify things for a man that was actually very complicated and often seemed to be walking the stairway of good intentions straight down to hell.

He wanted to keep harry safe, so left him with the Dursleys.\\
He wanted him to be able to have a childhood, so he withheld information that would have changed his worldview and probably made him pay more attention to his studies.\\
He assumed that Harry was loved, and kept sending him home.\\
He offered second chances like candy.

The list keeps growing as you read through canon, but most authors can't deal with the subtle complexities that such a character needs, so they turn them into a cartoon villain who has clear motivations and methods.

In my fic, he's an old man who has been overworked for decades, and has been becoming increasingly used to making expedient decisions rather than good decisions that take more time. Which wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't the headmaster, as some of those expedient decisions could be to pass the work off onto someone else.

However, his decisions affect the lives of hundreds of children. At one point in haste when Minerva was younger and new to the Deputy position, he used a minor charm to get her to take on some more of the paperwork. If he hadn't used the Elder Wand it would have probably given him a weeks respite to get back on an even keel. Instead, it lasted until it was eaten, and made her responsibilities to the students as head of house and deputy headmistress suffer. This has had a side effect of increasing his workload in the school, which will lead to more bad decisions.

****** Sirius in Azkaban without trial was something I was also curious about. In the books we were told that some death eaters were thrown in without trial but I always believed that someone would have asked for a trial for Sirius since he was James' best friend. I never understood how no one questioned him. Was it because he was a Black and people figured it was only time until he turned into a traitor? Were his friends to busy grieving their families to look out for him and question his imprisonment? They were as close as brother and yet no one, not even Dumbledore doubted his imprisonment. I won't deny that Dumbledore should have done something given all the political power he had. I don't know why he didn't, was he too busy with the aftermath of the war that he forgot? It's unlikely ofc and it's not fair that Snape got a second chance in this regard while Sirius didn't.

But I don't think Dumbledore gave them a second chance, they bribed their way. I don't think he can just throw people in Azkaban without a majority consensus if their is a trial. Those who got a trial had the money, power and influence. The Lestrange had all three but they were caught red handed and Bellatrix would never claim she was under the imperious curse since she revered Riddle so much. Meanwhile, Dumbledore actually stood up for Snape.

*** Dumbledor doesn't give many second chances.

There's Snape, who got less of a second chance and more a lifetime commitment to absolute loyalty and espionage, he never let Snape out of his sight again and put him to excellent use, he's quite probably the only successful spy the Order ever had, simply because noone else could actually decieve Voldemort.

I've seen Hagrid mentioned, but the key point there is that Hagrid wasn't even guilty, he was literally framed by Voldemort and Dumbledore knew it. Hagrid was one of the most unambigously good people in the entire series and utterly loyal to Dumbledore. Hardly a poor decision.

Then I guess there's Draco, Snape made an unbreakable vow to aidhim so Dumbledore couldn't really do much earlier in the year and it was less a second chance and more a case of trying to change his mind before it was too late. Not a great showing but Dumbledore was dead within the year either way.\\
Draco was also still legally and in Dumbledore's eyes a child at this point, one who hadn't actually done much yet, so while ultimately a failure, it's very understandable.

I'm pretty sure that mound of gold is what most fanfic writers think of when they picture Harry's wealth. Now, we can talk about how Rowling is incredibly bad at math and says each galleon is only $5 or whatever, but from a real-world perspective, that picture contains more money than anyone could reasonably spend in a lifetime.

It's not the wealth as presented from the perspective of just an orphan boy, its the reasonable perspective described to us in the books and then shown to us in the movies that shows harry has more money than most of us will see in our lifetimes as muggles.

For context, [[http://www.coinandbullionpages.com/images/1-kilo-gold-bar.jpg][This is a 1kg bar of gold.]] This is worth ~$65,000. Or, slightly more than the median yearly household income in America. He's not relatively well off compared to his previous orphan status. He is /loaded/.

******** Now I see it. That looks like a lot but for my usual headcanon I am not using movies as reference. Instead I am giving you the two paragraphs that made me reach my conclusion and no amount of downvotes will change my opinion.

#+begin_quote
  Price on request... Harry didn't like to think how much gold the Firebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his whole life - but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nimbus Two Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very good broom already? (POA, Chapter 4)
#+end_quote

Whether it was Harry's assumption that it was way more expensive than it actually was we are not told but based on the fact that he was a reader of Which Broom and might have heard people talking on Diagon Alley, he might have had at least a clue of the price range if he was so cautious about its cost, so much so that he was worried that buying it will empty his vault. On the other hand, he receives a Firebolt from Sirius who can't even show up in person to request the price or to haggle on it. He just sends an order form from Which Broom... so most likely he paid the full price. On the other hand, in HBP, Dumbledore tells Harry the following:

#+begin_quote
  "You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts..."

That means that even after buying a Firebolt, Sirius's account didn't go dry. And we don't even know if Harry actually inherited the Black vault or the money Arcturus gave to him. So, yes, I would say the Potters were doing fine financially considering that both James and Lily were unemployed, but I don't think they were above middle-class. They lived in a fairly normal house, by wizard standards, without white peacocks or house elf heads hung up on walls. Also their vault was not significant enough to be defended by dragons like the lower level ones.

********* Your "evidence" there literally disproves itself in what you posted... He didn't even ask for the price, he just assumed it would be more than he could afford. And as we all know, 13 year olds are never prone to hyperbole, obviously.

And "empty your vault" is not a phrase that is used only in a literal sense. People say that they emptied their bank account to buy a something all the time even when they just spend a big chunk of what they have, people rarely literally mean that their bank balance hit $0.00 when they say that.

And this is all with absolutely zero knowledge of how expensive a Firebolt is. If I had a buddy that was eying a Bugatti Veyron and then decided not to buy it because it would wipe him out, I wouldn't think he wasn't rich just because he didn't want to drop $2 million on a fancy car.

Your opinion is based on nothing, man. Just your own headcanon, not anything from actual canon. That's why you're getting downvoted. Even a single pile of gold large enough to be described as a mound like they were in the books would be enough to set up a person for life, even discounting that he had multiples, or what "columns" of silver would be worth.

That's in no way evidence of Harry's wealth.

The Trumps are the most obvious example at the moment, but Dumbledore is an old politician with an agenda, and there's a wealth of examples of such people being amoral at best when pursuing their goals.

Canon Dumbledore spends at least 15 years grooming Harry to be willingly suicidal. Writing him as evilly motivated, i.e. ‚Äúbashing‚Äù him, is not remotely an unreasonable response by someone who finds that distasteful.

**** This has gotten long.

TL/DR: the series is not consistent; most if the characters aren't either. People write fanfic to explore areas the author didn't; people take shortcuts because fanfic. None of that requires childish as an explanation.

Dumbledore's attitude and actions are because of the prophecy until they're about the horcrux too.

Dumbledore believed there would be a straight-up 1:1 confrontation, and yet he ignored if not suppressed any of the Potters willed instructions for their son's care, and extralegally placed him into a neglectful if not abusive home. He subsequently made no attempt to help Harry survive the confrontation he expected, and instead pushed him towards an attitude of self-sacrifice, continuing his efforts after his own death in the way he prevented the Potters from doing.

To me, the whole series can be viewed as a disgusting example of an elderly man trying to create a passion play at the expense of a minor. Obviously many disagree, which is fine.

It's difficult to analyze the canon series deeply. It started out as children's novels, with caricatured adults, and then attempted with mixed success to change into a series of young adult novels with nuanced characters and mature themes.

The results do not reflect well on many characters as written: Dumbledore, Snape, Lupin, Molly Weasley, and Augusta Longbottom spring to mind. I believe Rowling was attempting to write them as varyingly positive characters, but I don't believe the actions they take and the attitudes they express play at all when viewed with mature expectations.

Fanfic is typically much shorter than a series of novels. Hobbyist authors often take shortcuts with characters and background.

For Dumbledore, some authors see the canon version lionized for repellant behaviour, and make him more clearly a villain to enable a better outcome for Harry and other characters like Sirius, who get to be shafted in canon.

**** The Peverells are hyped to be a tier above all other enchanters though, the brothers managed to create the most powerful wand in exsistance, the ressurection stone and a everlasting invisibility cloak.

1 of the brothers died, the other married into the slytherin family that managed to squander their wealth and the other married into the Potters who we see atleast care for their most important heirloom respectfully untill James and Harry uses it.

It isn't so far fetched that they actually have access to far more artifacts and texts produced by the legendary brothers, and therefore can somewhat replicate their feats.

** Yeah, a lot of Dumbledore bashing is pretty bizarre. People can argue about his being manipulative or leaving Harry with the Dursleys, but the stealing from Harry and brainwashing kids and being willing to murder people cause he's so obstinate are all pretty ridiculous. People forgetting perhaps that it's a children's book aimed at entertaining 10 year olds. They're not going to go into the intricacies of Wizarding banking and assets.

** I mean no one /makes/ him. He's the one draining his own vaults and running out of money for the ‚Äúwar‚Äù! Plus, I mean, he's also the one stealing. That's like watching someone stealing from a store then yelling at the cashier about ‚Äúwhy didn't you check out the thief?!‚Äù The poor cashier didn't do anything wrong!

Okay, I'm trolling. Sorry. I /love/ evil Dumbledore (when he's portrayed correctly!) personality but just like with canon Voldemort - don't make evil Dumbledore's worst crime be vault fraud! Just like how Voldemort's worst crime shouldn't be killing the Potters or trying to kill Harry. If you want a super evil intelligent baddie then you really need to have them do something worst than stealing money or murder that happened when OP was an infant. (And, as regards to canon Voldemort, someone will argue his worst crime is Horcruxes, but we don't even know how to make a Horcrux. I'm talking about intelligent, handsome, Tom Riddle. You mean, in canon, that this incredibly intelligent wizard (whom the author drones on and on about his intelligence) put Horcruxes in objects that were so obvious they were destroyed by a seventeen year old? Oh and he also put them in places that, again, a seventeen year old could find them? Like, I get it, but I don't agree Voldemort is intelligent at /all/ when he does do this stuff in canon. Say the Horcruxes fried his mind but I ain't buying it.

If you want actual intelligent bad guys then they have to win, at least a little, and have plots that the characters can not overcome without loss of some kind or without a huge trial. That's just my opinion. Don't come for me. So I love evil Dumbledore and even evil Voldemort and Evil James Potter was a super interesting idea - but don't hype up their intelligence just for the ‚Äúfinal battle‚Äù to be half a chapter long where nobody but a random Hufflepuff and a horrible bullying Gryffindor/Slytherin we only saw bully MC's once or twice die. In a way, the best books I've ever read are the ones with a heavy loss (and I read romance so not heavy romantic loss, either).

** Well sometimes it's because theyre making it a bad/manipulative Dumbledore's story so why not make him steal from the vaults? It's literally one of the easiest ways to make Dumbledore's look bad since he has Harry's key.

As for why, there's plenty of reasons I've seen given. He needs money to bribe members of the Wizengamot is one, for example.

** Sometimes he's (sort of) using it for a "good cause," supporting the Order of the Phoenix, etc. Of course that falls a bit flat with some thought because the Order is defunct from 1982 to 1995 (or so it appears) and it never seems to be used to counter people like Malfoy.

I think I saw one where he was putting it into a school vault, but that has plenty of holes as well because he's not spending it anywhere. I believe the complaint about school brooms is canon, for example.

I'm not a fan of stealing it because "I want to be rich!" A lot of authors leave that as its own motivation (well, it is a human one) and frequently have him drain other vaults as well in this scenario. Honestly, I can get behind "I want all the things" much better when it's artifacts and books; still bad, but fits the academic aspect so much better.

And there was one where he admitted to a variation of kleptomania. He couldn't explain why he had felt it necessary and then couldn't stop. Which, again, given human nature, is as valid as anything else.

(I am excluding any arrangements for a reasonable stipend being paid to the Dursleys; how they misuse it is generally not on Albus.)

Bribing allies like the Weasleys--whether they're aware or not--works, but only if you're really setting him up as a master plotter. Long range: saw one where Harry's vault paid for all 7 Weasleys' tuition (not sure if Molly or Arthur knew about that). Bribing Ron and/or Ginny and giving Molly the vault key are shorter range plans and fit in certain types of stories.

Let's face it: reading over canon with an adult eye shows Dumbledore is a manipulative old coot. It's a matter of personal interpretation as to what kind. There's outright stupid (not a fan), senile, too much of an ivory tower academic to understand the real world (like this one the best), varying flavors of evil or ill-minded. And there was at least one where he was possessed, although I'm not sure he stole in that one.

But stealing can be a good indicator as to what kind of Dumbledore we're dealing with when done right. Or it can simply be part of the pile-on for poor Harry and serves no other purpose. I'm usually content if it fits the internal logic of the story.

*** I'm in no way denying that he's manipulating, I'm just frustrated with how authors go around explaining his actions.

I too, can get behind the idea of him taking books or artefacts for the sake of knowledge and academia.

Sadly there aren't many good master plotter ff out there.

Especially hate it when he steals for no other reason than for Harry to side with Slytherins, hate the light or the goblins etc There's more ways to go around this

** Edgelord teenagers who have difficulty understanding Dumbledore's actions and character. It is easy to see from the book "he knew of the abuse! MONSTER!!!" without considering, that Harry would have very likely perished without the blood protection.

Had he been placed with another wizarding family - their fate would have likely been same as Longbottoms, with Harry dead or spending rest of his life in St. Mungos. That was the reality that waited him, should Petunia ever decide to throw Harry out.

And it is an easy way to show how "evil" and "bad" Dumbledore is.

** It's just another way to for people that hate Dumbledore to bash him.

That being said, in these stories they typically assume the Potters were very wealthy (which may or may not be true, as far as I know we know Harry had enough money to live on but I'm not sure if we really know exactly how much). Dumbledore being powerful and influential means he likely has plenty of money to live off of, but a man acting as a general and a leader/influencer of entire countries could always find a use for money and almost certainly wouldn't be able to fully fund everything he'd like to out of his own pocket. It would likely be trivially easy for Dumbledore to take money from Harry if he needed it, and if you assume he's extremely wealthy it may be enough to be tempting if you assume Dumbledore would be willing to steal from Harry.

Also, I would be surprised if the Wizengamet was paid a salary. As far as I recall the seats are essentially given to wizarding nobility so it would more or less be assumed the reason you're even there is that you come from an accomplished and rich family. Being poor enough that you needed the money would probably be more of a reason to abolish your right to a seat than to give you a salary.
