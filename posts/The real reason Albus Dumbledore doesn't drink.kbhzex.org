Dumbledore knew people wondered about him. Knew they saw he never drank anything, despite his many stressful positions. Knew he was always calm and never wild. He knew many speculated he didn't drink because it would damage his image or that the backlash of his drunken magic would be to devastating.

​

His eyes shifted to a drawer containing a modified time turner. His own creation, that let him move through time in his own way; He wondered how they would react if they knew about that time he went barrelling down the M25 being chased by muggle cops on an old motorcycle, flinging presents out from his wand and injuring many muggles and wizards alike by his generous gifts walloping them in the face.

​

Oh well, at least the muggle and wizard children alike benefitted from him accidentally creating the legend of Santa Clause in the same incident.


** I also think that the map shaped scar he has is actually something he drew with a quill on himself, very pissed at that point too and not realising how much pressure he was putting on the quill. It wouldn't do to get lost in the subway, after all.

** I would like to point out that the M25 was completed in 1975, so this reminiscing of a miss spent youth occured when Dumbledore was around 100

*** No. He created the legend of Santa Claus during his youth in the 19th century with a motorcycle that didn't exist yet on the M25 that didn't exist yet.

Dumbledore is just THAT GOOD with his hacked time turner.
