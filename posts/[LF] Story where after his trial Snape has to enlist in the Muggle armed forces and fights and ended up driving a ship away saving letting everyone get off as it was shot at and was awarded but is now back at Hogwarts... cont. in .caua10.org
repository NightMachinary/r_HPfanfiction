And some kid I don't remember who maybe Harry maybe an OC maybe a relative I think, somebody, finds his medal in a box with a uniform etc. and asks him about it and he ends up detailing all the stuff and one of his friends he met during the battle(s) that he thought was dead and had seen fall at some point turns out to be alive and I think his name was Ben and he was the uncle of another student and was living in Canada and came to visit Snape

And he is called 'Shake' by students I think b/c of ptsd, might be a different story but I think it's the same one... ?

I think I read it on ff.net sometime in the past few months, it could have been on some other random place- this is driving me insane and I can't for the life of me find this fic that absolutely exists

*PLEASE HELP ME*

Edit: and while I'm posting here another fic or two I'm searching for: Snape leaves Hogwarts and buys like toys and stuff and visits kids with cancer and another Professor follows him. In what might be another fic he knows, maybe it's his niece or something, a young girl with I think Leukemia and they are at the beach and she eventually passes away

Edit: FOUND! For Valour by Whitetail (on potionsandsnitches)


** This story sounds off the wall. I don't know what it is, but I'd really like to read it now
