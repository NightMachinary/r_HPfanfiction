I've seen different variations on interactions between dementors and Harry and the horcrux, but I don't think I've seen this.


** linkao3(15465966) The Second String has this as a plot point.

#+begin_quote
  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Set in fall term of third year the Dementor on train kisses the scar and sucks out the shard of Riddle's soul -- with interesting reaction in the Dementor. Declared 'uninteresting' without the Dark Lord's mark, Harry is deserted by old friends and ignored by Dumbledore but he makes new friends. Then he receives a letter from Dementor who wants something.

** Another one is this one.

​

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10669760/1/Don-t-look-back-in-Anger]]

​

Umbrridge basicly leaves the door of his cell in Azkaban unlocked and he receives the dementor's kiss.

​

Luckily for Harry, he's not occupying his body at the time.

​

What I like most about this story is the fact that he can spirit rove, similar to astral projection.

​

If only more fanfiction stories had branches of magic that's different to what you see in cannon.

​

One miss fired spell later has one that allows him to turn into smoke and travel to places.

​

They called it fumation I think.

​

That one was supposedly getting a sequel, but it's been a couple years since we heard about that and stil nothing.

​

Still, if you're interested in reading it.

** There is the "partially kissed hero" (or "half kissed hero"?), but I honestly wouldn't recommend it.

I remember a ton of Dumbledore and Snape bashing, they were the evilest evil (but not smart, because a smart villain is a stupid idea).

Harry was probably OP, and it is lunar harmony.

I never bothered finishing it.

*** Yep it's Partially Kissed Hero.

It starts out okay but after a while the author decides he loves the sound of his own voice rather than advancing the plot so we get endless dialogue where (usually) Harry and Luna explain something to Hermione. Almost always in response to something a reviewer had said.

Eventually it becomes clear there's no story plan (I recall an author's note saying something like "I'm not sure where to take this") and it meanders until the reader gets bored and gives up.
