By "good" I mean she doesn't care about blood plotitics (or politics in general) she just wants her family to be happy.

Draco is in Gryfindor? Okay! Time to change his green and silver clothing to red and gold.

Draco is friends with Ron, Harry, and Hermione? As long as he's happy, nothing else matters.

She's placed in Slytherin because her ambition to keep her family safe and happy is that strong. When the Dark Lord sends Draco on his quest to kill Dumbledore, Narcissa starts working to either take Voldemort down, or help kill Dumbledore (if she's allowed to, i don't remember the exact orders given to Draco)


** The Narcissa Militant series by Lomonaaeren has a fantastic Narcissa who is an assassin, immensely capable and in control. It's crack with some semi-serious world building/magical theory around light/dark spells, wards, blood magic, etc. Fits your request well because she is entirely focused on keeping her family safe and happy.

  Narcissa is actually the source of the Malfoy family's wealth---and not because she inherited the Black fortune, either. She's an in-demand spy and assassin. But now she's retired, and intent on using all her skills to make sure her baby boy gets what he wants. If that's Harry Potter, then Harry Potter he shall have.

  Magic sends Lucius Malfoy back in time to save Harry Potter. He's as surprised as you are. Thank goodness he has Narcissa at his side.

  Minerva McGonagall steps in on the awful night the Potters are murdered and arranges to have Harry Potter raised by Sirius Black and his somewhat cousins, the Malfoys. Draco and Harry grow up as almost brothers and everything - well, almost everything - is different. Gryffindor!Draco. Dramione. AU.

** I read Blinding Light by 16pennies in which Narcissa helps Hermione escape Malfoy Manor and they both go on the run. I found it quite satisfying. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11371044/1/Blinding-Light]]

** A Different Professor linkffn(11950451)

Not a main character but it's there. Narcissa leaves Lucius and takes Draco with her. Eventually becomes kinda the Team Mom alongside Sirius.

  "Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever." Ginny has been taken to the Chamber of Secrets and Harry may know where that is. How would things have turned out if he had gone to a Different Professor? Rated T for violence and gore
