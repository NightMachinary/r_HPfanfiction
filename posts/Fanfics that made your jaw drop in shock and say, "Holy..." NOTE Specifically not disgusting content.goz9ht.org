For what it's worth, I mean things that might be chilling, might be awesome, I generally do *NOT* mean things that make you want to bleach your eyes with holy water, as one fellow redditor put it. But maybe give you a new appreciation for canon.

I just read this little fanfic just now, about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13502309/1/Molly-Weasley-and-the-Second-Cousin][/Molly Weasley and the Second Cousin/]], who is something of an accountant, and often settles debts.

The end result? Me staring at the screen after I finished reading it for a good 20 seconds before coming here to post this topic.


** linkffn(The Strange Disappearance Of Sally-Anne Perks)

One I cannot recommend enough. It's a mystery that is entertaining, and really made me think about certain characters (won't name them, it'd spoil the ending) and their relationships, and also what it means to lose somebody. All in the context of one specific character...

  Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student.

  Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, he doesn't want to die

** Realignment, the 3-way battle at the Ministry.

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, Imago Dei.

Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament, the Maginot Rouge scene.

Eclipse of the Sky, the tree Horcrux, the island scene, the Forbidden Forest with Carrow, and the rest of the fic.

Defiance, Harry's fight against Dumbledore.

Beyond the Curtain, literally the last scene so far, but the whole fic too is jawdropping.

The Legacy, the Notts scene.

The Mind Arts, the first task and when he discovers what his power seems like.

The Life he Leads, every major Helian Magics use.

Invincible, during the whole construction and departure of the ship.

Hogwarts Battle School, Fulminata, every major battle.

Echoes in the Fog, pretty much the whole fic.

Those are the ones that come to mind. There are several fics that are fantastic, but these are a few that I love. My favourite of the bunch is Eclipse, followed by ITT and then Beyond the Curtain. Echoes is great, but you need to read at least another 7 fics to get it.

#+begin_quote
  Draco Malfoy is convinced that his mother has been murdered, not committed suicide, the way the Aurors have decided. He demands that Harry Potter, disgraced Auror, help him investigate to prove it and catch her killer. But the longer Harry and Draco investigate Malfoy Manor, the more Harry becomes uneasily aware that there is something strange about the stories Draco is telling him---and the little room that's always kept locked.

** I /hate/ Prince of Slytherin (seems to be an unpopular opinion, but there you are), but the moment in year two where diary!Tom reveals his whole plan honestly blew me away. The climax of that story arc (I refuse to call it a book) actually meaningfully used all of the seemingly disparate and ancillary information that came before it, unlike the third year arc, which is honestly just a mess.

* edit: I don't mean that the culmination of diary!Tom's plans was good by PoS' standards, I meant that it's an amazing piece of writing that genuinely knocked my socks off. It's a great example of somebody writing fanfiction specifically for people who read a lot of fanfiction: we're all used to Diarymort opening the Chamber and the basilisk attacking any muggleborn it can with no real long term plan. Realising that /every single attack/ was very specifically targeted to test the school's reactions was incredible, and his plans from there didn't disappoint, either.

**** OP asked about jaw-dropping moments in fanfic. This was a jaw-dropping moment in a fanfic. I don't see how it's off topic. Also, maybe don't tell strangers on the internet what they feel and why? I have no idea why you think "I hate the whole story because of one part," nor to what one part you're referring.

There are things I genuinely love about PoS, but there's a /lot/ more that I don't, and on balance, I consider it to be a /very/ bad story.

* edit, because point of order: your prequel comparison is . . . perplexing to me. People are allowed to dislike things, and they don't need to justify disliking things, to you or anyone else. If someone dislikes the prequel trilogy because of Jar Jar, provided they aren't being a jerk about it, how is that /any/ of your business?

Even beyond that, it's a wildly inaccurate comparison: hating a trilogy of movies because of one character who only plays a prominent role in the first of the three is in no way comparable to hating a million-word story because roughly half of it is a poorly-conveyed tangle of ideas with dismal execution.

I get the “hate the story for one part” because of when you said “unlike the third year arc, which was honestly just a mess”, this along with you hating the tic as well as loving the second arc and not saying anything about the first, suggesting you are indifferent or don't find it worth mentioning, make it seem that you hate it solely due to the third arc

****** I'm not reviewing PoS: I mentioned year three because it was relevant and didn't mention year one because it wasn't. Draw from what I said what conclusions you will, but know that you aren't getting anywhere near my full opinion or thoughts on the fic because I refrained from bogging down my comment in unnecessary and irrelevant information and limited myself to relevant context. Again, make of that what you will.

* edit: also, just to be clear, I didn't love the second arc. I loved parts of it, same as I liked parts of the first and third, and while it's overall my favourite of the three, I still consider it the best of a bad lot. Plenty of media that I genuinely dislike or even hate has done stuff that I adore, and my being able to sincerely praise something I dislike doesn't make me dislike it any less.

** Bear with me, they are both HP x Marvel crossovers.

On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads. I read it on ao3. It might be the fact that I read it all in one night and at 3:20 you start to get emotional at every turn, but it's also fantastic world building by the author and maybe a little cheesy at the very end tbh

Child of the Storm. I'm still reading it on ff.net, but holy... this isn't just world building, it is actual universe building, and it incorporates so many comic elements and references I sometimes have to put my phone down and stare at the wall for a minute. And it's the length of eight novels- 400k+ words. Smh

I recommend OPGAAD for an emotional read, but CotS for a mind-bender.

** Linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House) by Belial666. Valeria, the main character, uses an enhanced version of Neville's potion accident from the first lesson on Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle in the dead of the night after petrifying them so they wouldn't be able to scream and so at the end of the next day they have to be delivered to St-Mungos and they have to stay there for a whole month. Keep in mind that she did that because he made her trip in the stairs and insulted her because of her blood and that was like six/seven hours before she did that to him and it was their first week of first-year. She often munchkins the crap out of magic in a non Mary-Sue way.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
