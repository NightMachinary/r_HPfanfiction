:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This specific fanfiction is Harry surviving, along with Lily. Long story short, they stay in Hosmeade close to Hogwarts as Harry has trouble controlling his magic. I remember he meets Daphne Greengrass and gives her a bracelet (during the summer) and he ends up going to Hogwarts with her not knowing who he was. That's all I can remember.


** Sadlly abandoned. But it was a kind of unique twist on canon and Harry/Daphne in general.

  Harry saves Lily's life when Voldemort comes for them, but this has impacting consequences. Wanting to distance himself, Harry locks himself away until he's finally forced out into the open by his name being called from the Goblet of Fire. This happens in 5th year in my story.

** Firstly sorry, but I can't help you there. Just FYI, you might want to change the flair to "What's the fic?" if you are searching for a specific story, as request is a request for recommendations
