chapter 7

#+begin_quote
  You know a story is good when you're not even halfway through and you're already worried you're reading it too fast! I'm a big fan of HP/Star Trek crossovers, unfortunately it's a ridiculously underrepresented crossover genre. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this one!
#+end_quote

I was bummed about how few there are. Even looking at Star Trek Crossovers with a wildcard, there's still not a lot. And shockingly, this story is pretty highly rated. Like top 1% (number five of followed out of 676 in total). It kinda depresses me that my writing is that highly rated.

#+begin_quote
  So far I'm really enjoying it. Harry is a really interesting character who has seen and done a lot. So many other crossover stories like this would inevitably have him in the Star Trek universe/time at a very young age, relatively inexperienced and unknowledgeable and then subsequently spend the entire story trying to get back to Hogwarts, his friends, and his destined fight with Voldemort. So boring. You sidestepped all of that and changed Harry Potter, his storyline and also weren't afraid to mess with Star Trek details and backstory. I'm really impressed by that. It makes for a much, much, much better story. I mean, it's nice to sometimes tie the story into recognizable canon episodes and events and what not but also nice to truly blaze your own path.
#+end_quote

Swapping around missions and ignoring a few episodes is helpful. And changing some relationships helps. Riker not being able to hook up with Deanna helped fuel Will They/Won't they and let Riker be the Slut of the Series. It was kinda boring. Had it not been a network show we might have seen Riker/Deanna being married and sluts together---nailing species no man has nailed before. This takes place in the new continuity as well, instigated by all the time travels. Having Picard be a stepfather is a little... I don't want to say humanizing but makes him a little more relatable. In the original version, he and Bev had adopted a child years later---now, he still has issues with kids but smarter ones he can more readily handle. Harry interacts more with the Enterprise crew, though mostly by letters/comms.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's people sound fascinating. I'm bummed that Hermione and Fleur have long since passed and obviously spent a long time without Harry, but again, it is freeing story-wise. Bit surprised that Harry hasn't learned, at least in chapter, about their life without him and then their deaths. I suppose it's tough to think about their lives going on for so long without him. Can he summon them with the resurrection stone or its powers? Does he even have it? I mean, there are references to the Hallows everywhere, but I haven't seen him use any Hallow powers beyond the immortality and all. Did he even ask about his children's lives?
#+end_quote

Harry interacts with a number of his descendants. I discuss his views on his wives' paintings. His lack of use of the Hallows---specifically the stone, he uses the wand and the cloak occasionally---will be brought up as well. I'm still debating if he used/uses it offscreen, onscreen, or refuses/d to use it because his wives deserve to have their next great adventure not be disturbed. Or worse, Hermione berates him for not doing things right.

#+begin_quote
  Pretty amazing how far his people have come. Not as far as Harry wanted, obviously, but 2 billion people is quite a magical society from what it was on Earth. Great idea to monetarily encourage their people to have more than one child. Very little mention of any magical innovations they might have come up with in his multi century absence, though. Has there been nothing significantly improved or discovered magically?
#+end_quote

Some things like potions and better versions of spells but really, with magic, there's very little reason to innovate. Some spells had to be modified but they're basically mennonites, stuck in the medieval age. And they don't need to advance. That annoyed Harry.

Even we don't know why we innovated. There're tribes in South America that are still reliant on bows or slings. We may never truly understand why we ever tried to advance beyond simple mechanisms like the lever, I think.

#+begin_quote
  I'm a huge fan of world building and this story has a lot of it. It's been great fun so far, especially with Harry immediately being named Emperor and leading his people. This hinted to prophecy is obviously pretty significant since Harry is sinking so much of his personal wealth and his people's wealth into the endeavor, though I'm not sure of that last part. Does the government have wealth that is usable off their planet? Still not 100% sure he made the best deal for the mining rights on that planet but you sold it pretty well narratively. I also think it's fun that he's looking for alternative methods to increase his coffers. With clever uses of magic he can stand to make a lot. Even those cargo vessels can be used to make a great deal. If he can hide the spatial expansion and weight reductions he could take huge amounts of cargo in a single trip to begin paying back the cost of those ships. The mention of going after the Orion Syndicate or the Cardassians promises to be fun. If he makes a friend of Bajor now, especially with the wormhole soon to be discovered, that could provide huge benefits to his people.
#+end_quote

Technically, this is still the prologue of the story.

As for the spatial modifications of cargo, it's being done but they have to be careful because if they deliver X(a full ship's cargo)*3 to planet Y, then people will be “What the fuck?!” So they have to deliver only enough for each leg to make it look feasible but they can use the spatial modifications to change cargos en route then fake travel logs to make it look like they traveled somewhere else at high warp while really having the item aboard already. Got ten million tonnes of kevas but the planet you're going to is now more in need ten million tonnes of seed grain? Just a quick swap of cargo pods from their hidden compartments and voila, you're delivering the more expensive cargo.

God, I wish there was a really, really good sequel to Freelancer. Fucking loved that game.

#+begin_quote
  I'm glad you have no desire for Harry or his people to interact much with Earth and humanity nor any plans for his people to join the Federation. It's freeing. That line from an early chapter talking about the utopia of Earth and the Federation could not, CAN NOT exist without villains in the background making it possible, aka Section 31...I found that an amazing line. Really fascinating stuff. His close relations with both Vulcan and the Klingon Empire will likely ruffle a lot of feathers, but it's certainly been profitable for both and both seem to be getting along swimmingly. I imagine Earth and many in Starfleet are going to be utterly confused by Harry's people wanting nothing to do with humanity.
#+end_quote

Harry is Section 31 in a way. He'll do anything to save his people "From the terrible secrets of space," he says in a sing-song voice.

#+begin_quote
  Speaking of the Klingons, I have a strong feeling that they've been long aware of Section 31's existence. Given Harry's adoption by a ruling caste member, I would not be surprised if Harry was told about the group and finally discovered the identity of the so called “villains” of the Federation he already suspected were working behind the scenes. It's not hard to guess that they're also the ones behind all the tracking devices on his ship.
#+end_quote

I'm debating that. In ST!Canon, I think the Klingons dealt with them in Enterprise(begins in 2151), right? Dessel'b may be old enough to have been around then(story beings about 2363ish I think)(going with their dotage being about 270-300 years with the oldest Klingon ever being 340(the klingons have seriously redundant systems)), though a child at the time. Harry knows who keeps putting the trackers on his ship: they may have been able to reroute his security because it was a federation ship but they couldn't stop Darby from seeing them enter the ship and take photos with a camera.

#+begin_quote
  All the new ships and technology have been great. It's kind of amazing what his people are capable of with the Vulcan's help and with their Emperor actively encouraging his people to innovate and reach for more. I'm also getting a huge kick out of Harry using his 20th and 21st century sci-fi knowledge to inspire designs like the Iron Man armor. Speaking of that knowledge, WW3 and the Eugenics Wars on Earth destroyed a lot of that stuff. Harry could make a huge amount of money by setting up a catalog of these “lost” pieces of Earth culture for people to view. He could make even more by converting some of the more popular ones into holonovels. That'd be a nice source of income that he wouldn't need to do much for and it would fund a lot of his activities.
#+end_quote

Planning on that

#+begin_quote
  Oh, by the way, I think it's really cool that Harry's mate is writing a holonovel of his life. I also think a Vulcan mate is pretty noteworthy, but I'm very glad that you're acknowledging that as Emperor of his people Harry is going to have a lot of pressure upon him to marry a witch or 5. In fact politically it might be a good idea to take at least one veela, one hybrid magical, and one wife from the other humanoid magical species.
#+end_quote

No comment on relationship stuff at the moment except Harems will NOT happen. But I do like the idea of his cock being lent out to certain people... maybe a sidestory that doesn't affect the actual story. Some serious engorging spells to knock up a giantess maybe?

#+begin_quote
  I'm a huge fan of the story so far and I'm happy to favorite this story. My profile gets a lot of monthly hits so I hope more people will check it out and review. I'm looking forward to more!
#+end_quote

I'm glad you're enjoying it. Your very long review caused a weird sensation in my chest. Someone told me it was pride and/or happiness. I'll have to take their word for it.

** I personally love the story, but I just don't have the flair to leave good, constructive reviews. I'm glad someone else can put a lot of what I'm thinking of down for you to see.

Congratulations though! ♥

**** There are some negatives/criticism in the review if you look for them. Like the lack of Hallows powers/knowledge of his wives lives, etc. It's a good, supportive review, but I can see some advice in there. ^ _ ^

** That guy has a wall of text about his Twilight pairing preferences on his profile page, so make of it what you will.

He left several lengthy reviews for my story, but soured on it once the plot and characters started to drift away from where /he/ wanted them to go.
