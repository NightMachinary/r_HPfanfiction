Cracky question, I know, but I'm genuinely curious if someone could make a WMD Choir now. :D

Best I can come up with is to get a person with colour-based synaesthesia (sees music as colour), ear-muff them up so the Mandrake Sounds only knock them out instead of kill them, and rely on the colours and patience to get it done bit by bit. :D
