** The first and only time I saw Harry Potter was the day before the trial. He looked nothing like the pictures in the Prophet, a proud and striking man with flecks of grey in his unruly black hair. The man before me looked nothing like him, unkempt and haggard. He shuffled forward towards me, and my eyes instinctively flicked up to his forehead. His eyes flashed in annoyance and he picked up a badge.

“Business?”, I spoke quietly, wishing I was anywhere but here.

“Harry Potter.”, voice cracking as he refused to meet my eyes. “Here for the sentencing of Albus Severus Potter.”
