And none of that Firebird 'boo hoo this took 2 chapters to resolve' shit. A real, tangible storyline where he has other motives than not getting a piece of Lily-white butt.

Also some incest smut if you have it. Toodles!


** The only fics I can think of is By The Divining Light and Conlaodh's Song linkffn(By The Divining Light; Conlaodh's Song).

He was definitely on Voldemort's side.

** You know what would be super interesting? If Sirius was a sleeper agent, used the Imperius curse against Peter to do all of the betraying and murdering, and didn't expect to go to jail without a trial, and then used this as the ultimate cover for his spying against the order.

*** Oooh, that'd be an insane idea. Just gotta remember that you can't break the Fidelius just by Imperiusing someone, so Sirius would've had to lie about that part.

  PS/SS AU. What if Sirius Black had been the one who tried to kill Harry? Harry Potter arrives at Hogwarts for his first year, but all is not what it seems. Will he uncover the secret that has been kept from him for eleven years?
