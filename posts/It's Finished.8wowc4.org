Omg guys, there is such an immense relief and accomplishment finishing a long fic which has taken me almost 13 years to complete! 13 years I've poured my creativity into Imprisoned Realm. Last night I posted the epilogue.

Love it or hate the fic, please celebrate with me. :)

** Congratulations! Sticking with a story for 12.5 years and not abandoning it is quite frankly, amazing. Also, your summary is captivating.

** Major props to you. That's a lot of dedication across a large chunk of your life.

What's next? Freedom from the fandom? Extensive edits? Something new?

*** I'm just going to edit a few chapters a little, nothing major and that's it. I'm done with writing and participating in HP fandom. If of course, JKR turns around and writes more HP books, then I might join in again. I will continue to lurk in fandom though. :)

#+begin_quote
  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war?

** Congrats!! I have a story that I haven't been able to touch for a year or two, started it over 8 years ago, but I have half of the next chapter written and there's only 3 more to go until the story is really done. I just can't get myself to rush write them, I need to do them justice, but I just don't have the time to D: I'll give yours a read!
