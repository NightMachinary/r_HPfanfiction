But yeah, can people recommend fics where Voldemort won either of the wars and there's still a resistance movement opposed to him. Either something the Order or other factions. I've just been reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9591005/1/Champion][Champion by OctaviusOwl]] and was wondering if there were anymore fics like that out there.

Thanks in advance.

Sorry if I tagged that wrong, by the way. I was just going off [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3e71xm/meta_the_difference_between_lf_and_req/][this]] thread for how to tag.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] had Voldemort win and rule Britain, and there's certainly still a resistance movement. Voldemort is not a terrible ruler in it, although he's still not exactly nice.

** Hi! I am currently writing such a fanfic. It's WIP and not fully 'tidied up' yet, but it's at ~80k words and I have a new chapter nearly ready. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3705335/chapters/8200329][Harry Potter and the Unspeakables I - Ynys Afal: The Island of Apples]]. Basically, some shenanigans went down at the beginning of the war and Harry and several others were taken out of action so Voldemort won. Now, almost a decade later, they're back with a plan. It's quite AU, but I'm not rewriting canon rules and stuff in the main, just... it's set in another timeline, I guess.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  Voldemort has launched an all out war on the Wizarding World, and has taken the Boy Who Lived. But he has not reckoned on the resourcefulness of Hermione Granger. HHr developing in a sort of postapocalyptic environment.

*** I found it interesting that Hermione's goal in this story was, in her own words, to help Harry. It wasn't to defeat Voldemort, restore her homeland to a stable government, end oppression, safeguard the millions of people Voldemort would attempt to slaughter; her primary goal was to help Harry.

Then there was a scene where [[#s][spoilers]] miscarried a child and found out their husband died, and then she decided her own death might have been kinder. I would have expected [[#s][spoilers]].

**** Absolutely not. Firstly, you're seriously minimising the trauma of a miscarriage, like massively and that's not even getting into her husband dying.

Secondly reread the second task in GOF and tell me she is someone who deals with family trauma well.

**** I mean, that's kind of Hermione's goal in canon as well. Sure, she wants to make the wizarding world safer and fairer to muggleborns and magical creatures, but her primary reason for having a dog in the fight is because Harry's one of her best friends and she wants to protect him any way she can.

Like [[/u/AWookieeFromKashyyyk]] said, miscarriages are hard on anyone, even the sternest woman. Add in the fact that her husband as well as her unborn child died, and it's hard to imagine even some of the strongest people getting back up on their feet after that. To simply say she should be harder than that and seek revenge is a bit naive and is a bit lacking in empathy for women who have been in a similar situation.

I think that that's overstating it a bit, and somewhat demeaning to her character. Hermione is a Muggleborn, and a prominent one, so she'd have a proverbial dog in the fight whether or not Harry existed; and she is a Gryffindor who thinks big, so she works to make the world a better place (whether the world wants it or not), regardless of what Harry thinks. As it happens, most of the fight against Voldemort revolves around Harry (due to a prophecy that all sides believe in), so she ends up providing a lot of organizational support and logistics for Harry. However, can you name /one/ occasion in canon where the goals of protecting Harry and defeating Voldemort were at odds, and she chose protecting Harry?

****** Off the top of my head? No. But I also can't really think of a time where she chooses defeating Voldemort over protecting Harry either.

A more simple way to put this is: Do you think Hermione (or Ron, for that matter) would prefer a dead Harry and a dead Voldemort, to a live Harry and a live Voldemort? Somehow, I don't think it's the former. Which is probably why Harry avoids telling either about his suicide mission at the end of DH.

That is true. That said, to give an extreme example, Stunning Harry, feeding him the Draught of Living Death, and shipping him and herself off to Australia could have worked. :D

That's a good thought experiment, and I am honestly not sure which she would choose if she were absolutely certain that this was the only way. However, I don't think that it tells us as much as we might like.

Basically, suppose that the choice were instead between a dead /X/ and Voldemort and a live /X/ and Voldemort, where /X/ is anyone she knows personally and likes (e.g., Ginny, Remus, Bill). Would her preference be different from the /X/=Harry case?

Very true. Of course, that could all be considered protecting Harry in a pretty roundabout way.

I think the answer would be the same regardless of who it is. It speaks more to Hermione's character, in that she's not likely to leave any of her friends behind, if she can.

Roundabout? Seems like the most direct way possible to me: knock him out, put him into suspended animation, and sequester him somewhere far, far away from danger. :D

That's where I am not sure... We know that she's the most ruthless of the trio as it is. By the end of DH, Harry, who was, at the start, reluctant to Stun his enemies off brooms because they might fall off and get hurt, and they might be victims of the Imperius was, by the end of DH, casting Crucios on impulse and applying the Imperius as needed. Hermione had gone through the same experiences, except that she was also tortured by Bellatrix with the Cruciatus and scarred by her; and, unlike the others, she's actually studied the Dark Arts systematically in her research on Horcruxes.

Even that aside, I am glad that we agree that it's not about Harry as such; fanfic paradigms where Hermione's life revolves around Harry's are a bit of a pet peeve.

********** Yeah, we're on the same page, but I think I phrased my original post rather poorly: Hermione's primary reason IMO for fighting is to protect her friends; it just so happens Harry's the one in the most danger the most often.

And while she does have a vindictive streak, I don't think Hermione's ruthlessness extends to leaving friends to die so that she can possibly put an end to Voldemort. Maybe in a post-apocalyptic situation where Voldemort rules with an iron fist, but in canon? Pretty unlikely.

************ That's a tougher sell. I'd like to say no, but we never get a good enough look into her head to really tell for sure. After all, she does often criticise Harry's innate need to save everyone, so she is a bit more pragmatic than fanfic writers think (i.e. that Hermione's an incurable ingenue that wants to save the world and everything in it).
