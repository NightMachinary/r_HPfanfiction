Im looking for long (100k+ preferred) fics where there is good focus on occlumency learning, with sorting memories, mindscapes etc.

Bonus for harry taking the war seriously and not throwing stunners, but killing DE's. Bashing is welcomed. No slash fics please


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), has Dumbledore training both Harry and Ron in Occlumency and Legilimency. The body count is enormous, and Legilimency is decisive in this story.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]], linkffn(11574569), has lots of occlumency, but no body counts yet.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

There is no war in there so far. But it has a very studious fem!Harry. Mind arts are a great part of the first year and Harry continues to perfect it as years go by. Mindscapes? Check. Storing memories? Check.

#+end_quote

This just gave me an idea:

The fic starts with this awful trope, played completely straight. Ranty, childish, immature Harry making shitty arguments about dark magic and ethics, going around killing Death Eaters.

Then Harry is caught, put on trial, and rightly convicted as a murderer. Basically Harry as the wizarding equivalent of that guy in the UK who recently drove a car into a crowd of Muslims, thinking he was "fighting back" - he goes around thinking he's acting in defence, but actually is just an alt-right mass murderer nutjob.

**** More likely that Indy!Harry went around lashing out against any perceived Death Eaters. He might have caught a few real ones on his rampage, but the great majority of his victims were innocents or didn't deserve to be killed.

His actions sparked outrage in Magical Britain and Voldemort gained quite a few more sympathizers.

It's about Harry's perception, not about reality. Like the guy who ran over Muslims, Harry */thinks/* he's attacking the enemy, but is actually just going around killing people.

In the future perhaps try not to go around looking for excuses to be offended.

It is an /analogy./ An analogy does not require that all details of the situations be the same--if they were identical, it wouldn't be an analogy--only that some pertinent detail is.

All of this is quite clearly outlining the reversal of the situation in the first paragraph, which was quite clearly phrased as "playing the trope straight" i.e. it's not what's actually going on, but you fool the reader into thinking it is, before pulling a switcheroo.

** From what I remember, linkffn(Stronger Than Hope by Alaunatar) has this. Snape is also as much of a bastard as ever, which I liked.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Enemy Within by Theowyn of HPG) and its sequel linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chained Souls by Theowyn of HPG) also has good descriptions of Occlumency and it played a pretty big role in the war.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has a lot on Occulmency and Legimency. In this universe, anyone can learn either although there's a very, very small portion of people who are naturally born as a fully-trained Occulmens or Legimens (similar to being born a Metamorphmagus). It also takes a long, long time (so Harry and co. can't just master it overnight) and is treated like a real skill (so someone like Dumbledore, who's been practicing for decades, isn't gonna be blocked by a Harry who's only been practicing for 2 years).

It's also quite dangerous, as you're re-writing the way your brain thinks and because of this the fic explores alternatives to keeping your mind from being read (which makes it seem more real to me because in real life there's more than 1 way to solve a problem.)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

Facing off against enemies old and new, very few things could come more naturally to him. No Slash. AU. Dimension Travel with a dash of Time Travel.
