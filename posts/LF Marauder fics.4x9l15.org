I'm trying to find a novel length or series that follows the marauders through all 7 years of Hogwarts. Doesn't matter if it's centric on one of the four but I would like it to be mostly canon. I've been searching but haven't had much luck with anything that's well written. Any input would be lovely!

  This is the story of four boys. This is the story of how these four boys came to know each other, of how they became friends. This is the story of their unbreakable bond that could survive any test. This is a story that will ultimately end in tragedy.
