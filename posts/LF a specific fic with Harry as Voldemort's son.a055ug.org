It was a Drarry fic, I can't really remember much of it but near the beginning after Harry overhears James and Dumbledore(I think, might be someone else) planning to kill him he locks his bedroom door that night, plays it off as not meaning to in the morning when Lily wakes him up, and runs away that day. Later in the story Lily leaves James, finds Harry, and gets together with Snape.


** Probably this one by Tiro.
