*** I think there's only 5 authors I follow who update with any regularity I usually consider a story updated within the last 2 years to still be active. I always find it strange when people say a story is abandoned after a couple months of no update when there are plenty of story's that have gone years before an update was posted. hell that one fic where Harry has to have sex with a bunch of people to transfer magic to them because he stole magic from Voldemort when he killed him got updated and finished last year even though the last update had been in 2009.
