I remember a fanfic where a female tom riddle possessed Ginny, even after Harry destroyed the diary, and brought Harry back down to the chamber of secrets. It had a lemon in it if I remember correctly.


** I hope someone has the answer because now I'm curious as well.

** I feel like you're looking for linkffn(The Merging). It's been awhile since I read it but I'm pretty sure I remember that happening.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
