I don't remember the main plot but what I do remember is Remus, Fred, George and Severus all make a trip together to Privet Drive to drive the Dursleys crazy. Fred and George paint with various horrendous shades one of which is so bad Snape awards points. Another bit was everything breaks but there's no visible sign of disrepair. They also enlarge some of Petunia's lingerie to make it look like Vernon's having an affair. Anyone know the title?


** This took a bit of searching. Some of the points don't add up.

Snape is not present nor is there any painting. I'm not positive if this is the one or not,but chapter 18 in linkffn(Harry Potter and the price of being noble) such as the underwear and pranks.

If it's not it sorry!
