Now, I'm not picky about this one. I just want a Harry that is VERY sarcastic and has that sh** eating grin.

Here are some ideas for what i'd like to see in the story (optional)

-Harry f***ing with the Timeline cause he can\\
-Harry purposely acting like Tom Riddle to scare the Sh** out of Dumbledore and other teachers

-He can be a god at magic

-He can be the master of death

-He can team up with Moldyshorts *cough* i mean Voldemort and screw up time lines together


** *Oh God Not Again!* - linkffn(4536005)\\
Harry wakes up on the island where Hagrid meets him for the first time. He decides to just have fun. My favorite quote is "It's a good thing that Professor McGonagall warned me not to open this broomstick-shaped package at the table. After all, something that is shaped exactly in the form of a broom can be so many, many things,"

*Boredom Is Deadly* - linkffn(11305455)\\
Harry never had a "next great adventure" because of the whole Master of Death thing. He found a loophole and decides to do it. Calls up Voldemort to plan it out and gets drunk. They wake up to a scroll of parchment. Things are changed. Come on down to hogwarts to learn magic, where you get sorted by the Sorting Kettle into one of four houses: Gryffindork, Ravenflaw, Huffleduff, and Slytherin.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  For Harry, the 'next great adventure' isn't really all that great. After two-thousand years of dealing with the whining souls of the dead, he decides to spice things up a bit...by returning to his first year at Hogwarts. Crackfic! MOD!Harry Darkish!Harry GaryStu!Harry with a twist. NO Bashing!

** Triple Trouble has this. Harry, Voldemort, and Grindlewald all end up in 1991 as 11 year olds with all of their memories up to the point right before they died. It's very silly but sadly unfinished. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12983913/chapters/29683959]])

  Dumbledore would regret the decision to hand over the school letters to the house elves, even if it did save him hours in admin. Eleven year old Harry Potter was expected... Tom Riddle and Gellert Grindelwald... yeah, not so much. However that might turn out to be the least of the school's problems.

** linkao3(full circle) has pretty much most of what you asked for. It is Tom Riddle/Harry Potter though, so if you aren't up for that beware.

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)
