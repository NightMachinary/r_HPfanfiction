:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfic.

I think it is based in Harry's first year and involves a few of the 5/6th year Slytherins, despite harry sorting gryffindor, he met one in Diagon alley I think. He notices Harry's underweight/small maybe some bruises and subtley get potions to repair damage done in things like his toothpaste with some help from a friend (other Slytherin). Their parents find out and aren't best pleased. Percy notices the potions and ends up helping I think once it's explained it's not for bad reasons maybe Oliver wood helps too I'm not sure .

Not going to lie I'm patchy on the details.

I appreciate any help, thank you.
