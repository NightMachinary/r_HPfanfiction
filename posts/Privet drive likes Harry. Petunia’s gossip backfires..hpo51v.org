This popped into my head tonight. I want a fic where Petunia and Vernon go around spreading rumors about their horrible delinquent nephew. But they forget to describe what he looks like because they think there is no way a freak could be mistaken for their Dudley.

But the neighborhood looks at the kids' behavior and think Dudley is Harry and Harry is Dudley.

Petunia doesn't find out until she's talking to a neighbor and the neighbor mentions that she really should stop her nephew from stealing his cousin's food. Her poor son looks like skin and bones while her horrid nephew looks like a Boulder come to life. While Petunia is still confused, the neighbor could continue to point out all of Dudley's horrible behavior and bullying and delinquent actions all the while saying it was obvious how true her assessment of her nephew was and how “Dudley” (Harry) is such a kind and polite child with a heart of gold.

People can take it further with the Dursley's reactions or not. As long as correcting the assumption of the boys' names doesn't change opinions of who each really is.

Edit: For those who wanted a reminder, I want to give a warning that I'm not a writer. I can come up with some interesting ideas, but can never manage to turn them into stories. But if someone wants to write this, please go ahead and send me a link!


** "I am sorry, ma'am, but my name is Harry, Harry Potter."

Mrs. McClane looked at Harry in an odd way, and he had to hold himself so as to not flinch. So this was the end then? He guessed it was too good to be true, she would spread that to the other neighbors and Harry could kiss goodbye to the `chores`, the lessons, the cookies.

But instead of sneering, she smiled and ruffled his hair "So you are, /Harry."/

It spread like fire the next day, how Petunia Dursley mistreated and badmouthed her nephew, Harry, while coddling Dudley, the miscreant.

It was decided they would keep the ruse until they could help Harry properly.

----

Harry was at Mr. Lane home today, helping in the garden, he loved working in Mr. Lane's garden, it wasn`t that much different from his Aunt's but the hat, and tools provided helped a lot, the plenty of water and the lemonade and sandwiches at the end were just a bonus.

Mr. Lane exited his house with a cup of cold water for Harry, he was without his cane today, so his leg wasn't hurting as usual. He was among Harry's favorite neighbors, not only because he was kind to him, but he had all those medals and Uncle Vernon was /scared/ of him.

"Ah, nice work on those Roses, lad, they look much better."

He gestured for Harry to sit in the lawn chairs, and placed the cup on the small table, after removing his gloves and cleaning his hands with the hose, Harry did so and drank the cold water, not being able to stop the sound of contentment that came from his throat, he blushed, but Mr. Lane just laughed.

"Nothing like some cold water after a day's work, eh?"

Harry nodded, and Mr. Lane smiled at him, "You know, Harry, you remind me of myself at your age," he looked around the garden, "you did good work today, what do you say about a lesson on those books from my service time you look so much at?"

Harry's eyes widened, he was looking for a way to politely refuse but then Mr. Lane said, "I was thinking we could begin with one of my favorite ones," he grinned, "The Art of War, by a very wise man called Sun Tzu."

------

Every week, the young couple of the neighborhood, Mr. and Mrs. Smithson went for their weekly outing and left Harry to care for little Jimmy. Jimmy adored Harry and treated him like a big brother, on those days, Harry normally played with him, heated their dinner, gave him a bath and then put the boy to sleep with his favorite movie(and Harry's too), The Sword in the Stone.

Harry's favorite character was Merlin, but he never, ever, could let his relatives hear him say that, Aunt Petunia hated that name for some reason.

That week, however, Mrs. Smithson said they were going to the movies, Harry nodded and with a sadder smile than he wanted, bid her farewell and turned to leave, before being stopped with a gentle hand in his shoulder.

"Oh, Harry, we want you to come too, who's going to prevent Jimmy from making a mess with all the popcorn?"

Harry couldn't contain his smile and asked what movie they were going to see.

"Oh, it came out a few years ago, but this month they are showing the entire trilogy together, it's called Star Wars."

That night, Harry had a new favorite movie and a new favorite character. In the following two weeks, Harry watched the other two movies in his babysitting nights, and the Smithsons even took him to McDonald's, he had never been happier.

----

Normally, Vernon and Petunia would've put a stop to it, but they received a visit from the very normal and respectable, and /tall/ son of Mr. Lane, /Captain/ Lane from the Royal Army. Who said Harry was a very kind, respectable boy and alluded to how he had friends in Her Majesty service that would like to know if he was being treated well.

----

Mrs. Figg looked relieved every time she saw Harry smiling.

----

Dudley stopped his Harry Hunting one day when Mr. Kent from Number 11 caught him by the ear and dragged him to the Dursley's door and reprimanded Petunia in full view of the street about how her son was a hooligan and why couldn't he be like Harry.

Harry had a sleepover with Jimmy that night.

----

On Christmas, Harry got almost as many gifts as Dudley did, mostly clothes and some toys, he cried himself to sleep that night, of happiness this time.

----

When Harry was nearing his eleventh birthday, a new family moved into Privet Drive, the Summers, a young couple. Mr. Summers was British but Mrs. Summers was French, they moved so their daughter, Eloise, which was the same age as Harry. could go to a boarding school in Scotland.

When they heard Harry's name, they looked very surprised, and when they quickly integrated into the grapevine, Mr. Summers would glare at Harry's relatives and the couple always finds a way to invite him for dinner in the nights he would dine at his relative's. Aunt Petunia just sniffed.

Mr. Summers apparently liked the color yellow, with a bit of black, Mrs. Summer always preferred light blue for some reason.

They told him Eloise's school name was Hogwarts and were very confused and somewhat angry when he told them he never heard of it and how Uncle Vernon told him he was going to St. Brutus, Mr. Summer said he very much doubted that.

Eloise was Harry's first friend of his own age, she had the most beautiful shade of red hair Harry had ever seen. They played a lot, and Eloise taught him all the children's games he had only watched sullenly while other kids played.

Dudley tried to bully her like he did anyone who tried to befriend Harry, but stopped when she kicked him right between his legs, his friends tried to help but they tripped and fell(all at the same time), Harry thought Eloise was the coolest girl ever.

His birthday party happened in the Summer's house, it was the best day of his life, Mrs. McClane made him a big cake and Mrs. Smithson made all kinds of party foods.

The house was beautifully decorated, and Harry was pretty sure he had more gifts than Dudley(who apparently had a stomach ache and couldn't come), not that he counted. Mr. Lane gave him a wristwatch that had the Army insignia in it, the Smithsons gave him three books from a series called The Lord of The Rings(Mr. Summer laughed when he saw that). Eloise gave him a box to open later, and kissed him in the cheek, which made everyone laugh when he blushed crimson.

He was still coming down from his high, when after the party, during dinner with the Summers, two owls(!) swopped in and delivered letters, the first to Eloise and the second to Harry, Harry thought it had been a mistake(he had seen owls in the neighborhood since the Summers had moved in, but never paid attention), but it was his name in the envelope. Eloise was smiling and saying she finally could tell him a lot of things.

"Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry..." he read faintly.

Mr. Summer approached him around the table and placed his hand on the boy's shoulder.

"Harry, there are some things you must know, we waited until you received your letter, but this only confirms one thing we already knew."

"What, Sir?" Harry asked with wide eyes.

"You are a Wizard, Harry."

**** I was thinking of putting Harry in Ravenclaw, he would be much more studious, confident, and even ambitious enough for the Hat to consider Slytherin, if not for his views on Muggles.

He wants to be in the Military and see the world like Mr. Lane(WW2+ Veteran), finds out the closest thing to that is an ICW Warlock(think Interpol Agent with a bit of MI6) and decides that's what he wants to be(at least initially). I may make up some British gov aligned magical force though(MI7?) just so Harry can say he wants to serve Her Majesty.

The School Summers would be him learning more about his neighbors (that become his family), getting practically raised by them, and making up watered down versions of his adventures(there was this very two-faced teacher or once a snake got in the school grounds and I had to kill it.)

He wouldn't be best friends with Ron and Hermione though, probably be closest to the Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff axis and only intervene at the very end of the year.

At best they'd have an academic rivalry, friendly or not, going on, and even then that acquaintanceship would really begin in their third year, if they take the same electives.

Ravenclaws and Gryffindors, IIRC, had very few classes together.

******* Basically you use a semicolon when you have two sentences that can be stand alone, but you want the pause between the two sentences to be shorter. You can also use them before words such as “however,” “nevertheless,” and “therefore.” People often use semicolons to vary the sentence lengths in a paragraph or two link two ideas together more.

******* I have only taken an English class twice in the last four years, but here's my try at explaining it. I hope it helps!

Semi-colons are used like commas and conjunctions, as a “soft period/full stop” used to give more explanation after it, or to separate items in a list.

An example of the first type: “We have been on the train for hours, but we're nowhere near our destination” can turn into “we have been on the train for hours; we're nowhere near our destination.” Both the part before the semi-colon and the part after must be full sentences, and typically the part after explains a little something more than the first or draws conclusions or something like that. In modern fiction and essay writing, this is the most common usage.

An example of a list using semi-colons is as follows: the sky, filled to the brim with stars; the moon, speckled with iridescent craters; and the annual meteor shower that meant someone, somewhere is wishing incredibly hard for something. In this case, you use a colon to set off the list at first, and then semi-colons to separate the items on the list. It's very common in the classics that have very long sentences with many commas because it can be difficult to distinguish different entries to a list of they all have about fifteen commas.

** I love the idea , a much more well adjusted harry would be awesome, especially if after the whole name confusion is fixed they still know that harry is the innocent one and the whole community becomes like a foster family to harry, families getting harry to babysit for them for which they take him out to parks and movies, grannies call him over to feed him as they think he's too skinny he does household chores for them, grandpas call him over just to chat and end up teaching him things they both enjoy like crafts, woodworking, camping exercising etc, and in the end it's a strong, knowledgeable harry with a big brother mentality that comes to Hogwarts and takes his whole year under his wing, helping Neville study, supporting Hermione to socialize, encouraging Ron to find his niche, limiting Draco's entitled behaviour etc . Bonus by considering the whole street his family the bloodwards cover the whole area.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
