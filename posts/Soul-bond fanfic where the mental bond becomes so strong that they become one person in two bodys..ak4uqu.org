I was reading a fanfic with a soul bond recently where it was mentioned that Harry and Hermione could share knowledge with each other through their fancy mental link and that triggered a thought: what if you took that to its illogical extreme and made them share personality traits, likes/dislikes, opinions, and a name (Harrmoine Janes Granger-Potter Is a excellently horrible name in my opinion).

â€‹

It's a soul bond between Harry and Ginny, for all intents and purposes they are one person. There's this interesting conversation between Molly and Harry where it lays out that Harry shares a lot of the same Wizarding World interests as Ginny because he never experienced them before meeting Ginny, therefore he likes what she likes in the WW, while she likes what things he did like in the Muggle World.

It also delves rather deeply into what sort of experiences follow with having this sort of bond. It started on the Philosopher's Stone, with initial intentions to go throughout the series, but unfortunately its currently on indefinite hiatus after the Chamber of Secrets sequel.

If Sovran restarts the story, be prepared for long waits between chapters(like almost a year in a couple of circumstances).

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.
