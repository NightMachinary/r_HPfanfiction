I can't explain why I'm yearning to reread this well-written, moving, but devestatingly sad fic, but I'm becoming a bit desperate about ever finding it again.

I can't describe it well enough to make it identifiable without spoiling, sorry about that anyone who hasn't read it. Last chance to turn back--but if you /all/ do, I won't get any responses! So if you read a lot of fanfiction about a decade ago and want to help, please read on and I'll give all the details I recall.

I remember it as very short, maybe only one chapter. It was written early in the series while Harry was still quite young. Albus and Severus have taken Harry away somewhere, to an isolated location, a hut or cottage. I don't think it was a cave.

He lives with them there for a period of time in preparation for a ritual. On the day, they feed him a specific meal, a porridge made of some kind of grain, and I think they dress him a certain way, style his hair a certain way, and possibly create a specific cut on his skin?

It gradually becomes clear that he is going to be ritually sacrificed to vanquish the Dark Lord. (Not far from the actual plotline as it turned out.)

Albus and Severus are sad but resolute, and Harry is innocent and trusting, and it's heart wrenching.

The format of the ritual was based on the injury patterns and stomach contents of one or more of the ritually sacrificed [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Croghan_Man][bog bodies]] found in Ireland, implying it was an ancient ritual that has to be repeated periodically.

I keep thinking it was by Cybele, but apparently not. I must have read the also wonderful and devastating /If You Are Prepared/ around the same time and linked the two in my mind.


** I know I'm late to this post, but omg If You Are Prepared. Why'd you have to remind me of that :( That's actually the story I thought you might have been describing until you mentioned it at the end. Kinda want to go find it but I'm not sure if I'm up for that emotional journey.
