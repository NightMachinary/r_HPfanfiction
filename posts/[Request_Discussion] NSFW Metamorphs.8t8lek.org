** I do remember reading a story that wasn't smut but had something like this in it. Harry and Ron were aurors and Ron was giving Harry crap about his one gay romance. A celebrity chaser had polyjuiced himself into Harry's wife and slept with him. Ron thinks it's the funniest thing that he ever heard.

Don't remember the story name unfortunately.

** I stumbled upon [[http://rakked.tumblr.com/post/54276391336/the-horsecock-harry-potterverse][this]] set of commissioned works, which feature Harry using a particular transfiguration spell on his junk. It's pure smut, and has a couple interesting pairings.

Edit: There's also Tonks using her powers for fun too.
