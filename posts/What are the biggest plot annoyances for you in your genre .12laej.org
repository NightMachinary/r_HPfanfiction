I read Severus/Hermione and the biggest plot stickler for me is not developing their relationship enough to make a relationship believable. I'll be the first to admit that it's a fantastically AU pairing, but I love it and it /can/ be done well. However, there are far too many stories that are decent until the pair have their first somewhat emotional moment/encounter/event, and then they are suddenly in love and realize that they have totally always loved each other forever. No. NO. That is in no way a vaguely realistic way for any romance involving these two to happen.

What are the some major sticking points for plots in your genre?


** Okay first one. Who the hell is Daphne Greengrass? I mean, yes I know of the character, but in many fanfics, she is always shown as the hottest damn girl in Slytherin. Like, where the hell did she come from and why is she so damn desired? Astoria, I could understand a bit more but Daphne? Who the heck are you girl?

Second one is Ron. Hey, even I'm guilty of this in my current fic but why the hell does he have to be the bad guy all the time? He was immature sure, but he wasn't bad enough to warrant all the hate he gets in fics. Even Draco got more good respect than Ron. I have a sneak suspicion it's due to the fact that everyone's dream girl Hermione ended up with Ron instead of Harry. Don't hate yo, gingers gotta have love too.

Next, the circlejerk fics or what some call the crackfics. I don't hate them, but I do get annoyed at the ones where Harry is badass out of no where and 5068 chapters of absolutely no conflict at all. I mean, some are just chapter after chapter of Harry being better than every single person he meets. It's like, damn, if you're going to overpower Harry, overpower Dumbledore into being able to destroy entire cities by eating babies or something so it somewhat balances out. I want some drama damn it!

And finally, not a complaint but did anyone else notice you can't have a "Harry interacting with Slytherins" fanfic without Blaise Zabini? I mean, dude was described as arrogant and slightly douche in canon, why is he so damn vital to any interaction with Slytherins all the time? Every time I see him, I sing to myself "everyone knows, it's Blaise!"

*** Oh Crackfics, sometimes they are so good and sometimes they are so bad. And Ron Hate. SSHG gets a lot of Ron Hate. There is a trope in SSHG about Ron "stuffing his face" all the time, and I'm sure it goes into other genres as well, but there was a wonderful crackfic that was basically all the wildly OOC Snape things and Ron stuffing his face obsessively before dieing. Ron Hate can be a really big turn off for a story for me if it is baseless. However, most SSHG people just retcon him into being dead at the start of the story ;)

*** Daphne and blaise were originally two of the only named slytherins that weren't evil as fuck directly in the books. As such early fics would attach personalities to them for when they wanted a slytherin character. This is why early fics have girl blaises because the gender was unknown (and his race wasn't known either). The tropes that developed in those early years stuck as have every other little stupid idiosyncrasy of harry potter fanfiction.

Ron is a shitty friend, in fics a lot of authors just want him gone or want someone to betray harry. Draco gets respect because dumb fangirls think the actor who played him was hot. He is hooked up with hermione a lot because many fanfic wirters (girls) project themselves onto hermione.

Crackfics are meant to not have drama, they are meant to not be well written, they are fucking crack. A quick fix of pure dumb fun.

*** I used to read a ton of H/Hr fanfiction, and I'd get really annoyed if Ron was too OOC. I can't say I like Ron, he is far from my favorite character in the series, but he isn't evil. Any story that would start to go in that direction I would have to stop reading just because it seemed way too far-fetched.

Most probably can't think of another Slytherin male to use aside from Blaise, but I used to always notice that too.

I'm happy to say I haven't read any crackfics, and I hope to never get that "pleasure."

Without further thought, he leaves the Dursleys, goes to Gringotts and discovers that Dumbledore/someone stole all his money.

*** Oh God, this. I just want to tell these authors to go /read/ thr Harry Potter books for a minute, and really look at Harry's character in canon. Harry isn't really decisive. I mean, yeah, when it's live or die he always manages to pull out his A-game, but very rarely does he actually do anything without outside impetus. If you want your Harry to do that, build up to it slowly, not within the first three paragraphs of your fic. Honestly. It's called character development.

Trying to mesh the convoluted relationships together and rebuild an alternate version of wizarding society is ridiculous, but fun. I'm at an impasse as well as I'm trying to do right by it since I can't say I've read anything like it before, thus the exact details have to mulled over and perfected or else I'm unhappy with it.

********* Yes, that is the story line :) It starts at the immediate end of the Battle of Hogwarts and will continue through the stabilization of Wizarding Britain. /That/ is the least difficult part for me because the relationships are so...matter of fact, yet totally different than anything I've read in fanfic. The summation of the relationships is Severus and his pureblood wife are together via an arranged marriage. She has a near life long paramour (whom she could/would not wed) to whom she is also magically bonded, though she is devoted to Severus and does love him also. Severus is fine with the arrangement because of some of the details I'm leaving out and because, though he likes his wife and is good friends with her, he can't say he loves her in the way she does her paramour. Plus, he figures he has a probability of dieing anyway.

Skipping a whole lot of plot, detail, and drama, eventually, Hermione and Severus are forced together in order to keep her safe. From there, they reconcile what has happened, will happen, and what they can do about it. Wizarding Britain becomes normal again, eventually. However, you better believe it isn't all sunshine and roses at the end.

Additional details of interest: Magical healing and disease of the mind, dragon camp, international wizarding society, British and international pureblood society, Unspeakables, the upper echelons of divination skill, genetics, and lots and lots of difficult healing of many main characters and their families. Plus, if you're familiar with the Marriage Law Challenge, there is something sort of like that going on too.

** That's a huge problem in all romances, even in good ones. Sometimes, I think it's an issue with planning - the romance forgets to catch up with the plot, and the outline goes haywire, because now you've got to resolve everything in time :P I've agonized over pacing multiple subplots properly, so I know the feeling. But I also think it's a general willingness, when people read and/or write specifically for ships, to just "accept" that the romance is there - and most of the audience is just there for the romance anyway.

-I love exploring post-Hogwarts Draco, but I rarely ever find a fic that does him justice. I think most fics characterize him too nicely, with too much smirky charm, and too immediately repentant. I've always thought he'd be very closed-off and suffer from something like PTSD, and it'd take a long time for him to come to terms with his part in the war.

-As much as I like the style of writing prominent in the livejournal community - quick pacing, short sections, frequent metaphors - they get pretty same-y after awhile, and the character development often leaves something to be desired.

-A general lack of exploration into different kinds of relationships in romances. This has been the primary motivator for most of my writing, come to think of it :P A lot of fic (and tv and movies and /people/) have somewhat black and representation of romances. Either a couple is together or not. But I like the in-betweens. I like the not-quite-defined and the stumbling blocks - and not just your vanilla-flavored conflict either. And friendships are so undervalued. Sometimes a friendship is just a friendship, and it's /better that way/. It doesn't mean less.

*** I totally agree about it being a problem in a lot of romances. I guess it just especially bugs me because 1) it's my genre and 2) it seems to be an objectively harder pair to get together. Harry and Hermione has a lot more to go on than Severus and Hermione. Take the time to do it right or it just comes out wrong and very OOC.

And post-war Draco! YES YES, A THOUSAND TIME TURNER TIMES YES! If I'm not reading SSHG, than I'm reading something Draco specific and his characterizations are wild post-war.

**** Also, I think the OOCness also afflicts Snape and Draco more because their characters tend to deal with themes of redemption. A lot of stories - and fans in general - try to excuse their actions too quickly and too wholly. But it's all right to like a morally grey character; in fact, that's /why/ I like Snape and especially Dumbledore - because their motivations are so controversial. If they weren't, they wouldn't be nearly as interesting (nor fallible, for Dumbledore).

It's the association some make of *morally good character = well-written character*, which makes no sense, but I've found is especially rampant in the HP fandom. Like for Ginny, who is pretty much perfect - which is why I feel she's one of the most poorly-written characters in the books. And Lily +too+ in fandom, since so many put her on a goddess pedestal.

You don't happen to know some good short Draco fics, do you? ;) It's always lovely to read more. I periodically try to finish my Draco/Astoria oneshot but I haven't been able to power through writing the second half.

*** Also having a hard time finding good Draco/Hermione for same exact reason. I can deal with character's change over time but not with a sudden replacement. Some stories like Turncoat were possible to read if they put in a few years and gave him a back story harsh enough that would explain him maturing somewhat.

I really want to find a story where Draco gets mature but stays... well not evil, but let's say self-centered. Basically if he were to adjust to his canon stereotype but get smart/good enough to make it work for him. Fallout was close but not quite that for me.

** One of my pet peeves is the almost always present torture of Severus by Deatheaters/Voldermort. It just breaks the story for me because almost always the story reinforces the canon in terms of his position - that he is considered by Voldermort to be a valuable spy. With that established, it just makes no sense for him to be seriously tortured/hurt because it will make him unable to fulfill his perceived role.

A lot of fics have plot developments about how Voldermort is dissapointed and/or bored and/or plain crazy so he tortures Snape to near death and then Snape is usually dumped at Hogwarts into the caring arms of Hermione... and every time I read something like that I can't escape the question. How exactly does Voldermort now expect Snape to explain his condition to the Order of the Phoenix?

"My true master is disappointed because I am not spying on you guys well enough... no wait you are not supposed to know about that... I had a run-in with Death Eaters and managed just barely to escape their grasp despite the fact that should no longer have any blood left in my body and can't even stand... yes exactly like the last 20 times... they capture me a lot...and then I always manage to get away at the very last moment."

I can deal with violence in my stories, but not stupid violence.

Second pet peeve are stories that just grossly miss the desired maturity of characterization. Usually these are written by a literate but immature writer. Due to their correct spelling and grammar it takes longer to evaluate the story correctly and discard it. Usually have to invest time in several chapters of such stories before you see that the characters are acting/thinking like young teens instead of adults/young adults they are supposed to be.

** Super complicated "ancient magic" that just happens to work perfectly for the plot. I can forgive it a few times, but not every chapter.

Harry and Hermione as a couple. I've yet to read a fic where it didn't seem forced and OOC.

Slash-Sirius/Remus is fine, and I would probably read Dumbledore if he wasn't so old, but two explicitly hetero characters together is not my thing.

Lily Evans fics that feature a self-sacrificing,endlessly forgiving, and incredibly condescending saint instead of a teenage girl.

All of Slytherin House being Death Eaters or some form thereof.

As an American, blatant Americanisms. The occasional "sweater" is fine, but please don't say "Mom" in regular conversation.

Overly powerful characters.
