I have entered a OC/SI story phase in my reading and I can't seem to stop, I don't think I want to.

So I wish to read a Harry Potter SI/OC born in one of those arrogant and supremacist pureblood families.

A more specific request is a fic in which the SI/OC is born in James and Lily Potter's time in the First Wizarding War. This SI/OC being pureblood can infiltrate Voldemort's Death Eaters as a spy for Dumbledore.

But any other good story with a pureblood SI/OC as a theme would be great. Thank you in advance.


** +The flair you want is "request," not "recommendation."+ Best of luck.

  Thirteen-year-old Bella Black intended to go back in time to start a war in service to her patron Power. Ritual magic goes awry and she finds herself in 1993, faced with a failing House of Black, an insane alter ego, and a Dark Lord on the rise. Chaos ensues. Title drop. (A collaboration by LeighaGreene and inwardtransience)

** linkffn(in bad faith) SI/OC is reborn as Draco's younger sister. It's really good!

linkffn(disenchanted) SI/OC is reborn as the younger sister of Sirius and Regulus. She's trying so hard to save her brothers from their horrible futures even as a baby. This also has a lot of Pureblood themes. This is amazing and I highly recommend this!

linkffn(scourgify) SI/OC is reborn as the twin of Vincent Crabbe and she was positively repulsed by it. It's not a story in James or Lily's time but it has some Pureblood themes.

  When I imagined being a witch I imagined magic and flying. I imagined proving to the world that Slytherin and Evil are not synonymous. I imagined love and adventure. But most of all I imagined waking up-eleven years old-on the Hogwarts Express alongside Harry and Ron. So why, pray-tell, am I in a nursery, in 1970? This is not what I imagined! A realistic SI.

  The words be careful what you wish for had never rung truer. "Wait... what did she just call my father? Oh, oh god no, anyone but them! Please god no! I'd rather scourgify my own blood then have them for a family! I would take the Malfoys- no, even Voldemort over them! Anyone but...!" SI-OC. Pairings undecided. Not an SI you've read before, according to reviewers.

  ‚ÄúWhat's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.‚Äù The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?

Summary:

James and Emma Potter are twins - inseparable. They have their Hogwarts years planned out from the start, including the House: "Gryffindor, where the brave dwell at heart!" But what happens when the impossible comes true? Standing on opposite sides of the war, the twins realise that not everything is as black and white as it seems...
