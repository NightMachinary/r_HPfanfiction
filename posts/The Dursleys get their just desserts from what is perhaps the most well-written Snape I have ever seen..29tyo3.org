I must admit, the premise is a tad unrealistic, but it's so, /so/ worth it. Aside from that, there is nothing else that is poorly exaggerated in here. I really can say that it is quite well-written.

The descriptions are just fucking magnificent. I need more fics like this, god damn it! I want to gush more, but I'd ruin it! I will only say that it is absolutely chock full of interesting stuff; there is far more there than just the well-trod Dursleys story. (I cried a few times and laughed many more!)

It is one of those rare fics that focuses on the Dursleys rather than on the whole mentor-snape aftermath. Quite refreshing imo. In the vast majority of Dursleys fics I've read they never seem to get what's really coming to them; it is not so here, but it's not a violent wish-fulfillment fic either.

** I really liked how Snape was written in this one, but I felt the ending was a bit weak. It felt rather unfinished.
