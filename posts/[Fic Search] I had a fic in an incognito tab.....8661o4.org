I was just reading a fic that I found through a TVtropes page.

Unfortunately, that window was in Incognito mode, and I closed it by accident, and now cannot recall the Tvtropes page nor the fanfic title.

What I recall is the following:

1) Starts in the summer after GoF

2) Harry apparently cast a Fidelius on some of the Graveyard events, making an unknown person his Secret Keeper. He does not know the secret himself

3) Harry Potter was hit by an AK in the Graveyard, which changed his magic. He disintegrates his holly wand trying to cast with it.

4) His Patronus is now a Thestral

5) He is Lord Potter (Claims it at Gringotts in chapter 1)

6) Dumbledore has been hiding this from him

7) Action was kicked off by Harry having recurring nightmares about the GY, he owls Fred and George for advice, they bring in Bill.

8) In chapter 2, right before I closed the tab, Sirius summons Kreacher and tells him something along the lines of "This is my heir and the next Lord Black".

EDIT: 9) I think the fic summary mentioned Daphne, but it didn't have the <> indicating a ship.

10) The fic has exactly 44 chapters

This is driving me crazy, please help me!

  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU. Powerful! Harry, Harry/Daphne.

** I binge-read it. Quite good but unfinished. Seems abandoned. Power creep is prevalent though.

*** Yes.

The author also has a ridiculous number of words that are clearly intended to be words spelled similarly, and straight-out incorrect usages...
