In a bit of a FF rut and can't seem to find one to hold my attention. Any reccs on your favorites? Any pairing, scenario, trope, etc. Not picky.


** Change of Heart by Ragdoll [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/631887]] Pansy x Neville Summary: Pansy Parkinson has a very cunning scheme to keep herself out of Azkaban Prison. Unfortunately, things don't always go as planned.

  AU after GoF. Trelawney makes a new prophecy about a mysterious Half-Blood Prince, and Dumbledore struggles to find out who it's about. Already walking a tightrope between two masters, Severus Snape feigns ignorance while making his own plans.

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?

** What has held your attention before? I'm not sure what you'd like.

linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) is good for a laugh, while having serious elements too.

linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) has great worldbuilding for the previous generation (Marlene McKinnon, Gawain Robards, Tonks, etc). First four books in the series are complete and total over 1 million words, fifth is actively updated.

I'll mention Methods of Rationality, because although you may or may not like it, I think you should read it and decide for yourself what to think of it. It has its faults (eg the plot arcs work better in its original serial format than as a novel), but also many strengths (complex plot, thought-provoking discussions, lots of humor), and IMO the level of hate it gets here is excessive. Generally I recommend the alternate/expanded introduction, linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMOR).

A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

*** I will read anything.. Snape adopting Harry, dark anyone/anything, next gen OC main pairing. My fav would be a toss up between the Ministers Secret (time travel Hermione paired with a young Kingsley) and Fervidity (a super dark triad where Hermione goes dark as she pretends to be Snape's daughter while trying to Voldy down from the inside). My taste is all over the place. I'll try out your reccs! Already tackled Methods of Rationality! Not my cup of tea, but well written and worth the read, for sure.! I've read Innocent, too

Well, the longest story I follow isn't HP; it's "With This Ring". It has been updating daily since 2013, putting it over 2.5 million words by now. Actually, it's really two stories in one; there are two (main) alternate timelines, one where the main character made "Paragon" choices (friendly and diplomatic), and the other where he made more "Renegade" choices (direct and often violent).

In a nutshell: The author self-insert wakes up in near-Earth orbit around DC Comics Earth-16, wearing an orange power ring, with no idea how he got there, and with his general knowledge of DC but having forgotten everything about Earth-16 specifically. All manner of adventures, antics, awkwardness and awesomeness ensue.

It's posted on a discussion forum (started on Spacebattles, currently on Questionable Questing), so there's a lot of conversation with the author and other readers between chapters.

***** That's great. I love a long fic and would love to read one that just keeps updating! I'm following one that's currently sitting at around 1.4 million words. I'll check out the one you just mentioned, sounds pretty interesting! Another fic I read, The Debt of Time, has a group where the author is very active. I really enjoy that aspect so the one you mentioned will be great

Key elements in that post include:

- Links to TVTropes and a wiki.

** Just recommended this on someone else's post

I really liked this one. It has a twin named Audrey for Harry but does a great job of giving her own character, intriguing abilities and exploration into different forms of magic (magnuse, astral projecting) but not overpowered, and interesting plot still close enough to canon. Hope your in for the long haul, though, ‘cause it's l o n g.

  Audrey Potter hates the technicalities that constantly drag her into trouble with her twin brother, Harry. But when she finally starts to prove herself by crawling from behind her brother's overbearing shadow during the Triwizard tournament, she begins realizing that it may have been better to just stay hidden...slow-burn Draco/OC. Swearing. Spoilers in Reviews!
