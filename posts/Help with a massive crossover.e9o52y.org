Cu Chulainn(Fate/Stay Night) Master: Dolores Umbridge

** u/ForwardDiscussion:
#+begin_quote
  Cu Chulainn(Fate/Stay Night) Master: Dolores Umbridge
#+end_quote

Lancer always gets shafted.

How about Astolfo with Tonks?

edit: Also:

#+begin_quote
  EMIYA(Fate/Stay Night) - Master: Voldemort
#+end_quote

Might want to go with EMIYA Alter, though your plot probably counts on it being EMIYA.

** It is Hard to give a sugestion whitout knowing what you want to do xD

I would cut most of your non fate servants, too many crossovers would just create confusion and make the story to dard to focus. I would change akechi for Mod!harry, it would give a interesting dynamic with Malfoy and it is a classic.

I like ezio.

A au!ariana with dumbledore has huge potencial.

If you want to Troll snape hard core, Hans instead of Elisabeth. But Elisabeth is fine.

Widowmaker is meh, especialy paired with greyback. Give the man Robin hood.

I know nothing about the other crossovers.

I assume this isn't about Monty Python and the Holy Grail? Pity. I don't know who most of those characters are, but I will just point out that Albus being Ariana's "master" is very disturbing. (Though it could be just my perverted mind). And Ezio is a master assassin, how come Ron is his master? Shouldn't it be the other way? Oh, and Edmond Dantes is from the novel "The Count of Monte Cristo", not some "grand" order.
