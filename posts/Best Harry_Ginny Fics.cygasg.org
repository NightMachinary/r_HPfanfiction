Any suggestions for more Harry/Ginny? I am looking for stories that are well written, but doesn't have to be within cannon (other than H/G), open to AU. One-Shots, long stories, all are welcome.

I would like to pretend (as many of us would) that Cursed Child was all a bad dream, so I prefer nothing within that realm.

Examples of a few I have liked recently:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]] by RR Fang

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3830952/1/Need][Need]] by iluvfanfics1

all of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] 's fics.

â€‹

I have been out of the FF universe for a while, and have found my way back home after all these years, so if there are some obvious amazing ones, I probably don't know about them yet. Share away!

Thanks!
