:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
One thing which really irritates me in the original books is that after Harry and Ginny start to walk together (that's a Bohemism, go out together?), he never tells her about horcruxes and all that crap. I can understand she may be too young to actually go with them (although The Trace is too convenient plot device, she is not of age and she really shouldn't go to the suicide mission), they may pretend to split for the protection of her and her family and many other things. However, the is no excuse in the world for Harry not tell her. She is not silly fangirl who he may need to be tested whether he can trust her (like Cho would be if they stayed together), she is a well worn battle hardened trustworthy person (literally battle hardened, more than most adults around, thinking about it). If Dumbledore raves about love being the most powerful weapon against the evil, he should really have no problems with Harry trusting his girlfriend.

Did anybody work around these lines?


** Yes, the phrase is go out together. Personally I understand not telling her. There is no upside to it, only more possibilities for failure. Voldemort's defeat hangs upon secrecy, he has to remain complacent about his Horcruxes until it's too late.

**** As [[/r/neymovirne][r/neymovirne]] pointed out, Snape is a legilimens and they don't know his true loyalties. It is VERY important that Voldemort remains unaware of their plans to hunt his horcruxes, otherwise he will secure them better. Also if she accidently let a hint of it slide (she's a human, everyone can make mistakes) and it reaches Voldemort then she will be in extreme danger.

So yes, to protect them, i would do this to my boy/girl-friend.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), is the most enjoyable fic for me that has Ginny accompanying Harry in Year 7.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** She's been his girlfriend for what, 1,5 months before he breaks up with her at the Dumbledore's funeral? Hardly a romance for ages at that point. Anyway, Harry couldn't take Ginny with them on the Horcrux hunt, and she would be a risk with such knowledge at Hogwarts where at least Snape (whose true loyalties they're unaware of) is a legilimens and has access to Veritaserum.

*** Well, except Harry knows Ginny for five years at this point, knows her she beat Voldemort twice, she was for a year member of DA (so she knows a bit in handling secrecy and she was tested she can preserve it), she fought in the Department of Mysteries. You cannot say Harry knows her just for six weeks.

Obviously, we have different understanding what is important in a relationship.
