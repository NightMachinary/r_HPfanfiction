Instead of Harry Potter being entered into the Triwizard Tournament, Draco Malfoy is entered instead.

Oh the fame is great for the weeks he has it but the moment he steps into the arena and sees the dragon he is supposed to get past, well...

Mostly just want to see Draco make a fool out of himself. Crouch Jr. accidentally puts in Draco's name instead of Harry's, Draco convinces an older student to put his name in, etc.


** Harry forgets his DADA homework and is reminded by Ron at the last minute of potions with Slytherin. They see Malfoy's bag unguarded and hastily copy his work before heading off to Moody's class.

Fast forward, Crouch Jr. Confunds the GoF and drops Harry's copied assignment into it.

He is supremely surprised when he learns that the Goblet considers the paper to contain Draco's signature, never mind who's name was printed at the top.

*** I'm not sure how that could work. Harry's own name would be on the paper as well as his own magical signature, considering that he was the one who created the copy.

If, however, he took Draco's paper, made a copy and then smuggled the copy into Draco's bag, keeping the slightly modified original, the paper would still have largely Draco's magical signature...

** I really like that idea, though I'd like to see a more capable Draco. I mean he was chosen by the Goblet so he'd have to have some skill and the character to win the turnament. It would be fun to see him and Harry both being chosen too.

well, if it was Barty who put him in by mistake... then he would be the only ^{and thus best} entrant for the 4th school.

tho yea; a more capable Draco, probably with assistance provided by his father, would be nice too.

**** Could go the other way and have Malfoy senior messing up each task by his sheer ineptitude. trying to pay off the dragon by doing what a Malfoy does best throw gold at it. Buying Draco diving equipment that doesn't work or has know clue how to put it together. Think “a black comedy” levels of jokes and verbal barbs. It would be hilarious

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

I would prefer Harry somehow manipulating events so Draco's name instead of his is put into the goblet. Maybe he learns in advance about the goblet and that contract thing. Or maybe he is a time traveler with future knowledge. But I think it would be only fair, something like entirely justified vengeance, if Harry had a hand in this, considering all the shit always heaped on him - with Draco being one of those responsible for that.
