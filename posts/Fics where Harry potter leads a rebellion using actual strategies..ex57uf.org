** Oh my god, I wish this was true as well - I had a similar idea ages ago too! Yes, I've seen Code Geass, and a story in which Harry was like Lelouch would be so great if written well!

This would probably be a story best sparked by Sirius actually dying in 3rd year, and Harry hating the system, and starting to actually do something to change it.

It would be nice if, like lelouch, Harry starts realising that he can't do it peacefully, or without hurting innocents.

I've even come up with (1) intellegent plan, that probably would be good for an older (6/7th year?) Harry as a younger one would not know occlumency.

Since occulumency prevents veritaserum from working apart from glazed eyes, and the imperius curses only sign is glazed eyes, Harry could do something to help his rebbellion while taking veritaserum (But making sure that he is using occlumency at the same time so he does not give away his plans), and if caught he can say that he was under imperious, and people would believe him because in pensieve memories they would all see glazed eyes.

Downside is veritaserum is poisonous so this can't be done for long.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has been training himself and his friends for months, in preparation for this day. Today, his war begins when Voldemort plans a trap for him at the Department of Mysteries - only it's Harry who has the upper hand, until a trio of faces from his past make a very unwelcome return. Grey!Harry, Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.

** Stand Against the Moon has him running a rebellion like this, only against the Ministry instead of Voldemort.
