So this quote from McGonagall made me think it would be a great set up for a fic

#+begin_quote
  ‘Potter,' she [Professor McGonagall] said in ringing tones, ‘I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly, I will make sure you achieve the required results!'
#+end_quote

< Before the quote she explained that Harry was at A level, and by the time O.W.Ls rolled around he achieved EE, so imagine how much he would have improved with a very frustrated and determined Minerva No Nonsense McGonagall at his back.

Of course I'll accept any fics with her as a main supportive role, including oneshots. She's a hard character to get the voice right on, if you ask me.


** Mentor McGonagall in the The Art of Self-Fashioning linkffn(11585823). McGonagall more or less encourages Harry's fascination and specialization in Transfiguration, and even serves as something of a partner for more of his crazier endeavors.

Harry McGonagall linkffn(3160475) has Harry taken and raised by a squib relative of McGonagall's, and she is sort of like an aunt/mentor to him.

Taking Control linkffn(Taking Control) has McGonagall serving as something of an advisor and confidant to Harry throughout the fic. She offers advice on his teaching, his methods, and even offers to show him how to dance. She sticks up for him against Dumbledore.

A common theme in a lot of supportive-McGonagall fics seems to be that they are also Ravenclaw!Harry fics. Not all, but far greater in percentage than the average for say supportive-Snape fics.

On a side note, now I really want to see supportive/mentor Flitwick stories.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

*** Thank you for the links. That being said, Harry McGonagall feels very family sitcom to me. I feel like all that it's missing to be a contender with Full House is a laugh track. Which might be good for some people but for me it's a bit too much.

On the other hand I never finished reading art of self-fashioning. Something about the way Harry acted really turned me off finishing it when I first tried to read it. It felt like Harry was smart and had all this potential and just ended up wasting it all. This may or may not be true, as I didn't finish the fic, but I could give it another try.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

*** I would really enjoy a supportive Flitwick fic that didn't just use him as a platform to explore goblins. It's very common and I feel like this jovial intelligent man has much more to offer than just being a gateway into his possible culture and heritage.

** Are you okay with fem!Harry and unreasonable coming out angst? (I mean, ridicule from your schoolmates doesn't seem that much of an issue after you slew a Basilisk with a bloody sword). Because there's the "Power of Love" series has a lot of supportive McGonagall scenes, but it's also bloated and makes too much of an issue out of the coming out thing.

*** You know, teen angst is silly like that and I could totally see a teenager get over the fact they murdered an abnormally large snake a couple years ago compared to dealing with complex feelings about sexuality and fitting in.

**** I mean, if it was just the snake, maybe, idk. But at that point, Harry/Jasmine had semi-regular run-ins with Voldemort, took on a dragon and so on. In comparison to that, giving the students who already dislike you another angle of attack seems trivial.
