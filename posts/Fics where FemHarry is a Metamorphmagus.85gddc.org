What I'm looking for is a decent length fic which is hopefully complete or constantly being written where Fem!Harry is a Metamorphmagus.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances.

**** By no rehashing of canonical plotlines, does that mean there's different conflicts during the years?

** linkffn(Son of Potter Daughter of Black by DaSalvatore) extremely well done, with enough emotional turmoil to feel more real than usual. At least for me.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12555630/1/Absolution][Absolution]] by ContraryToEverything might be something you'll like. It's a one shot, however it is a well written one. Harry is still a male here, but he would mostly morph into a girl. And no, it is not a romance. It's more of a reconciliation fic.
