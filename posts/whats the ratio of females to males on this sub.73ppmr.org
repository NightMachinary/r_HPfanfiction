** According to the [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNWTOcubzPLMYcc_CdhAH0uwBMSloTgTdjTQZxINdHovbnRQ/viewanalytics][2017 survey]], 66.4% male, 32.1% female, 1.5% other.

**** I doubt [[/r/HPfanfiction]]'s demographics, especially in this regard, are representative of the wider HP (fanfic) community, or the fanfiction community in general. Consider, for example, the prominence of Harry/Daphne as a favourite pairing in the survey, compared to its relative popularity on ff.net.

*** Huh, I would have thought more female than male. I think the HP fanfic community in general is like that, but reddits demographics itself has a much larger male skew.

I would also bet that this sub skews a bit older too than the HP fanfic community as a whole.

Going “lmfao” at it when you don't know anything is kind of rude, you know. People with that kind of anatomy probably had to deal with enough shit relating to that already, there is no need to sum it all up in such a crude way.

******** Except that there are people who don't have XX or XY chromosomes. It would be nice if it were always as simple as that, but it isn't, there are people who have XXY or XXX or X0 and so on, and even if it is rare generalising like that only shows that there isn't really anything but rudeness beneath your attitude.

And the survey asked people what sex they were assigned at birth. While certainly anything above even 1% (probably a tenth of that, really) is likely to be some people not being truthful to make themselves feel better, I reiterate the point that there are places where people with visible intersex condition at birth can have that assigned instead of either male or female, and while we are very unlikely to have gotten any such people in the survey because of the relatively low amount of people, laughing at it without thinking, once again, is crude.

****** While I completely agree that otherkin deserve to be made ample fun of, I wouldn't say the same thing for people who choose to identify as "genderless". At least, while otherkin are indeed often arguably delusional, many "genderless" people became so as a choice (like becoming transgender), and do not believe they were /born/ sexless or anything of the kind. You may think they're /wrong/ to change their gender identity like that, but it's not the same sort of laughable silliness as otherkin. Besides all of this, starting to make fun of "genderqueer" people on the Internet, especially on reddit or tumblr, is guaranteed to start a pointless, off-topic argument, so please refrain from doing that in the future.

******* Yeah, it did take me some time to realise that one, due to both questions in the survey using the same language which is kind of confusing, and by then the best thing I could do was to leave it be. Oh well, happens, though if it's not about anatomy then it's even more valid what with the existence of non-binary people (whom I don't get in that regard, but that's not my business).
