One AU element that I think would work well in the HP universe would be a slight merging of the TYPE-MOON magic system with the HP magic system. That would be the introduction of Magical Crests. Magical Crests in the TYPE-MOON universe are ‘crests' or a bunch of magical ‘nerves' known as magical circuits. These crests are passed down through mage families and the longer the lineage of the family, the stronger they are. The magical crests contain the knowledge of spells from the founder of the mage family and each subsequent inheritor of the crest has a duty to add to the crest with their own research and spells which is then passed down to their own heir.

This doesn't have to be Magical Crests in particular, but something similar to it would make the Purebloods aversion to the Muggle-born and muggles more understandable and have a real justification other than the idiotic ‘justifications' that we get in the canon series. Purebloods work to keep their blood and lineage clear of non-magical blood and work to strengthen their lineage with other strong families. The introduction of non-magical blood, even the smallest amount could mean that the heir would not be able to inherit the magical crest from their father or mother.

It would also mean that some families are better at some studies of magic than others. For example, perhaps the Malfoys Magical Crest is more focused on Alchemy and enchanting, and the Blacks Crest is focused on the Dark Arts. The crests make it so that the children who inherit them are naturally better at things and provides a deeper look at the world building.

The Pureblood families would therefore be naturally stronger and would provide a more easily explainable justification to their superiority, rather than the outright bigotry that we see in canon. Hogwarts would be more of an introduction to magic and a wide sweeping education on magic and then the graduates are able to go off to higher educations, get apprenticeships, and so on to further their magical crest, their research, ect.

Of course, this was just a thought that I had after reading some pureblood fanfics and watching the Fate series, so if you have any further ideas or thoughts, please feel free to share.


** As one familiar with Fate, it would be a reason.

Personally, not one I'd enjoy as I don't really like the idea of legitimizing bigotry. More fun to punch the bigots in the face.

*** Perhaps, but in terms of in-universe explanations, in my opinion it would make things more interesting and less 'Purebloods bigots, Purebloods bad' and would make the magic system more in depth and more interesting.

**** Not all purebloods are bad, already.

Weasleys are purebloods, as are the Longbottoms. The Potters were mostly pureblood with some exceptions. More interesting to me to include a traditionalist faction that doesn't care about blood purity itself, than make Pureblood bigots 'right' in some way.

** Perhaps it could be a Grimoire type thing. It could also include the families history and events involving the family. It would add more reason to keep outsiders away from it ,as these would help explain how they gained power within the Wizarding World.

** The Rigel Black Chronicles (starting with linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense)) has a slightly different take, although gifts like Parseltongue and Metamorphmagery do run in pureblood families and don't tend to just appear in first-generation mages. The key difference, though, between old and new magic is wildness. The more generations pass, the more magic becomes tamed and easily controlled, whereas a muggle-born witch or wizard with large magical reserves will find them acting up in response to any strong emotion.

So, in the present day, under Tom Riddle's influence, non-purebloods have been banned from Hogwarts on the grounds that they are dangerous to pureblood children and not able to control their magic well enough to keep up with the curriculum properly. Harry sneaks herself in, but does actually experience some of the challenges associated with her mother's wild magic; she learns spells really quickly by just asking her magic to cooperate, but if she's not careful to keep a lid on her emotions, it may do things she didn't intend (like casting a very dangerous shield charm that dissolves anything it touches).

There's a further possible reason for prejudice, in the fact that young babies are able to sense magical auras around them, and instinctively associate them with the presence of their mothers - causing them to shy away from people who don't feel like magic, and thus feeding into an instinctive aversion and isolation as they grow older, even after they've forgotten the reason.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** I always liked the theory that magic evolved just like other things. In the beginning there was rudimentary magic (stuff that people do that Dumbledore calls magic but we can also do it such as music, art or words). Initially it was charm... women would seduce men for protection, while men would use charisma to gather people together in groups to hunt. Then there were curses which were ill-wishes upon people that offended you and words that made other people uncomfortable. Over time some people's will would become so strong that they could influence nature through such acts. They would dance to bring about rain, or they'd make drawings or recite incantations to protect the loved ones and to punish the enemies. Gradually this affinity evolved into magic. Muggles and wizards have a common ancestor but the purebloods had so many generations of wizards before them that they thing of themselves as purebloods, while a muggleborn may pop up in a non-magical family after hundreds of generations.
