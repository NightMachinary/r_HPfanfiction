I was reading a comment in another thread about all of the jokes Voldemort makes about Peter's hand/arm and the idea of Voldemort as that one friend who makes puns about everything sounds hilarious. Maybe take it a step further and have swashbuckling, comedian showboating Voldemort who does things like Lucius in A Very Potter Sequel - setting up elaborate atmosphere and choreographed, orchestrated entrances.

Take it a step even further - Dumbledore is the only one he ever feared, right? That's because flamboyant, stylish, eccentric, witty Dumbledore outshines him at every turn. Even further - Lockhart was a threat to both of them with his perfect smile and hair and ridiculously large personality, so they band together to get rid of him. I don't know where all of this came from, but I have crazy stupid ideas sometimes and I want to put them out there in hopes of inspiring something great.

Oh, and Dobby is secretly the most powerful of them all - him and his boxers and socks. Dumbledore likes socks too... do you think socks could be the power he knows not?


** I'd love to read this.

Imagine an AU where the reason Harry's parents died weren't bc of a Prophecy but because they called out Voldemorts jokes.

And the only way for Harry to defeat Voldemort is to crack a pun WITH him.

*** Nah, the prophecy stays, but the Potters "thrice defied him" in the sense that they called him out.

The power he knows not is Harry's naturally snarky wit. Harry's DGAF attitude becomes so over the top Voldemort just can't take it anymore. When they duel in the graveyard, it's really a roast. Harry's like a hostile poetry slam king. He gets ostracized by book 7 because he's such a jerk to everyone, but shows up at the Battle of Hogwarts and slams Voldemort so hard in front of the whole wizarding world that Voldemort is just like "Yep. I'm ruined. Time to be a muggle and start acting."

The whole story is like some hip hop gang shit but all posh and British. Harry takes it to the next level with his 90s kid gangster flow.

Edit: aaaand I just saw the post about the Drill Rapper Harry in Hogsmead Ends. LOL. Weird how that happens.

** Tom is obsessed with Harry because his parents were actually strong rivals. The power Harry knows not is his complete lack of ability to read between the lines and see a pun. All of there confrontations Tom drops some liller puns and dad jokes but it all goes straight over Harry's head. Tom thinks Harry couldn't possibly be that dumb and actually tells Harry he is too dumb to appreciate a great pun. Harry rrsponds that maybe his puns just aren't that great. Tom begins to doubt himself as Lord Voldemort, master of puns and sets out to find the pun of all puns that even Harry could understand. Fun fact, Tom has severe social insecurities and hides behind his jokes. Tom is actually a fairly poor wizard. The reason he is the most feared wizard is because nobody can even get a spell off at him, they are to busy laughing at his puns. When Harry doesn't get the jokes it becomes a duel between two very average wizards where in the end Harry accidentally makes the most killer pun Tom had ever heard and dies of a heart attack in his shock.

** In his younger days, when he wasn't as good at puns, Voldemort named his followers the Death Eaters. Because they would Death Eat anyone that got in their way.
