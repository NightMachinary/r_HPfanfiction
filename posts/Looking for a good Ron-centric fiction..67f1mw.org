There are countless fanfictions featuring the other two of the trio, while Ron is almost completely ignored at best, gleefully bashed upon at worst.

Are there any well-written stories that focus on a well-developed, nuanced Ron? A relationship with Hermione is a plus, good grammar is a must, bashing of any sort is a bust. Thanks!


** Whenever I see requests for pro-Ron fics, I like to point out one of the snippets in this chapter in this collection: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8527691/12/An-Incomplete-Potter-Collection]]

However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

**** Oh man I'm really enjoying this so far. Ron doesn't really feel like Ron here; I would've liked to see him blunder about a bit, but considering he's mentally an adult, it's understandable, though I'd always imagine that even as an adult he'd have the emotional range of a teaspoon. Maybe a tablespoon, if we're being generous.

Oh and a female Harry? Always a plus (I have a frankly disturbing thing for women with black hair and green eyes). Violet is very different, Granger is downright unbelievable, and both are such enigmas. I can't wait for the next chapter.

**** I really wanted to like The Red Knight because decent Ron fics are really thin on the ground - it gets recommended a lot here - but the versions of Harry and Hermione in this fic killed it for me. They have almost nothing in common with canon Harry and Hermione. Whatever Ron is actually trying to achieve becomes almost irrelevant because the whole thing is constantly thwarted by these crazy mirror-universe versions of his friends.

[[/spoiler][Would canon Hermione hold an innocent eleven year old responsible for someone else's actions /that haven't even happened yet/ the way she does in this fic? Harry and Hermione might have been traumatised and have very good in-universe reasons to act like they do, but in the end I had to give up. This fic completely destroys the trio's friendship before the story even starts - and continues with only Ron seeming willing to honestly try and move past it.]]

The author gave us a capable and interesting Ron, but unfortunately at the expense of the other two characters.

***** On my list. However I'm currently obsessed with Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Live, which is 200 chapters and 600k words, so it'll be a while. It has an amazing Ron, by the way. Everyone gets a boost in smarts, athletics, and maturity, but they are in essence, the same people. Definitely recommended.

****** After several years of reading fics, I finally reached my limit of Hermione a couple months ago. I used to devour H/H fics, but now I can't read anything that has her as a main character. I feel pretty weird about it, but I think I'm just exhausted of her being made into a Mary sue revolutionary. That's the only reason, I think, that I haven't read HG&tBWL.

******* Ah I know what you mean. Hermione here is a bit Mary Sue, but most assuredly has flaws, and frankly all characters receive the same treatment (including characters usually relegated to the background, like Alicia Spinnet and Pansy Parkinson), so she never comes off as ridiculously overpowered; everyone has their strength and weaknesses.

Also, though it's written from Hermione's point of view, it feels much more like a trio fic, at least to me. I don't think it's H/H, nor will it ever be.

I greatly urge you to reconsider and give the story a try. It's a smart blend of action, suspense, humor, and intrigue that draws you in and wets your appetite for more.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

**** Already read this one, but thanks! I read it a while ago, so I'm not sure, but I remember getting the distinct feeling that Ron wasn't very..Ron here.

I also don't really like Starfox5's writing style. He's a great author and brilliant with plot and character development, but just something about his stories rankle. His Dumbledore in Divided and Entwined is excellent though, especially since I believe Dumbledore to be an extremely difficult character to write.

Yeah. Tough to say what exactly. His plots are better than canon's and his writing is technically very good. I just think it falls short in the charm and the humour regions. I like my stories to have lighthearted moments.
