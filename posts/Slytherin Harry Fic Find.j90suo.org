So I read this a while ago. Basically its where Harry is like in 6th or 7th year and in Slytherin. His younger brother is the bwl. Harry was chosen as the hogwarts champion. Harry is extremely smart and also sleeps around with many people. He is capable of unsupported flight. I think his bestfriend was a lestrange and his parents neglected and hurt him. Suddenly as he becomes more famous his parents try to be there for him. I think Hermione liked him but Harry younger brother had a crush on her. I really dont remember the name of the fic and cant really find it.
