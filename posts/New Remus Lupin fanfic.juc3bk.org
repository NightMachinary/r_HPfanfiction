Hi, Reddit! I've been writing this Remus Lupin fanfic for about a week now and I've just posted the fifth chapter!

Here's a summary:

Elaine Martel's life takes an unexpected turn in the Summer of 1993, when she receives a letter from Hogwarts. She excitedly returns three years after graduating and, after becoming the youngest professor at the school, makes an encounter that will completely change her.

It's mostly a slowburn (I'm not a huge fan when things are rushed) that I've been updating every day or every other day so far :)

You can read it [[https://my.w.tt/EOlMvwk4pbb][here]]

I appreciate all upvotes, comments and feedback if you'd like to give it a read!

Thank you so much
