** There was a fic with HP/Bellatrix pairing in which Bellatrix was getting off of getting tortured. I didn't read it totally but I seem to remember it being NSFW, time travel and Harry was not the nice naive boy we have in the cannon. Maybe someone will remember the fic

  In the aftermath of the Final battle a misplaced spell sends HP and Bellatrix to an alternative world. It holds everything each of them have lost to the war and yet they find themselves inexorably drawn back to each other. HPBella done right.

** There might be some hidden potential here for a HP/Star Wars crossover. Imagine a Sith being hit with the Cruciatis and using the pain to fuel a counterattack, preferably to yeet a death eater across the room.

** If you don't mind slash, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10279982/1/Thanatos-in-Your-Palm][Thanatos in Your Palm]] fits your request exactly. Harry can't feel pain and asks Draco to perform the curse on him.

** There's a series of Dark!Harry fics by BolshevikMuppet99 (might want to check spelling) that has Harry enjoying casting the cruciatus (and assorted other 'Dark' magic) on others? They're not exactly what you've asked for re the cruciatus and the series is rather dark and touches on a couple of sensitive topics but they might be something you'd enjoy

** If I remember correctly, this is a plot point in a couple of Jeconais's stories. The 'Perfect Slytherins' series comes to mind.

** As someone who enjoys fictional torture, the cruciatus is boring, there's no depth to it. I prefer creative spell use over just extreme pain, especially because it's not very conductive to torture as you can only use it for a short while before the victim is a vegetable.
