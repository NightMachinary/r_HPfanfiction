I am looking there any really good series that set in relative future (2030+) of series characterized by few criteria:

- *Technological singularity* - mundane technology entered singularity stage were new software is so complex that its development itself largely AI based, with computational power increasing factorially fast, with consequences of it application in cybernetics, virtual reality, medicine, etc.
- *Outer Space is more accessible* - at very least few countries have permanent bases on orbit or/and Moon or/and Mars, though space opera like level of space travel with extraterrestrial civilizations is appreciated.
- *Downfall of Statute of Secrecy* - Wizarding World is secret no more and magic is actively crossed with super advanced technology. Imagine possibilities!

Obviously such story is either AU in regards of timeline or stars generation of children or/and grandchildren of characters of HP books. I don't really find much of stories of this kind. Any recommendations? Any ideas why there is not much stories of this kind?On related note, I present two fandoms for crossovering that are good inspiration for such setting but are largely overlooked:

- *Shadowrun* - set in world that alternating between magical and non-magical eras, with most recent non-magical era (Fifth World) is mostly our IRL history up to 2011 when Awakening happens, that brings forth Sixth World were magic is back. Shadowrun is set in 2060s, when most of changes settled in. It is a dystopian cyberpunk with magic, where ancient dragons run megacorporations and megacorporation run countries, some humans spontaneously mutated into elves, dwarves, orcs and other fantasy races and hackers use technomancy spells in order to traverse the Matrix.
- *Starfinder* - magical space opera that set in future of Pathfinder - epic fantasy world derived from 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons. If Shadowrun is mundane technological world suddenly flooded with magic, Starfinder is epic fantasy world that overcame 'medieval technological stasis' trope and reached the stars. If Shadowrun is gritty underdog adventure in cynical world ruled by corporations, Starfinder is wondrous epic fantasy meets science finction adventure among the stars. Gods still give power to their clerics, wizards cast spells, necromancers command armies of undead and so on, but AIs, orbital cities-hubs and faster than light travel are common things and your casual humans, elves and dwarves are mixing with androids and bizarre alien races of all shapes and lifeforms.

Noticed much more no magic AUs than any presence of sci-fi induced settings and this kind of sad. Most of stories that have any such presence are WH40K and Star Wars crossovers that don't really fit the bill as usually there is large disconnection in setting of stories instead fusion, while no-crossover sci-fy AU HP stories are virtually non-existent.


** Maybe linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes)? It's a Firefly and Harry Potter crossover, but it's been a while since I've read it, so I don't know how well it's stood up over the years

  COMPLETE. Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.

** There is a shadowrun crossover where Harry is a dragon. It's sort of pre this though, like it covers the statute falling because muggles start changing into orcs and stuff

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

*** Thanks. It looks interesting and I already was considering to read. I made this post with hope to hear opinions about why such stories are not more common.
