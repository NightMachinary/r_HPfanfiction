Somehow I've found myself reading quite a few fics focusing on Regulus Black either as a main character or a strong supporting one. If you have any well-written recommendations that are preferably completed, please send them my name way!

For reference, I've already read and enjoyed these ones:

linkffn(Blackpool)

linkao3(face death in the hope)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of slytherin)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)


** I think all of these are complete.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

  A stupidly curious Harry Potter accidentally ends up in the past ... right in front of Regulus Black. Deciding he might as well stop the world going to hell, a - slightly insane - Potter drags a bewildered Regulus with him. Between ending a war and accidentally saving the Blacks, the two quickly get close. Will they have a second chance at happiness? Maybe?

  When Harry wakes up in an alternate timeline--a timeline where Voldemort was defeated long before the first war--he discovers everything is different. His parents, his godfather, his friends--and him. Harry must deal with the consequences of who he would have been if he had been raised by his parents, and figure out where he stands with his casual hook up, Draco Malfoy.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

  Regulus agrees to be a spy for the Order of the Phoenix shortly before Voldemort's downfall. Thirteen years later, he's a reluctant potions master under the watchful eye of Albus Dumbledore, just trying to get through his days without cursing the meddling Headmaster. Now Regulus's estranged brother has escaped from Azkaban, and Dumbledore has had the grand idea to invite Sirius's pet werewolf to teach at the school.

** Linkao3(the lost generation). Ensemble cast with all of the marauders but great Sirius/Regulus dynamics and Regulus gets plenty of POV action. I'm reading it currently and I can't put it down!

I'm also going to recommend linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin). Regulus doesn't show up until the end of book 2 though. It's brilliant what the author does with him but this story is A Lot and not for everyone.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries.
