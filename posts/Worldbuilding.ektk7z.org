Rowling's worldbuilding, whether you think it's good or bad, is quite limited to stuff needed for her plot. Harry needs transport, she invents the Knight Bus, he needs to track someone, she invents the Marauders and their map, etc. If you're writing a fic that isn't just canon rehash or extension, you're probably going to need to flesh it out a little. I'm curious about what people think might help.

So first, what examples of fics with good worldbuilding are out there? The story can be good or bad, it's just the worldbuilding that has to be good here. :)

Secondly, what resources for Harry Potter worldbuilding are there? Can be good summaries of canon information, real life texts on witchcraft practices or alchemical symbols, mythology on Goblins or Elves, etc. Anything you've found useful or think someone else might find useful.

Finally, what other stuff do you think is helpful for Harry Potter worldbuilding? Things to keep in mind while designing, tones to take, themes to follow, good tropes or bad cliches, etc.

Hopefully we can come up with something to help new writers here!


** Part I:

Before I get to your three questions, its probably best to address Rowling's issue with worldbuilding in general. The thing about her writing is that she is /generalist/: she outlines just enough of the characters, setting, events to give an idea of what its like while letting the audience fill in the canvas themselves so to speak. Its basically the opposite of Stephen King's approach to writing, and you can see the appeal it would have for kids to read.

Now, you are correct that she Rowling treats her world, magic and even characters as more of a "how to get from point A to point B," rather than as "how would X respond if Y occurs/exists?" Thats because the HP books are not really about the Wizarding World itself. Let me explain. Strip away all the magic and fantastical elements (you know, the HP stuff), and what are you left with? Seven 19th century style boarding school mystery/detective stories.

- What is the three-headed dog guarding?
- What is the chamber of secrets/who is the Heir of Slytherin?
- Who is Sirius Black/why does he want to kill Harry?
- Who put Harry's name in the Goblet of Fire and why?
- What is the "weapon" Voldemort is after in the Ministry/what is the room he keeps dreaming about?
- Who is the half-blood prince/what is a Horcrux?
- What are the Deathly Hallows and who is the Master of Death?

Everything else is in service to making these mysteries work within each book, regardless of contradiction or later issues it may cause (ex. Harry, Ron and Hermione's inexplicable behavioral shifts between books, the existence of Veritaserum/Legilimency/Penseive(s) and the problems with Sirius prosecution, Voldemort suddenly starts broadcasting to Harry again in DH, etc.). This is why much of the world feels inconsistent or patchy - worldbuilding was secondary to her plot.

*** Part II:

Now for your actual questions/requests. First, I can think of quite a few fics that have good-to-great worldbuilding, but I will limit it to those that are more outstanding in their qualities:

Those that loosely follow canon-style:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): has some very in-depth dives not only into the lore o Harry Potter but into the wider tropes that often occur in the fandom. Has a somewhat shaky start, but becomes very interesting (great worldbuilding) by the 2nd year.
- linkffn(Victoria Potter): I would highly recommend this one, as Taure creates a masterful re-imagining of Harry Potter with a fem!Harry as the protagonist. The worldbuilding could almost be considered the gold-standard at this point, though it depends on how much you appreciate the whimsical nature of the early books.
- linkffn(Forging the Sword): fairly good worldbuilding, though the major focus of the fic is on the relationship between the trio (which is a definite worth reading aspect).
- linkffn(Out of the Night by RememberFics): a repost of Raining Ink's fic, but this fic had perhaps the most nuanced portrayal of both Diagon/Knockturn Alley and dark magic/wizards I have encountered in any fic.

Those that deviate from canon heavily or are AU:

- linffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): the only good Voldemort-wins fic I have yet to encounter, and perhaps the best portrayal of Harry, Snape, and Voldemort I can recall encountering. The intricacies of the world that you see are truly staggering, and only grow as each year passes in the fic.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome): a somewhat modified version of canon where Harry isn't the BWL. The fic is very much about the worldbuilding, as an attempt to create a more magical HP world than is seen in canon.
- linkffn(Dodgning Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is a Dish Best Served Raw): there is a lot I can say about this fic, good and bad, but its hard to deny just how alive the world it portrays feels. Its also a great story, even if it occasionally feels directionless, and really makes me care about the characters.
- linkffn(A Long Journey Home): long story short, this is basically a "Man from Earth" style story that is less about plot and more about how such a thing affected Harry in this story. The Merlin-arc is lauded here for a reason.

Second, the theoretical answer is [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/][the Wizarding World]] site, formerly Pottermore. In practice, I would tell the authors to read the books more closely, followed by consulting the HP wiki for a bit more analysis. I would also recommend having a decent literature and fantasy background, both for understanding how worlds are built to be consistent as well as for different ideas that could be explored.

Third, a lot of the tropes of fantasy can be understood by both reading the Hobbit/Lord of the Rings series and examining where Tolkein drew from in literature and mythology. Additionally, much of Rowling's fantasy elements are actually drawn directly from real-world mythologies (ex. wands were existent in old world mythologies and magic from the 'rabdos' of Mycenaen Greece to the "gambanteinn" of the Norse), so a decent understanding would allow you to build a more intricate world without having to just come out of the blue with new ideas.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** On the contrary, most of Rowling's worldbuilding is atmospheric and is not driven by the plot. Harry needs transport? He has a high-speed broom. It'd be easy to work out a scene where he takes it. Instead, there's new modes of transportation virtually every book. Brooms, trains, flying cars, Floo powder, Knight bus, hippogriffs, portkeys, thestrals, Apparition, underwater ships...

If she wanted to make grounded, cohesive worldbuilding, she could stick to one or two of them. But that was never her goal. Instead, she constantly aims to exercise the imagination, particularly of children, with weird and whimsical and funny (or sometimes scary) new ideas. Just read the first half of Philosopher's Stone and see how many random details there are about wizards, magic, and the wizarding world. Most of which never come up again.

Her problem is that she /doesn't/ think enough about the plot when worldbuilding, except in the immediate instance. Random things she invented earlier don't make a lot of sense when applied to later plot points, or vice versa. The wizarding world is incredibly imaginative, but it doesn't fit together well.

** Nothing is perfect. There is a lot of work of work in the great retellings of the HP story by some more reputable authors (White_Squirrel, Northumbrian, et al.). They usually have to deal especially with the chronological inconsistencies (e.g., famously Dumbledore flew to London on a broom in HPPS, because neither Floo nor mostly Apparition has been discovered yet; there was no time line limiting access to people of certain age, etc.).

Probably the best resource with a lot of reservations is still the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/][Harry Potter Wiki]]. The biggest problem is that it takes as [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Canon][canon]] everything JKR ever uttered including all films, computer games, Cursed Child, Fantastic Beasts etc., and they try to harmonize all discrepancies and conflicts among the different works. Results are sometimes rather strange, because especially in the later works JKR is incredibly sloppy with her writing (e.g., time travel or Fidelius Charm in CC are something very different from the rest of the canon). So, for example, if you reject (as every sane person should, IMHO) the Cursed Child, than you should be careful reading that wiki, and check what the citation for the given fact is. Fortunately, they are rather careful with having their references in order. Also, consider [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Mistakes_in_the_Harry_Potter_books][mistakes in the Harry Potter books]], which is a horribly confusing list where among simple typos and misspellings are rather serious issues.

I like [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/][HP Lexicon]]. It seems a bit less active than HP Wiki, which means it is less affected by problems with the Cursed Child etc., and it is more oriented towards longer essay style pages rather than Wikipedia-like ones. On the other hand, some of these essays are biased towards some specific opinion, there is less of NPOV there.

** The Sinister Man's /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ ( linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) ) features depictions of sociopolitical developments (both historical and contemporary) and governmental/organizational bureaucracies worth dying for.

When designing a world and its systems, I recommend creating tradeoffs for anything that can be useful to a character wherever possible. It's a good habit to get into that helps prevent against overpowered characters and contrived-feeling plot developments. Similarly, I'd recommend to never let any system(-in-context), organization, or (worst of all) person be perfect.

As for themes, I highly advise that authors be aware of how there world and overall plot comment on the themes that are part of their story and how that affects the resulting message that their story communicates. The same applies with tropes used in the story and smaller-scale plot developments as well.

Also, I'd recommend considering not shying away from making analogues to things in real life, even modern social or political issues. For, example, /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ has ongoing commentaries on both the Patriot Act and political polarization, and it's a better story for doing so.
