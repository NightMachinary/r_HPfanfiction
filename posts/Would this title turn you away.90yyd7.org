I've been considering a story with a focus on the interactions of how/why light and dark magic exist and what their existence would be like when I thought about how Voldemort's soul is inside Harry making him a hybrid of light and dark in some ways. Now, dark magic is represented by snakes constantly throughout the series, so would it be a stretch to connect Harry to a *Naga*? The story wouldn't even have Nagas in it, but I feel like there is a bit of a terrible writing connotation connected to the term due to their somewhat common usage in badly written stories. I'm not certain of the exact title but something like **Harry Potter and the Naga's [Insert word]** or **... and the [Adjective] Naga**.

Would this type of title instantly make you skip the story, would it spark your interest, or would it make you put it on the "Ignore on principle" list?


** As I haven't yet read a good story with Nagas in it. Yes I would skip this story.

** The problems I have are:

- Snakes are used extremely often in titles, and really worn as a symbol
- While your reasoning may be good, it's not really obvious
- It doesn't really connect to the story (as you admit yourself)

While it would not completely turn me off, try to have a title that connects to what is happening in your story, or at least what makes your story unique. These titles seem to work well, examples:

- A Long Journey Home
- On the Way to Greatness
- A Black Comedy
- The Changeling
- ...

Your title is just so generic, since it doesn't tell you anything about the story. Sure, it might tell something about the protagonist, but we all heard that Harry is also kinda snakey and we read a lot about how dark he is. There are not only hints in the original series (Parselmouth, ...) but also in like every fanfiction, ever.

So tl; dr: I don't think it's bad, but it alone is neither interesting not unique to your story.

** Yeah, I wouldn't bother using the word Naga in the title unless they actually had something to do with the story. Explaining the symbolism (if there's even any?) in an author's note would only make it worse.

*** ...This trope is the main focus of the actual series. My idea is more of a commentary on the hypocrisy of the "light" discriminating against "dark" magic and claiming the moral high ground because they advocate muggleborn/muggle rights. The focus isn't in the magic itself, but instead it would be on the social aspects that such a divide would create.

***** That's my biggest concern with writing fanfiction. So many presuppositions are brought into any aspect that it becomes a minefield of disconnecting what I write from what other people wrote. That's why I used "light" and "dark" in quotations as they aren't the words I prefer to use even if I don't know what will work best.

I can only imagine Voldemort running for Minister. "That Albus Dumbledore is /faaake news/." "I know what I need to do and I'm going to do it better than anyone else." "Those muggleborns are a hoax! You're telling me that two nonmagical people can make a magical baby? That's fake news people."

****** Try to keep your political opinions to yourself though. Keep in mind that not may everybody agree with your views and for some people it's an immediate turn-off to see them in a fic.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

******* I don't believe I expressed any political views. I merely made a couple of universally understood references. Also, it's pretty hard to keep political views out of what is essentially a political story. I have no intention of brining up real world issues, but if the story demands me to bring such a view then I have no qualms doing so.

** I'm used to daft titles anyway, it wouldn't make a difference for me as far as trying it out goes. But I'd advise against it in the sense that if the title promises me some nagas, then goddammit, I want me some nagas. If you want to insert them into the /Harry Potter/ worldbuilding, I firmly believe it can be done, and well...

...and it'd make me all the more upset to read the story and find out it /wasn't/ actually about nagas, but just Parseltongue --- much like I become (perhaps unduly) upset with stories that brandish about "Basilisk" in their title, only for it to just be a metaphor and the story to be a Slytherin-Harry that doesn't even feature the Chamber of Secrets in any prominent way, or other things of that nature (oh, all those fics with "Phoenix" in the title that scarcely mention Phoenixes at all...). Mind, Rowling made a similar mistakes with /Goblet of Fire/, which was much more about the Triwizard Tournament than the actual Goblet (which is an underused, underexplained, underdevelopped plot-device).
