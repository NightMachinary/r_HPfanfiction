This is pre-Hogwarts, and Grindelwald cannot cast harmful magic except in self-defense at reasonable levels.


** Would love to read this.

(prompt-within-prompt) Petunia and/or Vernon have to explain Grindelwald to the neighbors.

Also OP: Am loving your user flair.

*** It was meant as a humorous prompt.

Thanks! I made it up when I saw a thread about disturbing fics. "For the Greater Goat" is actually my [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] username.

**** I can't believe this is legit. Brilliant!

As for the prompt, I'm seeing Grindelwald teaching German and his ideology. Petunia tries to ban the German when little Harry refuses to speak English and Grindelwald riots. All the windows at number four break, the kitchen catches fire, and in the middle of the night, Petunia finds herself being steamrolled by Dudley's toy tank.

Also: Gellert Grindelwald is rather difficult for a small dim child like Dudley to manage, so the Dark Lord of Continental Europe and (Soon-one day) Everything Else must content himself with “Waldo.”

***** "Where's Waldo?!" Dumbledore said frantically. "He has absconded with Harry. He is dressed in bright red and white stripes."

****** Harry is on a school trip where all the chaperones are wearing red and white stripes. Dumbledore keeps pulling them from the group, thinking it's “Waldo” in disguise.

Waldo writes a letter home: “Albus: I never knew children ate so much. The Dursley boy is inflating like a balloon. His mother spends more on sweets than my Glorious Revolution budget. I refuse to follow her example. I refuse to go back to prison for not following her example.---g ... P.s. Have attempted to debrief the Boy of Interest on the Glorious Revolution. We are making progress: He can almost pronounce “glorious” now.”
