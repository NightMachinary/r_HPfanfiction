I've been poking around for a while to see if I could find this fic but I haven't had any luck so far. The details are as follows: Harry is lying on the floor of Grimmauld Place after the war, and I believe Ginny is there as well. Harry discovers he has exceptional control over fire and is playing around with it. He is maneuvering the fire around a chandelier(I think), when the fire somehow creates a phoenix song. He is then transported to another universe (not that he knows it yet). Sirius finds him and Harry freaks out, running to Hogsmeade I believe. In this universe James, Lily, and Harry are all alive but I think most of the Weasley family has been decimated. New Harry is injured fighting deatheaters and brought back to Grimmauld Place believed to be a deatheater. They use Pomphrey to question him because Harry still doesn't realize he is in a new universe. The only other thing I remember is that Ginny was also transported to the new universe. The fic is short and incomplete.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
