No offense to all the Harriet's out there, like you actaully exist, buy when doing a fem Harry just change it to anything else like Holly, Helen or literally any girl name like she's a girl you can move away from Harry.

P.S I know why they do it but come on just have some creativity it's a fic go crazy with it and go insane change anything you want.


** Harriet's a common, rather middle class, name in the UK and I don't really get why everyone gets in a twist about it.

**** There were two in my class of thirty at school, dozens at my uni (it was very rah there though) and my youngest sister is close friends with one too. I'm 28 for context, so not a wildly different generation to Harry Potter!

*** Mostly because it's lazy af, and speaks of a general lack of creativity on the Author's part. Every "Harriet" fic I've ever read has been a canon rehash, likely for the same reason.

It's even worse when they feminize the second name as well, and turn her into Harriet Jane. It's a sign of an insanely uncreative fic and I'm not here for that.

** I'll take Harriet over all the fanon Evans flower names any day.

In fact, I don't know why you thought this was worth complaining about, since Harriet seems to be a pretty uncommon name for her.

** We don't know why he's named Harry in canon. We don't know Lily's parents' names, so maybe he was named after Lily's dad. Maybe he was named after Lily's mom, but the name Harriet was changed to Harry. If he'd been a girl, they could have just used Harriet without changing it. Basically chill out about the name Harriet. There are perfectly good justifications for it if someone likes it.

** Holly makes the most sense in my opinion, it sounds as close enough to Harry and it's a plant name keeping in the theme like Lily and Petunia. (For some reason I always imagine that their mum was called Heather... )

*** James himself has a normal name, but he's the son of Fleamont and Euphemia, and two of his three best friends are Sirius and Remus; that's a lot of possible room for 'this is a pretty great name!'. I get the feeling that Lily was probably in charge of picking Harry's name.

*** Eh, a quick Google suggests that while for some reason it really fell out of favour as a name in the US in the 1960s, in the UK it has been consistently more popular, if still not exactly common. According to ONS, neither Harriet or Harry were on the top 100 baby names in 1974, or 84 but both were for 94. Also, as someone else has said, why would you expect wizarding naming fashions to look anything like ours given how location/class/culture dependent it can be.

** In the end I used Rose Potter, when I needed Harry's sister, but if I ever write fem!Harry I would make her Harriet (and I use Emma and Dan for Grangers) just to get rid of people who are so stuck up on names.

** I love it when fem!Harry is called Dorea. It is a nice way to say that JK was wrong and James was directly related to a Dorea, even if it is the wrong generation. Also a nice message to Sirius in the way of 'a nice Black does exist - therefore you will be my kids godfather'.
