:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
My brain is a mess and I honestly don't know if what I remember is one fic or two fictions?

Edit: It is two fictions, the later one is found. The one I would love help find is this one:

I remember is Harry sneaks off to London, finds an apothecary shop. He discovers what he has been doing is magic. The shop owner allows him to work, even though Harry is 8/9 years old, as he knew (though he didn't tell Harry) that something wasn't right and that the alias give - Evans I believe? was a cover for Harry's true name. He pays Harry for sweeping, allows him access to books, and make sure he is fed.

Okay this second part has been found! Thank you LadyDuchessRed! I'll leave it up though for those interested!

The second part (or story) is the Weasley sons get jobs during the summer. Charlie works at an animal sanutary featuring large and sometimes dangerous animals or endangered ones. There are unicorns and Hagrid is talked into taking his giant Acromantulas there. Hagrid actually stays there and gets a Beast Handling License (?) and is mad when he finds out what Dumbledore used Fluffy for when borrowing him. Percy works in a bookstore or used shop. He also gets a card for the Wizarding library. Molly Weasley isn't thrilled.

I think eventually Arthur is able to, with the help of Malfoy and another rich pureblood, to get a job mixing magic and technology. Again, Molly isn't happy.

Then, the other part is Molly and Arthur separate. Ron and Ginny live with her. Eventually, Ginn gets angry Arthur won't allow her more money and does an illegal/dangerous spell to strip him of his parental rights - leaving her with her Molly and her true father Dumbledore.

This one is found here: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14469255?view_full_work=true]] (Again, thank you LadyDuchessRed)

Sorry for all the information but this is driving me nuts. If anyone knows anything, I'd be grateful! Thanks!

** I think the second one (potentially the third also - not certain, may be combining fics myself!) is: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14469255/chapters/33426591]]

**** No problem! I was just rereading that a few weeks ago, didn't get to the part with Ginny but since I've read it before I vaguely remember it. Hopefully someone can find the Harry one - it sounds awesome! üòÅ

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-

*** No, I know Harry was helping out at the apothecary before Hogwarts. It was due to the owner Jacob giving him books to read in his cupboard that he learned about the Wizarding World and how their society is, even his heritage a bit.
