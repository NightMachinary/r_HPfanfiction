  In Asia an animal is found which men call bonnacon. It has the head of a bull, and thereafter its whole body is of the size of a bull's with the maned neck of a horse. Its horns are convoluted, curling back on themselves in such a way that if anyone comes up against it, he is not harmed. But the protection which its forehead denies this monster is furnished by its bowels. For when it turns to flee, it discharges fumes from the excrement of its belly over a distance of three acres, the heat of which sets fire to anything it touches. In this way, it drives off its pursuers with its harmful excrement.

From the Aberdeen Bestiary (well, actually from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnacon][Wikipedia]], but it's supposed to be a quote from said bestiary).


** Sorry I havent read any such fics. Honestly I've never even heard of this creature till you requested it, but I'd be up for writing a fic that features this creature. Maybe something to do with Harry being a lover of all things magic animals like Newt and Hagrid or maybe a version of Harry that has creature blood in his family line that attracts animals or something like that.

I am now picturing a creature inheritance fic where Harry ends up as a minotaur with caustic diarrhea.
