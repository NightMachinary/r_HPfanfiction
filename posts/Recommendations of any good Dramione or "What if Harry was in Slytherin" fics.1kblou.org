The first is a longstanding fantasy of mine, the latter, thanks to something new I just read. Thanks!


** Dramione recs? Hell yes, I have Dramione recs! (This is my specialty, for Dramione was the ship that launched a thousand ships for me)

What do you like in a Dramione fic?

*Lengthy coming-of-age (where Hermione/Draco grows up and matures /slowly/ through their relationship):*

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1][The Fallout]] by everythursday (also goes by Sage). This is also a war fic, so if you dislike those you probably won't enjoy this one. I personally love this story for the romance and the intensity of emotions the war evokes. Their relationship starts to really develop around seven or eight chapters into the story, so if you've reached that point and dislike it, it may not be worth continuing.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]] by Bex-chan. This is an interesting fic that begins in sixth year and develops into a parallel AU of DH. This fic /does/ take place during the war, but contains much less violence, emotional truama, and visible battle scenes than the Fallout. Although this fic is not complete, the author has nearly completed the story--it's only missing a few chapters.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3144908/1/We-Learned-the-Sea][We Learned the Sea]] by luckei1 (aka floorcoaster). This is a classic. An absolute Dramione classic. I highly recommend it. It's beautiful. Just... just read it.

*Forced Companionship/Marriage fic (where they are forced to be together in a romantic or psuedo-romantic way):*

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5095119/1/The-Dragon-s-Bride][The Dragon's Bride]] by rizzle. This is one of my personal favorites. It's a marriage fic, where the pair end up together by accident and have to work out their problems from there. It's an AU that takes place at Hogwarts, at the end of their seventh year.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3932315/1/The-Bracelet][The Bracelet]] by Akashathekitty. This could feasibly be placed under the lengthy coming-of-age section as well. It's a seventh year AU where the pair are bonded somewhat against their will through two magical objects. This has a well-written love triangle as well (I actually could root for the third point of the love triangle, but was satisfied with the ending nontheless).

*Adventure Partnerships (where they pair up, often to survive, on some sort of quest or time of hardship):*

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=367][Parade of the Sun]] by everythusday (aka Sage). If you love adventure stories (which I do), then this is absolutely the story for you. Hermione and Draco are each seeking a magical object, and this is the story of how they butt heads and tensely partner up on their quest. It's a wonderful story where their relationship isn't the driving force of the plot (not that their relationship isn't important to the story).

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=832][Finders]] by everythursday (Sage). This is a story that had me on the edge of my seat and actually gave me a bit of a scare. It's incredible. Hermione begins having visions of horrifying things (at first, in a very PTSD way), and slowly discovers the source is a bigger problem than she initially thought. Their relationship again takes a bit of a back seat in this action-y adventure/mystery, but is still a good Dramione story.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9336105/1/The-Interred][The Interred]] by GinnyRules. This story is not complete, but will be complete any day now (the author regularly updates and the story is nearly done). This is another mystery/adventure story that features the Department of Mysteries. I only recently discovered this story, and thought it was a good read.

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=3][The Symmetrical Transit]] by everythursday/Sage. You'll notice that there are a lot of her fics on this list. That's because everythursday is one of the best Dramione authors and the Adventure Partnership is a very common trope in her writing. It's been a while since I've read this particular fic, but I do remember enjoying it. It's set during the war, but the pair are removed from the fighting/action due to unusual circumstances.

*Passionate and Smutty (where they get together because of or for sex):*

/Note: These are not PWP fics. They are stories. With plots. And sex./

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3732710/1/Silencio][Silencio]] by Akashathekitty. This is the very first Dramione fic I ever read, and it's still one of my favorites. It's passionate, smutty, sad, and a great read. Honestly, if you haven't read this story, you need to, unless you just don't like smut (which would be unfortunate, because Dramione as a ship has some /great/ smut). The author has begun writing a sequel to this story, albeit very slowly.

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=441][The Complexity of Carnal Knowledge]] by Akashathekitty (who writes good smut). This story has not been updated in a while, which is sad. If you don't like reading WIP that may take a /long/ time to finish, then don't even start it. This story features Hermione and Draco as coworkers who may or may not be attracted to each other.

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1281][The Virgin Conundrum]] by Akashathekitty. I really like this story. Simple premise: Hermione wants to not be a virgin. It is not PWP. I repeat, not PWP.

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=108][Beautiful Disaster]] by ashleyfanfic. How do you feel about Veela!Draco? It lends itself well to smutty stories and light reading. This fic is not complete, but is a good read nonetheless.

*Redemption Stories (where Draco must atone for his past deeds, in one form or another):*

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2603288/1/The-Nietzsche-Classes][The Nietzsche Classes]] by Beringae. I /love/ this story. It's incredibly unique. The author has Hermione teaching a class of former Death Eaters the philosophies and histories of people like Hitler and Niezsche. It is very interesting from an intellectual and philosophical perspective; the author does a wonderful job of connecting real-world events to Voldemort's regime. Also, there is Dramione, but I read this story for the author's insight and analysis of Harry Potter.

*Memory Loss (where one of the pair loses their memory):*

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=718][Thirteenth Night]] by nelpher. It's good. Here, Draco is the one who has lost his memory--or rather, had it removed.

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=212][A Pound of Flesh]] by Pennilyn Novus. Another memory-less Draco. I prefer Thirteenth Night to this fic, but A Pound of Flesh is still worth a shot!

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7580458/1/Redemption][Redemption]] by anondracomalfoy. I really, really liked this story, having found it only recently myself. It's lovely, and has a few surprises up its sleeve. It's a bit of a mystery, but their relationship is central to the entire story. Beautiful story.

*Dark/Evil/Death Eaters (where Hermione is immersed in the world of Death Eaters, often as a "gift" to Draco):*

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=22][Tender Vengeance]] by Margot Le Faye. This could also be under the smutty section, but it fits better here, I believe. It's a dark and disturbing story where Hermione is forced to become a sex slave for DeathEater!Draco. It is not complete, but is fairly long anyways. Does contain some non- and dub-con.

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=288&chapter=1][Uncoffined]] by lady_of_clunn. I haven't actually read this story, but it is at the top of my to-read list. Several other people have recommended it to me, and the warnings the author gives certainly make it a good fic for this section. I can let you know whether I liked it after I've read it, if you'd like!

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=121][You Change My Mind]] by Akashathekitty. Another fic where Hermione is gifted to Draco. It's good, and contains some of the Akashathekitty smut that is so popular. I particularly like the ending of this fic, which I cannot reveal because it would ruin everything.

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=63][Master]] by Akashathekitty. A sex-slave fic that turns into something a little more. It is only a oneshot, so it's a lot shorter than the others on here. It's definitely worth a read!

*The Etc. Category (for fics that didn't fit anywhere else):*

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172243/1/Broken][Broken]] by inadaze22. This is an incredibly sad and beautiful story of loss, heartbreak, and eventual recovery. It's a story that makes me cry no matter how many times I read it. Brace yourself. It's powerful, raw, and mature. It's a must-read.

...Whew. I think that's all my fic recs for now. Sorry if it's overwhelming... I just dumped everything on you at once. If you have any further questions, go ahead and ask! And I welcome others to chime in if they liked/disiked any of these stories.

/Edit: I'll be sporadically adding new fics as I think of them./

** There are many good ones, but one of my favorite "Harry in Slytherin" stories is the one by Big D on a Diet: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do][What Would Slytherin Harry Do?]]

#+begin_quote
  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around.
#+end_quote

The story is told in a set of episodes so "complete" is a matter of taste. 44k words.

** I've been enjoying a long and emotionally sophisticated story called [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends or Truth and Reconciliation]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1994264/Vera-Rozalsky][Vera Rozalsky]].

Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

Harry Potter - Rated: M - English - Drama/Romance - Chapters: 66 - Words: 329,854 - Reviews: 1000 - Updated: 1-6-13 - Published: 11-26-09 - Hermione G. & Neville L.

It is in Hermione's POV and involves more than a few ethically surprising choices, but if you'd like to see a proper post-war fallout kind of story involving Hermione and Draco (and Neville and Ginny and memories of Tonks), it's worth the read.

****** Well for Every Thursday the premise is after Hogwarts, but before Voldy is dead, and Draco is with the Order of the Pheonix because of Pansy...everything else follows canon, as far as magic ability etc. Ron and Harry aren't in the story much.

You could try AkashatheKitty 's stories, they are really good and a little lighter. There are thousands of stories on dramione.org, though, find one whose synopsis is satisfying to you!
