I'm looking for a TOM RIDDLE fanfiction with OFC (IT DOESN'T necessarily ALWAYS HAVE TO BE AN OC, IT COULD BE j,k' rowling's character SOMEONE LIKE HERMIONE OR SOMETHING) traveling back in time( accidentally or not, it doesn;t matter).the Oc could even be a muggle or maybe even a person somehow sucked in from the real world to the harry potter universe. I do prefer if there would be romance. And not just from the OC. Maybe it could even be one sided from riddle's side? I searched so many fanfics who seemed to fit these terms, but i didn't like any of them. Some of them appeared kinda pretentious to me, and others were just dumb. I really don't know where to search anymore so i'm looking here for help.


** Do you mind if there's no time travel? If not, I would highly recommend linkffn(Hypocrisy by Sachita). It's a Tom/Minerva McGonagall fic. It starts their first year of Hogwarts and continues beyond Minerva's graduation. The historical setting in this story is one of the most accurate I've read in any fanfiction, and is truly a delight to read.

The characters are wonderfully fleshed out and don't deviate too much from canon. The romance is believable despite Tom clearly beginning his descent into madness.

I really love this story, if you couldn't tell.

  How could she sit there, looking at all the innocent children she had sworn to protect, when she belonged to the guilty ones? How could she accuse others when she should be accused? And how could she have ever been so stupid to fall for one Tom Riddle?

** linkffn(Out of Shadow by Sophiax)

The OC travels back in time from a dark future on a mission to kill Voldemort, but ends up falling in love with Tom Riddle instead. It is a good read, and Sophiax is a good writer. There is that classic Head Boy, Head Girl romance.
