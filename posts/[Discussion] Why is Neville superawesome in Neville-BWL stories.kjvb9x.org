I mean, isn't he supposed to grow more or less the same? The only significant change is that he knows his parents were killed instead of driven insane? I really expect that in Neville BWL stories Neville is more similar to his canon self than Harry for instance (who in this case I guess gets to grow with his parents)


** If anything Neville should be even more insecure of himself in this scenario since his grandmother would totally expect more of him and press him more, causing Neville to feel more like a failure at the start of his first year

*** It's all dependent on how the author spins it honestly. His grandmother may have also died in the attack, which would drastically change his circumstances. Maybe his father's wand was broken, thus meaning he would get his own from the beginning. There are also plenty of other ways that it can be tweaked at the discretion of the author.

**** Right. There would also be more outside interest in Neville, so his grandmother could find her options more limited, instead of having a monopoly on his development shared with those relatives she let near.

** Hmmm I'd think because if he is the BWL he'd be raised differently. In general it'd be assumed that he did the magic that got rid of Voldemort. Which would mean less pressure from family in terms of magic I'd think. (They wouldn't throw him out a window because he's already shown magic.)

With his family not putting him down/pressuring him over that I think he'd be more confident/self assured earlier. As has also been mentioned he's likely to get a new wand rather than his fathers which would help with his spellcasting.

I'd imagine Snape wouldn't hate Neville as much considering that'd mean Lily is still alive so he might not be as aggressive towards him letting him perform better there too as we've seen some of Neville's poor performance is nerves/Snape.

** Can you give some examples? Most of the Neville BWL stories I've read (For example, The Art of Self Fashioning, or The Other Boy Who Lived) had a rather average Neville as opposed to an OP one.
