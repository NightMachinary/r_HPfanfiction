Stuff like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry][Brutal Harry]] where his abuse shows. Even in Canon, he's treated like shit, forced to do all the chores, "Duck the occasional swing of a frying pan" and sleep in a Cupboard under the stairs, and is never bought prescription glasses, wrecking his eyes (even more so)

Harry not suddenly becoming super well adjusted, fitting into everything. I want to see him react like a human would, rather than Wizarding Jesus the Magical Forgiveness Man to the level of Narutotrash (I love the series Naruto but hate the character - the movie where he's locked in blood prison without being told it's a deep cover mission, and is like "Kay I'll forgive you" When Kakashi buys him Ramen. - Trashy film with 1 good character - Ryuzetsu)

Only example I've seen that didn't end in "Kayiforgiveyou" immediately was Brutal Harry. Any others?


** I think the Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady does this. Pretty much canon Dursley behaviour, but Harry's response to them is different. He's more affected than in canon, but never "snaps out of it" and realizes they were abusive, which is something that's bothered me in other fics. So far he's finished 3rd year in the series and is still slowly learning what parts of his childhood were not okay.

The series has 4 complete installments, and BrilliantLady only has 2-3 chapters to finish writing before she'll start releasing the 5th.

  Friendless, bullied, seen as worthless by the Dursleys, Harry's natural rebellious and adventurous nature was repressed. Life was only bearable if he kept out of the way so he grew up unwilling to step out of line. He lives by his wits but has high ideals and courage below the surface. Harry is simply reluctant to draw attention to himself --- it's less painful that way! H/G. Ron/Hm.

Kakashi offers to buy him Ramen and Naruto is like "Oh, kay" and is forgiving. That's the sort of Harry you get in Fanfiction, or even Canon, far too often.

Did Kishimoto approve that? Because I didn't think even he could produce something /that/ bad.

1. Deep cover mission /where you don't tell your operative/!?!? He doesn't even know there's a mission, what kind of crack has Tsunade been smoking, just piss off Naruto and hope for the best? What the /fuck/? There's just.. so much wrong with that. So much. Wow.

2. Naruto should be able to absolutely shit on every ninja that appeared in that movie, at the same time, without breaking a sweat. Utterly ridiculous.

3. Yeah you're right, the forgiveness there is /awful/.
