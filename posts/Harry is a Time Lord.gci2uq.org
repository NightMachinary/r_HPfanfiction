Alright I have a hard request for ya'll to fill. I am looking for Fics where Harry is a Time Lord. The hard part is it has to have more than 10 chapters. I was considering it had to be complete but then that would be impossible... XD

He is a time lord but the reveal is near the end.

*** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Heartlands of Time)

A groundhogs-day looping Harry Potter, reset back to the Very Beginning upon Every Death, in the world of an Evil Overlord List abiding Dark Lord... It's been uncountable millennia from the relative prospective of Harry, and as a result he's completely off his rocker... Time, itself, is beginning to break down, and we're approaching his Final Chance. There's no Plot Armor in this world. Get ready for a /wild/ (and confusing) ride!

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  Sequel to Wastelands! Time has all but run out for Harry Potter. There are no more second chances. No more desperate bids for salvaged redemption. The game has changed, and in the end Harry will learn that the cost of his defiance has never run so high.

** linkao3(798851) is nine chapters, but complete. Harry is the Doctor. Reasonably sure the same author has one where he's the Master as well.
