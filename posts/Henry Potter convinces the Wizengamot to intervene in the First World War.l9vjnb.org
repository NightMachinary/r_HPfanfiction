I read on the wiki that the Potters may have been omitted from the Sacred 28 due to Henry Potter condemning the minister for preventing intervention in the Great War. The idea is that Henry manages to convince the Wizengamot to intervene in the war and uses it as an excuse to weaken the more conservative or Dark elements of the government by drafting members of their families. Basically it's a bunch of pure-bloods being forced to fight alongside and interact with muggles. My own sort of headcannon for the au is that it results in the collapse of the statute of secrecy as well due to other nations mobilising their wizarding populations and all the magic being to much to cover up.


** The problem is that if british and french wizards joins the fight, german and astro-hungarians are also going to join.

What would be more interesting is how magical europe is compared to muggle europe, is the HRE still in effect, is Germany unified, is austria hungary unified, does magical poland exsist?

It is a open hole that we have basically zero information on

*** With regards to the mobilisation of the French causing the mobilisation of the central powers that's what I also though. Also imagine the boost to the Russian war effort if they mobilised their wizards, it stands to reason that they would have the largest forces of mages which I imagine may result in a more even eastern front. Regardless of how the war turns out in the end I reckon it will be very bloody (well, more bloody than it already was).

**** its a complete mess if wizards does get involved though, is Magical UK a colonial power capable of drawing upon the african + indian wizards and witches, same with the french in regards to africa. is America unified in the same fashion of the non magical world or does native american tribes still rule parts of the continent.

in Europe, how does the borders look like, is magical germany forged by magical Prussia? does other European states exist, do Spain have colonial holdings, same with the Dutch.

Do Russia have a unified magical country, with a standardized educationor is the British/french or Germans better educated.

To create a realistic scenario, you have to world build to a insane amount

** Henry Potter's request goes through and he himself + some Pureblood family lords go to intervene in WW1.

The pureblood family lords completely hide themselves with invisibility cloaks and muggle repelling charms and bide their time for the perfect opening. Henry takes offense to such cowardliness and goes to battle with magic.

As you would expect from 1 wizard fighting a army squadron, Henry dies quickly. The Lords quickly cover up his use of magic, take his body and return home.

Final Result: The Potter Family's patriarch dies, the stupidity of his death is mocked for years and the Wizarding World's conviction to not meddle in the savagery of muggles is reinforced.
