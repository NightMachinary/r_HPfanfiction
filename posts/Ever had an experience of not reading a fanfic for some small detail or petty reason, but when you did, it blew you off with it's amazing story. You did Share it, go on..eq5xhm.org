** I didn't want to read Stages of Hope because the summary made it seem like it was a joke. After I actually got around to reading it, I thought it was great.

** I couldnt read Harry Potter and Prince of Slytherin, it sounded generic.

I read it two weeks ago, finished it all in 3 days. Like damn it's pretty good, only I want more brotherly interactions but that ruined now!!!

Warning James Potter is bashed, however it has a reason. I dont like it but I will let it slide due to the fact it plays in the story.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** I had put off linkffn(the pureblood pretense) forever because I thought it sounded strange and had such a different start from canon, (alive parents, voldemort isn't the obvious terrorist but instead a political fiend). Then, when I caved and read it, I couldn't stop, it was well written and super interesting!

** Hey, just weird american language things but the phrase is "blew you away" not "blew you off", the latter sounds vaguely sexual.

its not really important and language is poopy with all its rules and oddities anyway but i figured id mention it.

**** Teen slang has turned ”blew you off” into a sexual phrase due to the term ”blowjob” ---> ”she blew me off”

it is annoying that it can be confused for either so I'm just going to ignore any differences

** Probably The Dogfather. Because really - the title is atrocious, the summary is atrocious and makes me cringe and you look at those two things and expect the worst.

... It was actually rather good.

**** Hello Alma!

My name is StatusCount - I've made a new account!

I was not sure whether you liked chat or not, so I just replied on a random comment of yours.

I don't ever want to lose contact with you - although I barely know you, you feel like my friend.

****** No, no one was being mean! I just felt like it.

Sometimes you just need a fresh new blank slate! :). My feed was getting very clogged up so I did it.

Also, I don't like the fact that my cousin and entire family can see my account so I've changed it without telling them! I know they don't look at it but it just creeps me out that they CAN look at it if they want. So now I've removed that ability.

I think that in the future I'll try to erase as much evidence of my existence as possible that links to my name in real life, because I don't want too much to be pulling on me as I move forward i life. I'll keep anonymous accounts like reddit and 4chan however!

Oh. I just realized the remindme 20 years that I did on my old account won't work anymore. Oh well. I can do it again!

** It took me AGES to get to Forging the Sword just because I couldn't really take the premise, turned out completely differently than I thought it would be and one of my favorite fics.

I'm currently reading the second book of the Stygian trilogy by Slide and absolutely loving it, read the first book a couple years ago and for whatever reason just couldn't get into the second one right after. After this I'll probably have the same experience with Anguis and Shade to Shade which I've never been able to get into.
