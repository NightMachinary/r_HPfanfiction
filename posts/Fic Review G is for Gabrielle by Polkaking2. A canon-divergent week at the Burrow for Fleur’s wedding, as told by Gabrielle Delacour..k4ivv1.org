Trigger warnings below for discussion of sexual situations involving minors. Also for language because I get a little carried away talking about the first trigger warning. Obviously I will not be linking the fic due to Rule 8.

* Premise
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: premise
  :END:
In the summer of 1997, eleven year old Gabrielle Delacour comes to the Burrow ahead of Fleur and Bill's wedding sans her parents. Shenanigans ensue as Gabrielle turns out to be a plucky girl with a troublemaker's instincts and a taste for Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. This is a part light-hearted comedy, part adventure story as told by Gabrielle.

It only takes place over about seven days, but has a word count of 280k. For perspective, that is 30k words longer than Order of the Phoenix, which was the longest book in the HP series. A LOT seems to be happening at the Burrow at any given time.

The fic is ‘T' rated, and was written over 3 years between 2006 and 2009, so Deathly Hallows was not published when it was released, but there are clear signs of the story adapting to the canon storyline as it pans out. It is also part 1 of a 3 part series, the last of which is still unfinished.

* Plot
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: plot
  :END:
Gabrielle arrives at the Burrow determined to make an impression of being someone to be taken seriously. Like a lot of kids on the cusp of adolescence, she wants very badly to be grown up and invests a lot of time trying to impress the teenagers at the Burrow. Unfortunately, she is a magnet for disaster and quickly starts earning herself nicknames, starting with “the Blond Bludger” after she careens so hard into Harry on the staircase that she gives herself a concussion. She spends the rest of the story trying -- to no avail -- to get anyone else to call her by her real name.

The twins play a heavy part in Gabrielle's story as well. She first time she is pranked, she thinks to herself that these two boys are creative geniuses, and can't understand why Molly hates their products so much. When everyone else at the Burrow refuses to eat anything offered by Fred or George, Gabrielle tries it every single time, never even asking what will happen to her. She quickly becomes their guinea pig for prototypes. George is a bit kinder and more doting on Gabrielle, and in turn Gabrielle latches onto him and develops an enormous crush.

She also forms something of a ‘coven' with Ginny and Hermione, especially after the latter two girls discover the book on veela sex magic that Gabrielle's grandmother smuggled into her luggage for the trip. Ginny and Hermione immediately start making use of the rituals detailed in the book, especially the ones for protecting the veela's “chosen warrior” -- on the excuse that they are magically protecting Harry and Ron. The rituals require nudity on the part of the “veela”, but not actual sex. Unsurprisingly, when Ginny and Hermione sneak into Harry and Ron's respective rooms naked in the middle of the night, sex happens anyway. Even though the sex doesn't occur on page, this by itself would be enough to apply Rule 8 to this post, but this is not the Rule 8 breach we're going to talk about. We'll get to it.

Against the backdrop of the Burrow's daily life as experienced by Gabrielle, we also get peeks into the lives of other major players from the main plot of Harry Potter. We see Voldemort attempt to infiltrate the Ministry by setting himself up as the anonymous founder of a right wing political party, unaffiliated with the Death Eaters.

When Harry and Ginny's sex magic ritual destroys Voldemort's body (yes, really), we get quite a few scenes from Snape's perspective as he struggles to put Voldemort into a new body while protecting Draco from Voldemort. Incidentally, he eventually finds a willing host for Voldemort's soul, and his name is -- I kid you not -- /Dickinbottom/.

We also get some parts from Harry's perspective as he attempts to adapt his plans to destroy the horcruxes, and also reflect on how silly he was to ever try to break up with Ginny. Learning that sex is a thing often does that for a teenager.

* Writing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: writing
  :END:
Honestly the writing style really impressed me. When you consider how very long it takes to get through a single day by word count in this story, it remains remarkably eventful and entertaining. This is a fic which makes great use of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreliable_narrator][unreliable narrator]], as we see events and conversations fancifully interpreted by an eleven year old girl whose first language is not English.

Although the occasional French word makes an appearance here and there, when characters are speaking in French there are usually brackets inside the quotation marks to differentiate, which I found really helpful. Some stories assume that their readers speak conversational French and as a result dialogue just ends up getting missed because it isn't translated. When Gabrielle and Fleur speak in English, the accent is written in similarly to how JK wrote them, though Gabrielle's accent is lighter than Fleur's.

I don't have a lot to complain about in the technical department, other than the author seems to think that Greyback's first name is spelled Frenrir, and occasionally the dialogue became a little chaotic and hard to follow, but for the most part it's very easy to read.

The style is past tense 3rd person limited. I'd say about 70-80% of the story is Gabrielle's perspective and the remaining 20% told between Voldemort, Snape and Harry. Gabrielle's perspective is a colourful microcosm of the Weasley's world in one of the most chaotic times in their lives, which we follow hour by hour and enjoy the fun of her mini misadventures. With the other characters, time moves much more quickly and the style changes to a more traditional adventure story, with some genuinely dark stuff going on. It's a weird and jarring contrast though, to have the serious and gruesome parts play second fiddle to the perspective of a little girl. Especially when you consider that the whole story is only a week long, it might have been better to leave out the plot-heavy elements entirely and just let it be the light hearted comedy it set out to be.

Something which was really in this story's favour was the way it brought the perspective of the world /down/ a level, by focusing on the small things as a reflection of the smallness and childishness of our protagonist. There is an almost Disney-ish cast of supporting characters in the house who interact almost exclusively with Gabrielle.

The kitchen appliances are all magical, semi-sentient and temperamental, and Gabrielle's daily struggles include having to cajole and trick them into just allowing her to make breakfast. The kettle, a gift to Mrs Weasley from Mrs Delacour, speaks only French, adores Mrs Weasley, declares that Gabrielle is “not a proper witch” and refuses to boil water for her. It is likely a voice given to the self-doubt Gabrielle tries so hard to fight against in her effort to prove herself as someone worth something.

There is also Crookshanks, who seems to take every opportunity to police Gabrielle and ruin her plans. It doesn't seem to be out of any particular protectiveness of Hermione or the Weasleys; as far as I can tell he's just an exceptionally petty cat.

Then there's the Second Corps -- a regiment of ‘Guardin' Gnomes who have been recruited by Fred and George to guard the Burrow and also sneak little gifts and wheezes to Gabrielle. It's like Cinderella's mice, but much more crude.

The way that magic sparks in every mundane corner of life is such a creative interpretation of the world of Harry Potter as it might be experienced by a magical child, it is such a strength of the writing. It was so accurate to the experiences of a child though, that it also reminded me of what sucked about being that age. All the other characters in the story show remarkably little regard for Gabrielle's agency or privacy, or feel perfectly entitled to publicly criticise her appearance and talents. Fleur is the worst offender, going to so far as to replace Gabrielle's entire trunk of clothes with ones she prefers because she doesn't like Gabrielle's muggle tastes. But even Ginny, who is closest in age to Gabrielle and shares her room with her, is guilty of taking Gabrielle's belongings and simply not returning them. Gabrielle's mother and aunt when they finally arrive, freely disparage and make barbed remarks at Gabrielle's expense, and all in all I feel really quite sorry and frustrated for her a lot.

* Characterisation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: characterisation
  :END:
Let me start out by saying that this type of story is right up my alley. I LOVE reading stories which add depth to minor characters.

And there was a lot about *Gabrielle* that I really liked. She feels like a real eleven year old, and she's spirited -- she is CONSTANTLY getting hurt, sometimes quite badly -- but is always getting back up for another round. She is a generally good person but isn't always good natured, and though she clearly does have some special abilities (such as an ability to “See” where the ingredients of her drinks came from), she doesn't feel remotely like a Mary Sue. In fact, I wish she had a little more success in her tiny endeavours.

What did disappoint me a little about her characterisation was that it put her completely at odds with Fleur. Apparently when she was eight (during Gof), she wanted to be just like her older sister, and this was when they were closest. But now she wants to put distance between herself and Fleur, so despite this beautiful little piece of canon in which the person who meant the most in the world to Fleur was Gabrielle, the two are not close at all. Gabrielle 100% sides with the Weasleys when they complain about Fleur, and Fleur is kept largely in the background, being snooty and two-dimensional.

*Ron* is not well thought of by Gabrielle. She mostly wonders what Hermione sees in him, and whilst some of this is clearly the unreliable narrator coming through, I think there is also a bit of author bias. Almost every single scene in which Ron appears features him either eating or being upset that he isn't eating. It's like that one line in Half Blood Prince but [[https://images.app.goo.gl/Antn4LARhqFnjVLg8][over and over again.]]

For *Hermione's* part, she is kept remarkably well in character, if perhaps not as domineering as I'm used to. One early departure from canon which I enjoyed enormously was the way Hermione and Ron finally confessed their feelings for each other. Hermione comes to the Burrow after having had a holiday in Majorca with her female cousin who studies anthropology, where they spent some time scientifically “demystifying the human form”. On a nudist beach.

And I need to share with you all how she describes her experience to Ron.

“She showed me how it was the female that controlled the ‘approach phase' as she called it. She showed me how different levels of ritualistic cultural display and physical transactions worked on different types of boys... My cousin said that in her experience most boys wait for a sign. Some need a billboard.”

After which she straddles him, kisses him and tell him she wants to be his girlfriend. This felt so much like the Hermione version of Ron studying the “Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches” in canon that it cracked me up. It felt like the most Hermione-ish confession I could think of.

*Ginny* is written more complexly than I usually see her. She's blunt and grumpy with Gabrielle, and I don't know if I would say that they ever truly became friends. Ginny is extremely shrewd and frequently makes transactions of favours with Gabrielle, if not outright manipulating her. Unlike Fleur or Fred however, she doesn't have any real malice for Gabrielle, it's just that her attention is so focused on Harry, whom she worries for constantly.

*Harry* himself is more or less in character but largely unremarkable in the story.

The twins are characterised exceptionally well, right down to differentiating between the personalities of *Fred* and *George*. Both twins really enjoy pranking Gabrielle, but George is the one who stops the pranks going too far or occasionally includes a Wheeze that Gabrielle will actually enjoy, like a hair colour changing potion. He also starts gifting her with things he has designed himself.

Which brings me to the weirdness and the reason I definitely cannot link the fic. Gabrielle accepts a challenge from the twins to see if she can break into Snape's potions cabinet at Hogwarts. Before they go however, George takes it upon himself to get her fitted for dragonhide gloves to make sure she isn't seriously injured by any protective spells on the cabinet.

He takes her to a leatherworking shop in Knockturn Alley, which is apparently largely a sex shop. Mr Lunky, the shop owner, has Gabrielle measured for the gloves. Being a magical store, the tape measure moves of its own accord, and doesn't stop at measuring her hands -- it goes under all her clothes and pinches her nipple. [[https://images.app.goo.gl/k86nGNJVFz8fA7LRA][This is apparently fine.]]

When the gloves are finally done, Lunky gives Gabrielle much more expensive gloves than George ordered. He gushes to Gabrielle how she reminds him so much of his wife (whom George states categorically looks absolutely NOTHING like Gabrielle), then promptly closes his shop for the rest of the day so that he can rush home to fuck his wife. I think this is implied to be a manifestation of Gabrielle's veela powers, because apparently lots of old men look at Gabrielle and are reminded of their wives or daughters. If it hadn't been for this particular scene with Lunky it might not have been so goddam creepy, but I am SO fucking uncomfortable about a grown man becoming desperate to have sex after looking at a prepubescent girl.

Now let's talk George and Gabrielle directly. I think it's a really normal thing for a kid Gabrielle's age to have a huge crush on a much older boy who was nice to her. Even the fact that Gabrielle took every opportunity to pursue that crush and impress George does not raise any warning bells for me, but George reciprocating definitely does. George is nineteen, and at this time would be at the peak of his hormone-induced libido. I would expect him to be pursuing sexual partners at his age, and he does actually have a girlfriend, but displays clear favour to Gabrielle over his adult partner. I would have excused this (only a little) if the attraction on his part had also been due to veela magic and not of his own will, but the fic implies that it is almost certainly not the case. A little later on, George and Gabrielle even get into a play wrestle at the Burrow, which abruptly stops when Gabrielle is straddling George and feels him get an erection. NopenopenopeNOPE!

* TL;DR
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: tldr
  :END:
I wanted to like this story. I really, really did. There is a lot that it did right -- characterisation was fantastic and it all just felt so /magical/. It added colour and depth to the wizarding world in such creative and inviting ways. The author clearly has a lot of talent, but I am so, so uncomfortable with George/Gabrielle at this age, and I wish that it had been handled with more subtlety, with George not finding Gabrielle sexually attractive for several years yet. It doesn't feel quite right to entirely condemn the story either. A lot of the scenes in the story which made me uncomfortable were also clearly trying not to cross a line, and arguments can be made for the intervention of magic or even just how often stuff like this happens accidentally in everyday life. If it hadn't been for those scenes I would have whole heartedly recommended this story to you all. As it is I will say make your own judgement call about it. I'll leave it with a 6/10.

** The story seems like one I would enjoy immensely. However, I too can't stand creepy pedophelia in fics. Which is really too bad, because I often find myself bemoaning the fact that most fics don't really treat magic as magical, which it seems this one does
