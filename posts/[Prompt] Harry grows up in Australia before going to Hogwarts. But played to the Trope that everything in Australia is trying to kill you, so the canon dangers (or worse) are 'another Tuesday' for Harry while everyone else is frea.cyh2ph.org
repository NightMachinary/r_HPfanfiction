*** And suddenly I'm picturing that besides a very probable Dragon Reserve, that Magical Australia has a Basilisk Reserve too, or at least an infestation, since they're not naturally occurring in the wild (at least the first one introduced) they would definitely be an invasive species.

Though if its a perpetuating population (instead of a few spread out isolated cases still surviving from various dark wizards who got shipped in with the muggle criminals during Australia's penal colony period), that does raise the question of whether there's some idiot/asshole who is making them, or (worse) the +now+ wild ones have figured out how to either breed naturally (+Life, uh, finds a way+) or how to steal chicken eggs and balance +petrified+ toads on top of said eggs.

**** I've never understood the whole 'Harry only has parseltongue due to horcrux' seeing as Tom was descended off of the first Peverell brother, along with Harry off the third. SO, IF that's correct, either Salazaar is either born before them leading to Harry having the chance to gain it, or Salazaar was born after. However, I think the first. It is also possible, he is related to ole Anty by the Gaunts and not Slytherin. Now, I wish Harry was more creative and utilized that ability more at the least, and possibly had a pet snake either in fanfiction or canon. Also I believe it acted similiar to the workings of a hereditary gene as it was introduced when both parents had some muggle or were a muggle. Tom his father, Harry's mother Lily.

***** Tom was a descendant of the second brother and it's easy to say a descendant of Cadmus married a Slytherin descendant, but this fandom loves Harry the parselmouth so much I'm shocked so few have made the Peverell brothers a descendant of Salazar.

And he didn't utilize parseltongue because JKR wanted a clear divide between Harry and Voldemort. That's why she had him be so ridiculously horrified at what he did to Malfoy despite his actions the previous year and the next.

****** That's pretty stupid, along with the whole 'Tom's like me, but I'll deny it out of being afraid of being like him.' It is stupid because while they share similarities, they also share differences. I think that while he was afraid of turning out like him, he still should've at least recognized and accepted they were similiar, but that it's those choices that made them who they are. Also Dumbledore saying that Harry didn't go to Slytherin is bull. The only reason Harry didn't go was because of Malfoy meeting him, and being a prick. Maybe a bit of Ron pressuring him, along with Hagrid. That's it, so no 'you're different due to traits.' Harry could've done well anywhere. He is reasonably intelligent if he applies himself, can be loyal if you earn his trust, had a rather noble outlook on life, and probably held ambition. However, each houses would then lead him to develop their traits more thoroughly.

So he should be the dream prince of every teenage girl. At the sorting every eye was looking for that mystical black unruly hair, those green sparkly eyes and that famous lighting scar on his forehead. But.... Wait... No one could see him. His name was called: „Harry Potter!“ But no one stepped forward. Where could he be? Suddenly! A rumble! Cracks, screeches and claws against stone were heard. And then the doors of the great hall flew open, crashing against the walls leaving an indent. A huge hairy beast fell down and what seemed like a person stood above it shouting: „Yeeehaaaaa!“ A lasso was around the beasts neck, that later would be identified as an acromanrula named Aragog. Little twiches were seen. The figure shouted: “G'Day mates!! You're pet was attacking me!

This one has Harry being abandoned in Australia by the Dursleys, so he grows up there. It's a one-shot, but it was an interesting read.

  Harry was left in the Australian outback by his relatives. Rather than dying from exposure, the heat, or any of the many and varied nasties that could have easily killed him, Harry was found. Don't own. COMPLETE.

** I think an interesting side effect of this would be that "normal" in muggle Australia is a very different thing than is normal in suburban England, and so I can imagine the Dursleys acting very different in their quest to blend in
