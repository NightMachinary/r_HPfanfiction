:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Does anyone know a fic where Ginny's part of the golden trio from the beginning? And either Ron includes her more, or Ron's not there at all. And instead Ginny is the third person. I would like to see what would happen if Ginny was included more. Like would she have consulted in Tom Riddle if she had people to hang out with? So yeah, if anyone has any suggestions of this, pls let me know! Thanks!


** As a side comment, I always thought Harry's group of friends was missing one member...

So you have the golden trio, 3 is a magic number cool. But then in OotP you get Ginny, Neville and Luna... which makes them 6... shouldn't they have added a 7 member? 7 is a good magical number, right?
