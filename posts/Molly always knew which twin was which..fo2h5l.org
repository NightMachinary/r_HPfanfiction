My idea is that Molly Weasley always knew her children like the back of her hand and the twins could only pull one over her when she let them. She knew who was Fred and who was George but played along with their game of mixing up identities as she got to get her laughs in. She also knew that the reason they started it was after she had a day where everything went wrong and she was crying from the stress, both her boys saw this, and all of six years old, promised to make her smile.

The reason she gets after them is because she knows how corrupt the Ministry is and she wants to protect them by making sure that they have all the resources available to stop anyone from taking advantage of the twins' genius for their own profit.

It could end with them putting up a dedication to her when they open Weasley's Wizards Wheezes.

Could show that the reason she objects to Fleur is because she feels Bill is rushing the relationship, which is out of character for him as he is generally very methodical and Fleur is unwilling to meet Molly even halfway. It could be explained as a case of two strong personalities clashing, then finding common ground in the aftermath of the Half Blood Prince.

Edit: Wow, 50 upvotes? Did not expect that!


** This is very wholesome and I approve

*** Thanks. Just got tired of Weasley bashing and Molly bashing that exists in the fandom. I would write it, but I am pants at writing fluff and family feels. So, I left it up for more skilled authors to write it.

**** I don't read much HP fanfiction anymore (I read one when I was REALLY young in middle school where OP had a secret baby with Draco who turned out to be Fleur and Bill's kid I think and that story about killed meüò©üò©üò©üò©) so I have never experienced this. Is it prevalent across the board or in certain pairings/genres?

***** Generally occurring in Harry x Hermione pairing stories or Slytherin MC stories.

****** Ah, that makes sense. Because they hafta villify the competition so we as readers relate and cheer for the pairing.

No, it was on Wattpad, but I went and found it just nowüòÇüòÇ Betrayal by GlitterInTheAir. Ugh, I scanned over it and the memories are washing over meüòçüòçThis story was one of the ones that inspired me to write.

** I love any story where Arthur and/or Molly are more than meets the eye. We often forget that the canon books are written from the perspective of a teenager, and how little teenagers truly know about the adults in their lives. Molly's an Order member, and she successfully duels Bellatrix Lestrange. To cast her off as "just some house wife" always feels underwhelming to me.

*** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer Series]] has an epic Molly. The story is mostly about math prodigy Hermione. All the characters end up being a bit more mature. But Molly used to be a defence tutor, and ends up tutoring Hermione. There's three stories in the series, and it goes from years 1-7 and beyond. I highly recommend!

**** My headcanon has always been that Molly went the opposite way of the common ideal that women are supposed to stay home and be housewives. I think Molly excelled at school, near the top of her class, and many expected her to go onto have a great career. I'm thinking one of her children took after her natural skills, and I'm leaning towards maybe she could've been a great curse breaker and that's where Bill got it from. But she fell in love and she wanted nothing more than to raise a family. Her Prewett family pushed her to actually put her career first but she stuck by Arthur and said she wanted to be home. Only until Bill came along and the war started did they finally make amends, which she was able to do before losing Gideon and Fabian.
