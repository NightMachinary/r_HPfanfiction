I'm looking for fanfiction that focuses on Hermione. No slash, please, but some romance is OK. It would preferably be a strong Hermione, and probably AU. Thanks!

*** I've read some of these threads, but they weren't quite what I needed, so I decided to make my own. Thanks!

**** Yeah. I get they're probably useful in some cases but people saying "use the search feature" are hardly ever helpful
