Preferably complete, but anything with a sizeable word count and regularly updated is fine too.


** [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Betrayal_of_the_Best_Kind/index/][Betrayal of the Best Kind]] AU after GoF, Harry goes to Azkaban story (not much angst). 100k words + 100k word sequel.

  He had a crush. She was fascinated. What happens when fixation turns into solace? A one-shot of a mutually beneficial obsession.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.
