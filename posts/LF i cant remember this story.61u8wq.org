(i have tried googling i cant find them) in the story harry lost one of his eyes and he took an eye from the basilisk in the chamber of secrets and replaced his missing eye with it. another story im having trouble remembering is one where harry and snape travel to i think egypt and harry has a pet snake (yes it is a snarry fic) and they both train using staffs.


** Whoa that seems pretty cool! I wish I could help ya but the only fic I remember where harry loses an eye is completely different
