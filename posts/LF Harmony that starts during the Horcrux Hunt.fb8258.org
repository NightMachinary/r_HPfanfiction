I'd love to read something that happens after Ron leaves the Horcrux hunt, and Harry just appreciates Hermione so much for sticking with him and eventually starts getting feelings?

Long fic please, and preferably Hermione's POV, but I'm okay with Harry POV too!

Thank you! :)


** This isn't quite what you're looking for, given that it's a shorter story and that Ron didn't get saved in 6th year, but they do begin a relationship while hunting for Horcruxes.

The fic is short, but has a longer sequel titled Echoes in the Fog which involves dimension hopping.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

  ‘So why are you still here?' Harry asked Ron.‘Search me,' said Ron.‘Go home then,' said Harry.‘Yeah, maybe I will!' shouted Ron, and he took several steps towards Harry, who did not back away...What could have happened between Harry and Hermione in the Deathly Hallows after Ron leaves. This story mostly follows canon but provides a different look at how the relationships in HP could have formed had Hermione realized that her and Ron did not fit well together and that Harry, her best friend, was really what she was looking for the whole time.[Updated Sundays, with occasional extra chapters on Wednesdays]*note: this has grown into a rewrite of book seven
