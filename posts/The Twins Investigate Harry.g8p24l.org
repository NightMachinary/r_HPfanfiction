[CRACKFIC] A thought experiment between two brothers about their adopted siblings preferences in women...

Hired by their little sister when Hermione's love advice (date another guy and make him jealous) seems to have had the opposite effect: being that Harry wouldn't pursue he as she was in a relationship; Fred and George take a look into their silent partner to see what he seems to desire in a... partner.

Not much to go off of in all honesty, the only interactions the boy had had with the fairer sex being two disastrous affairs with two very different ladies: Parvati Patil and Cho Chang.

George determined that Parvati was an irrelevant factor as Cho was who he'd actually pursued. Making a case that (with a few stolen glances he'd thrown Katie Bell's way over the years) that Ginny was in with a chance as Harry CLEARLY liked ladies with Quidditch skills.

Fred disagreed initially, citing that Harry may have some sort of fetish towards "exotic" girls, though Ginny being a pretty redhead could turn Harry's attention to her.

The pair both eventually agree that Cho is who they should be focussing on, and agree that anything he may have seen in the girl lll, Ginny had the same but better. The pair more than happy to build up their baby sisters self-esteem with the facts and logic of their "investigation".

Until a slew of secret trysts are revealed to the public via the acid quill of Rita Skeeter, documenting flings with: Penelope Clearwater, Mafalda Hopkirk and even Amelia Bones. All leading to an idea spouting in the boys heads...

...that maybe Harry just liked women who were older than him... and they'd have to somehow break that gently to Ginny...


** Hermione didn't know if she ought to laugh or cry. The Weasley twins had transfigured their robes into an approximation of Muggle 1940s suits and were stalking through the Great Hall, glaring at people from underneath their fedoras. Professor Umbridge had demanded to know what was going on only to be brushed off with a: "Official business, toots" from Fred in his best approximation of an LA drawl. Hermione ducked her head into her book; someone had introduced them to The Big Sleep - or Who Framed Roger Rabbit? And when she found out who she was going to hex them into oblivion.

She felt them sit on either side of her and she didn't even bother to repress a groan.

"Say doll, you've got an investigative streak a mile wide..." George had the same rubbish accent going on as his twin.

"So what if I do?" She put her book down, intrigued.

"How about you be our Girl Friday on this latest case of ours? There's mystery and mayhem in it for you." Fred cocked an eyebrow.

"Why on earth would I want that?" Hermione snorted.

"Because only you can help us solve the greatest mystery of our current school year," George supplied with his accent wavering slightly. "Harry James Potter."

--------------

It turned out that being Fred and George's Girl Friday meant curbing their worst impulses and apologising profusely to people left behind in their chaos. Even worse than that was sitting in on "interrogations." At least Parvarti didn't seem to care; but five years in Gryffindor had probably made her immune to Weasley-based weirdness.

"The Yule Ball? Well we had that first dance, we sat together for dinner and that was about it. He seemed glad to let me go and dance with Antoine and his friends. No hard feelings either way." She shrugged. "We've gone back to being casual acquaintances at best."

"No longing looks, no... Moments under the mistletoe?" George leered.

"God, no." Parvati snorted. "We both needed dates, that's it. Besides, I prefer older men - much more mature."

"How much older?" Fred broke character as he leaned forward optimistically. Her face contorted in disgust.

Hermione cut in:

"Did you miss the part where she said "mature?""

Parvarti smiled at Hermione for the first time in over a year as Fred visibly wilted.

--------------

Hermione sighed as she conjured yet another box of tissues.

"I'm sorry!" Cho wailed. "T-t-talking about this stuff does this to m-m-me!"

"Don't worry, it's been one of those years - hasn't it?" Hermione said kindly. She was shocked when she received a glare in return for her trouble."

"Now Miss Chang, how would you describe your relationship with Mr Potter?" Fred got them back on track.

"Confusing, nice, but bad, but... " She seemed stricken for a moment. "It was nice in the beginning, flirting and the odd snitch fluttering about in my stomach - but then there was Cedric a-a-and -" And they lost Cho to another weeping fit.

"So it's fair to say that you were conflicted about jumping into a relationship with your dead lover's Triwizard rival?" George stated bluntly.

Cho outright howled at that. "I-I-it wasn't like /that/!" She protested. "H-h-harry is the on-nly one that understands! He-he knew Cedric! He saw him die!" She saw Hermione curl a lip in disgust. "Oh and you can shut up, Granger! If it hadn't been for you and your little "appointment" on Valentine's Day we might still be together!"

Hermione raised an eyebrow.

"Sorry, Chang. I didn't realise your fee-fees were more important than the truth about Cedric's death getting out."

They watched the cogs turn in the Ravenclaws head as she aligned the Hogsmeade date with that of Quibbler being published in her head. She lifted her head up high:

"May I go now. My relationship with Harry was a disaster. That is all."

--------------

"Why do you need to know all this stuff about Harry anyway? Is one of you planning on asking him out?"

Both Fred and George stumbled.

"Not us, dollface" George corrected her quickly. "An interested party wants to know if she has a hope in hell."

"Might I suggest that there is an easier way of going about this?" Hermione gestured at them to follow her.

--------------

"So, Harry. What do you look for in a lady?" Fred plonked himself on one side of Harry, as he moped on a sofa in the common room.

"Yeah, what gets your pottery wheel whirling?" George sat on the other side, effectively squishing The Boy Who Lived into place.

Harry looked panicked and suddenly Hermione could see a younger, less worried boy from the year before sitting where the angry young man had been. It was the Yule Ball all over again. She sat down in front of him.

"What treacles your tart?" She asked looking deadly serious. "Who butters your baked potato? We need to know, Potter. Our research depends on it."

The sight of all three boys staring at her agog was gratifying.

"Rooon! Your brothers are being really weird!" He called out. "And I think they've Confunded Hermione! HELP!"

Ron came running down the stairs:

"How weird? On a scale of Percy to Dobby? What was that about Hermione?"

"We are well beyond Dobby! They want to know what turns me on! And Hermione wants to know what treacles my tart! For research purposes!"

Ron's face darkened as he pulled Harry up and out of his brothers' clutches.

"I don't know what kind of sick prank you're trying to pull," he manoeuvred Harry behind him, "but you leave him out of it! Bad enough that you involved Hermione, but Harry's been through enough!"

"Or what, ickle Ronniekins?" George asked mockingly. "You'll tell Mum?"

"I'll deal with you myself." And just for a few moments, Ron drew himself up to full height and gave them a glare that proved he was every inch Molly Weasley's son.

Harry tapped his best friend on the shoulder and swept him up in a kiss.

"I'd say Harry's current type is a redhead who's willing to protect him against everyone - even his family." Hermione opined sagely.

"My hero," Harry agreed as he came up for air. Ron blushed.

"Someone has to save you, you're too busy saving everyone else." He turned a deeper shade of pink.

Harry pulled Ron behind him and went out of the portrait hole to find somewhere that was a little more private.

The three of them sat in silence for a full minute. Fred was the first to compose himself.

"Well. Mum will be pleased! Ginny won't be, but I'll tell her that she has a chance to... I dunno. Carry their kid or something." With that, Fred went to write a letter with the good news. There was so little of it to go about these days.

George turned to Hermione with a grin:

""Who butters your baked potato?" Really, Hermione! I think you might be a prankster yet."

"It was fun getting Harry to lighten up, and the look on your face!"

"Hermione Granger, I'll corrupt you yet." A look dangerously close to admiration gleamed out of his eyes.

"I'd like to see you try," she challenged.

"Oh that can be arranged."

"Buy me a drink first."

"Oh look!" Two bottles of butterbeer appeared in George's hands. "Looks like we can have that drink after all."

Hermione took a bottle.

*** Ginny said this-

/"I never really gave up on you," she said. "Not really. I always hoped. ...Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more -- myself./
