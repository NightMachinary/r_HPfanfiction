Ever since I had read my very first "classic" novel-length fic in my particular ship (10+ years ago), I had the intense desire to film it as a stand-alone fan video.

Now, with the massive success of the few shorts like [[https://youtu.be/EmsntGGjxiw][Severus Snape and the Mauraders]], my decade-long dream doesn't seem that crazy or far-fetched.

What would you think of student filmmakers or amateurs adapting some of the absolute best fanfictions into visual media? As an actor and screenwriter, I know I would love to help bring my favorites to life, but the lack of funding for a non-profit project might make it impossible.


** My Immortal: The Movie

I'd kickstart the shit out of that

** I'd watch it. But it would depend on how well done it was. I've seen some good student vids. And I've seen some really really bad ones. It's the acting that either makes or breaks it for me. Granted, I've been in community theatre since I was 10, so I do have higher than average expectations...

*** Agreed - I have very demanding tastes and of all the short HP fan vids I've seen (including the homemade music videos), the one I linked is the only one that meets my expectations. For me, it's a combination of the acting and camera quality - it needs that studio feature look to it.

I think the biggest problem we'd face is getting the funding...Especially if the Fanfiction we were adapting revolved around a ship that not everyone loved.

***** I'd have to say Severus Snape and the Marauders. The acting was superb, but it wouldn't have been enough without the outstanding camera and special effects to enhance the writing and fight sequence.

****** I haven't watched that yet, and I will do soon.

Have you seen the Greater Good? It was my first fan film and it was an interesting take on Dumbledore and Grindelwald's duel with Aberforth and Ariana

** I love Harry Potter music videos like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNvSka8a0Xo][these]]. Not FanMovies, but they're far easier to find.

** TBH I doubt much will happen of it. First you need a fic of sufficient popularity and quality to turn into a short movie. Then you need funding or a bunch of people that don't mind working for free. Thirdly, you need someone with great editing skills.

There are technical limitations as well. The more CGI you use the higher the computing needs go.

** I've wanted this for a long time, and I think someday we'll get there, but the reality is it's incredibly difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to make even a short film that's worth watching. The people who made that video did a kickstarter and they also made the Greater Good video in 2013. That's less than an hour of content in four years.

(also, had no idea the Severus Snape one was out, so thanks for the reminder to watch it!!)

*** Presumably a decent jumping-off point would be audio-drama.

Obviously good acting and decent writing and directing are still needed. But at least it can be done on a tiny budget.

** The problem with doing film stuff with the HP universe is how outrageously expensive it can get. You've got costumes, props, cast, sets, and the most expensive of all: CGI for all the spells. And they can't even recoup their losses as it is fanfiction.

** SS&tM was all right for a short film. Didn't like the plot (Snape could do no wrong, everyone else was at fault), but loved the casting! If you liked this one, you should check out the Albus/Gellert confrontation, also by *Broad Strokes Productions*.
