Hello, here's Friday and a +the end is near+ weekend is coming so can you recommend me some good bashing fics? Please no robst. I like robst but have read all his fics.

It would be great if it is Hary-centric


** Certain authors like to bash, here is a list I can think of:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/777540/Bobmin356][Bobmin356]] generally bashes Dumbledore and wizarding Britain.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] generally bashes Ron, Dumbledore, and the Malfoys. But Ron often gets redemption in his fics, while Dumbledore and Malfoys are killed off. In *Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650), he stopped picking on Dumbledore/Ron/Draco, but went after Slughorn, the Grangers, and Muggles instead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1251524/kb0][kb0]] generally bashes Dumbledore, Molly, and Ron.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1816754/sbmcneil][sbmcneil]] generally bashes Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4329413/Sinyk][Sinyk]] is a serious Dumbledore and Weasley basher. He/she likes to put bash announcements in summary.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2936579/sprinter1988][sprinter1988]] generally bashes Dumbledore, wizarding world, and often times the Order.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/670787/Vance-McGill][Vance McGill]] generally bashes Dumbledore and Ron.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2149875/White-Angel-of-Auralon][White Angel of Auralon]] generally bashes Dumbledore, wizarding Britain, and Ginny/Hermione depending on whom he pairs Harry with.

  It started with a surprising proposals from an unexpected source, but that was only the beginning. Soon, Harry finds himself dealing with forces beyond his imagination and dreams, and ultimately finds that the world is not what he believed it to be.

  Starts at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts. As Harry stands over the dead body of Voldemort he realizes something. Bad Dumbledore. One shot.
