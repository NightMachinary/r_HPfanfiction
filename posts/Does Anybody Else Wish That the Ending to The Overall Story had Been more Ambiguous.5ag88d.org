I honestly would have preferred there to be no epilogue at the end of the Deathly Hallows (which would also mean no Cursed Child "book"). This would have allowed us readers who grew up with these characters to imagine any sort of ending we wanted for them.

Additionally, it would have made Jo's life easier as she wouldn't need to go back with a revisionist's brush when she felt like she made a mistake (i.e. her comments about Ron and Hermione in recent years, etc.)


** I thought this post was pretty insightful about that. [[http://inksplattersandearlyhours.tumblr.com/post/97668139669/i-think-one-of-the-reasons-the-harry-potter]]

The 'coming full circle' symbolism doesn't work when the premise of the story is that the wizarding world needs improvement. Instead it just appears as though nothing much has changed since Harry's first year at Hogwarts. Voldemort didn't cause bigotry and death entirely on his own, he just used the underlying issues that already existed, and failing to address those issues and papering over the cracks doesn't work...

If the Hogwarts Express had looked noticeably more modern, or there had been muggleborn families openly reading brochures about how to integrate their kids into the wizarding world, or some kind of sign that things had improved since the 90s, it wouldn't be so jarring.

**** Agreed, reading that epilogue was like a slap to the face right after that ending...

  “Are you sure?” said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand.

  “I think Harry's right,” said Hermione quietly.

  “That wand's more trouble than it's worth,” said Harry. “And quite honestly,” he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, “I've had enough trouble for a lifetime.”

That's not how life works. You don't just sail through the after effects of a war as if nothing had ever happened. There were still many loose ends. It was as if Rowling herself wanted to finish it and leave her characters alone, but really she could have went more into the rebuilding of the magical world and even expanded more on it. Too bad, she decides instead to hand the writing rights for the continuation to some playwright who had little respect for the story and Rowling moves onto movies instead of books. Heck, the movies are expanding on /the past/. Not the present or future after the Deathly Hallows.

/strangles the air/ I don't even comprehend anything anymore.

***** I think even the "Hogwarts Express" epilogue would have been decent if it had been used to contrast the present with the past. Show or even hint at all the good changes, instead of wallowing in mediocrity.

If not for the magic, the Dursleys would approve of the epilogue.

****** Yes, agreed, they could have showed the progress made since the war, instead everything's /the same/. Which shouldn't even be possible considering how it's at least been two decades since then. Does the Magical World really not evolve at all in terms of culture and magic and technique? What a waste of potential that would be if that's the case. Especially after the war, the entire government was pretty much in complete disarray, what about the closings for the other characters? Show a bit of what happens after a war. The funerals held, the campaigns made by the newer generation after the war, getting rid of past prejudices and working on integrating muggleborn and magical culture together instead of separating them.

A Dursley approved epilogue... that's certainly a terrifying thought to have.

It does seem that there is a reason for most fics to show Magical England as somewhat stagnant, or stuck in time.

Canonically, they either move *very* slowly, if at all, or their society just does not develop enough in 20 years to warrant changes in one of their main yearly events.

** I think my greater frustration with the epilogue (not to mention the utterly terrible cursed child) is that it gives Harry a mediocre half-life. Part of the prophecy that directs the entirety of the story is that 'neither can live while the other survives,' but the epilogue has nothing new to show for his life. He's married to the girl he dated at 16, he doesn't have any friends he didn't have at 16, he's doing the job he sort of thought about at 16, and all of his kids are names after people who died before he turned 18. So much of life happens after 18...meeting new people, falling in love, heartbreak, trying new jobs, failing at jobs, finding new hobbies...Harry is supposed to finally be able to have a life, but he doesn't have anything NEW to show for it.

And more annoying than boring pairings, poorly named children (seriously, Harry, how did you expect to feel about a child you named after to people who treated you horribly?!), and what appears to be a stagnant wizarding world, is that Harry joins up with the ministry. The ministry treats Harry worse than Voldemort ever does (at least he has reasons for wanting Harry dead)...why on earth would Harry go to work there?! He becomes part of the corrupt system he spent much of his school career fighting (if the fact his best friend admits to committing a crime to the HEAD AUROR and he just laughs it off)

*** This whole statement. It bugged the crap out of me that Harry apparently made all of his major life decisions between the ages of 11 and 17. Who the hell does that?

I wanted to see him stay friends with Hermione and Ron, but drift away from being BFFs and actually make friends with other people. And go out into the world and find interests other than "don't get killed by evil wizards." And heaven forbid he date anyone other than Ginny before getting married (Cho crying all over him doesn't count.)

**** Disagree 100%. Most news sites that reported on this (reputable ones anyway) said none of this, only citing the fact that JK Rowling thought that Ron and Hermione wouldn't work. I'm sure i'll get downvoted for this, but it seems like everyone on this sub has made up their own interpretations of the interview to fit their own opinions.

EDIT: How about someone offers a counter argument instead of using the dislike button to bury this opinion?

** While I would have loved an ending wherein there was no epilogue and Potter returning the Wand in Dumbledore's tomb and walking away, people like to have closure. Loose ends would've had rabid fans clamoring for what happened next, which will eventually lead Rowling to the epilogue and maybe the Cursed Child.

It would've been more dramatic, but human psychology got in the way.

** I'm with you on this. I would even go further and say that I had preferred if there was no kiss between Hermione and Ron and the relationships left completely open at the end of the book. The friendship of the trio was enough.

I remember that I stopped reading in the middle of the action because Ron and Hermione kissed and I was really miffed about that (I projected a lot of my own onto Harry, so I hoped Harry would get Hermione). To read that the character who really annoyed me in the last 2 books gets the character I projected a lot of my own emotional wishes onto... that didn't fly with my 16 year old mind.

When I then continued to read the story a week later and came to the epilogue... Lets just say that Rowling went from favorite author to 'literally the antichrist' in the course of a few pages. I was pissed. Not only because of Ron/Hermione, but also because /nothing/ seemed to have changed. The wizarding world was as supremacist as always - or at least I figured as much when Ron said he hexed his driving instructor to miss one of his mistakes.

Anyway, its over. Now that I'm 25 its not worth more than a shrug and a comment on reddit.

** That particular “fan”fic would have gotten created regardless of whether the epilogue was there or not. There is so much wrong with it as far as the author's approach to the world-building already done goes that to pretend that any of it is the fault of the epilogue or anything else Madame Rowling wrote is a disservice to her, if not an outright insult. That she did approve of it all could count as a mistake, but it is a decision-making one rather than a writing one that some people seem to like to imply it is.

As far as the pairing itself goes, Madam Rowling did admit that it is a pairing that is not the most likely to work and as such it is something of a wish fulfilment to her. That said, it being “unlikely” does in no way mean “impossible”, and many of the people who out and say that she'd said “impossible” or that she'd change the pairings if given another chance, do it because they are rabid Hermione/whomever shippers who are angry at Ron for taking the character played by Emma Watson out of the “free to pair with whomever and their dog” circle; in fact, there are some character analyses out there that take Hermione and Ron and drive through their characters fairly deeply only to conclude that the pairing could, surprisingly, work fairly well (though it could crash and burn too, of course, but the very fact that there is a real possibility of them working when some people seem to take it as impossible is fairly telling).

** I wasn't a huge fan of the epilogue as a piece of writing and for the fact that it sort of closed the door on any sequels set close to the end of the battle, but insofar as it told us that the characters wound up ok, I was fine with it. The final chapter before the epilogue was so abrupt that if there was no epilogue I would've felt really empty. I still argue there was so much still to resolve after Voldemort died that to end it there would have been way too ambiguous. I mean, as a shipper of Harry/Ginny, no epilogue would have left that entire plot line completely unfinished since Rowling didn't really give them a scene together after the battle.

** Well... Jo specifically stated that the epiloque was written as "Wish fulfilment", which means that if you particularly want to, you could consider it non-canon.

And Cursed Child was written by someone else. It was also written as a play, so to me, it's similar to the films in the sense that it's not strictly canon. I mean, there are things that happened in the films which expanded on the books, but there are also things in the films which directly contradict the books - because they are movies, stories in their own right, not moving illustrations of the text.

If you want to write it off that way, it's an option. You as the reader are free to interpret the books in any way that you like.
