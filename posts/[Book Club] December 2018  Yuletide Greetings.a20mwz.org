   :END:

1. Spoilers are allowed! This is a book club, after all.

2. As per *Subreddit Rule 5*, fics containing sexual or suggestive content involving minors cannot be recommended. This is due to reddit's [[https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-sexual-or-suggestive][site-wide policy]].

3. Please submit fics to be considered using [[https://goo.gl/forms/y60X6vHRLwFTFfYq2][this form]].

4. All stories submitted must be *complete*

--------------

This month, we will be doing something a little bit differently. As the holiday season abounds on us all, I wanted to include a variety of fics that touch on the spirit of this season. Please, don't feel obligated to read them all. I also attempted to select a variety of fics so that everyone could find something they enjoy.

*There is a good variant here, though they tend to follow happier, canon-compliant things.* I hope you enjoy these small selections. In the future I will endeavor to have some "themed" collections like this for special events.

** Stages of Hope was really good until right at the end. I wish there had been more conflict surrounding the "go and come back when you're done". Maybe even just by not exposing the plan?

​

I've heard it said: The reader can know the plan, if it goes wrong; or the reader can not know the plan, if it goes right. I suppose it's a neat twist to know the plan, and have it go right, but I still prefer the drama of an uncertain narrative.

** Finally got around to reading all of them (aside from Stages of Hope, which I read in the past). Both of the Weasley Christmases and 12 Days were excellent, characterizations felt spot on, but they definitely qualify as bittersweet.

Christmas Spirits is canon compliant and feels on point, but it's very short.

Wasn't a huge fan of The Potter-Weasley Christmas Party. It felt like it destroyed all of Neville's character growth into a confident person that happened during the Horcrux hunt (not to mention what an additional 17 years would do).

I'm saving Stages of Hope for when I don't have anything to do and can take time to process all the feels
