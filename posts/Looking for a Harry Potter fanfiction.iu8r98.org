:END:
I am looking for a fanfic that i read some way back. I remember that in this fanfic, Harry has a brother who was believed to be BWL. In this story was send to dursley when he had a few years, i remember that he was finally adopted by Voldemort. When he finally go to hogwarts, he go under false name (i think it was Selvyn or something like that) and was sorted in Slytherin and nobody knew he was adopted by voldemort or that he was Potter. In his years in hogwart he was selling his help or wares or something like that. I remember that he loved magical creatures. I know that this story is completed, and easily past 100 k words, but i dont remember if this was one fanfic or year by year. Also this fanfic was sad as hell, that when i was reading this i cry few times. I remember that in this fanfic Harry befriended Luna Lovegood and that she was killed by basilisk in the forbidden forest in fifth year. I will apreciate it if someone will let me help this fanfic. Cheers.


** I think it's Antithesis? It sounds like it, but I don't remember the loving animals part.
