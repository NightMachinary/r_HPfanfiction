Back when I started reading fanfics I would've read practically every fic regardless of tropes and pairings but now my taste in fics have got so specific, I just can't read about half the fics in the fandom. Anyone else have such experiences?


** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law][Sturgeon's_law]] is uncompromising: “ninety percent of everything is crap”. It is certainly true about fanfiction. Unless you start to filter out those ninety percent, you will read crap all the time.

The process you described is called maturing, and it is perfectly healthy.

** For me, most of the time it's a matter of the story being well-written and the characters making sense - and therein lies the crux of the problem. There's just certain things that, while they're /possible/ to do well, almost never actually /are/.

I can read a well-written bashing story - but 90% of the time, the bashed character is a caricature of a villain, whose plan could be neatly written off as "never gonna work" by any given 5-year-old.\\
Same goes for Lord Potter or Creature Harry - I've enjoyed a few, but most of it is written like some angsty teen's power-fantasy.

Then there's the myriad stories that are plagued by writing problems because the author is either not a native English speaker, doesn't bother to proofread, or loses the thread of their own story because they never planned past the start.

TL;DR 90% of /everything/ is crap. It's that hard-to-find 10% that you need to look out for.

The problem is when they come back with a list of surnames for him to add and more rings than "Sauron gave the Kings of Men" for him to dazzle girls with.

I would expect the test to be something like placing it into an enchanted parchment, bowl or something like that.

But then again, Wizards have stuff like the Marauder's Map, that can tell one's name regardless of any disguises, magic, or form. Maybe the Goblins could use something similar if they wanted.(We know they don't because Hermione fooled them with polyjuice)

**** Bashing, from my understanding, refers to taking a canon character and making them less /likeable/ or more /antagonistic/ - which has surprisingly little to do with how /well-written/ or /believable/ they are.

If a well-written villain in a fanfic would, given their original personality, be on the side of the heroes in that situation? The character is still being bashed, because they're placed in the role of an antagonist.

***** Making a character less likable or more antagonistic is not bashing. Bashing is exaggerating the negative sides of a character to comical levels or straight up invent shit to drag them down.

For example, let's say that Harry doesn't come across Hermione at Halloween, and she survives due to accidental magic (like Neville did). They don't become friends, Hermione stays lonely and grows bitter at her isolation. That's not bashing. However, if Hermione betrays Harry to Dumbledore in exchange for some books, well that's bashing.

Usually it's when things are over used or I realise they don't make sense and cant ignore it any longer.

Like, I read a really convincing comment about why it's unrealistic that Snape would be Draco's godfather. Now I cant stand to read about it and it's part of so many stories!

Rosier is one of them off the top of my head, but not Malfoy), and pureblood vs halfblood are the big ones.

Added to that... when you choose godparents for your kids, you pick from close, long time friends and family members. Snape is neither - he's a fellow terrorist that he's been on (I assume?) somewhat friendly terms with for maybe three years at the time of Draco's birth.

**** Sorry, tried to find it but no luck (I have a feeling it was a comment thread that got way off topic from the main post). So kudos to the OP for doing the hard yards, sorry I cant link you but what I recall is this:

The main issue is that Lucius is a blood purist from a prestigious family and Snape is a half blood from an impoverished background and with a Muggle name. He just doesn't have the status to be worthy of Draco (from a Malfoy perspective).

Lucius is (I think) a few years older in school, so even if he welcomed Snape to Slytherin or helped recruit him to the Dark Lord's service, that doesn't mean they were friends or close in a personal way. If anything this establishes even more a relationship dynamic where Lucius is the superior one and wouldn't see Snape as a capable equal. Not at that stage anyway.

The other point was that Lucius wouldn't need to make Snape Draco's Godfather for future perks or leverage, because Lucius would expect that as a Malfoy (as someone who 'helped' Snape in their youth and as former comrades) that Snape would own him the respect of doing everything possible to help his son anyway.

For me personally, I also think there is an issue with the timeline. Snape was 20/21 at the time, so again I think too young to be Lucuis' choice at this point. Draco was over a year old when Voldemort lost his body, I'm not overly family with godparent tradition but I assume the people in question were already chosen and at this stage I also assume the Malfoy's were still confident in Voldemort's victory. No need for a double agent as a fail safe. They could have picked him later but Lucius was probably free & clear legally before Snape was.

Add another 10 years and I can see that Lucius could have developed a decent friendship with Snape, one with more respect, but that would have come later.

But then again isn't that just like YA publishing? How many Twilight or Harry Potter clones came out in the years after those two became popular?

On its own, these are both fine beliefs too have. The one you seem to be having trouble with is that he thinks that Europe and the US didn't make them that way, which is an illogical rejection of colonialism. That's not really what he's saying though, as evidenced by him saying later "the backstory doesn't matter." It's not that he doesn't know colonialism exists, it's that he's tired of people defending the present day dystopian of these countries with colonialism, as if a) that changes the facts of their existence and b) they wouldn't have discovered how to be shitty in their own special way eventually like the rest of the world.

You could also have issue with Harry's reasoning ability and say that even though Noodlehammer says Harry doesn't give a shit about race, he's just using that to cover up the fact that he's defending his racism with "facts and logic" about the country. To this I say: you have the wrong context. In this story, Harry has to deal with the country and its representatives, not random joe shmoes, so this holds true. That means that Harry's views indicate Noodlehammer doesn't care about race either.

I don't think he's racist or mysogynstic. Writing a male fantasy doesn't make you misogynistic, just like a straight girl writing fetish wolfstar smut isn't trying to fetishize the gays. It's fanfiction, and people can write fantasies that don't reflect how they act in real life, even if real views are sprinkled in. All of the evidence suggests to me that Noodlehammer is much more the kind of person to not believe in something then believe in it, and that his fic is more of a reaction than action, if it is something at all. And you still haven't addressed my argument from earlier.

Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

*** I have a number of entries in my "stories I've read" file that have a comment on the order of, "Started good, getting worse, not good enough to continue."

It's interesting that, in my experience, the ones that start relatively well and then deteriorate greatly outnumber the ones that have a rough start and get better. I suppose it's the difference between getting tired of a story in the first case, and improving as a writer for the latter.

** Yeah... I got into fanfiction because of HP and Twilight (I still can't believe I read those books and read fanfiction based on it), and for a very long time, I didn't touch other fandoms. I read ff with super!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, Harry with magic trunks and five additional wands (one of them has to have a piece of basilisk!). I read time travel fics and fics bashing Weasleys, Snape, Dumbledore, Hermione, and fics with Independent!Harry and Lord Potter Black Gryffindor Peverell Merlin. And it was alright. I guess I enjoyed those tropes at least a little.

But after some time, I got bored with all those tropes and lost interest. I moved to asoiaf and asoiaf fanfiction and MCU fanfiction and forgot all about Harry Potter.

Now, I'm back, and I was sure after such a long time, I will have hundreds of fics to read during the pandemic, and I will rediscover the magic of HP again, but for the last two weeks, all I've been doing was skimming through ao3 and ff.net, and I still haven't found even one fic to read...

Everything feels wrong somehow, and though I'm an adult now and I want to read something more serious, I also want to feel the magic in magic, and I can't find that in most fics. Characters feel weird, storylines are boring, and magic is too complicated and too ordinary. To be honest, the realisation that I may be done with HP fics depressed me more than three months of self-isolation.

Anything to do with "soul bonds" for one---they almost never have any proper build-up for the romance bit. And the Weasley-bashing in Harmony fics is getting wearying. Like, I kind of get where they're coming from, and it's fine in GoF, but most of the time they ramp it up way too high. It's fine if the fic is designed to be humorous, but most of the time they try to be serious and its unrealistic. I mean, honestly. It shouldn't be that hard to make a halfway decent build-up for romance. They shouldn't just get together. You shouldn't need to invent all sorts of new stuff... just apply logic in the favour of the ship you want or whatever. At this point I'm mostly just reading pure humor fics because the serious ones are mostly an awful mess.

It makes me what to rip out my hair and scream ‘Canon Divergence can't change History and Rules of the universe your playing in'

for example if you want Harry to be wearing headphones and listening to music at school for whatever reason immediately 1) it can't be a iPhone or even an iPod. Harry was born in 1980. Your best bet is a cassette player but then you have to explain 2) why muggle technology works around magic. If your canon divergence is Harry's smarter or sneaker or something happens during his childhood to make him different that doesn't mean magic and muggle tech can suddenly work together.

But I gradually deviated from these filters gradually. Kinda like relaxing my wards and letting some deatheaters in (but I'm not saying it's bad, per se). I learned to tolerate works in progress, especially if it's riveting and well-written. I learned to read M/M pairings.

** Honeslty yes! I really want a specific Hermione critical fanfic, but I find one that starts well but it's either a one shot, or ends up being ridiculous in other ways.

Or if I read some bashing fanfics it becomes very black and white, with like Snape/Lily Harry being the golden bunch who do no wrong and James/Sirius/Ron/Draco being so evil and everything they do is wrong and if they get pranked oh well they deserved it.

** It's gotten to the point now that the moment I read or even feel the story is gonna hit one too many cliches I immediately stop. Cliches are a fun read when the writer is fully self aware of what he's doing, but when the writer is doing it unironically, I think that's the best way I can describe it, i stop cold.

** My list is more about stuff that I can't stand. Bashing or character punishment for example, out one of my personal un favorites, evil Dumbledore. I don't mind an antagonistic Dumbledore, mind you, but when he's evil, villainous, or commonly quoted as saying, "For the greater good!" it rubs me wrong. Likewise, I tend not to like those stories where the main character suddenly becomes super powerful (magically, financially, politically, ect) with a half assed reason or no reason at all. I want to see that power earned, or played for laughs in a comedy story.

** It's kinda the opposite for me; I've got favorite tracks for fics to take but if they deviate I'm not too upset, but I've got a handful of tropes and tracks that I absolutely detest and will immediately turn me off of a fic. Self Inserts, OC heavy/focused stories, stories where the main character develops another characters powers in the summary^{1}, stories where the author unceremoniously transforms the main character into their OC without any plot based causes ^{2}, or stories where the chapter/wordcount per thousand is heavily biased towards the chapters if it isn't a Drabble or similar style of fic^{3}.

^{1. crossovers where the summary tells you that Midoriya or Jaun or Naruto or Harry has suddenly been Peter Parker'd into having Spider Powers. Usually those will cram their main character into another's origin story with just a few name changes. And bits of the crossover world are excised and just enough to support that origin are inserted. It just feels lazy, and I don't want to read about someone who has no connection to Marvel developing exact replicas of Spider-Man's powers. Similarly, I don't want to hear about Harry getting caught in the opening of a portal to the afterlife and getting Danny Phantom's powers, et cetera. However, if they get One For All'd and the ghost of Trafalgar Law decides to give Jaun his Cut Cut Fruit and teach him how to use it or something similar then it's ok as long as it doesn't linger too long on that.}

^{2. It's fine if someone's going to introduce new abilities or personality traits/flaws to a character but I prefer it if it isn't just suddenly introduced, especially if it's done in the summary. I remember a fanfic where a 9-10 year old Harry reads a few books of Fairy Tail manga and decides it'd be cool if he had Lightning Dragon Slayer magic and because he apparently had an early onset case of 8th Grader Syndrome he bit down on a 9volt battery in an attempt to eat lightning. And because Harry Potter magic is usually written as pseudo-sapient and generally awesome and caring, it nearly destroys him sucking in the electricity and then uses it to recreate the magic he had hoped to gain! And this was how we were introduced to the story, and it wasn't a quick thing either. And unless it was really damn well written I'd likely drop it if it just starts with Harry having a full grasp of his lightning powers and we never see how he got them, save for a quick note in the summary.}

^{3. I like stories where it's about 1,000 words per chapter [1/1], 15,000 words per chapter is exceptional [1/15], but if a story that isn't a Drabble story where every chapter is its own self contained micro story, maybe even with little micro sequels or multi-part stories, has just 500 or 700 words per chapter would be mentally exhausting. Imagine picking up a book and every page or two is a chapter. That'd be a pain and if I have no way to return it, I'd likely be figuring out what happens when you run a book through a charcloth maker.}

** Ugh, definitely. A lot of plotlines get so old and I oftentimes find myself quitting after the first 5 chapters. It's such a struggle to find an appealing, original story. I've been struggling the most with finishing multi-chapter romances. It's so hard to find any that don't follow this form:

1. Used to be enemies/unacquainted/just friends, forced together by chance.
2. Such sexual tension. Hormonal encounters ensue.
3. Oh no! Someone did something!!! Awkward avoidance/rejection/bitterness/hate.
4. They still have to work with/see each other. [insert Awkward Penguin]
5. Apologies/Reconciliation
6. *AHEM* We all know what happens after that, right?

It's so boring and overused. Some romance publishers even have the basic plotline as a requirement for incoming manuscripts (*sigh*). That being said, I can totally relate to you. Happy fanfiction hunting!

** My desires regarding tropes ebb and flow. Sometimes I can deal with badfic tropes if I want some escapism. Pairings can be a matter of mood, too. I prefer more gen over relationships nowadays. I can hardly read threesome now, never mind Harry/Harem. But I have certainly gotten way pickier about grammar and formatting meeting a minimum bar.

** What turns me off most often is poor writing; when the pacing is off, or the author just has characters say "yes" to things that they shouldn't be agreeing to so fast, or at all.

The next most common thing that puts me off is when Harry goes around being instantly best chums with everyone he meets, particularly Draco (I just personally don't believe he has the potential to be much else besides a racist asshat, even in first year) because Harry in the books should not be capable of that kind of gregariousness.

Next thing I hate is all the female characters, particularly the love interest, being basically interchangable with a supportive sex doll. I want female characters who can stand up for themselves, not just be tokens to be traded between Harry and the villains for drama!

Lastly, I hate it when a fic "reveals" that Harry's name is /actually/ Hadrian or Harrold or Harrison or something. Fuck that noise.

** Yeah. I'm demi, so if sex is the catalyst for a relationship over traditional romance fluff, I get super annoyed and stop reading. If I can't relate to the characters behaviors, I can't read it. I also make it a point to not even bother clicking on harem fics because of how tropey and terrible most of them are. I'm sure there are outliers, but I don't care. Lol give me substance and compellingly interesting relationships. Not "who is the protag who's totally not a self insert male fantasy banging this week".
