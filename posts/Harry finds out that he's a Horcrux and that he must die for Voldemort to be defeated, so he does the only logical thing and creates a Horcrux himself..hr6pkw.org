  "Remorse," said Hermione. "You've got to really feel what you've done. There's a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can't see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?"
#+end_quote

Harry feels remorse over killing someone to survive and almost gets killed while his soul is being pieced together only five minutes after the deed is done. Remorse intensifies.

*** Not if he kills someone who really deserved it, SuperAbusive!Dursleys for example, or Bellatrix, Umbridge, even Snape if it's before the revelation. Hell, if there isn't a time limit for the time between murder and creating the Horcrux he could use Quirels death, Dumbledore saying that it was Quirel's fault guaranteed that Harry didn't have remorse for this.

Alternatively he could use a mercy-kill to create the Horcrux. Just go into an hospital, find the most in pain, with no chance of recuperating, all loved ones dead unfortunate fool, make the offer and kill him. Wouldn't even need to be AK or magic at all, just unplugging a socket would be enough in some cases.

***** There you have it; soft magic. The laws were always kind of fuzzy and in no moment were we given explanations for the why's or how's. All we know for sure about Horcruxes is that it needs a kill, the exact limit of how involved you must be in the act or what counts or not are ambiguous though. For example, the murder of Myrtle apparently counts, even if it was for all intents an accident and the one to actually do the deed was the Basilisks. While we can rule out it being dependent of subjective morality based in Voldemort's success compounded with his casual disregard for human life petty much all the rest is in the air. Theoretically if the person only needs to feel responsible for the death of someone they consider innocent then Harry should be able to use Cedric's or Sirius deaths to meme an Horcrux.

  Alone and beaten, Harry resorts to desperate measures in the war with Voldemort and his forces. There was no low, no evil his enemies wouldn't resort to. And so he saw fit to dive straight to the bottom and create a horcrux of his own. That was how it started, that's how the end of the wizarding world began. Two immortal dark lords duking it out was just too much.

*** Depends on the actual requirements for making a Horcrux.

If there are no additional horrific requirements other than the murder, (Lots of fics imply or explicitly state more disturbing requirements) then it comes down to the definition of murder.

From a legal perspective, murder is the unlawful, premeditated, killing of another human being. In which case killing a death eater outside of the heat of battle would count. Harry generally is against murder, even when it causes issues (see letting fucking Dolohov without at least turning him into a vegetable at the beginning of book seven) That being said, I don't think it would take much pushing to get Harry to that point, especially if they captured Bellatrix for example.

Harry knows that Voldemort is an unrepentant monster.
