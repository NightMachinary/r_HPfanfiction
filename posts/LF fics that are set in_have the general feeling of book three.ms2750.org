Preferably with Harry as the mc and without bashing.


** This is on hiatus, but I love it so so much and it's still worth reading. It's an AU set within POA that more directly addresses some of Harry and Sirius's trauma. It features mystery-solving trio dynamics, Hermione's passion for creature rights, quidditch team shenanigans, and teen awkwardness. It's such a delight. LullabyKnell captures the tone of book 3 well, balancing the whimsy of the earlier books and the darker themes that get introduced later in the series.

**** I'm sorry I didn't rec something new to you! It just fit what you wanted so perfectly :) This isn't quite what you asked for, but LullabyKnell has a funny one-shot that takes place during POA from the perspective of random Hogwarts students that you might enjoy too.

  The clues were there and they were not impossible to put together. A person didn't have to be breathtakingly clever and named Hermione Granger to realize that Professor Remus Lupin was a werewolf. The regular absences were covered up well and then explained away with the dismissive ease of someone who had been making these excuses all their life, but there were still students who could take a break from their own busy lives just long enough to make the necessary leap of logic. - Some snippets of realization with some random Hogwarts students.

  Prisoner of Azkaban AU: After the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match, Harry finds himself striking up two unlikely friendships. The first is with Hufflepuff's captain, Cedric Diggory. The second is with the Grim. You know, that canine specter of Death that's been trying to kill him. Between that and learning the Patronus Charm, surviving Sirius Black, passing his classes, training for the Quidditch House Cup, trying to figure out why Professor Lupin treats him so strangely, helping Hermione fight for werewolf rights, and more, Harry seems to be in for yet another busy year at Hogwarts. (Tl;dr: an alternate canon for POA, featuring crushes on handsome Hufflepuffs and canine Marauder dads.)
