** "hey it's me ur brother"

You were banned for spamming the discord, attempting to brigade it by sending invites elsewhere, and then bragging about it in chat.

Who cares if you're young? Plenty are around the same age as you. It's no excuse for being a dickhead.

This isn't some humongous conspiracy against you, you're not the only person around. If you're ruining the experiences of others, there's no point in keeping you around.

** Thanks Micro for getting to this for us. And to be clear Parrot, I'm the one who banned you, though you've somehow managed to contact every single other mod. You were given warnings before for your behavior and quite frankly should've been banned earlier, but we were lenient.

And making a new account to try and hide what you're doing on your main account won't help. We know you linked us in more than one subreddit to try and get people to brigade us. Consider your ban permanent.

** You sounded nice enough at the start, I'll give you that. [[http://imgur.com/TvIfFJe][Mfw I found out you were banned for triggering a spambot and spamming invites.]]

Enjoy your ban.
