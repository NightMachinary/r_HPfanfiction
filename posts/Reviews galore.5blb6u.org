I'm stealing a cool idea from [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]]. Link one of your fics and I'll read and review it. Might as well challenge myself, so I'll read anything HP.

A few things to keep in mind: 1) I reserve the right to read or not read something for Reasons (real life stuff, etc) 2) if you link a novel-length monster, it might take me a while 3) there'll be one review per submission.

Because I read mostly on the go on my phone, I would ask that you link fics from AO3/FFN so I can use the linkbot to download epubs. Let me know if you want me to review on AO3/FFN, or in this thread, or in a PM. In any case, I'll comment here when I post a review so you're notified.

Links away!


** I would pay to see a serious review of this fic:

  Either way, Harry knew that his sister would want him to do this, demand him to do it, even. In fact, she would be mad at him for not doing much more to her, even if she was asleep and couldn't enjoy it fully herself. As long as it made him happy, she would have been happy if he fucked or raped her as she slept and she wouldn't mind, she would encourage him to do so

Edit: To anyone else who has trouble with random websites loading, bookmark anonymouse.org. It apparently runs on a similar fix on your IP as UC Mini browser on Android that allows it to access websites worldwide.

  Some ideas are meant to flourish, and others need to die a quick, lonely death. I'm just going to leave all of these here. Aside from 'For Want of a Nail' springboards with AU-ness of potentially epic proportions, features jilted partners, cursed ferrets, conflicted overlords and more.

**** Thanks, that was an interesting critique. Most of what you named is basically why I don't continue this. The following chapters I have on my harddrive didn't go beyond whats there in the first chapter and as you said, that's just run off the mill dystopian stuff with a forced muggle superiority.

#+begin_quote
  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

#+begin_quote
  Two years after the end of the Hundred Year War, and the Fire Nation has fallen into chaos and disorder. With Ozai's trial on the horizon, Fire Lord Zuko stands at what could be the defining moment of his political career...but first, he needs all the help he can get. Tyzula-centric, with some canon pairings. Plot, mystery, and intrigue sprinkled in for good measure.
