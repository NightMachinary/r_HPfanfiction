I had this inspiration in the middle of the night. What if something actually happened to Vernon, that wasn't the usual pranks from James, during either his childhood or teenage years? Like discovering a squib relative who didn't adapt well to the muggle life? or a Granfather who was actually a banished wizard?

If anyone wants to pick it up, tell me because I want to read it! I'm too lazy to write it myself


** Interesting idea. Also, on a side note, if you ever go to Pottermore and search Vernon, you'll find that there is a pretty interesting back story behind his hate of magic.

** The squib burned off the Black tapestry was his father. Can you imagine being raised by Walberga's squib uncle? We know Vernon had a shitty childhood, could've been even shittier.

Especially if he ever met his cousin.
