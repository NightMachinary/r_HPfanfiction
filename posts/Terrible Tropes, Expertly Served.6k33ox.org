There are dozens of tropes which infest the Harry Potter fandom like lice on a werewolf. We've all seen them, we've all read them, we've all groaned quietly when we came across them in an otherwise GoodFic.

But someone once said, there is no such thing as a bad idea, just bad execution.

So, does anyone have examples of some of the most egregiously dumb tropes done /properly/?

Imagine a manipulative!Dumbledore, who is clearly struggling with what he believes he has to do. Who is actually /good/ at steering things, but now everything is starting to spiral out of control despite his best efforts (which are very good indeed) and what is he to do? Trust some prophecy from a drunken has-been? Put his faith in a bloody eleven year old boy? Or... try and steer things so that there is at least a faint hope that the world won't be consumed by darkness, even if it comes at terrible price, even if he won't live to see it, even if it is only a /faint/ hope, flickering in the night.

/That/ would be a good read. /That/ would be fun, that would have drama and tension and cleverness and actual bloody conflict.

The reason we all hate manipulative!Dumbledore stories is because that /isn't/ what we get. Instead, we get a practically senile old meddler, who is so blinded by arrogance and confidence in his own infallibility that he ignores perfectly reasonable objections in his quest to ensure his own supremacy over Magical Britain. If we don't get arrogance, then we get inept bumbling and weak willed fiddling, a Dumbledore who's just going through the motions until our brilliant protagonist slaps him down hard.

For the Greater Good of course.

Another fairly excessive example of this sort of thing is evil!Ron. Evil Ron is evil because herp-derp everyone should suck his dick and if they aren't then obviously they're the ones in the wrong!

That is as dumb as the evil!Rons usually are.

Ron might not be very book smart but he isn't an idiot; he's a decent fighter, and dab hand at strategy. In canon he put aside the little slights and all the praise and fame that got heaped on Harry, but it would be easy for those to turn him bitter. It wouldn't be insane for Ron to slowly draw further and further away from his ‘best friend' who somehow manages to always come out on top, always find the spotlight, always /win/, while Ron, right there beside him the whole way, gets a pat on the head at best. Show me a bright eyed and friendly Ron, one who genuinely cares for Harry and Hermione, but who is constantly sidelined and ignored, until... why should he bother with them anymore? Why shouldn't he make new friends, friends who will appreciate him? He's given Harry a present /every/ Christmas and /every/ birthday, and what has Ron gotten in return? Well no more. Ron will finally receive a just reward for his efforts, even if only at the hands of the Deatheaters.

Give me marriage contracts that don't exist because someone got drunk and signed it in blood.

Give me powerful!Harrys who scrimped and scraped and /bled/ for every damn inch of that elder wand.

Give me Draco/Harry pairings where the growth of the relationship is slow, and real, and not the result of being locked in a closet together that one time.

Give me dark!Harrys who aren't simply seduced by evil, because, like, it's totally cool and edgy, but who are abandoned and abused by the Light and left with literally nowhere else to turn.

In short, give me stories where a rightfully maligned trope is spun so well you just have to shake your head and accept it.

I can really only think of two that sort of do this off the top of my head.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]] is about a... well, a ruthless!Harry. But we watch all the moments that shape him to be that way happen one by one, and we can see the entire path that leads to the ending as a complete and comprehensible series of events, that at no point required anyone to act out of character for no reason. He isn't just some massive sociopathic badass for no reason; and he doesn't confuse being a dick with pragmatism.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The many Deaths of Harry Potter]] finished up recently and does the powerful!Harry thing pretty well in my opinion. Even then, it's not a matter of Harry's raw magical might, but more his creativity and resourcefulness that carries the day. It also does wandless magic pretty well; showing that it really is only good for little things and party tricks, that it isn't a matter of all of wizardkind being too lazy to put in the effort, but most of them not deeming the effort worth it since the best Harry can do by the end is summon his own wand from a few feet away, and even that took him months to learn.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/261823][Cunning and Ambition]] actually does Draco/Harry fairly well, but it's also a little AU so...

  ...and here's your sack of solid gold dildoes...
#+end_quote

The newly minted LORD Harry James Potter tilted his head quizzically, "I'm sorry, could you repeat that? I get a sack of golden whats?"

The giant house-elf, Zilla his name was, nodded, "A sack of golden dildoes, master. 22 carat, ranging from four inches to twelve-"

"Yes, yes, that's what I thought you said." Harry interrupted, "But WHY do I get a sack of golden dildoes of various shapes and sizes?"

Zilla blinked, "It's a long standing tradition of the Hufflepuff estate, master. It was Lady Eleanor Hufflepuff who started it."

The house-elf put a hand on his hip and started prancing back and forth, doing his impression of a pretentious lord, "She was getting sick of all these fancy /pureblood/ lords and ladies, with their /lands/ and their /gold/ and their /servants/, and the way they were /waving/ them about, trying to one-up each other, oh, it was just so positively /vulgar/."

He stopped and looked back at Harry, "So, she, Eleanor that is, went and commissioned this collection of golden dildoes, and gave the instruction that it be presented, by hand, in person, to whomever inherited the Hufflepuff estate, in order to humble them and ensure they understand what all these ostentatious shows of wealth are really a proxy for."

There was a pause, during which...brass band music could faintly be heard outside?

Zilla coughed, "Master? Did you understand all of it? You've been quiet for a while."

Harry just waved his hand, "No, I got it...I'm just visualizing the Malfoys standing on their manor house with a loudspeaker."

He cupped his hands in front of his mouth, "Everyone, look at us! We're fertile! We're fecund! I'm well hung and so is my son!"

Zilla nodded, "Essentially."

Harry snickered to himself, before he slowly frowned, "...Where is this sack of dildoes, anyway? And...is that music getting louder?"

That was when the front door burst open, and a marching band of house-elves, dressed in resplendent black and yellow tunics, started to parade in, blasting away on their trumpets and trombones and timpanis.

And, marching in step with them, several...no, dozens...no, /hundreds/ of elves, and surprisingly a few humans too, and they were balancing velvet cushions on their heads, and on each velvet cushion was...

Harry turned, "I thought you said it was a SACK of dildoes!" he shouted over the brass music.

Zilla shrugged, "A few of her descendants might have added to the collection and made their own decrees on what to do with them!"

****** Here's the explanation from her profile.

#+begin_quote
  I'm Raining Ink. From 2009 to late 2012, I wrote a Harry Potter fanfic called Out of the Night. I was fortunate to have the BEST reviewers and readers in the whole darn fandom, and I mean that. The story has been extremely popular, and I had tremendous plans for it, even to the point of beginning to outline subsequent "books" in a possible trilogy. I loved writing the fic. Until the morning of the day I decided to delete it for good, it was still percolating in the back of my mind. It was a good story, and getting even better in later chapters.

  Ultimately, that's why I had to let it go.

  You see, I want to write my own books. I know, I know, it's like saying I want to be a supermodel or something, but I have always wanted to be a writer. After finishing the third draft of a WIP novel (largely as a result of a long hiatus from all things fan fiction), I thought, how much farther along would I be if I hadn't spent all of those hours on OoTN?

  The thing is, this is my Dream -- the big one that deserves capital letters, the one I've spent years studying for. OoTN isn't a dream, it's a hobby, and a frightfully addictive one. So that's why once I finally accepted that I couldn't have the Dream and the hobby, I had to thrust OoTN away from me with both hands. (The thrusting away with both hands is why it's being deleted and not simply abandoned.)

  Some of you may say, "But look at the platform you've built! Ready-made fans!"

  Yeah, I know. It bites to leave these wonderful supportive people (more than a few of whom have already volunteered to buy anything I write!) behind. But I don't want to try to coattail off of OoTN, or off of J.K. Rowling. I need to keep my real life and my fanfic life separate. I need to close this chapter for good.

  So this is me, saying thank you and farewell and wish me luck if you've got it in you. I'm off to chase my Dream. I hope that, wherever you are in life, you're chasing yours.

  Over and out,

  Raining Ink

** I've read extensively in three fandoms and I have to say that proportionally Harry Potter fandom has more Badly written fics than the other three. It's a pity because, per everything you wrote above, the ground is fertile with possibilities. My own personal theory is that the writers are just too young and inexperienced. They find cliched hyperbole fun whereas I, being older, am either bored and/or very annoyed to the point of flinging my phone because "no real person acts that way". My hope is that as the fandom changes, more mature writers will settle in and do justice to some of your ideas, because when it's done right, it is utterly awesome.

*** I'd question as to exactly how much the fandom will change, if at all. Many older writers (not in terms of age but instead HP writing longevity) seemed to either "grow out of" or lose interest in penning HP fan fictions. Yet, you have a new crop of younger writers (much like you alluded to), that either have too little experience (with some, it's none at all), paired together with those younger authors who don't even bother to complete a story, due to whatever happens to set the detour path for them to take.

It's clear that the HP writing fandom isn't as big as it was once, which makes sense considering the books and films are now completed with the exception of Fantastic Beats (yet that doesn't directly deal with Harry Potter), but sadly, story gems are too little of nothing now, and continuously lost in a endless pit of garbage.

****** On SB, Worm is by far the most popular, and it has some absolutely fantastic stories by several authors.

However, in my experience it's more about what /kind/ of story you're looking for that determines where you'll be likely to find good stuff.

Ao3 tends to have lots of relationship emphasizing stuff, as well as more intense psychological plots.

SB and SV tend to have more of the mass consumable types of fanfiction, just better written because both of those sites tend to be populated by nerds who are approximately well read and like dissecting how abilities and so on work.

For Naruto, there are some truly awe inspiring romances, and some pretty great [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sasuke-uchiha-and-the-power-of-lies-naruto-comedy-au.472801/][GenFics]]. However [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/blackkat/pseuds/blackkat][Black.k.kat]] writes *the best rom-coms that you will ever read, anywhere, ever*, and she's even written a few for HP.

Homestuck tends to be [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/737625][a little weird]], just like the source material, but often has pretty decent stuff. Sadly it's very hard to write the easy to read/easy to enjoy stuff for, so it has very little representation on SB/SV. Many of the fics tend to focus on really bizarre sexualitys ([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6981655/chapters/15909901][because aliens]]) which leads to delightful smut.

Worm covers a broad spectrum. There are a lot of stories which simply follow [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/constellations-worm-okami.414320/][the MC with a different superpowers]], but the best ones tend to focus on the powers which [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/burn-up-worm-complete.395526/][change how her brain works]] and those can be simply delicious explorations of alien psyche.

One Piece is a series I have always enjoyed, but the fandom is sadly quite small. I just recently discovered [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/10859229][one series]] though which... like, it has a lot of AU elements, but /holy fuck/ it is practically fine literature. I'm not even kidding.

My Little Pony is... kind of an odd one, because the fanbase is incredibly diverse, so you can get bronys writing stories about [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][an AI eating the world being a good thing]] but also have some fics where [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/82419/a-stitch-in-time][time loops drive the Princess of Friendship insane]].

The other four I haven't delved much yet, so I only have one or two stories that I've found tolerable there.

In General, I would say Worm has the most readable stuff on SB/SV, Homestuck has the best (and weirdest) smut on Ao3, and Naruto has a decent representation on both sites, but more Ao3 than SB/SV. Good MLP:FiM is usually on fimfiction, the dedicated site

** linkffn(A dramatic reading) Umbridge finds the Harry Potter books and makes a public reading out of them. A well written and realistic take on the popular trope.

linkffn(Blurring Reality) Read this recently and have to recommend it. It's kind of a non magical AU trope with a serious supernatural twist. I know the summary sounds ridiculous, but it's really good. It's set in a dance school that's putting on a performance called "the prophecy" that's basically the Harry Potter plot.

Its a fic of parallels between the perfomance that they are putting on, the characters who we all know and love and the actual canon plot. Something really strange is going on since their real life starts to mirror the events happening in the play and actors start losing their grip with reality. It's like black swan movie Harry Potter edition since it has that psychological thriller thing going on. Everyone is very in character and has some great moments with Tom Riddle and Harry.

Sadly incomplete, but good. Its also a gen fic, no slash or romance.

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection.

  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

  When kids in the Slytherin Common Room tossed jeers at the pudgy feet of Millicent Bulstrode, Harry rose up to do something about it. This Harry, now one of Snape's own, got fewer House points lost but many more detentions-- it had never been the colors on his hem that Severus hated.This was not wishing Harry an easy path. This was not wishing the boy a warm House. This was Harry, three weeks in, sleep deprived and considering running away and going back to Privet Drive. This was Harry in the back of Potions class, blank-faced under Snape's disdain the way he'd perfected under the Dursleys's torments.When Quirrell shouted “troll in the dungeons, thought you ought to know,” and Harry overheard that there was a girl in the bathroom crying, he still ran off to make sure she got out okay. He hesitated first, at the back of the little pack of Slytherin first years (at the back so that no one could get behind him)-- he hesitated. And Millicent Bulstrode, who could never quite keep her tummy tucked in enough, could never brush all the cat hair off her robes, never quite keep her temper in check, hesitated, too.

** White Squirrel basically built his career on taking what appears to be clichéd premises ("Harry becomes an Animagus before even getting his letter", "Hermione is a genius who's going to redesign magic from the ground up", "the characters read the books publically and comment on it"), but write them so well that the stories still manage to be some of the best out there. You might especially enjoy linkffn(Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue), which is precisely /about/ realistic consequences of the Death Eater-controlled Ministry forcing marriages and the Goblins having their own justice system. It's a quick and awesome read.

** Linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) has not evil, but definitely a Slytherin dickheaded Ron. Linkffn(11729812) is Percy-centric. And has a weasleys bashing done very right. I admit, sometimes the author slips into absurd category, so to speak. But all in all it is more about growing up in a big, poor family and all the struggles that come with it than mindless bashing.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** "A Marauder's Plan" by CatsAreCool was the first Lord Potter fic I read. While it's not in my list of top faves, every completed Lord Potter fic I've read since has been a disappointment. The family magic in this story is cool and there's no ridiculous OP!Harry who is emancipated early because lordship+goblins. [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/487526]]

The first story that actually made HP/DM believable to me was "Temptation on the Warfront" by AlizarinCrimson, wherein Draco joins the horcrux hunt and actually starts to confront his racism. Some knock it for following canon pretty closely, but I needed it to in order to believe this pairing could actually work. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594/chapters/9926705]]

Also, I find the prevalence of stories with Harry getting raped and the Dursleys being even worse abusive bastards than in canon for no damn reason, except to make his life even more difficult so we're in even more awe of how he's able to rise above it, to be highly disrespectful to people who have actually gone through those or similar situations. I've seen it so often I'd say it's become a trope. However, I have found one well thought out, meaningful, and respectful story where Harry does experience those things to the point where he's sold into child slavery. It's very difficult to read, especially in the beginning, but is very well done and touching. Plus there are later a lot of fluffy moments mixed in with the consequences of surviving such abuse that help temper the sadness and gravity of the story. "Freedom Series" by Sensiblytainted [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/726243]]

And, for the exact opposite of the tooth achingly fluffy soulmate fics, especially those wherein the mates bond and suddenly inherit ridiculous powers, here is "in death we seek devotion" by flat_teeth, where Harry Potter is Tom Riddle's soulmate. He keeps getting killed by Tom and reincarnated over and over again for being a muggle. Of course, he finally is reborn a wizard, but by then there's the prophecy. A depressingly good antidote to true love lasts forever. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7911124/chapters/18074659]]
