:END:
Harry is an intern at St Mungo's and ends up doing a rotation in the ward for (I think) patients recovering from magical substance abuse (things like sleeping potions, painkillers ect).

To his utter surprise Draco Malfoy ends up as his supervisor, (I think he wasn't a mediwizard though, I think I remember something about his robes being a different colour?) and he really seems to care about his patients.

/Spoilers/

As the story continues and Harry and Draco's relationship start tipping into something more, we find out that Draco is a recovered, potentially Dreamless Sleep? Or pain potion? Addict who turned his life around and became an expert in the field.

I'm pretty sure this fic was on AO3, but I can't be 100% sure! Please let me know if it sounds familiar!!


** This fic is Reparations.
