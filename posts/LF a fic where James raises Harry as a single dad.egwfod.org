If anyone has any fic recs for James Potter raising Harry, either never having died or at least having had custody of Harry for the majority of his childhood before Hogwarts and the effects thereafter (and maybe some angst, bc like...Lily is dead), that'd be cool!


** linkao3: Storm of Yesterday by ShayaLonnie has that.

** There is a series on wattpad by kmbell that is about james living and raising a baby harry while having ptsd and in mourning from lily dying. You will like it if you like james x oc after lily's death, plus it's one of the best written fanfics I've ever read.

Edit: it's starts out with single james, and leads to relationship. It's called Nepenthe.

** I remember liking linkffn(The Reluctant Champion) . It had some wtf moments, ie>! Harry getting a bj at the Yule Ball,!< but it managed to capture the father-son relationship well enough.

** Without Thorn, The Rose comes to mind though I didn't manage to get very far into the fic. It's kinda strange... but he is raised by James as a single dad. I'm afraid it's the only one I can think of. linkffn(9097983)

  A bittersweet coming-of-age story for fans of good writing. Lily died, and left James to raise a stranger's son alone. In the shadows of Azkaban, Harry learns from Dementors and Death Eaters, while in the caverns of the sea a mysterious power awaits the chance to steal his soul. Warnings inside.
