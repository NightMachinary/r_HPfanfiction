:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember if it was actually labeled as a Death Note crossover and I haven't found it searching that way. It was a pretty typical revenge fic where he goes back in time after everyone turns on him. In it, he's MOD but because he can't communicate with death regularly, he starts a Death Note style hit list and people he doesn't like die in freakishly bizarre accidents. Only other thing I remember is that I think Ron died on the train (fell out the window or something when trying to catch a chocolate frog). Thanks for the help!
