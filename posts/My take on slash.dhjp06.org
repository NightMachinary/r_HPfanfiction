Sorry, english isn't my first language

I legit don't know how else to explain that gay fiction should primarily belong to gay/bi/pan/queer men.

As a bi man, i really want say that more often than not, straight women's consumption of our relationships, sexuality, and traumas is fetishistic. It's not about fighting heteronormativity or subvert the mainstream perspective. They are just getting off on gay sex

** Personally i take it like this If only minorities were allowed to write fics about themselves then Id have alot fewer stories about people like me.

Now i think if you arent writing about yourself , In this case if you are straight and writing stories about gay /bi people, then please try to be sensitive and take feedback from gay/bi people. But personally I dont think saying that only members of a minority should write about stories involving said minority, is a good stance to take for progress in the depiction of said minority.

You wouldnt want black characters to only be in stories written by black people.

You wouldnt want women only in stories written by women.

So why would you want gay/bi people in only in stories written by gay/bi people?
