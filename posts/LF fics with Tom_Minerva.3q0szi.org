** I know two oneshots, both told backwards chronologically, neither romantic. I don't think I told you about them yet :p

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?psid=268294][For Such the Angels Go]] by Elesphyl which is about how the muggle war affects Tom, and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?psid=268294][King Me]] by GubraithianFire which is more concerned with the competitive dynamic between them. There are a few more around that era from the latter's Tom/Minerva challenge, but these are the ones that stood out for me.

...and now I want to write one, too.

*** Thanks. Am lacking some inspiration for mine right now and can't seem to find many good ones. Unless I'm using the search engine wrong, which is well and possible, there's nothing much on ffn.net...

LET'S DO IT, YO

**** /Looks at last update date of Clash and Tithonus and mourns/

linkffn(Boy who lived by Megii of Mysteri OusStranger) has a bit of Tom/Minerva. I don't care for it but it seems that other people do, given that it's in the DLP library.

linkffn(October by Carnivorous Muffin) has Tom and Minerva as platonic friends. Well, Minerva has a bit of a crush on Tom which he doesn't return. It's readable, but nothing special.

Good luck to you if you do decide to write the new story. I'll read it. Just... don't forget you other two stories. Please?

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, slash
