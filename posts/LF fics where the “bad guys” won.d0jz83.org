It might be the Battle of Hogwarts, or Trio didn't find all the horcruxes or anything Plus to your karma for dead Harry (dead for real, faked death, imprisoned/thought dead whatever) Doesnt matter who will win in the end Thanks :)


** linkffn(3766574) - Prince of the Dark Kingdom fits the bill well. It's an epic, which, despite being unfinished is undeniably worthy of a read. It's awesome. Voldemort wins and all that. Although he does during the 1980s. EDIT: Bot doesn't want to comply [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]

Most of the others are quite terrible for me (mostly horrible slash/mpreg/stockholm Harry with Death Eaters and Voldemort, which are not my cup of tea). There is one other that I remember:

linkffn(2416530) - This is super creepy. Voldemort won later and Harry is now his "adopted" son. Super creepy. EDIT: Bot doesn't want to comply [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2416530/1/The-Manipulator][The Manipulator]]

**** Reading this story now and I like it. Seen the summary before on this sub but haven't checked it out prior. Really weird the author's so insistent about Harry/Hermione not being a couple. I don't know any siblings that buries their faces in each other's hair.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts. Eighteen years ago, Harry Potter disappeared, presumed dead. He only now resurfaces to guide Neville's team through the Magical Curtain that separates the rest of the world from Voldemort's empire, where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free.

  Harry saw the injustice that happened in the Potions classroom that first Friday. Rather than go to Hagrid's as promised (because he forgot) he instead went to the hospital wing without being injured, where he has a conversation with Neville Longbottom. The source of the conversation? Harry can cook, and Neville knows his plants. They'd be a great team in potions. What Harry didn't know was that rather than just have Ron for his one and only friend, he would get the whole of his dorm to become friends, and help each other through the years at Hogwarts. **This is my first HP fic, my first internet fic, and my second ever fic**

** Ashwinder archive checking in with 2 options of Hermione whoring ...

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=22985][The Princess of Gryffindor]] is superb, with Hermione forced to serve in the Death Eaters' favorite brothel. I have a pretty limited favorites list on Ashwinder, but this fic is on it.

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=7101][The Unfortunates]] starts with Hermione in a false identity to evade the current power establishment, and she turns to prostitution out of desperation. I'll have to give it a re-read ... Can't quite remember how it goes.
