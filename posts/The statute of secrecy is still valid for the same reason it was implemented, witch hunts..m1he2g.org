Our protagonist is astounded to learn that their self righteous rant on why the statute of secrecy is a thing of the past is effortlessly destroyed.

How does this character, or even a main character, react?


** Bet you more muggles are killed by magicals than vice versa. How many did Voldemort kill with his attacks...hundreds, thousands? 500 years ago some random dark wizard could have held whole regions in his thrall and we'd never know since the magicals erased themselves from history.

** Well, on the other hand, these witch-hunts (which are very very real and very awful) happen mostly in the third-world countries, and if the existence of magical population was opened, I believe that most western countries would do more than doing nothing, which is what we are doing now.

I had in my one (unfinished and unpublished) story organization /Magiciens sans frontières/ which searches for small abused magical children in Africa and Asia and transports them to Europe (particularly to the Czech magical school at Budeč, which has a hospital which specializes in the magical pediatry), where they are cared for (some of them are already Obscurials) and potentially adopted.

** I mean, there are better arguments for and against the statue of secrecy than the witch hunt ones.

I think a good argument depending on your moral values is that wizards are inherently more capable in terms of what they can accomplish that a non-magical

A group of non-magicals can learn engineering, physics and invent anti-gravity technology.

But a wizard can do it at 11 with a few words. There is also nothing a non-magical can learn that a wizard can't. They can also do the same as this group, but they can also use magic.

It's like being a trillionare. You are by definition the apex of absolute privilege among people who can't do magic.

Like so, if a character believes this is acceptable due to their values and such, they can make this argument and say that because magicals are inherently superior they should then control everything.

However another character might say that the fact that magicals privilege over other because of their capabilities is actually immoral. And therefore wizards should stay with each other and not lord their capabilities over people who are incapable of defending themselves.

And so on, I have never seen this type of argument given a proper shot in a story, it's always some stupid petty thing about how muggles don't have souls and such. Or when this argument is made the ones that want to keep the statue of secrecy is viewed as a crazy person because they belive in universal rights who are incompatible with the fact that wizards can manipulate reality and non-wizards can't

Not saying this is the argument I would make, but at least it's more reasoned than just 'muggles are genetically inferior' thing

I would love to met anyone with this viewpoint. That would be a hilarious discussion to have.

That is of the exact same vein of thought that a genius is immoral for having an advantage.

That an athlete has an immoral advantage of someone born with bells-palsy.

Perhaps we should blind, mute, deaf, paralyze and perform a lobotomy on all children from now on to ensure they are all equal?

It is the moral thing to do correct?

I love this idea 100%, absolute enforced classism!

The illiterate cannot defend themselves against ideas they cannot understand!

The poor cannot defend themselves from the traps of poverty!

The middle class cannot defend themselves from economic warfare of the wealthy!

A rigid caste structure were each class is fully separated from each other. After all, the only way to protect people who have inherent advantages over them is to separate them.

Maybe create some camps and cities only for those of certain classes even!

I am sure this will end well.

No way it could end in disaster at all.

Also, to show my deep American roots I end on this modified quote.

"God created man /and wizard/. Samuel Colt made them equal."

Good luck magicing a solution against 600rpm @ 1,200fps. Or a nice MOAB dropped from 12k in the air at night.

First, you actually have to have a target. Anti muggle charms.

A single random wizard, Daedalus Diggle, is apparently capable of creating/summoning shooting stars for shits and giggles.

A couple of skilled wizards can seemingly remove knowledge of an area from the entire planet.

Wizards can create a functioning time travel device so small and easy to use that a 13 year old child can wear it like jewelry and use it on a daily basis for a year without incident.

Samuel Colt didn't equalize this disparity.

****** I personally don't remember anything about muggleborn career prospects from canon, so I'd need to be reminded or see quotes. Tbh I don't think we know much about what Arthur's job actually entails. I think he deals with enchanted muggle objects - knowledge of how the muggle aspects work might not be important. Just identifying the magic and containing/removing it or whatever. Even if it is, it's just speculation to say that discrimination is the deciding factor there, though it certainly could be.

I'm pretty sure that any wizard who both could and would get a job in a muggle government could also just become filthy rich in the muggle world with little effort.

But sure, wizards joining up with muggles could certainly change things. They'd have to manage dealing with the wizarding government(s) though. The Ministry already interacts with the British muggle government and seems to boss them around as they please, so I don't think it would be particularly easy.

Wizards have hella advantages for sure. They also are an extreme minority, if they lose on wizard for each 100 muggles they kill they still lose.

Wizards could live fairly godking like for a decent amount of time. A muggle with a gun, sword, or whatever only has to win once. The wizard has to win every single time, it's the Heroes Paradox, just in reverse of the roles.

** Did you actually read the article? It makes some pretty strong distinctions about what exactly is actually being persecuted in these third-world witch-hunts.

Spoiler: It's not magic in general. (except in Saudi Arabia, but fuck those guys)

Most of the places in which these events occur have strong cultural belief in magic as an effective and normal part of life. Magical witch-doctors are common pillars of many of these communities.

The distinction that often gets lost in the retelling or translation is that these people don't lump all magic together and instead have distinct notions of 'good' and 'evil' types of magic. When these people accuse someone of witchcraft, they are typically referring to the 'evil' kind of magic (cursing people and stuff like that), what the Harry Potter fanfic community would recognize and 'Dark Magic'.

But that's not the end of it! Most accusations of this sort of witchcraft aren't even made in good faith. It's usually just a transparent layer of unprovable bullshit used to further personal agendas such as greed and misogyny.

In conclusion: even though 'witch-hunts' happen, they are not something any actual witch would be at all worried about. Well, unless they live in Saudi Arabia, but that's really the least of their reasons not to want to live there.

**** No, you.

You're still confusing contemporary western laymans notions of witchcraft (i.e. that a witch is any female performing magic) with the very limited technical definition outlined in the article. The article makes clear that it is only /very specific kinds/ of magic that are being persecuted in the witch hunts outlined in the article, which gives several very specific examples thereof. Honestly, this article reads much more technical than your average wiki article.

And I never claimed that these hunts aren't happening. Only that it isn't a genuine persecution of /magic in general,/ and that most accusations are not made in good faith (i.e. everyone involved in the hunt knows the accusation is a bullshit cover for other kinds of hate or greed).

#+begin_quote
  Of main terminological interest in ethnographic literature were the emic perspectives and differentiations between witchcraft (spiritual) and sorcery (possible empiric actions like creating amulets, charms, chanting spells and curses) and the classification and translation of native terminology concerning spiritual offenses and powers.

  In this article, only those cases are referred to as witch-hunts, that involve the notion of a spiritual crime.

***** Okay, we are talking at cross here. I agree with your understanding, not arguing the basic facts with you. We both have the same understanding of them.

I am saying those facts would not matter so much in a world where the magical people went into hiding over fear of witch hunts.

The sheer volume of current day witch hunts, even if they are almost entirely known bullshit even to the accusers, is the problem.

"Look how many muggles kill other muggles just thinking they have magic! Afraid they had used that magic against them."

"How little provocation would they need to blame their problems on an actual witch or wizard!?"

That is the boilerplate argument I am going for.

I understand the difference between a witch and witchcraft as well. My family has a great deal of witchcraft/fae bullshit I had to deal with growing up.

I think my post is still up, I tend to delete everything other than story prompts after a few weeks, where I went into detail on some of my childhood.

Edit: Just checked, my comment is gone. Pretty much grew up with maternal and paternal families being old world magick type superstitious folk.

Lots of religious observations for safety of soul and body. Tons of little things to observe constantly to ward off evil and stay on this side of safety. Lots of wrought iron, silver pocket knives passed down from grandparent to grandkids on their 9th birthday, salt mixed in paint on all thresholds in various symbols, 24k gold cross in at least one eastern facing window (usually plated lol), fireplaces must have a bowl of water with herbs in them when unlit, and a ton of other bullshit.

I still catch myself saying a litany for various things on reflex. Did it this morning when stuck in an intersection with traffic.

"Raphael here my plea to Saint Frances, Shield me from the devils sight, petere in nomine libera hominis"

Just something forced to say stuck on bridges and at intersections so many times as a kid it is reflexive rant to vent frustrations now as an adult.

****** It's cool man. I get it. It's hard to communicate with just text, especially when you don't really know your audience. Sorry if I came across as snippy. I just couldn't stand feeling like someone was being wrong on the internet you know?

I agree that the pureblood wizards probably wouldn't look too deeply at the facts and would just jump at the chance to use the out-of-context raw numbers to justify the status quo.

What I got from your original post was that these shocking statistics were to be directed at a protagonist muggleborn or half-blood familiar with modern liberal thinking and scientific education, i.e. the one claiming that the the SoS was no longer necessary due to modern enlightened perspectives.

The conclusions I drew from the article, as discussed above, are what I would expect said muggleborn protagonist's reasoned rebuttal to be.

Not that that rebuttal would likely convince many purebloods. The SoS was implemented out of fear and that fear has had centuries to infiltrate the wizarding zeitgeist. They are not likely to respond to a well-reasoned, fact-based argument when their opinion is based primarily on emotion. Generally the only way to change an emotionally grounded opinion is with direct personal experience or guidance from a trusted confidant or authority figure, the keyword there being 'trust'.

On another note. I find that personal experience with superstition you shared to be fascinating. It's not something I have much personal experience with. I'd be interested to read a more detailed post about the topic sometime. In the context of reading and writing fanfic in a magical setting, these sorts of little cultural details can really bring a setting to life for the reader, which is something I really enjoy seeing in a fic.

******* I cannot stand willful ignorance either so I get where you are coming from. Outside of communities I enjoy I tend to let it pass. Not worth the stress in most cases for little to no return.

I don't mind sharing a bit of my childhood, large parts of it though are classic cult abuse though and I keep those mostly to myself.

My maternal grandfather, while he was still mentally whole, would never blink with both eyes on seeing anyone at first.

Leave the room and come back, there he would be winking at you until he was sure you weren't a faeling.

It was expected to do the same when around him as well.

Maternal side things just to keep it simple for now.

The tableware had to be laid in a certain order according to a set of rules.

Knife, fork, spoon is the order they were laid down but looking at them it is Fork-Plate-Knife-Spoon. Any kids who messed it up got hit and had to then rewash the entire set of silverware.

Also always touch your table knife first, middle of the handle, then run your middle finger down it, when sitting down.

Put a few grains of salt in your drink and let it sit before drinking it. We had tiny little plates of salt we passed around the table.

Always touch the doorframe with your left ring finger when entering a house. Never invite with words someone into your house.

Anyone who is in your house guest or just random person (salesman or whater) MUST be offered Food, Drink, and Comfort. Which means "Can I get you a drink or snack? Grab a seat if you want."

NEVER THANK ANYONE! Seriously, still have trouble physically saying the words thank you. Same applies to verbally acknowledging a debt even a "hey, let me get you back for that later" is anathema.

Shoes, underwear, pants, etc... always put on left leg first. In fact all clothes are left first then right.

I do know the thing behind the pocket knife bit though. Inherited silver is supposed to be just as bad for fae and evil as cold iron and 'gold blessed by the sun'. Hence the gold crosses in Eastern facing windows.

Common one in America we did was if you spill salt you have to throw a pinch over your shoulder to blind the devil.

First time I did that out of habit my wife thought I was insane lol.

My grandmother (maternal) still thinks my wife (and by association my kids) are evil as she doesn't like lavender.

Tons of Rosemary, Lavender, Holly, Strawberries and clover in our yards. Only allowed to pick two out of every three strawberries. Had to leave some for the wee folk after all.

Speaking of wee folk, always leave sugar water out after the first frost to the first flower.

If anything is ever moved in the house and no one moved it don't say anything just move it back. To acknowledge the tricks of the folk encourages them.

Alway leave a small plate of leftovers out overnight. Just toss the food in the morning and wash it.

Oh, that's another big one. Always set an extra table setting for the Lord. Don't serve the plate, just set it.

Wee folk don't like payment, leave out a nice tidy pile of scrap cloth and such somewhat out of sight for them.

If you see a ghost always be polite. Ask them "Would you like help?" whenever meeting one. Make sure to move any furniture you think is in their way for them.

We had to reorganize our dining room three times before my mother was sure the ghost of a toddler in a house we moved into was finally happy with it.

No one was happy with the final arrangement, it was awkward af lmao.

Nuts was weird, we could eat them only after the first snow fall until the lavender bloomed.

Almost all of it was about appeasement or protection. Moss was only allowed to grow on West facing walls. Something about keeping the folk (fae) unhappy with each other.

Always keep one pocket empty except for something shiny in it.

Just the tip of stuff we had to learn growing up, and that was just my maternal family. Paternal was even worse, we had to be able to read nearly all the old stories and repeat them by heart. Also my fathers paternal line have been story tellers since sometime around the time the Roman's left England. At least so the story goes, lol.

So I have literally dozens and dozens of fucked up old stories. Seeing as how my paternal grandparents were Austrian immigrants the stories are near as pure as they can get.

So many stories and fucking wild as shit rites to remember. Story telling is a nearly lost art anymore.

It was a combination of teacher, survival tips educator, gossip/news reporter, entertainer, and history keeper.

Sure modern storytellers can entertain people with lively stories. Do they also teach people who their current leaders are, their decisions, and the history of their country?

So much has been lost over time about storytelling and the many parts of history they kept.

Got way off track there sorry, just something I get side tracked with easily.
