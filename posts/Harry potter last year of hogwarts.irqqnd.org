This plot wont leave me alone and i realy need people to create it. Harry creates a new identity during deathly hallows and becomes a slytherin. He helps the students rebel, they might not know it is him helping them though. He shows not all slytherins are evil. I dont know how to work out the horcrux hunt though. He has to destroy them but he needs to be at the school. Maybe he can do some obscure ritual that splits him in two? He tells no one About it and if they split the one at the school has to die for the other harry. One he dies harry becomes whole again and regains all memories of what happened to him over the year.

I know this i lengthy and im sorry for that. Thank you in advance. Preferably this be on fanfiction.net and possibly wattpad. Cannot be first person though
