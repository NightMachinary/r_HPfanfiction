** So what do you think most fanfiction belong? Do-over fanfiction seems popular, but it seems when time travel makes it AU, then we have a different universe.

Harry Potter and the Balm of Time

This fanfic is interesting because Harry and Hermione change the past and it changes the future . What other time travel fanfic do you recommend for which type of time travel?

** Most fanfiction definitely goes with the Do-Over timetravel, simply because its such a enormously effective tool to write fix-fics. The second most used is probably the Back to the Future type of timetravel.

Funnily enough, one of the least used timetravel methods in the Harry Potter fanfiction is the actual timetravel introduced in Harry Potter. Hell, not even the franchise itself stays true to it /cough/ Cursed Child /cough/.

I'm not sure if I agree with him that HP's timetravel is my favorite. I'm more a fan of the Do-Over timetravel. I'm just not a fan of the "fix everything" approach with a horribly overpowered character. I like fics that actually think through the consequences of the character's actions and how they influence other characters. Nothing worse than a Dumbledore who is suddenly confronted with an incredibly powerful Harry Potter and doesn't react to it.

Harry (or others) could always come clean with Dumbledore. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795), shows that working together with him made things a lot easier.

I now absolutely hate 'Maintaining the Time Line' fics. There was zero need to rehash the Graveyard Resurrection Scheme, since time travelers knew Voldemort was hiding in Little Hangleton prior to that and he was weak in his homunculus form!

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

Well that just depends on your Dumbledore characterization, doesn't it?
