I wrote a Harry Potter fanfiction about 8 teenagers who are sent to the Wizarding World in place of Harry, who died in Voldemort's 1981 attack (he was still defeated, though)

Would you read?


** Seems interesting. Is there a link?

*** I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post a link, but try searching When Worlds Collide Harry Potter fanfiction on Google. It's the third result down for me, and the first chapter is called, just simply, Eddie.

**** Sure you can post a link! There wouldn't be a Self-Promotion flair if it were discouraged or forbidden. I'd do it for you, but I can't seem to find it via Google.
