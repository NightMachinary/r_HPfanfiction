Alright, the basic premise of the fic that I am pondering is something that I am ripping off from the amazing web serial [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/][/Worm/]] by Wildbow: Butcher!Harry. In /Worm/, The Butcher is an immortal supervillain, of sorts. Anytime The Butcher dies, the person who killed them receives weakened versions of all the previous Butchers powers, plus their personalities. It makes for a villain who is both very dangerous and very unstable. In this version, "The Butcher" is passed on by a magical artifact created hundreds of years ago by an Indian (not Native American) necromancer. I am looking for suggestions of basic personalities/backgrounds of previous 'Butchers'. I have the first one settled, and the last active host was a muggleborn British Wizard who left the Wizarding World to fight in WWI abroad. The 'Butcher' totem, a representation of the Hindu god Yama, has laid dormant in a junk shop in Hogsmeade for decades, until one Harry Potter happens across it during his very first visit to the village. I am envisioning 20 so different hosts of 'Yama' over the course of a millenia. I want them to have a variety of origins and personalities, so I entreat you, [[/r/HPfanfiction]] to lend me your creativity.


** Possibly at least one that was as close to saint like as a normal human can be, who did his best to fight against the madness, perhaps even succeeding somewhat in taking up pure causes, killing killers.

Edit: Or maybe make them a Christian, but with the power, they turn to punishing the sinners. Killing for even the slightest sins; lust gluteny, greed, etc.. Perhaps ending in their suicide.

Perhaps one with some real cleverness and cunning; who managed to take over and run a small country at the very least, at least for a while.

** Given it's nature, I suspect a number of the personalities would be in law enforcement. The totem being picked up as evidence, but never making it to the locker. Bonus points if one of the more 'useful' personalities is a completely muggle 'cop' from an older civilization, complete with marked tendencies to swear in ancient Sumerian or whatever.

** Hmmm, interesting idea, but wouldn't most of the previous hosts be insane from their time being host of a bunch of voices? Interesting idea though, I'd suggest a psycho-happy one though, also some very old fashioned ones, as the totem would've been around for a long time.
