** Looking at this, I think the influence of Cassandra Claire's /Draco Trilogy/, published between 2000-2006, featuring H/D, H/Hr, D/Hr; as well as her "Big Name Fans" clique, is not to be underestimated. People tend to forget how influential she was on the early HP fandom.

Also interesting to notice is the slight rise of H/Hr in 2014, which seems to correlate with JKR's statements about R/Hr in the Wonderland magazine - widely misinterpreted by the mainstream media as completely endorsing the H/Hr pairing.

H/G seems to be getting a massive rise in popularity rankings in the past year or so, probably due to Cursed Child exposing their relationship more and showing deeper moments between them.

Anyway, great job :)

****** Draco Malfoy is also painted pretty heavily as an anti-hero in the last two books. He is stuck in the unfavorable position of being ordered to kill the most powerful wizard alive by the second most powerful wizard, who happens to be an evil maniac with a proverbial noose around the neck of his parents. He also isn't fully devoted to the movement of eliminating muggleborns, lacking the conviction to use the Unforgivable Curses. His insults in earlier years could easily have been rooted in jealousy of Hermione's intellect or friendship with Harry Potter.

Combined with the fact that his family has money and political weight I could see why authors would pair him with the most background developed female character. As a character I dislike him but he is honestly one of the best ones to read or write about, alongside Severus Snape and Tom Riddle.

** Draco fics were popular from the very beginning, but I think part of the reason they've stayed so high is because of Tom Felton. He has stayed active in the HP community, doing things like comicon, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0_r8tAZQRA][filming a tour]] of WWoHP when it opened in FL, and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsjGYTtmlR4][adorably funny stuff like this]]. So people who may not have liked Draco the book character are fans now because they project more of Tom Felton's qualities onto Draco and want ff character Draco to grow up to be the sort of person who Felton is in real life. And of course those who liked Draco all along endure in their love believing that Tom Felton has proved them right--that Draco was really a good guy in a terrible situation who becomes kind and funny when removed from all that, or whichever theory they prefer.

**** I agree about Ron, although I don't think I would attribute it to Rupert Grint as an actor or a person, more the writing of the screenplay.

IMO Ron and Ginny were both stronger/better characters in the books than in the movies. As people's memories of the book characters faded and were replaced by the (again IMO) inferior movie versions, perhaps their fondness for Ron and Ginny also faded somewhat. My guess is that this might be why Ron and Ginny as ff characters started out in the middle but ended up near the bottom.

While there are undoubtedly a few fics that pair up Fred and George romantically, it most certainly wouldn't find a place in a list of the top 25 most popular ships. Same for Harry and Ron - Harry/Ron isn't a very popular romantic pairing by any means.

Harry and Hermione are also probably higher than they should be, because they have a larger number of gen fics, than Harry and Ginny or Ron and Hermione.

My initial suspicion would be that the above average fan age for Snape is less to do with his age and more to do with the readers. I think as I have gotten older I see more shades of grey than when I was younger and it is this depth I appreciate in Snape's character as opposed to Lupin (for example).

The problem is this data (fascinating though it is) only accounts for fics posted on ff.net. Historically, before ao3, a very large amount snarry fics were posted on slash or snarry specific archives as ff.net had a very bad rep especially amongst slash fans. Even though ff.net's rep is much better these days, it seems a lot of slash writers prefer ao3.

** Is it viable for you to add results from specific archives. I know SSHG has a lot of fics that are hosted on Ashwinder and not cross posted to ffnet (I've seen maybe 20-30).

*** Not really. I'd have to rewrite the html parsing code for each archive since they each display the information in different ways.

** Do you know where Hermione/Charlie ranks? I know it's not terribly popular but that pairing is what I like to read and write about.

Hopefully, Harry Potter Fanfiction does stabilize; obviously the spikes in 2010-2011 due to the final two films being released were very large, but I joined Fanficion.net only in 2015, therefore, I missed the "Golden Age" and following years where stories were released in large numbers. I still feel like it's popular but nowhere near what it once was.

*** It's ranked 80th overall and peaked in 2007. [[http://i.imgur.com/yPxkKSJ.png][Here's the graph]]. I don't think it got as much of a movie boost in 2011 since Charlie isn't in the movies, but it's definitely still alive and well today!

**** Also look at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/529718/atruwriter][atruwriter]], she's not active anymore but she wrote some pretty interesting rarepairs, and hit the Hermione/Sirius and Hermione/Remus ships at their peaks back in the day, including others like Hermione/Fred, Hermione/Charlie.

** This was really cool to read! I liked the graph at the end with all the rankings over time. I'm actually surprised in the popularity spike for SSHG.

How are you parsing through the archive?

** Nice, thank you for this. Have you considered filtering the 724k+ fics? E.g. consider only fics with 20k+/40k+/100k+ words, or/and only completed ones?

Maybe even something like the completion rate by pairing and year.

I think the overall popularity graph as a function not of the number of fics, but the number of words could be interesting.

** I really find it fascinating that the most popular pairing (according to your chart) that's actually cannon is James/Lily. It's my favorite so I feel somewhat vindicated. I have to imagine that it's because of the ability to make your own story out of it. You have a few basics: boy and girl meet, boy likes girl, girl hates boy, they spend 7 years in close quarters with each other, add some war turmoil, growing up, falling in love and you've got the J/L skeleton.

That is IF you wanted to go cannon. (Of course you don't have to). But even for cannon that's some bare bones to add on to. A perfect amount for a writer (and reader) to experience the story many times,in many ways, with the same ending.

Suffice to say: I'm happy to find Jily at #3.
