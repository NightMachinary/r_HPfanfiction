** This fic doesn't have an auction element, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2446736/1/Better-Angels][Better Angels]] is pretty much exactly what you're looking for. The premise is that snape was born a slave and bought by Lucious Malfoy's father. They sent Snape to Hogwarts to be trained as a potions master, but when hung upside down at the end of his 5th year by the Marauders, everyone saw his slave tattoo, and the Malfoys pulled him out of Hogwarts. James felt so guilty that he bought Snape from the Malfoys, and the story starts off with Snape getting to know James as a master. There is no romance (or sex at all - other than references) in this fic in any way, it is just a really unique look into the mind of a magical slave and a nice characterization of James.

*** Do you have any suggestions for stories like Radaslab's? Ive read Vance's and it was solid but have not found much else beyond that. I enjoyed them both but preferred Radaslab's darker undertones and somewhat like the OP, would love one that was a bit more !Dark or at least focused more on the darker sides of things within Britain's magical society (such as the auctions).

** It's not like slave trade slavery per say but this fic features Harry's daughter being kidnapped into sex slavery by death eaters in revenge after the war. It explores underground prostitution in the wizarding world so it's interesting in that respect. Warning though it is really brutal/graphic and most certainly NSFW. linkffn(scarlet by ely-baby)
