** Idk how full of a crossover it'd really turn out to be, but perhaps throw in a twist right at the end of book seven. Harry has his climactic showdown with Voldemort and emerges on top. The monster that has haunted him before he was even born is finally gone for good. But then an even as his foe's body is still crumbling to ash unwordly voice booms out for all present to hear: "With this character's death, the thread of prophecy is severed. Restore a saved game to restore the weave of fate, or persist in the doomed world you have created".

*** LMAO! I hate it when that happens to me in Morrowind! Especially when I'm escorting that slave girl that's pretending to be a Telvanni. I wished I could fast travel with her just to save me all of that unnecessary pain. As much as I love Morrowind, it got on my nerves quite a bit, but I persevered, and beat the main questline, Bloodmoon (as a Werewolf, and getting the Spear of the Hunter), and Tribunal. Never did complete the Mages Guild, Fighter's Guild, the Morag Tong, Thieves Guild, or any of the House quests (i.e. Telvanni, Redoran, Hlaalu).

** Perhaps you could make Voldemort and the Death Eaters come across Ulfric and the Stormcloaks, and then both sides see the similarities and flaws in the other. Perhaps they'd temporarily join up and then betray each other down the line.

Perhaps you could make the Ministry of Magic meet the Imperial Legion (Skyrim era), and see how they interact with each other.

You could make Harry himself end up in the Elder Scrolls world, which means he'd have to adapt to the 'high fantasy' setting vs the 'low fantasy' of JKR's world. There's no Statute of Secrecy, magic goes way beyond needing to be fine-tuned with wands (how would Harry's wand rank among the Elder Scrolls's instruments, such as staves, etc.?), ES not being set in a 'realistic' setting like HP, etc.

Or you could do the reverse and have the Elder Scrolls characters cross over into HP's world, but then you run the risk of limited freedom while having to deal with the 'realistic' setting + Muggle stuff. Or you could merge the two worlds and make all hell/Oblivion let loose. But, again, that means you'll have to deal with the broader Muggle stuff.

You could make Harry, Hermione, Draco, or whoever else somehow end up in the ES setting. I can totally see Hermione going all S.P.E.W.-style on the fact that slavery still exists in the ES world, particularly in places like Morrowind. Or, lol, Draco starts making fun of the elves (because he had Dobby as a servant) only to end up running into one, especially the Thalmor.

You could make Harry cross over as the often-used 'Master of Death' title in fanon, which would be interesting. In ES, necromancy is very much prevalent, while resurrection is not an impossibility like in Harry's world. So how special would MoD Harry actually be with all of his fanon OP powers?

Perhaps Harry could meet the Daedric Princes and end up having to navigate between them and their values.

For example, how would Meridia react to Harry having once 'conquered' death, seeing as Meridia despises the undead (would she classify Harry as being one?).

How would madlad Sheogorath react to Harry? Would he not care about the whole crossover thing and just go on as usual? Harry gets treated like any mortal person from Mundus and has to deal with the fact that he's not really that special here.

What about Molag Bal, the King of Rape? Depending on whether or not you're writing evil!Harry, perhaps Harry would avoid Molag like the plague. Fenrir Greyback, on the other hand (given what it's implied he does in canon), would probably gladly alternate between Hircine and Molag Bal.

Hell, perhaps you could make a crossover before the end of book seven, meaning that Harry gets promptly ripped away from his own setting and plot and has to deal with whatever's happening in the ES setting before going home. Depending on whether or not you have Harry age or the HP timeline freeze during his absence, Harry's return would be interesting in different ways.

What would Harry's race even be? The ES folk would probably be scratching their heads wondering if Harry ought to be classified as Nord, Imperial, Breton ... or just some alien from another dimension.

*** It's an interesting thought. I have one Harry Potter/Elder Scrolls fanfiction on Webnovel where Harry's an Ayleid, and is the last descendant of King Laloriaran Dynar. Meridia also shows up and makes him immortal via making him into a Purified. Gotta admit, ESO has some very interesting things I didn't know about in ES Lore previously.

But I had one particular idea in preparation for the Gates of Oblivion chapter that's coming out for ESO this year. It was a female Harry Potter idea in which she meets Mehrunes Dagon, but I think I made her too much like Cinder Fall from RWBY, and thus started thinking if I could somehow still make that work by making it into a Harry Potter/Elder Scrolls/RWBY crossover, and make her actually BE Cinder Fall, but more competent, more cunning, and more powerful than she actually is in the RWBY series. I wouldn't know how to go about that though.

**** I don't know a lot about ESO and the very early periods of the ES timeline, so I can't really comment on the Ayleids and stuff.

However, my advice would be to perhaps limit the crossover to two fandoms. There's nothing really wrong with adding more fandoms. But the less you use, the easier it tends to be on most readers (less fandoms to know about). For HP x ES, perhaps keep it that way.

There's a lot you can do between HP and Elder Scrolls, though I think having the plot take place within ES's setting works better for freedom of writing.

Also, you should consider cross-posting to AO3 and FFnet.

***** Thing is, I also love RWBY, and Cinder is my favorite antagonist aside from Salem, so if I make a Pyromancer/Fire Elemental female Harry, I gotta go with molding her after Cinder, but not to the point where it's blatantly obvious... or, at least I try not to make it obvious. But I've also thought about that particular crossover (HP/RWBY), where fem! Harry is Cinder (I've only read one where that happens, and I was left frustrated afterwards). I was writing my HP/ES crossover, and realized that I may have made her too much like Cinder, then thought about just making it that way.

It would be something I know Cinder would actually do if she ever learned of Daedric Princes... especially one that represents Ambition, and Destruction.

So, yeah. I just had that thought. It would be unique to have more than just two stories as a crossover, but I was just going to leave this one at three... depending on how well the idea is liked.

****** Like I said, there's nothing really wrong with >2 fandom crossovers. AO3 does have high-bookmarked stories with many fandoms crossing over.

My vote is for "technically a weird type of daedra."

** I could never write, but I've been thinking of a story where Harry is either transported or reincarnated to a time a bit before the events of Skyrim begin. What I really want out of this story is to see him adopt Sissel and teach her magic as they adventure around.

** Maybe try something simple? Harry ends up in Skyrim and tries to make a life in it? Explore some tombs or maybe get recruited by the dawnguard and eventually meets serrana.

** I COULD do a familiar plot. Keep the gender-bent Harry, but instead of Mehrunes Dagon, it could be Molag Bal. I already have a similar plot on Wattpad, but since Molag Bal is one of my favorite Daedric Princes, and becoming a Daughter of Coldharbour isn't a fanfiction idea that I find anywhere, I could write one on Webnovel. What do you guys think?

** Well, I've just decided to rewrite Chapter 2 of my fanfiction on Webnovel that's titled "Harry Potter and the Return of the Wild Elves". In this story, Harry is the last king of the Ayleids, and is the descendant of King Laloriaran Dynar. In this story, Harry will be claiming the throne of Delodiil, the City of Light that once worshipped Meridia. Meridia is also taking an active roll in helping Harry along his path to destroy all evil from both Earth and Nirn.
