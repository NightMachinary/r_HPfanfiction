So it's a collection that has one story that I really want to read. The story features a older Harry that's neglected because his little sister by 3 years is the girl who lived but when she is entered into the triwizard tournament she is tortured and killed. Harry disappears and dumbledore and the parents try to find him. Please help.


** Try putting a bit of that in the title. Plenty of people skip a request that doesn't specify.
