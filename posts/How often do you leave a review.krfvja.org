** I try to leave at least one review on a story every time I read it.

If it's a chapter story then usually I power through it and have read 6 chapters before I've even realised so... So if I'm reviewing it's usually an apology and a summary of what I liked so far. Then always one big happy rant at the end.

There's some stories, especially one shots that I love rereading and if you go to the comments section its 3/4 comments of me from various dates going "I cried again!!"

** Most of the time, I review every multichapter story I like. I rarely, if ever, comment on fics I didn't like, or fics which in my opinion, have some serious flaws (grammar, characterisation, pacing, plot). If it's WIP, I try to leave a comment in every chapter. If it's complete then, I usually post one, long review at the final chapter.

One-shots that I loved, I usually bookmark, and sometimes I leave a comment.

** I very rarely leave reviews, personally, because I always try to be fair with any criticism, and that's a tricky proposition when dealing with amateur writing that someone's doing in their spare time. If I were reading a professionally published book from which the author was turning a profit, I'd have no trouble saying stuff like "this scene doesn't flow; it really needed another couple drafts," "this exposition is unnecessary; save it for your notes," or "this character adds nothing; cut them out and save your readers some time," but I feel awful saying stuff like that to someone who's simply writing for the enjoyment of it, so I just kinda don't.
