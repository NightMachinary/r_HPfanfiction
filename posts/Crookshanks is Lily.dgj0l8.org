I'd like to read a story with the following: Crookshanks is actually Lily locked in her animagus form and her normal human intellect suppressed by the same dark magic that keeps her in her animagus form (the sacrificial protection is either not really a sacrificial protection, but something else or relies on Lily's /readiness/ to give her life for her son, not the actual deed). Sirius recognizes her (because she learned how to transform with the gang) when he sees her and uses the spell to force people out of their animagus forms on her and reunites mother and son.


** Obscura Nox Animae is kind of like that. Lily survives as a bodyless spirit and can possess animals. Sirius realizes this as he can communicate with her. It's Snily and followed canon closely, but has a different ending.

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.
