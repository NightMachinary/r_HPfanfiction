Do your fics tend to center around the same few people?

I feel as though most people have a kind of niche.


** I hate writing Voldemort. It just never works. That and I can never make Ron as humorous as he is in the books. I always laugh my ass of with him but when I write him it's just :/

*** I'm not sure I could ever write Ron, at least not without combing through the entire series from beginning to end and making a character sheet.

I can't write LV, but I think I could write Tom Riddle, Jr.

** I tend to write about the next generation of kids or original characters. I think I'm less likely to make a person, like Harry or Voldemort or Luna, seem out of character that way; it's difficult to write on the same level as JKR, after all...

*** Same; plus, I don't get ideas for characters I feel had their story satisfactorily told by JKR, so when I don't write original or next gen, it's minor characters for me.

Also, my characters tend to range around my own age or younger - ages I've had experiences for, in essence - so I shy away from writing adults.

** In the trio era, I like to write about Draco, Luna, and Neville. I suppose in the earlier era, Frank Longbottom. Then, I really like writing the next generation, because despite all the cliched portrayals of the kids being just like their parents, there is so much potential there . . .

** I tend to write about Harry, Draco, Ginny, Voldemort/Tom Riddle, and Snape, but the only person I absolutely cannot write is Luna. I just can't do that spacey, not all there persona, which is a shame because Luna's great and I'd love to write about her, but I just can't do the character justice.

** I hate writing Draco, which sucks because I tend to focus on year 6 in my fic.

I also hate writing Ron, mostly because I dislike him without a lot of rework to his character, but I feel the need to explain why his personality and personal habits changed. I like the /idea/ of Ron as a best friend, but ...i dunno.

I tend to center on Harry/Hermione/Ginny...but thats mostly due to my hormones.

** I tend to focus on Harry, Hermione, and Ron. I like trio fics. I love reading about them all being best friends, being there for each other, doing awesome stuff together, and all of that other cheesy stuff.

I like to focus on Sirius too, because I want him to have a happy ending :(

*** You're a Slytherin! You can't like cheesy stuff! Your father will hear about this! ... Just kidding, I never tried writing a trio fic, isn't the dynamic rather hard to write so the balance between the three is good? I'm sure I would end up with more of a duo and an almost non-existent secondary side-kick :/

** I clearly have a niche in Hermione: she's just too awesome to write because she's intelligent, strong and stubborn...so she's my main character in my two stories (and will be in my future stories, except for one where I plan to use Ginny). Severus is another one I enjoy writing, because he's such a tortured soul. Of course, that leads me to pairing them... But in my opinion, if you want to write a good story, you can't entirely avoid using some characters as if hey didn't exist, just because you don't like them (for example, I hate Ron, but he's till here, even if marginally or just mentioned)

** I concentrate on current generation characters - Hermione, Snape, Lupin, Draco, etc. I like creating my own take on well-established canon personalities and back stories. Marauders and Next Gens aren't as challenging to me to write because JKR said so little about them. They may as well be OCs for that reason.

** I like writing about the more minor characters, I guess. Like Fred and George are my absolute favorite. So much fun! I try to stray away from Harry/Ron/Hermione because there's already so much written about them.
