I'm looking for a fic where Harry comes back in his fifth year with his hair streaked with blue. I remember a scene from this fic where snape makes them brew Veritaserum but Harry has already taken a perminate anti venom , snape makes Harry drink it and asks what happened to him in front of the whole class and Harry says non of your business please help me find this fic. Btw he is NOT A METAMORPHMANGUS
