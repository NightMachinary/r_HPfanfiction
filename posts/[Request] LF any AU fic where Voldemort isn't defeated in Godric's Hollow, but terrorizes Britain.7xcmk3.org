Also including Harry getting raised and trained (by Unspeakables, Dumbledore, Flamels, etc).


** linkffn(Imprisioned Realm) Its a dark fic (not that Harry is dark, although, he actually is dark, but that wasn't my point) with A LOT of mentions of rape and torture and PTSD because of said events(also with medical description of wounds inflicted for those events aswell). Its actually a fantastic read if you can stomach that. Its also like 2 chapters from completion.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? This is a very dark fic. Warnings within. A/N: Currently editing fic.
