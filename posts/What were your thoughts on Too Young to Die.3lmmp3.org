** I only read a few chapters because I couldn't get into it. I didn't feel the names Natasha and Zach fit-they don't sound like something JKR would have picked. I thought James and Lily were cartoonish and extremely childrens book villain-y.

What drew you to the story? I'm curious to hear what you found exciting and interesting!

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** If I had to sum it up in one word, it would be "unsatisfying".

Everything is rushed, with so many years passed over in very short amounts of time.

Characterisation is shallow, especially with regards to motivation. Harry is far too unlikeable, exceeding the necessary evil required by his plans and becoming a caricature. The Potters are awfully characterised, as is Dumbledore (saying it was all intentional at the end because he's batshit insane does not make it better).

The climax is badly managed and I ended up skimming almost all of it. The demon world is just dull, completely out of line with the HP magic system, and the mechanics of said world are just a mess. The author thinks they're being clever with the time stuff, but it just bogs the story down unnecessarily. The demon world is a means to an end, and given that it should not be lingered on.

Too many questions remain unanswered at the end, in particular about the wider world and what Voldemort thinks of the whole affair. The story really misses a trick in not exploring any kind of Harry-Voldemort interaction.

The worldbuilding and magic in general is poorly executed, especially all the dark magic stuff. The "addictive dark magic" stuff is cookie-cutter fantasy clich√© and just leads to boring characterisation. Crazy characters have no depth or complexity, nor are they relatable. But the magic in general needed to be explored much more thoroughly. The dark magic consists largely of just more and more spells that go boom. That's not really that interesting. And the regular Hogwarts magic is just entirely ignored.

The plot in general is really unbelievable, with Harry achieving things that he shouldn't be able to with the level of talent he is depicted as having (we never see him working for anything, really. He seems to stop studying somewhere around 3rd year). The forces arrayed against him are nowhere near competent enough. Everything works out too easily.

The best thing about the fic is that I was curious enough about the necromancy plotline that I read the whole thing.

*** One big thing about the characterization is that we literally see Natasha in only one chapter of the fic. It just doesn't make me care about Harry's descent into darkness/journey to bring her back. The author fails to develop her and Hary's relationship in any way, shape, or form, and the story and premise suffer for it.

Also, in the one chapter we see, their relationship is really weird because Harry is 11 and acts like her father. It's very off putting, and has some incestuous undertones. (Although to be fair, I might be retroactively applying this quality in my mind because of how creepy Harry is in the rest of the fic. )

*** Via the use of magic, it somehow manages to engineer a situation where two people rape each other simultaneously. That's a fairly impressive feat.

You have kid Harry disguising himself as someone older, then having sex with an adult woman. The woman is raping Harry because he's underage so statutory rape.

But at the same time, Harry is raping her because he has deceived her as to his identity which vitiates her consent.

*** Although I dislike casanova!Harry/harem!Harry, I was intrigued by the discussion this fic is generating to give it a go... but I'm utterly not a fan of rape as a plot device, so thanks for commenting on this.

** I liked it, in a guilty-pleasure-ish way. It's not a /great/ fic, not from a technical, plot, or story standpoint, but I always found myself interested in what would happen next.

** Almost every thread that asks for recommendations has it in it. I read it while it was still being updated, and loved it for quite a while. Still not too fond of the chapters where he was looking around the demon realm, and think the ending was bloody perfect.

**** Eh, I like how it ended and I mean exactly that. I don't really want a sequel to it, as I can't see anyone rescuing Harry, and don't think Natasha would live that interesting of a life.

Also with the AU including the knight suits (whatever they were called, its been a while since I've read) I can't imagine Harry being capable of single-handedly escaping, after caught without wand, suit, or anything else. Particularly with the government being fairly aware of his capabilities now.

Finally the suddenness of it really enhances why he kept it secret as best as he could, because as soon as it was exposed his plans crumbled.

  Which isn't bad, but it's definitely the type of story I would've expected to have a sequel and was disappointed to find there wasn't one

My personal headcanon is that he becomes [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/The-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]] when his sister is killed for a second time (maybe by his brother or Dumblefore or something) (and yes, I know that that is contradicted in the story itself but I don't care. It's too fucking good.)

****** It's not really that dark for most of it. Since the main character's kind of teensy bit insane the story's mostly lighthearted with a lot of violence thrown in.

** Could not get past the first few chapters. The writing was terrible, riddled with errors, and was pretty much full to overflowing with every obnoxious cliche that riddles WBWL fics.
