are there any fics where harry becomes a dark lord, not a follower of LV! but a dark lord in his own right. bonus if he treats Voldemort as an enemy( only one can rule).


** *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), has 'freedom fighter' Tom Riddle resisting the 'evil tyrant' Harry Potter. [[/spoiler][The setting of this story is very AU, especially in the Muggle world where nuclear weapons were never developed and European countries hated each other. In the wizarding world, James and Lily didn't trust Dumbledore at all, and they laid a nasty trap for Voldemort in their home. Predictably, the ever overconfident V stepped on the trap and got himself killed. James and Lily then fled England to avoid Dumbledore's grasps, and had to switch places every few years. Incensed by all this hiding and humiliations, a young Harry vowed to gain power and followers so he could one day force the wizarding world to leave them alone. Well, things didn't really turn out that way....]]

*** I wouldn't say that Emperor has Harry as a Dark Lord, so if you're looking for 'dark magic isn't evil, just misunderstood', Emperor is the wrong fic. On the other hand, if you want a thrilling tale of politics, warfare, and intrigue, you owe it to yourself to read it.

**** I don't see 'Dark Lord' as someone who is bent on using the dark magic, but someone who is willing to sacrifice countless lives for his/her ambition. In that regard, Emperor's Harry is the perfect candidate.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

**** If you look at situation closely, that was exactly what he was trying to present himself as. Harry had thousands of magicals and millions of muggle soldiers at his command, Riddle didn't really have a lot of choice other than to take the mantle of a 'freedom fighter' or 'mentor'.

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.
