Basically what the title said - Harry and the twins have a prank war.

Specific parts I'd like (not required, just do what you like!)

- Harry isn't in in Gryffindor

- Harry isn't the boy who lived, someone else is (please don't turn this into a Potter-bashing WBWL Manipulative Dumbles and arrogant brother) or the war never happened.

- Harry grew up with the Dursleys, but the just ignored him and gave him Dudleys second bedroom when he was young. He has clothes that fit but he isn't really part of the family.

- Harry likes mechanics

- Harry heard stories about his dad's pranks and thought it would be fun, but he got caught in a prank so he now had someone to get revenge on (The twins)

- Harry can have help, so long as he isn't paired with any of them and they aren't part of the golden trio. I would also prefer Luna, Ginny and Draco not helping, just because their actual characters wouldn't fit. Oh, they can rally behind the person, but none of them no who it is. (No omnipotent Luna, thank you. I've always thought her a sort of ‘animal seer' who gets flashes of places and animals, so it frustrates me when Harry's plots are found out because Luna just ‘knows things'.)

- The twins don't suspect Harry, at least for a while

- A lot of the school rallies behind the secret prankster, because many believe the twins bullies (and they are, sort of. Please acknowledge that their pranks aren't always harmless and they have a massive prejudice against Slytherins) and the twins get to feel what it's like on the other side of the blast. The mellow out their pranks from then on, but the ‘war' continues.

- The teachers and students have a betting ring on who the mysterious prankster is. Most are wrong, and there is a worryingly large amount on Nott and Zabini.

- Actual descriptions of the pranks and what they do, not just ‘the twin's hair suddenly turned a Slytherin green'. How did it happen? What spell/potion did it use? How difficult was it to make? What were their reactions? What were Harry and his helpers reaction? The teachers? The students? World building is so important to a good fic, even one-shots!

- Have fakers claim to be ‘the real prankster' and ‘the mastermind behind it all'

That's all I can think of. Good luck and happy writing!

** 'They have a massive prejudice against Slytherins'

Do they ? The most I can think of is them hissing at a first year being sorted

*** Hmm, maybe I did over-do it a bit, but I've seen a lot of people talking about how in general there is a massive predejuice against both houses from each side of the spectrum.

But also, imagine you're eleven and you get sorted into Slytherin. Everyone else got a thunderous applause, but you get hisses and anger from everyone and the Slytherin house looks on in indifference because that's normal for them, but that's not how the kid sees it. They see that they're the center of attention and suddenly everyone starts hating on them because of what a stupid dusty old hat said.

They'd be angry at the house they were put into for not supporting them like all the other houses do for their own, for making a terrible reputation with the other houses and they'd hate themselves for being sorted there, where all the ‘evil' people are.

It drives a wedge between the students and their house, and it drives a wedge between the rest of the school. The kid would think themselves on their own because their head of house was ‘evil' and they wouldn't trust the other teachers because they never told them to stop booing or to be kind to them.

Or maybe they'd be more perceptive and realize that the students were just feeling past-on prejudice and that Slytherins were not evil, they were just perceived to be. But then, they still wouldn't trust the other teachers or the headmaster who never stepped in.

Wow, this was a prank prompt. How did I manage to start a debate about Houses and prejudice?
