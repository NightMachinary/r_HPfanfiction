Any suggestions for Harry is Snape's apprentice fics? I don't mind if Harry wanted the apprenticeship or if he was forced into it.

Thanks!


** It's not /quite/ what you're after, as Harry isn't his formal apprentice, but you might find Blueowl's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][To Shape and Change]] to your liking; 232k words, complete.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

*** I'm pretty much the exact opposite of a huge fan of Snape, but I LOVED this fic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8347216/1/Little-Seer][Little Seer]] - Harry is a seer, Voldie rules, Dumbldore is the baddie, Snape wonders how he got caught up dealing with so much bullshit. LVHP slash but no sex in it so far. Any other recs I have are snarry.
