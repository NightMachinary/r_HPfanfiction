:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
When it comes to this fic, I remember several things:

Harry was the black sorcerer, he was sent to middle earth although I cannot remember how. The fic continues with Dumbledore/Snape/Mcgonnagal going to find Harry in this alternate world and they find him a captain leading the assault against the darkness of mordor.

Furthermore, this fic is relatively short with around 40k+ words and 1 or 2 chapters. You see Harry fighting the orcs, leading the army and finally fighting a very powerful Sauron. After Harry is incredibly injured Snape heals him with potions. The fic ends with Harry in the healing house and ultimately deciding with his partner/gf/wife to go back with Dumbledore and the gang. The fic is filled with gore and battle scenes.

I think it has been removed from fanfiction.net because I simply cannot find it anymore. After searching for quite an allotment of time, I have nearly given up. Please help me with my quest for this reread. It has been plaguing my mind for weeks.

  There walks in Middle Earth a powerful warlock of great magical skill, wrathful in battle. He walks in the company of a second, a sorceress, vengeful in her spellcraft. Ere the battle looms, and the End of All Things should they not prevail. Meanwhile in the county of Surrey, a teacher seeks a missing student, who is more than miles away.
