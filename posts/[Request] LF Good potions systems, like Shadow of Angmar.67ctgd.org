In linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) Harry can reason out a potion's recipe based on the natural properties of completely foreign ingredients and the application of poetic reasoning. Are there any other fanfics that have a similar element?


** Taure's very short fic linkffn(The Next Great Adventure by Taure).

Sadly, most potioneering in fanfiction is utterly terrible.

  Harry sacrifices himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest expecting to die. Instead he wakes up in the Third Age of Middle Earth, lost and confused. Realistic crossover with canon Harry. No power-ups, elfling Harry or tenth walker. No slash.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
