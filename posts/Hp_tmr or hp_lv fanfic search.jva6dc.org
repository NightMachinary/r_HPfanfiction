:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfiction where Harry is betrayed(?) and is a still, silent guardian behind Voldemorts throne, Remus and twins appear and Harry takes a step forward which was uncharacteristic of him. Voldemort spared them, I think...

Thats all I really remember, which granted isn't much... it was either ffn or aff. Slight chance of ao3... ask for details and I might remember? But really, I've been looking for awhile and this is all I've been going with, so help would be cool...


** I know where to find it but it's on wattpad. I don't know if it's on any other site
