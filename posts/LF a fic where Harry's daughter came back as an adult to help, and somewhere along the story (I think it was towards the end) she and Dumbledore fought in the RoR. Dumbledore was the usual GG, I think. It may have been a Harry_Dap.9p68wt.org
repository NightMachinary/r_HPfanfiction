#+TITLE: LF a fic where Harry's daughter came back as an adult to help, and somewhere along the story (I think it was towards the end) she and Dumbledore fought in the RoR. Dumbledore was the usual GG, I think. It may have been a Harry/Daphne fic.

The other thing I can remember is that the daughter is somewhat angry or resentful of Harry.


** I'm rather confident it is this one. Daughter's name is Athena, she never knew her Father as Harry wanted to keep her safe. Daphne was an unspeakable before they traveled back in time; Athena comes back midway through.

*** I meant the usual fanon trope (that I actually despise). And no, in canon he kept believing in the greater good, considering what he did to Harry for the actual greater good of the world. Which, to be honest, is amazing the depth of control and inteligence that he had.
