If anyone knows any good long fanfiction pairing together female Harry and Snape drop some suggestions here please! I'm a huge Snape fan so really Snape times anyone would be great. Oh! And if you know any good vampire Snape fics Id appreciate that as well.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/1/The-Never-ending-Road][The Never-Ending Road]] is really good. It starts in first year and is realistic, though, so there hasn't actually been any romance, yet.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4831537/1/Someone-To-Run-To][Someone to run to]] is femharry/snape, the only one I've read that I actually liked.

Since you say you would also like other snape pairings, here are my favourite snamiones (snatched from a previous comment):

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/When-A-Lioness-Fights][When a Lioness Fights]] - I was amazed by this and read it in one weekend.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7170435/70/Bound-to-Him][Bound to Him]] - Unfinished and very dark but it captivated me. I try to avoid unfinished stories but I wanted to skim the first chapter whether I should put it on my future reading list, and ended up reading the entire thing (so far).
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]] - A very sweet fic with a few dark moments in it that I am planning on re-reading, which I don't generally do with fanfiction

** linkao3(Gravity by SlytherinsQuill) isn't super long, but it is a pretty good fem!Harry/Snape, and it has pretty well done sex scenes. Also linkao3(Life As She Knows It by Meg_Nevermore) is good.

      A/N: Hi all\! This is my first HP\-verse fanfiction\! This is a repost from other sites as I have posted elsewhere\. It's a WIP currently that I am just returning to after an enforced break due to real life dramas, but I am back writing again now which is very exciting\. I hope you all enjoy it\. Just something for you to consider while reading, while I've read over this for spelling and grammar, etc myself, I currently don't have a beta reader, so I apologise if I've missed anything\.In this story Harry was born a girl\. He will stay a girl throughout, but most of what happened in all the books up the end of the sixth book stay true to the plot\. I'm not going to give you a background to the plot because you should be able to pick most of it up from the story line\.Please let me know what you think :\)~Quill \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Disclaimer: This story is based on characters and situations created and owned by JK Rowling, various publishers including but not limited to Bloomsbury Books, Scholastic Books and Raincoat Books, and Warner Bros\., Inc\.

  Hollis Potter walked into what she thinks is the final battle of the war that's been raging for the last six years, only to find, when it's over and she's officially lost everything, that she's not where she's supposed to be. Or, rather, she's not when she's supposed to be. She wouldn't have made it as far as she did without being stubborn, however, so she pushed past the surprise and the grief and decides to change it, no matter the cost. --Cross-posted on FanFic: Hollis Potter, with grim determination, walks into a battle that will make or break England - and affect the World War raging around them. The outcome is surprising, even for her, and she is left with nothing to do but adapt. [Slightly Edited/Reworked]

  #+begin_example
      This DOES NOT reflect my actual attitude towards God\. I believe in Him, and I know He loves us \- I just don't think that Hollis would think so\. As far as I know, Harry was never exposed to church or to God, and I think the lack of knowledge in addition to what he had been through would've made him less inclined to think well of Him\.

** I remember one I read on schnoogle at least 5 years ago. It was a trilogy of 5th, 6th, and 7th year with another story after.

It started with "harry" pretending to be a boy until 5th year. Dumbledore grooms her to be head of the order. She has 2 animagus forms, a snake and a bird, which she is taught to merge.

Don't remember much more but it was well written.
