I was wondering if anyone might be able to recommend me some good length fics (80k or longer and longer is better) with a good amount of differences to cannon in them. I'd prefer it not to be a cannon rehash with a different premise but I will honestly accept that if it's a good fic.

Mostly I'm looking for really any fics that starts off different in some interesting way and isn't too over the top with GodMode!Harry and such. Examples: different sorting, Harry with Lily and James alive ( a lot of these have them being really bad parents which confuses me but fair enough), raised by someone else than dursleys, Harry with different friends, dark/grey Harry (doesn't have to be but I tend to find most Slytherin Harry fics have him darker and most sorting outside of Gryffindor seems to be Slytherin).

A good few fics I've read like this are Hallowed, Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, and Three Black Birds. And they were all pretty great!

Thanks for helping me out guys and gals!

  After the infamous massacre of the Potters, young Harry Potter went missing. It doesn't really help that years later he turns up again, a bit darker, stranger and more erratic than anyone had hoped for. But Harry hardly cares, in the end it's his decision on which side he will fight; dark, light or no side at all. Eventually HP/LV... of sorts.

  Warnings Inside. Dumbledore ought to have known better than to leave an orphaned Harry Potter in the hands of the Dursleys. A twist of fate has the boy-who-lived living with criminals. Sly, cunning, street-smart, sorted into Slytherin where his housemates have been raised to hate him, will Harry survive? Or maybe it's the House of Snakes that doesn't stand a chance.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** This is my own fic and not 80k yet, but updates are regular and hopefully it should be there soon enough : linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13586585/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enigmatic-Professor-Riddle]])

The thing you'll like will possibly be that Lily and James are alive here, /and/ good parents. It's basically an AU where Dumbledore doesn't refuse Tom the post of the DADA teacher. Now Dumbledore is dead and Tom is Deputy Headmaster of Hogwarts.
