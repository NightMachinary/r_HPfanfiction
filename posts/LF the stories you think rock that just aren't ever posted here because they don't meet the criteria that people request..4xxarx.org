** Linkffn(Guy Fawkes Day) Remember, remember the Fifth of November...

Linkffn(Shift by moonfyre) has an interesting familiar that we don't usually see.

linkffn(In which Snape befriends an old grey donkey) I don't remember where I found this. It might have been on here. But holy god is it hilariously on point.

linkffn(Vince's Ambition) Goyle wants something different.

linkffn(Realizations) An adorable story that ends up with Harry getting a surrogate family. Likely dead.

linkffn(On a Train, Switching Tracks) Celebrities are mad. Harry's a celebrity. Oh dear. Also likely dead.

I have others, if people want them. This is, like, page three of my 17 pages of favorites...

***** In my story, Lily as a child wanted to be a paleontologist.

In the story James survived along with Harry's twin sister and tells them tales of their mother's dream of being a paleontologist.

Along with McGonagall--the animagus form CAN be directed but it's easier to accept your 'natural' form because you have to have to be VERY knowledgeable about the anatomy of the creature--they study the anatomy of alligators and large birds and then carefully build and transfigure the alligator into a utahraptor using the large bird's structure as a template. Finally, Harry is considered ready and attempts it. He completes a utahraptor animagus form in fourth or fifth year, completing his NEWT in Transfiguration early.

A pteradon was also considered.

**** I don't generally mind OCs if they are well written and make sense in the context of the plot. I've only read the beginning so far, but this one seems out of place. Its like the author had two separate unrelated plot ideas but didn't want to write two stories so they just merged them together.

Having a story where there is an American OC who gets involved in the plot so things happen a bit differently sounds find, as does a story where Draco travels back in time to fix things. But having a story where Draco goes back in time to fix things, and then there is also this random American OC for some reason is weird.
