Looking for some good long fics which avoid the whole Lord Potter bs. A little bit of pureblood etiquette is acceptable but I am at the point that bar a couple of well known exeptions (theblacksresurgence), I will exit a fic as soon as The MoOsst AnciEnt and MoSt NOble HoUSe Of PoTTer is mentioned. Beyond that I'm open to most stuff. Any suggestions boiiis???


** I completely skewer lordships in my WIP fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon][Loose Cannon]] (which is /very/ long). Lordships exist in the story, but there's no House Potter, and Harry blows the lid off of how bogus they all are.

#+begin_quote
  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** Can you describe briefly this 'Lord Potter' phenom in fics? I haven't come across it, mostly bc I read a lot of rom-com stuff/pieces where Harry is a background character.

*** It's when this happens:

/"OMG! And it turned out that Harry was the heir of Gryffindor through his dad. OMG! And his mum was from a Squib line and made him heir to Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Merlin, Morgana and Bill Gates as well. OMG! And he inherited all their stuff too. OMG! Which meant he was filthily rich. OMG!"/

**** Ah...but in canon we suddenly find out that Harry is a Gryffindor descendant in DH....but I get it. Harry in canon was already filthy rich, he had his parents money and Sirius's.

***** It was never proved in canon that Harry inherited everything Sirius owned. For all we know, Sirius never had a will and all of his possessions were given to the Malfoys or the Lestranges. Also Harry isn't a descendant of Gryffindor either

******** “Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, turning toward him, “a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us. By /us,/ I mean the Order of the Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that Sirius's will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned.”

Over on the sofa, Uncle Vernon's head turned, but Harry did not look at him, nor could he think of anything to say except, “Oh. Right.”

“This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,” Dumbledore went on. “You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts, and you inherit all of Sirius's personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the legacy ---"

Then it goes onto talk about inheriting Grimmauld place. .
