I'm looking for a fic where harry is a thug or criminal type character. Preferably he stays a total asshole the entire fic and doesn't redeem himself halfway through or something. No mafia stories please, I'm looking for lowlife criminal not classy criminal.


** Don't know of any that fit your criteria exactly but here's a criminal Harry story.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199602/1/The-Thief-of-Hogwarts]] Abandoned, but well worth the read, I think.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus]] WIP. Is probably more of the "classy criminal" vs lowlife. Fem!Harry is the ring-leader of THE criminal underworld. I include it because I really like the story, but to be honest, we haven't yet really seen much thuggery from her, so its probably not what you're looking for.
