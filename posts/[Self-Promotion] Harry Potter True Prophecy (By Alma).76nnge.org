** For some reason, recent "Self-Promotion" threads have been bare all except a link to the story that's being commercialized. So I'll ask, do you need help with anything in your story, a scene you want to be critiqued, or characterization you need input for? Or do you just want to simply advertise your story? Dropping a small sentence or two to accompany your link would be wildly helpful.

**** Try to provide a summary when advertising your story. It gives potential readers a way to quickly decide if they want to read it or not.

I guarantee that lack of a summary is a surer way to decrease a story's exposure, compared to your summary alienating potential readers.

****** You can't type text in a link post, so for this one just write it out in a comment. For the future, make it a text post, do the summary in the text and put the link at the bottom somewhere.

** Peculiar CAPS LOCK style, I'll give it a try. And usually I'd ask a short overview/summary/introduction to the story, but it sorta explains itself within the first 20 sentences, which is nice.

Edit; Does the site not allow for /curisiv/ and that's why you a resorting to caps lock? From the context of the use I'd personally use /curisive/ instead.

*** No, it is just a quirk. I'm autistic, and words in my head sound louder than others, and it is like an itch and I write it down to emphasize them.

**** Alright, first get a better writing program, I personally use Google Drive, just check it out, your writing efficiency will likely increase greatly.

Next I totally get the need for all caps, did it once myself, but for casual readers it rather jarring and /italics/ is more casual yet still convey your meaning. Else I quite enjoyed the story for what it's worth. Very different from the usual templates.

** A summary of some sort would be appreciated.

Also I haven't heard of the site you have it on before. If you only really want people you specifically share it with to read it then that isn't an issue, but if you want more people to stumble across it posting it on fanfiction.net or archiveofourown.org as well would be a good idea since that's where most people go to look for fanfiction.
