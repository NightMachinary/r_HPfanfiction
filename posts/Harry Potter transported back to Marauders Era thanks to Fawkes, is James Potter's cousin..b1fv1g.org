  Oh yeah and the first time he met Voldemort was legit. A true Slytherin indeed.

.. What does this mean? Harry fought well? They had a sneaky snakey conversation?

** Pretty sure this is /A New Life/ ffnlink(4345742). You didn't mention the HP/SB slash part, but that's only near where it breaks off, if I recall correctly, and everything else seems to align with what I remember.

  Set after DH. Harry is transported to an alternate universe, where he grows up as James' brother. But when he gets tangled in a web of family, romance and the First War, what will Harry do? HPSB Slash

*** I wish it was but something seems . . . . /off/. No Fawkes and it's Gryffindor Harry. Additionally I have read this a few months ago but the way Snape was obviously into Harry made me extremely uncomfortable so I stopped reading.

I know I didn't mix /A New Life/ with the one I am searching because the backstory between the sister and Voldemort is missing.

**** Huh, I thought the Caroline Potter bit was in A New Life, but I totally missed the detail you included about Slytherin Harry. Sorry I can't any more with this one, that was all I had.

  Harry dies at the same time as Voldemort when the killing curse backfires the second time and is sent back to Kings cross station. Now however Fawkes meets him there and sends him somewhere all together different than the Hogwarts he knows. Not Slash
