I'm looking for fics where Sirius doesn't go to jail. Like maybe the black family goes oh hey he was on Voldemort's side all along? Great let's help him not go to jail. Or maybe the justice system works like it should and at his trial it's found out that he is truly innocent. I'm interested in either type of fics. Thank you in advance!!


** If a fic where he gets out of Azkaban early enough to raise Harry works I highly recommend living with danger. It's really well written and while it's extremely AU it does a really good job being true to the characters

*** I would recommend A second Chance by Breanie. It's fabulous. You can find it on AO3 and FF
