Has anyone read any fics where Severus is friends with the marauders? Maybe minus peter?


** There are no Marauders, but he's good friends with Sirius and Remus in dimensional travels [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/][A Riddled Universe]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925;8678567).

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

  Sirius shrugs. “Okay.” He pushes down on the black lever, which has some surprising resistance. The box eats the bread. “The fuck?”

  Sirius Black loses the argument with the Sorting Hat and is Sorted Slytherin. He has no idea what could possibly be worse than this.

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. COMPLETE.

** I'm loathe to mention it, but this happens in The Lone Traveler series. It's Harry doing a bunch of dimension hopping and author plot fix-its. I could barely get through one of them, but some people like em.

*** I like a few of them (just a couple, really not the ones that go into other universes, like the Hobbit one). This mostly applies to the original author and creator of the series, but oh well, some of them are humorous to me.
