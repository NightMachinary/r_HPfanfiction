Would they pop into existence shoulder-to-shoulder feeling a bit wobbly, or would they end up melded together in some horrible amalgamated afront to God and the laws of nature? Or maybe something else entirely?


** I always thought the magic would push them slightly apart so they would end next to one another.

** Bill or Charlie - I forget which - mention appearing on top of an old Muggle woman during their Apparation test. Since appearing too high isn't even discussed as a danger during the Apparation lessons, it seems likely that he was shunted upwards when he was going to appear in an occupied space.

So that's probably what happens. The magic reads your Destination, Deliberation, and Determination, and comes up with the closest match - even if it's several feet /above/ the location you were thinking of.

So one of the people Apparating would stay in the same spot, and the other would appear above them.

** Probably the same thing that happens when you apparate directly into a wall, whatever that is.

** It's not canon, but i think there are two possibilities - either a shift of the person apparating, or a splinch, depending on some factors:\\
If you're good at apparating, and apparate within your usual distance, you get shifted to the side with no ill side effects\\
If you're shit at apparating, but still go withing your possible distance, you get shifted in a weird way - either upwards, or violently thrown to the side. Similiar in the case of the person from exhibit A apparating further than their limits.\\
If you overdo the distance and are shite at apparition... well, say goodbye to a piece of you that didn't get shifted properly.

** It was never mentioned as a danger in canon, and the Weasley twins for example casually Apparate inside the house, so probably nothing too terrible.
