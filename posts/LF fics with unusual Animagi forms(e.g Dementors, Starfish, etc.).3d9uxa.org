** linkffn(I'm Still Here) Has a joke (but no interaction) based on an unusual animagi form and another two unusual (But seen before in fanfiction) forms. Still, the forms have yet to make any difference for the story /yet/. Also Pers has already mentioned all other I know of.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
