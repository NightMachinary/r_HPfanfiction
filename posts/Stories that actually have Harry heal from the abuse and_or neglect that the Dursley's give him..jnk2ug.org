Rather it's canon or fanon related, either is fine. Where Harry is actually messed up by whatever the Dursley's did and the Wizarding World or some of the people help him heal.

*Note! Absolutely NO! Rape, please. I just can't handle that. Also nothing to the point of where the abuse would kill a normal adult, let alone an actual kid, nothing that extreme please.*

Anyone can be the main character can be on any site can be any length can be old or new.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

Would rather not have Weasley bashings where they are using Harry for his fame and fortune.

Doesn't have to focus on pairings but if there are am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes (Though nothing when they are super young please).


** I'm currently writing a fic where his abuse isn't being swept under a rug, and he's slowly dealing with it. There are off-screen references to rape, but I don't think I've made it explicit.

  What if Dobby bound himself to Harry without Harry knowing about it? How would that influence the story?
