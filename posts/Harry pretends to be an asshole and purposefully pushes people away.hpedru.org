Maybe because he thinks it's his and his job alone to stop Voldemort and no one else should get hurt because of him.

Or maybe because he learns about the Scarcrux early and thinks he's going to die anyway so it'll be better for everyone if they didn't get too close to him.

Or anything along the lines.


** So, Saving Conner is a WBWL twin fic, but it's very similar to your premise in that Harry believes that his only purpose (even more important than his own happiness or his “friends”) is to protect his twin - much of the story revolves around the development over time of his understanding of how that's problematic.

Some Lily/Dumbledore bashing. Possible James bashing, depending on how you look at it.

Also strongly bends toward Light/Dark magic trope, but in an effective, interesting way.

Overall, I thought it was decent and read the whole way through!

*** Agreed that it's well written with some interesting world-building, but I would describe it as /heavy/ Lily/Dumbledore bashing, some James bashing.

**** This is probably true. Been a while since I read it.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
