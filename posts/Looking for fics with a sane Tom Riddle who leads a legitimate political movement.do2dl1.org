I'm tired of comic book villain Voldemort; give me fics where he's actually a smart and competent leader rather than an impulsive madman who split his soul more times than the old Dark magic books said he should.

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

** Sarcasm and Slytherin Saga is the closest I've ever read and is not even that we even know what exactly is their agenda, is just that the "bad guys" don't feel like a bunch of rabid dogs owned by a madman, it is besides, the best "canon rehash" I've ever read, the main elements of the books are kept, you still have Voldemort possessing Quirrell and trying to steal the philosopher stone, you still have the whole Basilisk debacle, you still have the whole tournament thing, but damm it feels so different, there is hints that the whole conflict has actual substance, instead of being as you said just a comic book vilain, unfortunately the hints are so far that, hints and it does look like it may get abandoned so read at your own risk

** linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) is my favorite story of all time currently. It's so beautiful and has a very... sane Voldemort. It's a must-read imo. This feels like Voldemort as I always imagined him.

linkffn(Benefit of Old Laws) is in the same vein of politics over murder. It was actually a major plot point.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.
