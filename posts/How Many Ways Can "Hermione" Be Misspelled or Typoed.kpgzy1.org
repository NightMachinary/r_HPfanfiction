Disclaimer: I post this with only humor and affectionate ribbing for all of the beautiful fic writers who feed my addiction to my fandoms!

I've been on an absolute tear through fanfic lately, and I had to ask myself... how many ways can Hermione be misspelled, and WHY is her name still being misspelled by now?

So far, as I've been keeping track for the last two days, I've counted "Herminone", "Hermoine", "Herimone", and "Herminne" ðŸ˜… Anyone have any other misspellings you can't help but wonder about? It doesn't just have to be Hermione. "Ginerva" gets special mention because I see it so often!


** Depends on if Viktor Krum is featuring in the story - if he is, it's double the usual amount. :D

Tbf, misspelling her name is probably the most realistic thing this fandom does. Pretty sure anyone with an atypical name or name spelling can attest to that. You're never going to find 'Hermione' on a novelty name fridge magnet.

My favourite name misspelling is still Luscious Malfoy, though. Makes him sound like the Garnier Hair Care Model and Glam Metal Frontman he absolutely secretly is. :D

**** Because he's worth it. :)

(I know that's the Loreal tagline, but I haven't seen a Garnier advert in a decade, so I can't for the life of me remember what the hell their advert thing even is.)

*** I usually call him Luscious Milfboy. Husband of Cissy, father of Dorko. Can't help but imagine all of them having some sort of weird kink or perversion.

Love the username, btw. :)

** A few of those, Hermoine in particular, look like dyslexia happened. For reasons beyond me, some people still write directly into text editors rather than a processor with spellcheck.

** Definitely guilty of Hermoine...And consistently too. I just hadn't realised it was Hermione.
