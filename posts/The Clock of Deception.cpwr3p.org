A wonderful fic so far.

I really like the new prophecy.

*/"A Raven with bloodied claws tears off the clock hands and watches them fall. The cogs are still in motion, Facades will crumble, An alluring Prince will take his rightful place  Next to a sinful soul.‚Äù/*

And am very curious about what it means.

Also, it's oddly melodic when put in Google Translate and listening to it.

*** Quite possible if it wasn't strange as one of the two - the prince or the sinful soul - is probably Tom and this is a purely Tomarry relationship without anyone mixed in between those two.
