It's been a month since the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4cudor/writers_discussion_thread_april/][previous Writer's Discussion Thread]].

• What stories are you currently developing?

• How is your writing progressing?

• Need some quick feedback on a story you've written? Post a link and get some advice.

• Are you in need of a beta/willing to beta someone else's story?

• Come across a handy piece of advice you'd like to share with other authors?

• If you have other writing-related thoughts, post away!


** I'm finally starting to enjoy writing Aurors, but what is bothering me is the guest reviews I'm getting yelling about either Harry's behaviour or Ginny's behaviour in an argument. Readers seem entirely incapable of understanding that no character is flawless and it's normal to have arguments with your SO.

I hear you. Before I took my fic down, I regularly received reviews stating that Harry and Hermione needed to 'get busy' as soon as possible. At that point in the story, they were twelve, so... yuck.

*** That's the rub with fanfiction though; people don't really come for well-developed characters with strengths and flaws, they come for wish-fulfillment. Fortunately, as you continue on with your story, those people will likely drop it, and you'll have to deal less and less with unreasonable reviews like that.

**** Yeah possibly. The thing is, I could understand that more if it were a romance, but this issue is very much a subplot. It's not the sort of fic young teens would flock to. Maybe I'm wrong.

I don't know, I think there's something kind of rude about leaving a review that tells the author how the characters should act, unless they're out of character.

** I'm currently taking a break from most of my other stories to work on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11804414/1/The-Lesser-Kindness][The Lesser Kindness]], which is an HP/Witcher crossover. Essentially, it takes place in the Witcher world around 200 years before The Last Wish, which is the first Witcher book, and follows Harry's exploits as a Witcher, or a monster-slayer, in a series of short arcs. The first arc, which I've completed, follows Ron and Harry investigating the disappearances of young girls in a small riverside town. The second arc, which I've only just started, involves Harry, Hermione, and Viktor hunting down a djinn/genie in a university town, Oxenfurt. Ultimately, while it features almost exclusively HP characters in the crossover, the fic takes place in the Witcher world and follows its rules. So if you're looking for a crossover that is more HP and less whatever it's being crossed with, this probably isn't the crossover for you.

I'd also be willing to take tips or constructive criticism for how to improve going forward; so if you're bored, and you're a fan of The Witcher series, give it a read and send me a critique, if you can.

As for a piece of advice, mine centres around dialogue. Dialogue is actually quite difficult to do, since you need to keep it concise enough to get your point across, while also giving the illusion of two people having a "real-life" conversation, instead of a stilted, info-dumpy mess. The best advice I can give is simply to actually speak the conversations your characters are having, aloud. It sounds ridiculous, yes, but when you say things out loud, it's suddenly much easier to determine what sounds good and what sounds shit. Then you can just keep editing and rewriting until you have a proper, organic-sounding conversation.

*** That's really good advice. I find it hard sometimes to give /every/ character their own unique voice. Some of them are quite easy: Fleur, Dobby/Kreacher/Winky, Hagrid.

But some others have some really indistinct speech patterns (e.g. McGonagall, Sirius, etc). Narration is pretty easy, but AFAIK there's nothing particular about their dialogue conventions.

** - I'm writing Magic Muggle at the moment. It's over at [[/r/magicmuggle]]. Updates have been irregular and unpredictable recently due to upcoming exams, but I put up two chapters recently.

- I feel that my writing is progressing fairly well. I think - or hope - that the way I write dialogue has improved and become slightly more organic. On the other hand, I feel like I've focused too much on dialogue and should develop other areas.

- I would be very grateful for any feedback on the latest chapter at [[/r/magicmuggle]].

- I don't need a beta, and don't have the time to beta.

- The best advice I can give would be to write naturally, and write what you enjoy. If you have to force the words to come, it will show, so sometimes it's best to take a break and return when you are in a creative mood.

** There were one or two fics that I wanted to concentrate on, ones with Very Important Themes^{^{TM}} and outlines a mile long ... but my subconscious revoked its interest in those and said, "nah, screw all that," and has had a hundred new ideas for an extremely self-indulgent crackfic with an incompetent self-insert who keeps failing to help resolve the canon plot. I mentioned that fic on one thread or another in this subreddit a couple days ago, and now I can't stop thinking about the thing.

It's stress relief and might not see the light of day, but it's fun. My fanfiction writing is limited to Sundays (or spots of rare spare time in the rest of the week) so the actual writing pace is not very fast.

Is anyone else working on anything that they might not post?

*** I had a burst of inspiration earlier in the month for a fic very different from what I usually write -- it'll probably never see the light of day, or even be continued, but it was good stress relief while I was at it! Sometimes it's nice just to write for the sake of writing, or to write for yourself vs. an audience.

- My writing is progressing.. surprisingly well. Like, it's been really slow over this year, and I think I've accepted now that my style has changed (for the better, in my opinion) and I'm glad that I get to write something that reflects that. Also, I have an amaziiiiiiiiiing beta who is an absolute queen, and is so helpful!

    Yaxley mistimes his pursuit of the fleeing trio, and as the Horcrux hunt goes stagnant, the secret of No. 12 Grimmauld Place remains intact. Years later, an erratic band of survivors---tormented by inaction, those they call comrade, and the house that is their home---fight a desperate battle to stave off the utter end of wizarding Britain. In the shadows and corners of the House of Black, forces stir.

** - I wrote about 100k during April (Camp Nano) towards my novel length fic that I started in November. I haven't hit 200k yet but I'm close. It's not published anywhere because I've been having fun writing the scenes I want to write rather than writing beginning-middle-end style. It doesn't really have a title yet, but (almost) everything is outlined.
- I reread some of my old fanfic from years ago and it was cringe-worthy. I haven't done as much cringing when I've gone back to reread what I've written lately so I hope I've gotten better. I'm still a comma-addict, unfortunately.
- Sometimes this subreddit makes me nervous, because I'll read how people seem to hate this or that trope and I've used it in my story. So I'm leery of ever actually posting my stuff. Or sharing it here, at least.

Researching the Ministry, where everybody ended at after Voldemort was defeated, looking up maps and diagrams of various places... it's time consuming but very fun. I haven't read the books in years, so all of it is like visiting one of my childhood hometowns.
