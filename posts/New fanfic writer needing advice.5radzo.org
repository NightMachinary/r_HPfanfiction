Hi everyone!

I've been reading fan fic for years and have always had this stories in my head that I thought could go somewhere near and I've finally decided to try my hand at writing them.

I'm looking for two things: 1) general advice to a new fanfic writer and 2) advice on how to handle time gaps

The story I wanna write has 1 scene that is almost immediately post-war (maybe 3-4 months out) but the next scene isn't until about 1.5 years post war. After that time will be pretty fluid for a while, maybe only jumping a few weeks or months occasionally and even day by day at points. I want to manage the time jumps so that it isn't a huge distraction to the reader but also in a way that doesn't confuse the reader as to how long there is between certain events. Any suggestions?


** Your first draft WILL suck.

Keep writing despite this and push forward.

Yoyr story may want to go some place other than you had planned, go.

Keep a tab with thesaurus.com and Harry-Potter wiki open at all time. The worst thing you can do is make mistakes out of canon elements.

Reuse names, don't use Epithet.

Don't put An in the middle of your fic.

You can use said a lot. Even with adverbs (yes yes) trying to use a hundred different speech verbs is what gets me out of a story.

Don't apologize for what you can fix.

Make sure your summary don't had mistakes in it, does not bode well for the rest of the fic.

You really don't need to describe your MC. People will make their own picture. Unless it's relevant to the plot (a limp, a scar, etc.)

If it does not further plot and/or characterization, don't put it.

Look for betas, multiple if possible.

Don't hesitate to ask questions.

Most of all ENJOY

** Generally I would look for something in the scene that will inform the reader that time has passed. Could be the last scene was in the spring and in this one you talk about the leaves falling from the trees. If its a year or more then it can be as easy as saying 'had it really been two years since he'd last seen her?' Children can be another way of measuring time especially if they are young. Teddy can now walk, or speak or will be going to Hogwarts the next year.

Hope this helps and good luck with your writing,

** You might stage a scene in the first time frame (visiting a shop, wearing an annoying coat, hearing an unexpected song) that you then echo in the 'years later... ' scene to give the character a reason to think 'hey, that hasn't happened for almost two years'. It's useful to make the touchstone something that helps to better define the character and their values- is this someone who avoids unfamiliar places, or focuses on comfort, or pays attention to music, and that's why it was remarkable for them.

** Really, just get it down in writing first. You do not have to post anything until it is fit to be seen.

If you're an inexperienced writer read up on story structures, plot arcs, character development and anything else you can find -- no reason you can't be writing at the same time. Edit it to the best of your ability. Find a beta to read it over.

** We all start somewhere, don't we? It might be easier to make that first scene it's own chapter and make it clear in your second how much time has passed either through the growth of children, in the opening paragraph, or if you're like me a set date in time.

Best advice I can give you is to write everyday, and write at least a few chapters ahead of where you are posting, and lastly have a regular schedule for when you post a new chapter.
