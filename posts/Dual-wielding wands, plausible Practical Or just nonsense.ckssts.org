This thread is partly in response to [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ckqcy2/harry_dual_wielding_wands/][this thread]], where the OP there is asking for stories featuring Harry dual-wielding wands; and a thought occurred to me: "Is dual-wielding wands possible given what we know about how magic works in the Harry Potter books, or have people giving Harry the ability to do so been watching too many John Woo movies?". Thoughts?


** In canon, it's probably safe to assume that it wouldn't work because we never see anyone doing so. Voldemort, for example, has no reason not to world the Deathstick and his old yew wand at the same time.

In a fic, it's not something I mind as long as we have a reason why not everyone is doing so - maybe it takes incredible power, or unusual abilities to split one's attention. But being able to curse with one hand and shield with the other is a massive advantage on the battlefield.

We actually do. In DH, Harry casts with multiple wands at once and the spell is noted as being more powerful for having done so:

#+begin_quote
  As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took his chance; he leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco's grip, pointed all of them at Greyback and yelled: â€˜Stupefy!' The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground.

**** I think Harry probably got really lucky there. A lot of the points in this thread are forgetting the fact that wands have their own, for lack of a better word, "personality". Wands can switch ownership, not work well, malfunction, or in some cases be dangerous to the caster. The wand chooses the wizard, why would we assume they would be happy being 1 of multiple.

The explanation could be as simple as no one wants to risk their wand being tempermental if they feel slighted by the fact that you feel the need to use multiple wands at once. As per the final clash with the elder wand we know even spells like the killing curse can be reflected back on the caster if the wand acts up, just how dangerous could it be if 2 wands decide to act up at once.

What about "Lord Voldemort is not ambidextrous"? Even assuming it's theoretically possible to cast with two wands at once, it would necessitate someone who, in the heat of battle, is able to perfectly form wand movements with /both hands/, simultaneously.

It's also impractical for a host of reasons such as: having a free hand is /useful/; even if you can cast in two directions, you probably can't /aim/ in two directions at once, so fat lot of good this is in a duel; assuming you /can/, effortfully, work out the necessary concentration to successfully cast two spells at once, that concentration might nevertheless be better used elsewhere; etc.

**** You know those professors in college who write with both hands at the same time, but different things? Like I imagine if you were say, right handed, you could train your left hand to get really good at casting protego, and only ever use it for that and that becomes like habitual and you just focus on actual dueling with your right hand

***** Even then, casting spells is clearly not just a matter of doing the right motion with your wand. You have to say the incantation (or at least think it) and concentrate on intent of some sort. Your left hand alone can't cast /Protego/, you have to be thinking /about/ the spell as you move the hand.

So it's just about imaginable that you could cast the same spell in both directions at once, but, I think, unworkable to cast two /different/ spells at once.

***** In the movies, maybe, because the actors couldn't be bothered and/or it would have been a bit silly. But when reading, I never assumed that people stopped doing the wand movements just because they're not described to use every time, any more than I assume people simply hover from Point A to Point B if the narration fails to specify that they do so by putting one front of the other, and then repeating.

*** Well I imagine like anything else it's a skill that must be learned and if you aren't proficient with it you wouldn't bring it into battle because it would be a detriment.

I think it's theoretically possible but it would be just stupid complex, imagine trying to do wand motions with both hands simultaneously while also aiming. I mean shit a lot of people struggle to rub their belly and pat their heads at the same time. That doesn't even get into intent and concentration of spells either.

** This is where I think fan fiction and cannon get murky.

Cannon is unclear about the possibility (although it's doubtful). We're sort of beholden to what JK says can happen and can't depending on her mood and what she decided to Recon/put in fantastic beasts. Up until book 6 we didn't really know how people learned to cast silently. It's not really ever clarified if they have to have wand movements on top of that or if it's just another more advanced step to get rid of that too.

Personally I prefer a Brandon Sanderson or Patrick Rothafuss model for magic systems. Defined rules and understanding of magic but it's also a flexible system which allows talented characters to stretch what's possible.

On the other hand it's one of the reasons there's so much HP fan fiction. JKR built a reasonable base of lore, decent magic system, and a world filled with amazing characters and then she sort of just skimmed the surface.

If you (or any other author) can make dual wielding make sense/work based on sound reasoning or good explanation (say like Kvothe splitting his mind in name of the wind) then why not? Base magic on creativity and a connection with your wand rather than Latin words and weird motions. Or make it mandatory that all spells must be yodled and performed with giant rubber dildos. Knock yourself out.

** The problem I see is that a wand will listen to the wizard and act to cast a spell no matter which hand is holding it, so you'll get the same spell being cast from both wands. Great if you're trying to banish someone with a lot of force, as Harry did when casting with three wands against Greyback, but potentially disastrous for anyone tossing out, say, fiendfyre, which is already difficult to control.

I do see a need for Dragon handlers to have a backup six-shooter wand bundle, so they can Stun those vicious Hungarian Horntails when they get uppity, but they'd best keep it holstered at all other times.

** I doubt that it is possible to cast two spells at once, given that they seem to require some degree of concentration. However, we do see someone in the Battle of Hogwarts holding two wands pressed against one another and casting a Stunner with this double-wand, which results in a more powerful Stunner; so I think it's in the realm of possibility that with really good coordination, you could cast two of the same spell at once, reciting the incantation once while using each of the two wands to make identical wand movements.

This /would/ require perfect or near-perfect synchronicity, though, and doesn't sound very practical even then (what about aiming?). You /can/ imagine circumstances where it'd come in handy in a fight --- casting two /Arania Exumai/s simultaneously if you're surrounded by approaching Acromantulas, say --- but I think it'd more likely be a neat party trick available to ambidextrous wizards rather than a casting style you could just choose to use on a regular basis.

** I think that it may be possible, but I think it would most likely end up with the spell failing or the wands to be damaged. In my head it's like someone trying to punch with both hands at the same time, not very effective. What I want to ask is why would you want to use two wands? It's not going to make your spells anymore powerful, if anything they'd be weaker or unstable. Maybe, MAYBE it could be useful, but I just can't see how.

** A big part of learning spells is to get the muscle memory for the precise movements. You'll probably only learn to cast with one of your hands, just like most people can only write with one hand. Coordinating precise movements of two hands at once is probably more difficult than just casting with one hand more quickly. Also, you can only speak one incantation at a time.

** I remember one where the explanation was that casting required near complete focus, so you could effectively only mentally cast one spell at a time, so a second wand wouldn't help. Harry got around it by partitioning off part of his mind with occlumency, and basically having a background process running countspells and shields.

** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HhY2xQr0zw]]

Consider the above video showing how dual-wielding pistols performs under controlled circumstances. It's kinda sketchy and takes a lot of focus for not much advantage in target points.

Now imagine trying to do that in a combat scenario where you're running around and getting shot-at. Unless you're Lara-fucking-Croft or Keanu Reeves you're probably not going to hit much of anything.

Now swap the pistols for wands, wand-movements, and extra casting-related concentration. I presume trying to aim while doing wand movements with one wand is tricky to begin with. and unless you've got a crazy magical multitasking brain you'd probably only be able to cast the same spell from both wands if you want to cast simultaneously and wouldn't see any rate of fire improvements over a single wand if you alternated.

Conclusion: I don't think it would work out so well outside of a shooting range or a wizarding action-novel.

** Theoretically, provided you were doing the correct motions and were capable of casting without incantation, I see no reason why it would be impossible. However, I also see no reason why, unless you're naturally ambidextrous, it would be better than just learning to cast quicker with one wand.
