It's that time again. For July let's skip the theme. Just suggest anything you think is or will be a good read.


** /Saving Connor/, if you can stand the investment, is literally my favorite piece of literature. If anyone knows the author/a way to contact them, tell them I want to send them money.

/Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness/ is close to my heart for being perfectly written AND canon compliant; I love seeing canon from another POV. Along those lines, /The Snape Chronicles/ are another favorite of mine. The characterization in that one is so good it's become my headcanon.

/Harry Potter and the Natural 20/ is very well written, non-Harry POV, unique, and clever. Just generally a great read, even if you aren't into DnD.

The /Alexandra Quick/ series is also delightful. It reminds me very much of reading canon back in the day, with the whole book coming out at once, published-level writing, etc.

I have several other stories that I personally enjoy as much as the above, but for less... objective reasons. >_>

*** The Sacrifices Arc is far too long for the book club, same with Alexandra Quick, unfortunately. DAYD could be a good choice, though a lot of people may have read it already.

Same for DAYD.

+1 for Alexandra Quick though

******* Sure, it's not perfect.. but the implication in that that it's impossible to believe that Neville has grown up at all by his seventh year is pretty annoying. And that exaggerates its flaws to a really excessive degree for the sake of humor.

The ridiculous exaggeration of gender roles were my main complaint when reading it.

****** To name a few:

- Over dramatic/gritty for drama's sake.

- Flanderization of characters. Snape is a big one here.

- Unnecessary violence/gore for violence/gore's sake. Goes back to the first point really

- Unneeded original mechanics. All that Irish/Scottish magic crap.

- Cannon foddering of nearly every characters that isn't explicitly mentioned, and ignoring the epilogue and word of god.

- Exaggeration of gender role/Double standard/Excessive chauvinism

And that's before the entire author thing, which is a base breaker in its own right

******* After reading some of the sporking that [[/u/Manu_V]] posted, there was definitely a lot of stuff that I remember annoying me when I originally read it that I'd forgotten about.

#+begin_quote
  ignoring the epilogue and word of god
#+end_quote

This isn't really a valid complaint, though. No one is bound to comply with canon. Probably half the fics out there ignore the epilogue, or more.

The gender issues were what I remember really getting on my nerves.

*** I love A Difference In Family: The Snape Chronicles. A bit on the heavy side, but everyone should read it.

Saving Connor on the other hand... nope, couldn't quite power through yet another super!Harry story.

***** My problem with it is not that it's bad (it's actually rather good, I suppose). It's not the writing (it's well written, and I've read over half). It's not even the plot (read worse and better), the characters (though they're quite nice), or the cliches (they exist everywhere). The problem is that it's not maturely thought through - there exists nothing nuanced, nothing delicate.

The story just tries to be a steamroller of angst and drama and while those score extremely high with older teens, at this point I just have other fan fiction stories that do it better. But that lack of subtlety is exactly what makes sure that this will always have fans and will always be highly regarded... and will in essence be fan fiction, needing those extra crutches to build itself upon.

I could have been vicious here, lambasted the two-dimensionality of characters at critical points, joked about how many slash cliches slip through, but in the short term: "that poor super-powered hero made of protectiveness and love that everyone adores" elicits very little emotional response from me, especially when said "everyone else" isn't particularly extraordinary all things concidered.

*** I honestly really tried to like Saving Connor, but around the fourth book it just started feeling like filler. I wouldn't /not/ recommend the first or second ones, they were entertaining, but I can't recommend the whole series.

The other recommendations are excellent, even though Alexandra is one of the least likable main characters of fanfiction ever.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet]], my favorite fic out there. It's a one-shot of under a 600 words so just give it a shot.

Other fics I'd recommend:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7512124/1/Lessons-With-Hagrid][Lessons With Hagrid]], after Snape kicks Harry out of Occlumency lessons Hagrid takes them over. Hilarity ensues. One-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/All-The-Dementors-of-Azkaban][All The Dementors of Azkaban]], a incredibly silly story. It's great fun though. Luna gets sent too Azkaban in an AU where she got Tom Riddle's diary instead of Ginny. Harry disagrees and decides too camp next too her cell in progress. Lots of hilarious stuff follows.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][A Hero]], less lighthearted, still amazing. A one-shot where Dudley realises how the Dursleys are abusing Harry after a class asignment about abuse. Incredible and a must-read imo.

** How about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]]?

*They thought Lockhart was a fraud. They were wrong; he was their guide into a world of danger, adventure, intrigue and other Unspeakable Things.*

It's very funny and has a good plot. The epilogue is a bit OOC and rushed, but Unspeakable Things remains on my list of favorites, regardless of the lack of slash.
