I would be really interested in reading a story where Harry finds out he is a rich lord and instead of it solving all his problems, just causes problems. We have all seen really rich people fall into trouble with addiction, mania, and delusions. If you have everything, then what is there to work toward? What goals do you have (aside from offing voldemort) to give you that feeling of satisfaction with life? If it's too easy, where is the challenge and sense of accomplishment?


** I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but it's close and a really good fic. Linkffn(harry potter and the Prince of slytherin) is a WBWL story where the author decided that all the usual tropes from those fics (James potter hating us for no reason, leaving harry with the dursleys, etc.) has to make sense. It is a Lord Potter story, it's s excellent, and the fact that harry is the heir to the potter fortune doesn't make his life any easier.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.
