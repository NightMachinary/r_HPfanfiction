The first one shot is The Laughing Gargoyle and was used to answer the prompt 'changing hair color prank'. It followed an OC, Mariel Goyle, the terminally ill little sister of Gregory Goyle.

I want the second story to be on the more serious side; after all, this character has an incurable illness that's going to kill her while she's still pretty young. She doesn't get to go to school or do things other witches her age can. She's bedridden and weak, her only interactions are with her family, especially her brother (who she enjoys tormenting with progressively inventive pranks), and nurses.

The plot for the next one shot will be this, basically: "Mariel can see her progressive weakness and upcoming death is bothering her family but she pretends she can't see it. Because if she stops laughing, she might just start crying, too."

If I go with the similar vibe as the first title, I guess something like The Crying Gargoyle or The Acting Gargoyle could work but I just don't know if that's what I want to do or not.

Can I please have some advice on this?

Not sure if that tag is correct or not. Sorry if it's wrong!


** My first thought is "The Gargoyle in the Room" alluding to an elephant in the room being a topic everyone knows about and refuses to discuss.

** "A Giggling or Gloomy Gargoyal?" seems to sum up your story pretty well

** I don't have any specific suggestions, but I'd go for something pretence-ey. Stick to that theme of being in a bad spot but laughing through it and pretending everything is okay. The Pollyannaish Gargoyle, the Sanguine Gargoyle, that kind of thing. Fakery in the face of the sad.
