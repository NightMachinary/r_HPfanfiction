I'm looking for a HG/SS fic I read ages ago that I can't remember the name of. I thought that "For Someone Special" had bits that are definitely not in it, as I just re-read it and now I'm frothing at the mouth trying to figure out what this story was called.

What I remember: Hermione and Snape are definitely married, so I'm guessing it was a marriage law fic. Snape uses some sort of spell to change his body into other male characters while they are having sex so Hermione could experience other lovers (I thought that it was with Polyjuice, hence the confusion over "For Someone Special"). This happens rapidly during one encounter. Hermione gets sick while pregnant and Snape brews her a potion to save her life. He slices off a bit of his skin to imbue the potion with his love and their child winds up being creepily loved by everyone. They have a few kids and I think one of them finally winds up in Hufflepuff. Snape calls Hermione "My Own" as a play on "'Mione". I feel like they have some sort of telepathy. (Another reason I thought that some of these things happened in "For Someone Special")

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Googling "HG/SS" and things like "polyjuice" or "my own" has gotten me no where, but I admittedly have very poor Google-fu :\


** Sounds like Tyger Tyger by bloodcultfreud except there's no telepathy

Edit: actually the potion part is the only part that matches up with Tyger Tyger

*** Thank you! I read a whole bunch of HG/SS when I was in high school so I'm sure I may have mashed them all together into a smutty tangle of plot lines in my head.

** I know I've read this story...or at least, the part about the potion containing his flesh...but I can't remember the title or author! I remember that they had a couple kids very close together and then she gets pregnant again and is so run down that she needs the potion Snape makes that contains his flesh. Which results in their daughter, the embodiment of their love or something like. I don't remember for sure that it had the polyjuice or telepathy in it though. I will keep looking.

*** As [[/u/captainryan]] said, the potion bit is from Tyger Tyger which has apparently been removed.

The other bits may be from a different story?

*** I'm glad I'm not the only one. It's entirely possible I've mashed a bunch of stores together :\
