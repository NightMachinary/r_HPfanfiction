**** Triple quotes are a dogwhistle. One of the real ones, back before 4chan just started saying everything's a dogwhistle to troll the libs. It was used around people's names and in other contexts to signify that they were Jewish or jew-related.

***** Gonna need a source on that, because I've seen tons of people on every form of social media, from Myspace in 2006, to Tumblr/reddit/Facebook/Twitter in 2019, use it as a form of exaggerated emphasis.

Maybe it /used/ to be, but that doesnt mean it always is, or that it is now.

****** Fucking google it, it is a widely known thing. Jewish journalists and political figures often put it around their own names as a hearty “fuck you” to the anti-semites.

The only exception is that for a brief time they were used for emphasis on bird memes, and that's it.

I can now picture Luna on Wizarding Wireless with her own conspiracy show.

***** True, maybe they think that it is cruel and mean to write those stories. In my opinion, I don't care if Harry is riding a mammoth in the middle of the Sahara desert wearing woman's lingerie, I just want a explanation that makes sense. If Severus thaws, WHY. If Voldemort become good, WHY?.

I just think they need an explanation.
