So sick of seeing goblins has the super happy helpful misunderstood magical beings, who all fall over themselves because Harry shows some civility. What we need are manipulative nasty creatures that would love to get their greedy little claws into any vulnerable young wizard that they can..

Harry goes to Gringotts and has his scarcrux discovered, the goblin in charge decides its time to screw the young brat over and generally stick it to the wizarding world Harry having singed the contract fulfils the prophecy and has the ritual to “fix” the problem. The goblinsfix things the goblin way and instead of Harry having the fragment of Voldemort's soul removed and placed into a pig/doll/copy of Hogwarts a history having Harry's soul removed instead leading to a twisted and amusing timeline.

Difficult mode Harry's soul ends up in a copy of Hogwarts a History and makes its hands into a certain lonely young witch's hands and somehow ends in a Harmony pairing.

Hard mode Harry's soul ends up in in pork sausages and gets devoured by a certain red haired menace and accidentally destroying said menaces soul at the welcoming feast after scarcrux Harry gets sorted into Slytherin.

God mode A combination of the difficult and hard mode, with the goblins being the secret puppet masters behind the pure blood movement.

Bonus Points Female Harry Manipulate Dumbledore, that's working for the greater good of freeing the wiz idling world from the goblins claws Snap dying in an amusing and disgusting way


** took me like 2 rereads to understand this

for the people who are too lazy have a slightly shorter version with good grammar :

Basically goblins are massive assholes and decide to give middle finger to wizarding world by telling Harry they'll remove the horcrux from his scar but remove his soul and put it in a copy of hogwarts a history\\
Theres a Difficult Mode where the hogwarts a history book with harry's soul ends up in hermione's hands and it lead to HPHG\\
Hard Mode : Harry's soul ends up in sausages eaten by ron and ron gets his soul destroyed.\\
God Mode : Difficult + Hard + goblins are secret puppet masters behind pureblood stuff}\\
Bonus Points : Fem!Harry , Manipulative!Dumbledore(working to free wizarding world from goblins) , Snape dies in amusing and disgusting way.

** Goblins offer to get rid of the horcrux scar. Harry agrees to it because he thinks goblins are nice, misunderstood, warrior culture people. Goblins just kill him, which destroys the horcrux. No more Potter's left. Goblins get the Potter gold.
