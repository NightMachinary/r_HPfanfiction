There is a significant portion of people who like to believe that Crouch Jr. was a Ravenclaw (which would've brought an interesting diversity amongst Death Eaters) but my headcanon is that he was a Slytherin, given the hints and bits of his personality we are shown. The difficulty of judging his personality is that he acts 3/4 of the time as someone entirely different, but there are moments where he shows his true self, and there are interesting words used to explain his behaviour.

#+begin_quote
  It hasn't been easy, Harry, guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion. I have had to use every ounce of *cunning* I possess, so that my hand would not be detectable in your success.
#+end_quote

Cunning is a well-known Slytherin trait, possibly /the/ Slytherin trait.

#+begin_quote
  He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him. I was ready. It was my dream, my greatest *ambition*, to serve him, to prove myself to him.
#+end_quote

Ambition, another trait that is recognised with Slytherins. Also, the Sorting Hat lists Harry's thirst to prove himself as a Slytherin trait (/Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, my goodness, yes --- and */a nice thirst to prove yourself*/, now that's interesting....So where shall I put you?/), something that is valid for Crouch Jr. as well since he had the thirst to prove himself, perhaps to not just Voldemort but his father as well (until he gave up given by his neglect.

Not only this, but another very noteworthy quality is resourcefulness which Crouch Jr. displayed in abundance throughout the year. He convinces Hagrid to show him dragons, tells him about Summoning Charm with nobody being the wiser, gives the clue to Cedric because he knew he would repay Harry, uses Dobby to his advantage, plants a book about Gillyweed even before the Tournament has truly begun, and many more things which shows how resourceful he was. He was also very determined in his goal to guide Harry to Voldemort, there are lots of moments where he could've stumbled like his father trying to confess everything to Dumbledore but he saw through all of that without fault.

--------------

Bonus:

I'm also convinced that Crouch Snr. was also a former Slytherin student. Just like his son, he was also very ambitious in wanting to become Minister and he didn't stop from going at it, to the point of going out of his way to humiliate his son and throw him to prison. But there is one coincidence that is repeated in the book which I really like:

#+begin_quote
  "He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,” said Sirius. “He's a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical - and /power-hungry/. Oh never a Voldemort supporter,” he said, reading the look on Harry's face
#+end_quote

Power-hungry... this is the second time this word has been used. The first time was by the Sorting Hat, while describing Salazar Slytherin himself - /And power-hungry Slytherin loved those of great ambition./

--------------

I know this is a bit of a stretch, going by few words thrown in the middle, but I genuinely like the idea that Crouch family members were traditionally Slytherins. It would make the house a lot more interesting by having someone who absoutely detests Dark Wizards and someone who wants to become one so dearly. Not only this but this could also explain how Crouch Jr. chose to become a Death Eater, he would've been at Hogwarts from 1973 to 1979 (Sirius mentions that he was 19 when imprisoned in 1981) which would've had a popularity for Voldemort at an all-time high, with recruitment offers going around, and Crouch Jr. could've gotten influenced by the wrong sort, coupled with his neglect playing a part.


** The sorting hat sorts students based on the qualities they value, not the qualities they have, otherwise you wouldn't have Crabbe and Goyle in Slytherin, or Hermione/Peter/Percy in Gryffindor.

Also, you make the assumption that people stick to the qualities that are their strongest at age 11 for the rest of their lives - they do not. If you were to resort them at 16 or 17, the majority of them would go to Slytherin, because, let's face it, what teenager isn't ambitious?

** I think they were Slytherins, too.

The problem with this breakdown is that all of this fits Albus Dumbledore and, to an extent, Gilderoy Lockhart. Hermione was cunning and ambitious and, at times, ruthless. Percy is ambitious and could be called power-hungry. The twins are resourceful and ambitious.

*** That's the problem with the sorting. You can't convince me that if you're sorted into anything but Slytherin that you don't have an ambition to do something, or an ounce of cunning. It's a mixed bag if traits. Humans aren't archetypes.

***** Am I supposed to think that Crabbe and Goyle value cunning and ambition, even at 12?

People definitely ascribe too much influence to the Sorting, IMO - particularly for the background characters. It's probably a mix of what people value, what they are, and where they want to go - but people make it /way/ too homogeneous.

I'm of the opinion that the hat puts the biggest bigots there because that's what Salazar would want, he did after all put a murderous snake in the school to kill all the muggleborns

******* Neither of their fathers seem to be particularly caring of ambition or cunning.

Instead, it's (to me at least) clearly bigotry and heritage that got them into Slytherin. Basically, I think people play up the traits a bit too much, and play down a lot of the other aspects that would go into the Sorting.

** Wow, it's insane that I thought he was canonically a Ravenclaw. I never even thought about it, just took it for granted. Somehow, I can't imagine him in any other colors though??? It sounds shallow, but the reason I can't really consider him in another house is that I always imagine him in blue, and I think green doesn't fit him at all.

But ok, I could see him as a Slytherin, if Crouch Sr. was a Slythrin as well (but only then).

Though since people have traits from several different houses, I might as well ascribe unknown House headcanons by colors lol

** Barty Crouch Jr was a Hufflepuff. That's my interpretation, and I'm sticking with it.

But then again, I also maintain that the vainglorious attention seeking character of Gilderoy Lockhart makes him ideal as a Gryffindor.

** I disagree. At a glance, any house could potentially fit, as he has qualities from all four. But first, we can probably rule out Hufflepuff, because although he was loyal, a Hufflepuff going dark is rare enough to have been noteworthy. I believe we can potentially rule out Slytherin as well, thanks to his father. Barty Sr. was highly ambitious and probably was a Slytherin himself. Though it's only lightly touched upon, Barty Sr. was at best neglectful, and I don't believe that Barty Jr. would have wanted to be anything like him. Also, Sirius was highly unsympathetic to Slytherins thanks to his own family, yet was sympathetic toward Barty. Gryffindor I can find little against, but for the following reasons, I'm sticking with Ravenclaw:

- He successfully manipulated a highly powerful magical object without incident. That took both power and brains. He knew enough to flawlessly pass himself off as a highly celebrated and successful Auror for a full school year. Everything Moody could do, Barty did, and Moody had decades more experience than Barty at this point, and had been unable to cast for twelve or thirteen years.
- He learned about and imitated that Auror without even Dumbledore, a close friend, noticing until the very last minute. - And, frankly, this was more plot convenience than anything else. He gave believable responses, recalled everything Moody would have known, performed all of the same magic. He was so accomplished at this, that when the real Moody actually appears, the change is seamless, not only to the reader but to the other characters. Moody needs no introduction of his own.
- Both non-verbal magic and transfiguration (particularly of the human kind) are tricky. He combined both at least twice, again, without incident.
- He had to brew a continuous supply of Polyjuice, which is fairly complex. He was probably the most competent of the Death Eaters in general, all considered.
- Everything he did and said held two or more meanings.
- He gained twelve OWLs - two more than Hermione.
- He clearly valued education. He was an exceptional teacher, educating his students well, despite the plan. Dean Thomas informed Umbridge that they "still learned loads from him". Some think it's down to playing the part, but can you really imagine the real Moody being so comprehensive?
- Even Voldemort, not at all known for compliments, considered him intelligent: "Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement." He would have won if Voldemort hadn't managed to screw up and let Harry escape from the Graveyard. It was only a last minute improvisation combined with the dead body of a student in front of him that made Dumbledore suspicious.
- And speaking of Dumbledore, Barty was the only character in any official material ever to outsmart him. Grindelwald manipulated his emotions, not his mind.

I realise that members of other houses can be smart, but all things considered, I think Ravenclaw is quite a clear front-runner.

So Ravenclaw. Hatstool, perhaps. But Ravenclaw.
