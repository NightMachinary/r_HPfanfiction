  Harry Potter sacrificed everything for the world and it all amounted to nothing. Now in his final moments will Destiny take pity on an old man without hope? Fate had her turn. Now it's time for Destiny to show everyone how it's done right. Will you try again Harry Potter? Will you save them all or let history repeat itself?
