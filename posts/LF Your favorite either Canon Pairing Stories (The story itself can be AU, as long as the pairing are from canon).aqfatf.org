I'm in the mood for some canon compliant stories, can be AU; as long as the pairing is from canon.

The ones I'm looking for the most are: Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, or Bill/Fleur stories. The story can have one, two or all three pairings, or just one or two pairings in it.

No super powerful or super smart Harry, Harry smarter or more powerful than he was; from canon, is fine but make it believable.

No Character bashing, please.

Other than that I don't care what else the story has in it. The story itself can be incredly AU; as long the pairing is from canon.

If anyone knows of any really good Molly/Arthur stories, I'd like some of those as well, please.

If you have any other canon pairing stories that you like, feel free to recommend them as well.

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] by DianeCastle. All three canon pairings, covers the full seven years, and shows the relationships building up much better than in canon, IMHO.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), if you accept him as Harry.

If not, my pick is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929).

Both fics are totally hilarious.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...
