Hey, I need fanfiction recs about anyone really except drarry or dramione. I love marauder work and black family work. I just finished All the Young dudes and love it.


** linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies) --. Remus and Sirius during the 12 years in Azkaban. The ending is very Grant/Sirius/Remus and I loved it.

The following are stories from authors I adore that focus on Black Family stories. So any of their works are worth reading.

linkao3(Practical Applications of Arithmancy by JanuaryGrey) linkao3(They're Hiding Inside Me by TheDivineComedian) linkao3(The Dog Days of Summer by Marie Kavanagh)

If you want more romance focussed Wolfstar then linkao3(Dress Up in You by MsKingBean89) linkao3(Text Talk by Merlywhirls)

  Sirius is in Azkaban and Remus, for want of a better option, is getting on with his life. Sirius can only remember the worst parts of his life and Remus can only continue trying to live his, but eventually their separate threads must collide.*complete* (at last!)

  Sirius knew there would be consequences for taking Muggle Studies rather than Arithmancy like his parents wanted. His father always had a way of driving the point home though.

#+begin_quote
  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  Kate Heightmeyer sees Atlantis from a different perspective. She is the voice of reason behind the daily chaos, the note of stability amongst the cacophony of crisis. Kate's story intertwines her life pre-Atlantis with her experience as the resident psychologist, witnessing her fellow women's triumphs and insecurities, sharing in their victories and defeats, in the little moments that build the Atlantis mission into what it is.

  Sirius Black and James Potter are successful and famous tattoo artists. Their manager Lily insists they hire a piercer to cover their busy schedules, and Sirius does not approve of that idea even slightly.This fic is now completed, but there's still sequel action going on at Marauder Ink 2: Black and Grey(if you think there's a tag missing/something I've overlooked, please get in touch - either comments or on tumblr (jennandblitz) and I can update things!)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
