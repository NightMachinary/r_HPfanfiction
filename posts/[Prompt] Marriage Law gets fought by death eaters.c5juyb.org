I'm not trying to whitewash the death eaters, as they're the magical version of Nazis, but marriage laws were considered too extreme for them.

So I want a response where they fight it, but are still blatantly evil.


** I could totally see Draco being absolutely disgusted that he is legally obligated to "fornicate with a mudblood", and his parents fighting such a law tooth and nail, to save their son from such an indignity. No doubt many Death Eaters would be against such a law, essentially doing the right thing for the wrong reason.

What I really don't get is, why don't some of the Death Eaters in the Ministry take a page out of the Nazi handbook, like, one more on top of all the other pages they've already taken, and incentivise procreation with tax breaks? Like, all mothers who have at least two sons and at least two daughters attending Hogwarts are excused from paying certain taxes forever, and any mother who manages to fill an entire classroom by herself gets an Order of Merlin?

*** "Harry Potter and the Incentivized Childbirth"

"Harry Potter and the Wealthy Tax Breaks"

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Commerce"

I'd read a fic like what you described only because effective, realistic politics are cool.

Plus I love the parallels to Nazis.

*** I would say for 2 reasons :

1) From what we saw, the Magical World seem to have a kind of gender equality, with women in position of power. It can be argued that the women in power did this at the price of a family, but the same could also be said for the men (I see absolutely no indication that Flitwick, Snape, Dumbledore or Scrimgeour had any family). In this society, women would see this kind of incentives as being treated like broodmare, which they would probably dislike a lot (the only big family we see are the Weasleys after all, and their reputation is not the kind any Death Eater would want)

2) The Death Eater were not in place long enough. At the end of the war, the Death Eater in power for 10 months, and most of that time had been spent "cleaning" the country from its traitors and its mudbloods. If Voldemort had won the war and stabilised his power, maybe this kind of incentives would have made their apparation after some times. The Nazi had controled Germany for 6 years when they started the 2nd WW after all.

** They would hate a marriage law

They would have to marry dirty fucking mudbloods

That's like asking a Klansman to marry a blackwoman

** The thing about marriage laws is that death eaters are constantly put with “good” people, making this kind of story easy enough

*** I thought about having actual Nazis fight it in the prompt, just so the people who read them on this subreddit get the analogy.

** Since this is already being treated as a discussion thread:

Nazi Germany did have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reich_Bride_Schools][wife schools]], which might have been intended as a precursor to a marriage law. In fact I have no idea where people got the opinion that Nazi's would hate the idea of a marriage law: They may have hated being forced to marry Jews or Slavs. But that'd be about it. The concept itself wouldn't be abhorrent to them. Their goal was a highly centralised, an efficient state, and "some" 'living space'. All atrocities aside, not necessarily evil.

*** They had legislation for certain races not intermarrying, but they never did that. Although thanks for the link. It's interesting.

Would they eventually? Maybe. I'd have to look at how much the regime infringed on the rights of its citizens. Did they? No.

Still Marriage Law fics are stupid because not even the most authoritative government has dared try it.
