So I've been thinking. Dumbledore says quite a bit of goofy stuff to lighten the mood but I call bullshit on some of that.

[[http://media.gizmodo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1933.jpg][Here is a map of the London Underground.]] and it's just too damn complicated. I believe he was LYING when he said that he had a /perfect/ scar of it. The map is so condensed that in order for it to be perfect and not overlap it would need to be a giant scar - easily covering most of his leg. On top of that HOW would he even get the scar? Who carves a map of the Underground onto somebody? And why did it scar? Dumbledore is an extremely intelligent wizard and it is extremely unlikely that he doesn't know even the most basic healing spell.

So, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore has been exposed as a liar which is just one step short from a Dark Lord. Also think about what he had in his possession at the time of that lie. The Invisibility Cloak! And what is the symbol for the cloak? A triangle! Dear readers, I believe that this is a subconscious confession that Dumbledore is actually the leader of the Illuminati! Why not just a regular member, you ask? Because remember what the other Deathly Hallow in his possession is? The wand which is represented by a stick WHICH TURNS THE ORIGINAL TRIANGLE INTO TWO TRIANGLES SIGNIFYING THAT HE IS THE RICKIEST RICK.

*Kurama out.*


** Maybe he got a magic tattoo of a self-updating map of the london underground and then when he had the tattoo removed only then did they realize there was a slight allergic reaction to the tattoo so now he has a self-updating scar but it's so detailed you need a magnifying glass otherwise it just looks like a normal scar.

Now now, my boy, you can't obviously be accusing me- I mean, the esteemed Headmaster Dumbledore- of being a Dark Lord or anything like that, are you?

Why don't you have a Lemon Drop and think rationally? I'll be performing some diagnostic charms dangerously close to your head, and you may hear me utter 'Obliviate' and 'Imperio' a few times, but I just say those when I'm nervous.
