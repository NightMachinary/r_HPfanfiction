Hi, I'm looking for fics belonging to genres that you wouldn't expect from the fandom. A pretty good example of what I'm looking for is Unatoned, a murder mystery with a very strong film noir vibe. Do you know any fics that belong to unusal genres like this?


** "Murder most Horrid" might fit your request. AU, with Bellatrix as an auror investigating crimes.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** I'm not sure if either of these are quite what you're looking for, but both have rather unusual vibes for fanfic.

Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus is absurdist. Like, it's humor, but somehow not really at all in the same way that most humor fics are.

Without Rose the Thorn is very AU, and somehow quite beautiful. I don't know how'd classify the genre. It's coming of age I guess, but with a feel that I don't think I've seen in canon before.

  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

  A bittersweet coming-of-age story for fans of good writing. Lily died, and left James to raise a stranger's son alone. In the shadows of Azkaban, Harry learns from Dementors and Death Eaters, while in the caverns of the sea a mysterious power awaits the chance to steal his soul. Warnings inside.

** linkffn(Lost Hope by Adari) has a modernist tone and vibe that remind me a bit of Pynchon's.

  The plan was perfect. The execution was even better...but they all forgot to consult the Sorting Hat who had its own views. After all, what can you expect from the hat which contains all four founders?
