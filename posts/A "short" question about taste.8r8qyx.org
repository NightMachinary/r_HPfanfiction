Any of y'all remember The Magic Treehouse books? Who else thought they were the shit?

I did too, but unless I get kids, I wouldn't insist binge reading them to my peers. Not anymore at least.

It's a revelation that I realized after reading a sequel to a story and seeing it shat all over in some comments, that we all have a difference in literary maturity. By that, I mean we seem to have a saturation point when we read one too many stories with X cliche to where we get tired of X cliche and then look at all other stories with X cliche unfavorably. There was a time when I got a kick out of ridiculously overprivledged and overpowered "Lord Potter of six noble houses and currently taking over the seventh". Until I didn't.

I see this a ton with the anime fanfiction communities, where I would get caught up in epic stories, only to find that better ones exist /in droves/ and that this story isn't written well for.... Whatever that means.

I felt this most significantly with certain stories that seem well written. As in. They are leaps and bounds over the rest of the churning masses of fics. Then I realize that "oh wait, this hook I ate up years ago doesn't actually make sense anymore.... Why did I like this again?"

Thinking about it, I know it is a mess of different tastes and the arguments thereof, but I'm also realizing that it has to do with literary understanding and maturity. I liked stories that shot Snape full of holes that calling the deconstruction swiss cheese was too high of a compliment. Until I realized that /well written characters/ have a level of nuance to them. Then I saw deconstructions like that as too-narrow minded and unwilling to adapt after the initial deconstruction. It is why bashing no longer works for me because it is so 2 dimensional compared to the level of depth the rest of the cast is being developed.

I find it often in the General Recs threads where a popular story is suggested and re-suggested that has repeatedly been admonished by older - or lurking - users who either have a */much */ larger fanfiction repitoire than the suggestee or they're simply repeating criticism they saw somewhere else. It happens to where a story you like suddenly sours when someone points out a faux pas that in hindsight seems too obvious to miss.

It is *vexing*.

Then I realize that it isn't limited to fanfiction. My entire taste in books goes the same way. I used to gobble up Rick Riordian series until I predicted a twist in chapter 32 in something he said in chapter 2. It turned me off, until I picked up Tamora Pierce. Now that was the shit. Until someone gave me Angels and Demons. Then I got hooked onto Dan Brown.

Entirely different genres, but the transition from the YA novels to someing for older readers is giving me whiplash. Now I'm unfairly expecting my fanfiction by people who are not getting paid to do this for a living to be up to snuff to authors who have shelled out top charting epic after epic. This isn't right, yet it happened anyway.

I've seen this portrayed in snarky threads like "seven cycles of a Harry Potter fanfiction reader" of which one of the eponymous phases boils down to writing it yourself because no one else does it right. I hit that phase years ago, and I still haven't divested myself of that unrealistic dream.

It is vexing! I want to like your stories! I understand that you probably poured blood, sweat, and a dragon's heart into your stories, but for goodness sake, I cannot stomach your <insert trope/critical literary failing here>. Along the same lines, I loved your stories! They were the bees knees until I realized that I had somehow developed a bee allergy simply by looking at better insects.

How do y'all reconcile this.....mood? Is there a name for it, or do I just need to go pick up a "real book" and go bury my head in it? Or am I making a mountain out of a molehill? What is fanfiction! What is life!?

Warrgh!


** The more reading you consume, the bigger critic you are.

As long as you can still find stories to read it is ok to be picky. But if literally everything you try makes you angry for not being excellent, then you have fallen deep into an elitist view.

Growing up I loved reading the canon Harry Potter stories, but I would definitely be loath to read one now.

** To put it crudely, your taste has been deflowered by the shaft of... nope, I'm stopping this metaphor.

Basically you want better things as you grow to understand better things are available. Look forwards, the past is a killing field for your inner critic.

I cycle through fandoms, genres and even media types pretty much constantly. Coming back 'starved' lowers my expectations considerably.

Also at this point you've probably read all the most accessible material that can easily catch your attention. Now is the moment to start going outside your comfort zone and try tropes you wouldn't have considered before.

** Sorry you lost me when you said you liked Dan Brown novels, now I cannot comprehend anything you say. (JK)

Seriously though this is normal, in particular you get burned out on certain tropes, especially when the majority of writers don't do them well. (Hadrian Potter as an example). There are plenty of stories I enjoyed but when I went back later couldn't stomach my way through anymore.

** That's pretty normal, I'd say. Taste changes. And stories change as well - a series gets stale or takes a turn you don't like, or you get bored and simply want something new. Sometimes, it's a combination of both. That's the same for fanfiction as well as novel and tv series.

** You should try taking a break from FF or switching fandoms. Not too long, just a day or two, maybe three if you're in a really funky mood. It's like eating. Don't stuff yourself. Eat until you're comfortable, and then wait until you're hungry again.
