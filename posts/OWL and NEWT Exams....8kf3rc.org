Are the OWL and NEWT exams based on real exams that the UK has, or is it something Jo made up?


** At the end of your fifth year in secondary school you sit GCSE exams. At the end of your seventh, or your second in sixth form then you sit A-levels or equivalent. They line up with real exams for the same age if that answers your question.

*** Someone Rowling's age would've sat O Levels - formally known as Ordinary Levels (as distinct from Advanced, "A" Levels). The distinction between Ordinary Level exams and Ordinary Wizarding Level is not huge. And those of us who took our A Levels back in the days before AS and continuous assessment can confirm that the end-of-two-years exams on which the results hung were, indeed, Nastily Exhausting.

**** Absolutely this - it's based on O and A levels as done back in the day, but does still sort of equate to GCSE and A levels now in England and Wales.

Exams are a bit different in layout in Scotland now, but would have been O levels still in JK's day.

** I always thought the OWLs were like the GCSEs and the NEWTs like the A-Levels and therefore based on the real exams in the UK.

** As the other posters have mentioned, O and A Levels are the likely basis and closest analogue we have in the real world to OWLs and NEWTs.

That being said, I feel as though fans are too quick to compare the grading systems, i.e. O=A, E=B, and so on.

(cue off-topic rant)

There's a reason (beyond whimsical, tongue-in-cheek worldbuilding) that the grades are given adjectives like "Dreadful", or "Acceptable". I'd suggest that the boundaries are far wider and less distinct than we give them credit.

An above-average piece of work can still be considered "acceptable" rather than actually "exceeding expectations", for example. Satisfying all objectives in a given task might earn you a B rather than a C, but actually going beyond what is expected of you is often considered the domain of a straight-A student. Then you have the "Outstanding" mark, which I believe is much, much rarer than one might imagine.

*** I'd agree with this. That's how I see the system working.

I studied briefly in England. Post-secondary, but still. At that school, there were four markings: Fail, Pass, Pass with Merit, and Pass with Distinction. A Fail was any score up to 50, a Pass was 50-60, a Pass with Merit was 60-70, and a Pass with Distinction was 70+. The highest mark I remember one of my classmates getting was an 85. The highest I got was a 75 (I think). Scores in the high 80s or 90s --- I'm not actually sure if scores could go higher than 100 or not --- were supposedly at the level of doctoral students or professors. That's where I'd put the "Outstandings". Certainly a far cry from my schooling in America where it was fairly common for a reasonably competent student to get 100s on assignments.

**** That's at university level. As someone who's been through the whole secondary education system (currently at uni), it's very different. If I remember right, it was roughly 90% for an A*, 80% for an A, 70% for a B, 60% for a C, and so on at A-Level (16-18) and GCSE. Assignments are graded a bit differently in the UK, it's true, but the grading system at uni where a 70 is good and a 90 is nearly publishable is a far cry from secondary level schooling.

***** This is fair, although the boundaries fluctuate over the years. I sat my GCSEs eleven years ago (fuck, I'm old...) and the Higher Tier Maths papers we took had the boundary for an A set at 61. 80/70/60 for As, Bs, and Cs at A-Level was pretty standard, though. In any case, the current system is a poor match where OWLs and NEWTs are concerned.

***** Heh it's quite different in Scotland. Scotland varies a bit by the actual course, so a 50% in English is a C, but a 50% in Music or something would probably be a fail.

B's were around 60%, A's were 70%+. we don't have anything above an A, like an A* or whatever, other than personal gratification lol.

That's for highers though, no idea what Advanced Highers are like as I never took them. Standard Grades/National 4/5 = GSCE's taken from around 14-16, Highers = 1 year of study, A level equivalent, 5 needed to get into university typically. (I have never understood why people in England take 2 years to do A levels, when people in Scotland do the equivalent in 1. Obviously people in England aren't stupid, far from it, so it seems like perhaps the government simply doesn't want people to get to university too early?) Advanced Highers, taken after highers, 1 year, more respected than an A level. It's on the same level as a HNC if you know what that is.

Lots of people in Scotland don't bother with Advanced Highers though since you can go straight to university when you're 17, or take a gap year. I knew a guy who did but he did it solely to get into Oxford. (He got in)

In Scotland we don't have the sixth form distinction, all secondary schools go 6 years. (So we do have sixth form but it's not a choice, it's more of a choice to leave education than stay lol. You need to opt out)

** The main difference between them is that when wizarding students select their OWL subjects (by selecting electives) they are increasing the number of subjects they study, whereas in the Muggle world it's the opposite way around. You study lots of subjects Year 1-3 (aka Years 7-9), then drop many of them at the start of Year 4 (aka Year 10), keeping around 10.
