** All but the last part sounds like linkffn(Who Dares Wins by OlegGunnarsson).

Edit: re-read your post and it seems my choice might only be sort of like it. Otherwise maybe you are mixing two stories together.

#+begin_quote
  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.
