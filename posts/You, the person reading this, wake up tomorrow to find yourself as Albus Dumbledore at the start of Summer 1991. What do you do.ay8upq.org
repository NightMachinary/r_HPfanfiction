** "Minerva, I am /not Albus/. I have no idea how I came to be in his mind and body - until yesterday I was a retired lawyer in another universe entirely - but I came in to this situation with a very detailed knowledge of how the next seven years of history are going to go and the mistakes Albus would have made culminating in his death by misadventure some six years from now at a time of terrible, terrible crisis. Over the next few hours I shall write down as much of that future history as I humanly can and entrust it to you, so if Albus comes back he will have the benefit of it. If I am here permanently, I shall need as full a briefing as you can manage on the administrative situation of the school and the political situation of magical Britain, and we shall commence to /plan/. At some point in all of this I will need to learn some basic magic."

I will then spend the next few years bluffing and bullshitting to convince everyone that The Mighty Albus Dumbledore is still as potent as ever while building a cabal of competent wizards and witches to Get Shit Done behind the scenes.

**** About the only magical thing I could think of to do would be to find a suitable candidate to arm-wrestle me for the Elder Wand to ensure it's in the hands of someone who's going to fight. Harry would be a good choice, I think.

With a contingency plan to destroy the wretched thing if they fall to someone on the other side, and in the meantime it's kept secure somewhere a wizard would never think to even look for it. Like, I dunno, in a locked box in a self-storage locker in Carlisle or similar.

Other than that, I'm nicking Filch's Kwikspell collection and getting my study on. I know I'll have time, because I /guarantee/ I'm better at admin and legal work than Dumbledore: he only ever had a secondary school education in unrelated disciplines, I have postgraduate qualifications directly on point. Do what I'm good at, delegate what I'm not.

And hope that nobody notices that Dumbledore has gone back to dressing the way he did in Fantastic Beasts, because loud robes? Fuck /that/ noise.

** Great prompt! First thing I do is eat a lemon drop, of course. My immediate priorities are the destruction of the Horcruxes, as the biggest advantage of my Self-Insert knowledge^{TM} is being able to bypass the hunt for them. Voldemort's destruction is my goal.

​

Some assumptions:

- I am sent back to June 21st, 1991. This is, according to [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/timeline/character-timelines/harry-potter-timeline/][this webpage]], two days before Harry visits the zoo with the Dursleys.

​

* Task I: Retrieve Harry from the Dursleys
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: task-i-retrieve-harry-from-the-dursleys
  :END:
Firstly, I ask Molly Weasley if she would be alright with looking after the Boy-Who-Lived for the summer, as I have recently determined his current guardians are unsuited for him.

As I, the Muggle typing this, have no idea how to perform the various spells, I should spend some time brushing up on how they work. I will most likely abuse House Elf powers to do this, by asking Hogwarts' elves to retrieve the necessary reference material and have them refresh my memory on any critical points.

As Harry has yet to go to the zoo and be punished for setting the snake on Dudley, I will travel to the Dursleys' as soon as I can, and introduce Harry to the world of magic personally. My grandfatherly persona and sheer magical power should be sufficient to cow the Dursleys into ensuring I can take Harry away. I should have enough of a grasp of basic spells at this point to get by.

I will then take Harry to meet the Weasleys. They, as a Pureblood, but not bigoted, family will provide an excellent primer to the magical world for Harry. He can spend the summer with them, while I am off saving the Wizarding World.

​

* Task II: Clear Sirius Black's Name
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: task-ii-clear-sirius-blacks-name
  :END:
While at the Burrow dropping Harry off, I can ask to see Percy's rat (maybe bring it up in conversation somehow), and using my 'wise old wizard's eye', declare that this is an Animagus, though quietly, such as not to cause the children, nor Peter himself, any cause for alarm. If I can perform the Animagus-reversing spell, I can do that myself, otherwise I'll travel straight to the Ministry and get Amelia Bones or another trusted Ministry employee to do it. Questioning Peter should reveal the truth of what happened on Halloween 1981, and thus be sufficient to clear Sirius' name.

​

* Task III: Begin the Destruction of the Horcruxes
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: task-iii-begin-the-destruction-of-the-horcruxes
  :END:
To assist me, I would enlist the services of Alastor Moody. Due to his paranoid nature, I would reveal straight away that I am not in fact Albus Dumbledore, but a future do-gooder in his body. Ideally, I could provide some measure of proof here, and he would agree to work with me. I will do the same with Severus Snape, as he also has a useful set of skills. If they were unwilling to work with me, I'd have to find other competent member of the Order of the Phoenix to assist me. However, I will assume they do agree to help from here on.

The easiest Horcrux to reach is no doubt Ravenclaw's Diadem. I will endeavour to locate it in the Room of Requirement, but leave it there, as it's safe enough until I have a way to destroy the others. To do so, I will order a small quantity of Basilisk venom, which I will drip onto the Sword of Gryffindor's blade.

Next Gaunt Shack. Ideally, I could burn the entire shack down using Fiendfyre, but given that Dumbledore did not do that OTL, I'm going to assume there are sufficient wards protecting it. Hence, I will work in concert with Moody and Snape to bring down the protections and retrieve the ring. Ideally, the presence of two other wizards and sufficient warning should prevent anyone from getting cursed.

Lastly, the locket. Sirius' release from Azkaban will enable me to access Grimmauld Place (assuming Sirius feels grateful for his release), and retrieve the locket. Letting Kreacher know I will destroy the locket should be sufficient to assure his loyalty, though I would advise Sirius to either order the elf never to follow the orders of Bellatrix or Narcissa, or just free him, as the elf hasn't witnessed anything secret yet.

​

* Task IV: Typing up Some Loose Ends
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: task-iv-typing-up-some-loose-ends
  :END:
Ideally, Peter has been locked securely away in Azkaban at this point. If I was writing this story, I would probably have him escape en-route to the prison, just to add some excitement. The other Death Eater which has been hiding in Great Britain for all these years is Barty Crouch Jr. I will inform Amelia Bones or whoever about this, and thus travel to Crouch's residence and confront the father about it. I'll try to reach a compromise on this, as Crouch is a valuable ally, and I wouldn't want to see him incarcerated, but Crouch Jr. needs to be secured properly.

I will also launch some investigations into the various Death Eaters who used the Imperius Defence, and see if I can lock a few away. Ideally, the Dark Mark requires consent to be applied and so you could pick apart the Imperius Defence this way, but I think that's a fanon invention, so I wouldn't rely on it. Hopefully, some stupider ones have been involved in various crimes and I can catch them that way.

The goal of this segment is to erode as much of Voldemort's power base as possible.

​

* Task V: Destruction of the Remaining Horcruxes
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: task-v-destruction-of-the-remaining-horcruxes
  :END:
Ideally, I will have acquired some political capital by putting away former Death Eaters, maybe even to the point where Lucius Malfoy himself wants to strike a deal. I will do everything I can to acquire the Diary this way, as I wouldn't mind allowing a few former Death Eaters to walk free for a few more years in order to get the Diary early. In a similar vein, I will try to access Bellatrix's Gringotts vault legally as well, probably by using Sirius' relationship to her.

This concludes my collection of Horcruxes, and so I will destroy them all. All that remains is the one inside of Harry. Fanon is rife with alternative ways of destroying it, from Goblin cleansing rituals to exorcisms, to physically cutting his skull off, and the like. I am going to assume that the only way to remove the Horcrux with Harry's survival is the way done in the books, i.e. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse at him after being reborn via Harry's blood.

* Task V: Confronting Voldemort
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: task-v-confronting-voldemort
  :END:
Hopefully this all hasn't taken more than a couple of months. I will then travel to where Quirrel is currently, likely venturing through the forests of Albania. If he remains free from Voldemort's clutches, I will travel with him, until we reach the Dark Lord, otherwise our confrontation happens right away. My goal in this is to do as much damage to the spirit of Voldemort as I can, to force him to stay on the run and recuperate for as long as possible. Saving Quirrel's skin is a bonus as well. I will have done as much research into spells targeting spirits as I can ahead of time, as well as Voldemort is nowhere near full power at this point, so victory should be relatively assured.

* Task VI: The Wait
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: task-vi-the-wait
  :END:
With Voldemort neutralized for the time being, I return to Britain to watch over Harry's school days. The Philospher's Stone is not kept at Hogwarts, and the Diary is destroyed, so the Chamber of Secrets remains sealed. Sirius Black has been cleared, so he doesn't need to escape, and ideally Harry can live with him during the summers, as the lessened threat from Voldemort and his followers means the full strength of the enchantments around the Dursleys is not required. Fourth year, there's no Barty Crouch to muck up the Triwizard Tournament, so Voldemort does not return and start a reign of terror, so Harry's schooling should go relatively peacefully.

Throughout this, I will aim to keep an eye out for any rumours of Voldemort's presence, and attempt to chase him down should I learn of him making any moves in his spirit form. He lacks all of his canonical allies, so I wouldn't worry too much.

Once Harry has reached adulthood, I will reveal to him the true nature of his scar, and the only way I can see to destroy it, i.e. the convoluted sequence of events we see in canon. I will have done a great deal of research on alternative methods of destruction, so if a method has been found, ideally we'll do that. Otherwise, we play the reaction game, putting down Voldemort should he pop up anywhere. Constant Vigilance, in essence.

​

In my mind, this simply delays Voldemort's rise some, rather than completely destroying him, but I think by pushing it back until after Harry has reached adulthood, it makes him much stronger when eventually having to face down Voldemort. Plus, I'll still be around to lend a hand. These are just my thoughts though, based on goodness knows how many fix fics I've read, while trying to stay as canon-compliant as I can.

**** I would say the benefit outweighs the risk; Snape is a powerful wizard and an accomplished Potions Master, having him on my side when attempting to destroy the Horcruxes is essential. I don't want to risk him coming to the realization that something is wrong on his own and acting against me, so I would let him know that I'm now in control, and we still share the same goal, the destruction of Voldemort. This is useful, as Snape isn't really loyal to Dumbledore as a person, but has attached himself to Dumbledore's primary objective of destroying Voldemort due to his hatred of the man. I think my future knowledge would provide enough of an assurance to him that I'm able to take the Dark Lord down.

2. Get Sirius out of Azkaban and cleared. Then get him some professional help. 2a. Get Peter Pettigrew brought to justice.

3. Gather all the objects that are Horcruxes. Destroy somewhere- Fiendyre? May need to postpone until after #5.

4. Relegate Snape to some other Potions-related tasks. That man should NOT be teaching.

5. Kill the damn basilisk. This is a school, not the murderous reptile house!

Also, this may explain why 1) Albus never did anything and 2) why the teachers were not proactive. If I'm Dumbledore, clearly I use all of my influence to prevent other people from doing anything. It also explains why his plans are so crazy. I have my horrible memory filling in plot points. By the time the Goblet comes around, I've completely forgotten key parts of the book.

** I'd start with delving into magical law to see about getting Sirius a trial. Yeah, like a decade late, but I'll be damned if I let an innocent man sit with a life sentence. Next, move Harry to the Tonks residence. I'm not gonna bullshit about "blood of the mother" protecting him. If anything, James was ready to stand and fight for his son /and/ wife.

In his first year, no damn stone....or if I do have to keep it somewhere in the castle, it's gonna be in my office. Following that, proper magic lessons. None of that "power of love" crap. Yes, he'll get a chance to be a kid, but he's also gonna learn to defend himself. He's in a school with the children of Death Eaters and he needs to defend himself.

Next up, we're dealing with that Chamber of Secrets bullshit the moment the Dueling Club reveals he's a Parselmouth. I'm not letting students get paralyzed just to be a jackass.....and also bring Ginny into my office to talk about a rather dangerous diary.

Year 3: Ask Ron about how his familiar is...or pet, whatever word is used for the animal companion the kids can have. If he mentions it's not doing so well, I'll mention I know a guy that can make his rat better, but I'll need to borrow it for a little while. At that point, de-Animagus him, Full Body-Bind Jinx and a nice Floo call to Amelia Bones later and he's sitting in Azkaban while Sirius still gets to walk around free...since I already freed him before Harry started school...or by the start of Harry's second year.

Fourth Year: Talk "Alastor's" ear off for about an hour. As he goes for the flask with Polyjuice, Accio and Full Body-Bind Jinx. Another call to Amelia, an investigation into Crouch Sr., and no Tom Riddle 2: Electric Boogaloo.

Year 5: Yeah, Umbridge is teaching History of Magic and I'm gonna let Sirius take a crack at Defense. Can't be any worse than Lockhart....actually, might be better because he, y'know, grew up around that stuff. No duel at the Department because I would have taken Harry over the summer to hear the prophecy in full and kept up with training and pairing them with history of Tom Riddle lessons.

Sixth Year: Horace takes over as Potions Professor and Snape is officially fired. By this point, I've probably gotten enough complaints from 5 years worth of student and a lot of alumni that didn't go into a very prestigious field of magic. As for the new Defense teacher, if I can't find anyone, I'll take over teaching. I'm bored enough and the students need to know how to defend themselves. Plus, horcrux hunting with Harry on the weekends....or he can go to Hogsmeade while I plot locations.

Year 7: Horcrux hunt starts up in full! Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville join me in hunting down some dangerous magical artefacts every other weekend. I mean, they still deserve to have some time off and enjoy their last year at Hogwarts before they have to become adults.

....I feel like I solved every problem Dumbledore could have ever had in the series just with some forethought and advanced knowledge....or just common sense.

** Wait til school starts, Capture Pettigrew to save Sirius from Azkaban.

Other than that, keep things close to canon, except making sure that Sirius and Harry return to the Dursleys for a few weeks every year to keep the Lily's protection active. SInce I don't have his knowledge, I have to assume that keeping it strong at the Dursleys was imperative towards keeping Harry's protection against Voldemort Strong, and thus tethered Harry to life as long as it was Voldemort who tried to kill him.

A few things I'd try to do is find a way to retire from the Wizengamot and ICW position, while finding adequate replacements in people that I can trust, but I think it would prove difficult as the Ministry is pretty corrupt, and it was all Dumbledore could do to keep it from completely falling to the pureblood families.

I'd also do my best to research Horcruxes further, do everything I can to find information about the destruction and possible extraction of souls from Horcruxes.

Finding none, I'd still have the backup plan of canon, which still ends up with Harry being literally marked for death by a maniacal magical terrorist and surviving, which is what original Dumbledore was trying to accomplish and did end up accomplishing anyways.

I'd try to prevent as many deaths as possible.

I'd get as many Horcruxes as I can, and quiz Harry a bit on how I might have found them, and try to guide him on honing his instincts.

And I wouldn't fucking die.

I'd get Snape a therapist year 1.

and that's about it.

- incarcerate Quirrelmort (drought of the living death)

- fire Snape, Binns, Filch, Trelawney. McGonagall is no longer Head of House or Transfigurations teacher, she needs to focus on her job as deputy head. If she wants to she can offer some Seminars for advanced OWL or NEWT students.

- Hogwarts is closed for the Semester for lack of essential Staff

- clean up Hogwarts (remove dangerous objects from Come and Go room, deal with the Basilisk, change curriculum, hire curse breakers for DADA curse and other surprises hidden in the school)

- brush up on my magic (I don't believe in dualism so I'd expect to have most of Dumbledore's skills)

- free Sirius

- after freeing Sirius make the point that Azkaban is not reliable to contain the most dangerous Death Eaters. They need to be re-sentenced to the veil.

- kill a rat or deliver him to the DMLE

- get rid of Fudge. If there's no real dirt on him, create some.

- arrange accidents for Death Eaters in government and elsewhere

- destroy all the Horcruxes

- find a way to replicate the mystical circumstances that allowed Harry to survive an AK and destroy the Horcrux, or spend my innumerable resources (intelligence, wisdom, magical prowess, political capital) to find another solution

- find a new home for Harry

- re-open Hogwarts 1992. Everyone lives happily ever after... also try to make amends for getting sister killed instead of waffling about my own guilt.

** Step 0: Write down steps just in case you disappear suddenly

Step 1: Don True Cloak of Invisibility

Step 2: Acquire Ravenclaw's Diadem - the horcrux is the closest available and a simple AK should clear out the soul fragment without damaging any potential mind augmenting enchantments; if successful, don Diadem

Step 3: Acquire Resurrection Stone: Fiendfyre the Gaunt Shack; the Stone will not be harmed while any curses will be destroyed along with the Horcrux

Step 4: Don Resurrection Stone, become Master of Death: as the ring mounting has likely been destroyed swallowing the stone seems most efficacious

Step 5: Acquire Time Turner: Contrive a pretense to visit the Ministry of Magic if necessary, otherwise use True Cloak of Invisibility to bypass all detection mechanisms and proceed to the Department of Mysteries

Step 6: Asynchronous Logic: Become Omnipotent

Step 7: Find Plan Detailing best way to Fiendfyre Malfoy Manor left by my Future Self: Execute Plan

Step 8: Fiendfyre 12 Grimauld Place

Step 9: Help out Harry: Subtle Memory Charms seem most prudent to modify Dursley behavior, but my super intelligence and acausal logic may suggest a more efficacious plan, may include talking with Harry and either using acausal plan to get rid of Horcrux off the bat or simply a way to make him happier, encourage Harry to get sorted into Hufflepuff for maximum joy

Step 10: Start Wheels of Justice for Sirius: mid-long term goal can probably be started fairly easily by suggesting to Cornelius Fudge that he can appear a paragon of justice by ensuring that all past Death Eaters get full proper trial; may include covert removal of Delores Umbridge via Memory Charm or Fiendfyre

Step 11: Try and make Sorcerer's Stone plot unfold: shouldn't be too hard as there won't be many visible signs that anything is different, once Quirrlemort is in the school trap him using spirit/possession circles ie Seal of Solomon or simple temporal based freezing

Step 12: All Horcruxes save Harry's are dealt with, use Harry's time at Hogwarts to explore alternatives to his death using acausal logic, if no alternative is found ensure that the time until he turns 17 is spent as happily as possible then Fiendfyre him and the trapped spirit of Voldemort

Step 13: Reform Magical Britain: a few careful assassinations and Memory Charms will start pushing towards better integration of Muggleborns and rights for sentient non-humans

Step 14: Whatever you want: as the Omnipotent and Undying godhead of a magical people you can do whatever you want, including simply retiring to a nice little cottage in the English Countryside and taking it easy for the next century or two

Well... no one ever said that I'd have to be a good guy, did they?

Cast the Imperius curse on the Flamels, force them to tell me exactly how to obtain the Elixir of Life. Destroy the Diadem horcrux. Free Sirius, cast the Imperius curse on the Lestranges so that they brain themselves inside Azkaban. Obtain the Chalice horcrux using any means necessary. Destroy the remaining horcruxes without being stupid about it.

Cast the same curse on Lucius Malfoy, have him surrender the Diary to me, before having him kill Fudge in a very public setting. Let him get killed by Aurors and Hit Wizards in his escape.

Become Minister of Magic.

** Assuming it lasts longer than just the 1 year and I'm Dumbledore up to his death. Absolutely nothing different from canon Dumbledore until 5th year, aside from trying to find a way of removing the horcrux in Harry, at which point I gather and destroy all the horcruxes aside from Nagini, I task Snape with finding a chance to kill her, post Weasley bite but not long after since I don't want to dissuade Voldemort from doing the Sirius prophecy plan, and then if I found a way to remove the horcrux in Harry do it, if not duel Voldemort at the ministry like canon, hit Harry with a killing curse when Voldemort possesses him, worst case scenario it only destroys the horcrux and not Voldemort as well but if it doesn't that can be swiftly rectified.

Playing it safe with this cuz of the butterfly effect. No changes too early for fear of them spiralling out of control. Only early on change I can think of I might do is tell Snape before year 1 starts to gain Harry's trust and be sorta a mentor to him in order to get Voldemort to trust Snape more, Snape can give him more info on Harry than anyone else and if Voldemort trusts Snape more than he can get closer to the snake.

** Playing this as a strictly canon game, I don't have Dumbledore's memories or magical skills. I will be taken for an impostor by anyone with more sense than Hagrid, and maybe him, too. Also, Hogwarts is nearly empty, but I don't actually know who stays for the summer. In fact, at best, I have only a vague idea of its layout, so not only will I give myself away the minute I step out of Dumbledore's office/apartment, I don't actually know how to find McGonagall or Snape easily. I also don't have fanon characterizations of people like Amelia Bones to rely on, so I can pretty much only trust known Order members to not get in the way.

With all this in mind, I think it might actually be most efficient to wander around the castle until I see someone and then ask to speak to Snape. Snape can use Legilimency to learn of my knowledge of the books, then verify it by retrieving Ravenclaw's diadem from the Room of Requirement. This may complicate things for me personally, but he can then set things in motion to get rid of Voldemort and (probably) get Harry out of an abusive home. I would also tell anyone who will listen that Sirius Black was innocent and never received a trial, since Snape might just bury that.

The one complication is if Quirrell is in the castle already, but he wasn't possessed until after the Gringotts break-in. (He shook Harry's hand in the Leaky Cauldron without burning.) So I can probably divert him with some Dumbledore-ism or other.

And by “crux foundation” I mean, create a crux in a temporary container, like a Shiny rock, storing 1/2 o' my soul away. Create another in a Shiny ring for 1/4. Create Another in a Mithril or-whatever ring that has already been bound to me for 1/8. Do so only after binding myself into a Magical Oath that will stop existing just as soon as I “Don't make any more” and “reabsorb the 1/2 piece”.

Now I, personally, have 5/8 of a soul, that's enough. 1/4 is in a temporary ring and 1/8 in a permanent ring I'll be keeping with me. That brings the total I have On me to 3/4, which is even better. Get the 1/4 piece, which is bound via an oath, to possess an Obliviated wizard, and split again, into two 1/8s. Split Again one of them into two 1/16s.

Bind 1/8 into a Shiny rock that'll become a part of a ward stone for a very specific house on the ilse of man. Fidileo! Bind one of the 1/16s into a normal, non-wheat American penny, put a notice-me-not and an unbrakable ward (charm?) on it, powered by the crux, and let it go into circulation. Never going to see that again. Bind the other 1/16 to a piece of PVC, notice-me-not, unbrakable, and attach it to the next probe I know is leaving the solar system.

Now, I have 5/8 of a soul in myself, 1/8 in a ring that I can't lose that can channel magic if mine is bound, bringing my total to 3/4 of the total, I lose 1/4 of my power, but out of my new power, if bound, I can still access 1/6 of it, which is fair. Also, I have 5/8 of my soul to myself, two 1/4 peices and two 1/16 pieces, for four crux's and five total. A stable base for a lasting shape, a pyramid. Immutable, Immortal, Eternal. And STABLE. Ment to last forever. The North is my corner, my ring, always with me. The East is fickle, fleeting, and gone in a moment like the darkness at the sight of the sun; my penny, always missing. The South is a stable base, under the feet of the cross, a home to return to; my ward stone. And the West is inevitable, like the setting sun; my pvc ball, not likely to see anything as large as a speck of dust in a billion years...

The 1/4 pieces are North and South. The 1/16s are East and West. And 5/8 is in the center.

** I had to sit back and think about this for a bit. I think the reality is that I wake up as Dumbledore and have a bit of a fit. I imagine I'd begin with an identity crisis, and I would probably never be quite sure if I was Dumbledore or me ever again. Once I'd calmed down and taken stock of my surroundings I would need to find a confidant, likely McGonagall and Snape, and we would need to assemble a team that would make the Order of the Phoenix look like a farm league. Presumably, there are other great witches and wizards in the world who would have a vested interest in putting Voldemort away.

My knowledge of magic is narrow and focused primarily on a mixture of beginner spells and obscure Dark Arts as explained to a teenager. I might have some of Albus's muscle memory, but I don't have the depth or breadth of his understanding or his century of experience. Voldemort is glued to the back of one of my employee's heads, I have no good way to reveal it without endangering people, and I lack any practical knowledge of legilimency or occlumency to protect my mind should he or anyone else try to take a peak inside.

I also can't presume that I know better than Dumbledore on any number of things. If Dumbledore thinks the only way to keep Harry safe is to leave him with his horrible relatives with a Squib neighbor to keep an eye on him, I have to assume that's the pragmatic decision.

What I do have is foreknowledge. I know Voldemort's plans, I know who will go running back to him, I know about Pettigrew, I know the what and where of every Horcrux.

I am no longer the asset Dumbledore was, but if we can act on my knowledge, we can probably put this Voldemort matter to rest in a couple of years. The easy parts are catching Pettigrew and rounding up the Horcruxes. The harder part is keeping me a secret long enough to find a way to kill or contain Voldemort and break the chunk of Voldemort's soul off of Harry.

While we're doing that, I'm going to learn as much practical magic as I can because I'm only going to be able to keep this act up for so long. Once the team has dealt with Voldemort and saved Harry, Dumbledore is going to retire and basically go into hiding to avoid being locked up in St. Mungo's, and I'd like my final years to be comfortable. Also, as soon as I know we're good, I'm snapping the Elder Wand and losing the stone.
