** Something I was thinking about the other day, in a corona house arrest delirium: Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape use a Black family dark ritual to summon a champion to defeat Y-K-H, after McGonagall checks on 10 yo Harry and finds him weak, under nourished and underwhelming. A self insert shows up, but here's the kicker: Death is pissed off with the Headmaster trying to uncover the secrets of the Invisibility Cloak, and half way through the trip between universes, asks the SI to kill Dumbes. The SI suggests to make him/her a MoD and for some reason, Lord Peverell. With all the book knowledge and power, The MoD will make the Headmaster pretty much a useless bystander in the war, which will kill the manipulative git (maybe not actually, but that's the argument swaying Death). Also the summoning cannot be resisted, so they are in effect kidnappers. For the greater good.

** Do something with Grindelwald. Very few good stories feature him as a character and I feel like there is so much potential wasted here.

If you want to start writing new fanfic then I recommend some more unusual parings if you plan on writing something that has romance. Be more adventurous than the 2.4k Harry/Hermione, 2.3k Harry/Ginny, 5.4k Draco/Harry or 1.1k Harry/Snape fanfics. (That only includes those who are marked as a paring in the preview on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]]) Try something more, well maybe not out there, but something not completely overdone. (Something along the lines of Harry/Luna or Harry/Katie. Even a well written Harry/Fleur or Harry/Daphne as well as a character-based Harry/Pansy might get you a lot of readers for the pairing alone.)

Writing things that involve other schools also might be interesting. Change up the Triwizard tournament so that, for example, instead of Durmstrang we see Ilvermony competing, or something like that. Problem with these kinds of stories is that it requires a lot of OC's, which might cause a lot of people to overlook your story, no matter how good it is.

*** Even more important, try something else than pure romance. Did all you do in the high school was contemplating how to get into girl's knickers/get a boy into yours? If not, why do you think heroes of HP universe in the middle of the raising civil war did? Or do your story post-war. Just bring up some interesting new plot and write about it.

**** Yeah, romance shouldn't be the main plot drive. That makes both the story seem unrealistic and the plot seem unimportant. That's why most novels being sold feature some form of MacGuffin.

** Post-Hogwarts.

The increased availability of cell phones and security cameras is making it harder and harder to maintain the Statute of Secrecy. Then one day, while digging through some shelves at the back of the library, Hermione knocks a book off the shelf. When she goes to pick it up and put it back, she notices a moving image inside the cover, and some [[https://youtu.be/eSnAY95yN-s][eerie music]] starts to play...

TL;DR: HP/Myst crossover

** - Dudley Dursley vows to destroy Lord Voldemort, because Voldemort is bullying Potter and only Dudley gets to do that.

- Ron teaches Luna how to play chess

- Ginny invites Luna to stay over at the Burrow following the events of /Order of the Phoenix./ Shortly after she arrives, it becomes abundantly clear this is Luna's first sleepover

Unfortunately, the discussion there got completely side-tracked into stupid Hinny/Harmony discussion, but I would still like to see somebody to write it.

** I love slashfics but these ideas are a bit more general so you can decide to write relationships or not.

1.  A day in the life of 20 year old Tom Riddle. (40s music vibes, Tom being done with everyone and everything admiring Dumbledore because he defeated Grindelwald a year prior, travelling and Pureblood parties)

2.  Charlie Weasley and his friends getting Rons letter about Norbert and how they fly to Scotland to pick up that Dragon

3.  Bill Weasley at work as a curse breaker basically Grave robbing (Maybe Tomb Raider style)

4.  Sherlock x HP crossover. Percy Weasley works for the Ministry in all Muggle related things. He meets Mycroft Holmes.

5.  A fic about Sirius' aunt who wanted to legalize Muggle hunting. (I want this super elegant/proper, rich, entitled pureblood witch with a rather rare Hobby. And I want her to be all casual about it. Basically a female Hannibal Lecter)

6.  Draco Malfoy Time travels to the Marauders Area and befriends Sirius Black!/Or Draco Malfoy time travels to the marauders era but is a bit older. He gets put in Slytherin and has to deal with his father in the same house.

7.  After Sirius falls through the veil he ends up in the Marvel universe and befriends Loki (A marauder and the god of Mischief? They'd wreck havoc) and/or Tony Stark. I can see them getting along.

8.  Generally a Sirius Black & Draco Malfoy friendship

9.  Instead of being branded with the dark Mark before his 6th year, Draco gets bitten by Greyback as a punishment for his fathers failure in the Department of Mysteries. (Remember in canon in the books Harry, Hermione and Ron stalk Draco when he is in Borgin and Burkes and he shows Borgain something on his arm and refers to Greyback as a friend if his family. We never know what he shows him and he looked pretty thin and ill during the year)

10. Following around the Hog's Head's usual clientele. Vampires, Werewolves, Wizards not unlike Mundungus and all the other mysterious hooded people in there.

11. Harry Potter & Viktor Krum are in contact post-war

** *Harry is immortal and teaches History of Magic at Hogwarts*

- Main Plot Prompt is History repeats itself
- Harry is born during the 14th or 15th Century. HE IS NOT A VAMPIRE
- Everything on the books happened but during the 14th or 15th Century
- Ron and Hermione are reincarnated (both will have completely different names. Ron's reincarnation will still be a Weasley and Hermione's reincarnation will be a half-blood)
- Harry will not be reincarnated, of course, but the new version of Harry will be a distant relative of the older Harry. Same hair, the eyes will be your choice. (My guess will be Dudley's many great-grandsons or it can be your choice)
- Dumbledore will recruit the older Harry to be the new History of Magic and a member of the Order of the Phoenix during 5th year. Harry will banish Professor Binns (his favorite professor during his time at Hogwarts)
- The older Harry will become the new Harry's mentor

** - AU where Harry goes overseas to settle in the USA, because the wizarding press was getting too extra.

- After Hogwarts is rebuilt, Hermione, Ron, and Harry's proposed overhaul of the Hogwarts castle, and the house system.

- The war is over, and Harry is freaking tired. It suddenly hits him that he's just turned 17, doesn't have to fuck with school anymore, and that pretty much anything he asks for, they're going to grant him with a minimum of fuss. He's still sick of the public eye, but he does need some things sorted. What does he ask for?
