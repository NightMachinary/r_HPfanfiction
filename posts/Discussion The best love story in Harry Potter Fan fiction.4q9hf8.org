This is a very difficult thing to put down into words. I want to hear what you guys believe is the best harry potter Fan fiction based around two characters falling in love. What makes that story the best? Is it fluffy and cute? Or a rollercoaster of emotion ending in a firework display of pure unadulterated love?.


** For romance, I prefer some sort of path or struggle before the two characters end up with each other. I really like experiencing rollercoasters of emotion and wondering if the two characters will or won't end up with each other.

This is the correct answer. Disscussion over.

One of the best love stories I have ever read, FanFiction or otherwise. Rowling should take notes from this author.

** My favorite is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][TURN by Saras_Girl]]. It is recommended a lot as being one of the best HP/DM fics, but I would also say it is a great and very creative love story. The premise is that due to some "it's a wonderful life" type magic, Harry gets to live for awhile in the AU he would have had if he had apologized to Draco after the sectumsempra incident. Pretty much everything is better for him in that life (his career and his relationship with Draco certainly), but his kids who he loves so much don't exist. After that glimpse, he has to go back to his regular life with Ginny and make some hard decisions about his marriage and his career. And, maybe try to cultivate a relationship with Draco.

What makes it such a great love story is that after the "glimpse," Harry knows that he and real-life Draco could have had a great love but this Draco doesn't know that and Harry has to tread so lightly in his pursuit of a relationship with him. As the reader, you are rooting for them so hard because you already know how great it could be.

** Disclaimer: I read very few outright romance fics.

I'll start by saying I've never actually read a good fic where the predominant genre is romance. Sure, I've seen the recs for linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) and linkffn(Grow Young With Me) but even both of those fics fall under the territory of "enough fluff to make me throw up."

I'm sure there are other fics that have requisite drama and don't constraint themselves to typical shipping tropes. Linkffn(Unlike A Sister) is the only one that immediately comes to mind, but even that eschews all other plot points in favor of Harry and Hermione's forbidden tango.

What I would look for is a fic that is based on romance but uses the relationship to explore a larger problem. It could be anything from adjusting to a post-Voldemort world or the struggles of keeping together a Wealsey-PTSD family or rebuilding the Ministry in the aftermath of a coup. While some fics incorporate those points, an overwhelmingly large majority of fics are focused on resolving the ship.

Yes, they might have elements of rebuilding the Ministry or Hogwarts or trying to put the pieces back together of a family, but the overriding focus always seems to be "How are X/Y going to get together" or "How are X/Y going to stay together" or "How will X/Y get over Y/Z's relationship."

Before this gets to ranty, a good love/romance fic isn't necessarily about the romance between two characters. It's usually about two people finding romance while overcoming other external factors, not two people using romance to overcome external factors.

**** I've written a couple stories that I think could probably be contenders:

the first one is called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11164549/1/Bill-Fleur-s-Excellent-Honeymoon][Bill and Fleur's Excellent Honeymoon]]. It explores their relationship (and their honeymoon) as well as some adventures they get into along the way as they navigate what it means to be husband and wife.

I won a judge's pick on my story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11334833/1/Snape-s-Last-Request][Snape's Last Request]] which also has romance but is tied to a mystery and the making of the Polyjuice potion.

Then there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11518403/1/A-Knowing-Heart][A Knowing Heart]], which is a Harry/Luna story I wrote for a friend.

I wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11730076/1/A-Thousand-and-One-First-Dates][A Thousand And One First Dates]] for the OTP respect round of the QLFC last year and received a 10/10 on it. I'm not really a huge fan of James/Lily romance stories either way, so it was a challenge to write it, but I think I did a pretty good job.

Finally, I wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11895918/1/A-Taste-of-Fire-and-Ash][A Taste of Fire and Ash]] for my Grindledore-favoring friend.

I pretty much write any pairing, though Severus/adult-Hermione is my favorite.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

** I don't think there's such a thing as the best love story, specifically because fanfic of the shipping variety is so fiercely tied to love for or identification with a particular character or pairing. You may swear by the most beautifully written and persuasive Harry/Ginny or Harry/Draco fic in the world, and it will probably fail to hold my interest. It's not the author's fault. Fanfic tastes are stubbornly personal, sometimes downright irrational.

I don't have much appetite for fluff, or much patience with it. For shipfic, I like my heart to be broken on the way to having it healed. I like imperfect unions. I like obsession and conflicted feelings and passion that persists against the character's will.

I adore Snape/Harry. Those of you who hate the pairing might as well stop reading right here.

Probably my favorite romance fic in all of HP (which feels truer than calling it "the best," while knowing some people would despise it for the pairing alone):

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032][Rapture]] by mia_ugly linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032]])

This is a much beloved fic in Snape/Harry fandom, and the comments are a testament to the writer's ability to sweep them into another world. Readers cry over this story and remember it for years.

To demonstrate how different one's ideas of romance might be, here's another Snarry fic I consider romantic, even though the love story is more of a means by which Snape is able to reclaim himself. It presents Harry as gay and entirely at ease with himself, while Snape is a cross-dresser (but not for kink purposes; it's sadder and more complex than that), has almost given up magic, and is paralyzed by self-loathing. It's a poignant story and an allegory of coming out, of learning not to be ashamed of who you are. Harry is marvelous and warm in this fic, and Snape is poignant and fascinating and worn to the bone.

** Basically anything Jeconais writes tbh. I also read a fic very recently called linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) which as far as I can tell is basically the best harry/fleur centric fic on the internet. As for the all time best romance? Vox Corporis is definitely up there, I can't think of a better one off the top of my head.

** Hermione Granger and the Crystal of Time is one of my all-time favorites. Hermione (33) and Severus Snape (54) (Wizards don't crack) have an awesome murder mystery. Look for it on Fanfiction.net.

The Beggar-Thief starring Hermione and Draco and Scorpius and ...Aliens? Super duper awesome. I don't think it's a crossover it just has aliens and they do NOT come in peace. Look on Fanfiction.net.

*** I preferred /Those Gilded Chains We Wear/ for the way it handled falling in love with someone who is severely mentally ill. It was intense, and messy, and evocative. /Time Heals All Wounds/ was good, but I felt it got sloppy at times with the writing quality, and I didn't like it as much. Probably have to read it again to figure out exactly what bothered me about it.

High five on the Bellamione rec though.

** I hate fluffy. I have never read a very good love story in fanfiction, yes, sometimes there are interesting romances, and the only good quality is that they end in a display of pure unadulterated love, as you said. This is the same quality as cheap novels you can buy on a holiday to read and not think at all. And there are some stories that keep repeating how this is the one big pure love and they would do anything for one another, bla bla bla. Those stories are the worst, I think.
