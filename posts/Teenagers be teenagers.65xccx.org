Harry's school years are normal(er). He's popular, his dorm mates are his best mates, girlfriends, Quidditch, making trouble, drinking, outside Hogwarts activities, (maaaybe some smut) has fun. Riddle can be already dead, or not.

(My personal requests but don't have to go by them if you have a particular story in mind that other people may like:

-I'm not fond of HarryxGinny -No Slash -Harry is wealthy -More humour than drama)


** You might find more of this if you scroll through next gen stories, you might have to endure the idea of a Harry/Ginny pairing but it's far more likely to have teenage dramas being the source of conflict rather than a dark lord

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.

  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.

** In the claw of the raven series Riddle is as active as in canon, but harry is a studious Ravenclaw and ignores the attempted theft of the philosophers stone and reports the basilisk to the proper authorities. The fic contains pure-blood culture and Harry doesn't drink and dates around, but he voluntary enters a bethrothal contract in fourth year and likes his fiance. He spends most of his free time studying or with his friends and they do play a couple pranks. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Claw of the Raven) linkffn(Harry Potter at the Knees of the Marauders' ) linkffn(Harry Potter and the Interlude) linkffn(Harry Potter with the Power the Dark Lord Knows Not)

  After a summer spent attending Quidditch World Cup games and tutoring sessions, Harry returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year of schooling with plans to study hard, have fun, play Quidditch and become an animagus. Too bad there's a Tournament that gets in the way. The fourth (and final) part in my series, 'Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven'.
