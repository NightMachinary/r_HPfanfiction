So, I made a Harry Potter character who goes to Hogwarts in 2019, and is the daughter of a successful Pureblood (mixed, not totally pure) Auror from a long line of Blood Traitors. She's also the daughter of a Squib born to the Pureblood Trevers family (a family of high standing that supported You-Know-Who in the First Wizarding War)

Her mother, Jeane, was born in 1989, 9 years after Harry Potter was born. She wasn't discovered to be a Squib until in her teens, and her family immediately disowned her, and her sister Heathra, who pitied her.

Her older brother, Nolan, was born in 1979 and was groomed to be a pureblood supremacist (who would eventually go on to be a Death Eater in the Second Wizarding War).

So, I just need ideas: what do you think life would've been like for a Squib child growing up in a family like this during this time? (Before she was revealed as a Squib, but still suspected to be one).


** I think the moment the child didn't get a letter she'd be dumped into an orphanage and she might have been obliviated on top of it. So, orphanage or foster homes until adulthood.
