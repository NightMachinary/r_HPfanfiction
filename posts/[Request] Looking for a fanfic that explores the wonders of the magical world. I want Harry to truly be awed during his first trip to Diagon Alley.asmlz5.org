I've been a bit down recently and just want a fic that shows me, even if it's fictional, that there's still a wonderful and fantastical world out there to be explored.

I don't want a fic where Harry inherits half of Britain, I want one where he sees witches casting advanced charms+transfiguration spells to make an umbrella made out of ice crystals to escape from the rain. I want Harry to experience wizards showing off their latest enchanted watch and the newest spell they learned that turns their arm into stone.

I want vivid descriptors of Hogwarts and its grounds. Besides the lake, whomping willow, greenhouses, and Hagrid's shack, not much else is mentioned.

The Harry Potter universe allows our imagination to run wild but rarely is that ever explored in fanfiction without it delving into overused cliches and tropes. If anyone has any fics to share, I'd much appreciate it thank you!


** I don't really have a fic coming to mind where Harry is awed by the basic magical things. But in Linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) he goes much deeper into the world of magic together with Dumbledore. Goes to different magical cultures and learns a lot of new things. Fic starts in fourth year and the exploring is mostly done after the Triwizard Tournament ends. Interesting use of magic and a lot of different cultures around the world are visited.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
