:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello! I am very new at this so I'm sorry is this just sounds like random rambling. I have tried posting to Ao3 for help finding this fic, but have gotten no results. Someone told me to try on here and see if anyone knew the work I was talking about.

I believe the work was a Lily/Severus fic where Severus went back in time after he died? He came back right before the “mudblood” incident, like literally just before he said the words, and he eventually got together with Lily. Years later when he and Lily have a son (maybe named Sebastian? I'm not sure), his mother is babysitting the son while Severus and Lily are out, when Voldie comes to kill the son (the prophecy is still a thing) and Sev's mother dies instead of Lily, making Sev and Lily's son the boy who lived, and Severus and Lily get to raise their son.

Some other details I remember was sev changing his appearance, sev throwing his father out of their house, and for some reason people selling trinkets to others proclaiming the trinkets to protect them, and lily and sev saying how ridiculous it was.

Any help would be much appreciated! I really loved the fic and wanted to read it again!


** I definitely remember reading this fic a few years back but unfortunately I don't remember the name. Do you remember how long it was? or any other main characters? It was on FFN right?

*** I think it was a bit longer of a fic. I believe the marauders were also in the fic, as well as either marleen or someone else whom James ends up marrying and having Harry. I think it was on ao3 but I could be wrong...

** Possibly linkffn(the peace not promised)? I bailed on it too early to say whether there's a kid involved, but it sounds close in other ways

*** No, definitely not that one. It goes back to six months /after/ their breakup.

(It's also my favorite of the similar fics I've come across. Come Once Again and Love Me has great prose and good handling of the attempted-murder-by-werewolf incident, but leans more heavily into Severus' misanthropy; nothing wrong with that, but I prefer Peace Not Promised which more heavily emphasises his devotion, and is much longer, watching their relationship grow. I started Severus Snape and the Art of War, but a Severus and Lily who hang out together swearing and smoking stolen cigarettes just isn't the vibe I'm after.)

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.
