I am doing a staged reading of erotica soon with some friends and I wanted to do a Harry Potter fanfiction out of my own personal preference. However, I want to make the readers of it bust a gut laughing while they hear it. I'm perfectly OK with smut (It is supposed to be erotica!) but my priority is the funniest, most outrageous reading possible. Would anyone have any suggestions on a fanfic that I could use?

Sorry if there are any formatting issues, I'm on mobile.


** Does it have to be intentionally outrageous, or can it be something that's written seriously, but is just such an absurd self-insert power fantasy that it's ridiculous?

*** Honestly the chapters are infinitely too long. Humour fics work much better with short sharp chapters. I only got through the first 3 or 4 chapters, and they should be about 1/4 as long as they are.

** I'd go another way. Salon_Kitty wrote a few very good, mostly Luna-centric fics on adult-fanfiction.org (though the website has an outage atm). Notably Mad Snorkacks & Englishmen, where Luna is Harry's sub while the trio is on the run and [this one](members.adult-fanfiction.org/profile.php?no=1296851847), which features a reluctant Luna being gang(raped) in the first chapter. What makes this somewhat weird is that, well everything is somewhat weird when you're in Luna's head, apparently even gang-rape and being Harry's bitch. Oh, and there's a couple of scenes in there with things like multiple polyjuiced people, pegging Harry, stuff like that, should be a hoot!
