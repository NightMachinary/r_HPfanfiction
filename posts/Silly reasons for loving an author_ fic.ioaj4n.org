Does anyone have any silly reasons they decided to read everything by an author or love them. For me it would be britishisms. It feels right to me when the characters use british slag or the spelling is british.

Also shout out to VonPelt who became one of my favourite authors just because they put the small village where I live as a place that tonks lives in one of their fics. Idk why but the fact they they used somewhere other than London or other big cities made me happy more so that it was my home


** Love to be mentioned here, especially for such a detail I have probably spent way too much time to research it. I assume you live in Kent then?

** I like Sen Lin Yu because she writes heavily psychological fics and after reading a fic of hers where she wrote about terminal illness in a respectful and intriguing way I've always given her fics a go.

Also annerb because she wrote The Changeling. She could scrawl a plot down on a napkin and yeah, I'd check it out.

** For me it was the pretentiousness of pure blood culture and the extreme that Ellory took it to. I loved it, in all its pretentious glory and proceeded to devour everything written by them; Then went on a rabbit hole search on random websites that weren't the ‚Äúnormal route of Fic posting‚Äù that had stuff/PDFs just scattered across. Didn't matter what the pairing was, be it fem! SS and JP(it made s e n s e in the Fic) to Lucius Malfoy and lily Evans. It was all so very good
