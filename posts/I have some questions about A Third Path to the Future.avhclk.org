So I just started reading it and I'm really not liking this Harry. Here are some examples:

#+begin_quote
  And he bowed in a slightly formal manner towards the blonde woman, not bothering to remove the baby from his head as he seemed to be stuck there by some force. As she came closer he took a moment to assess her, and very purposefully bit his tongue. In his opinion she was a MILF but he wasn't going to comment on it out loud. Even after five years alone in this place he had slightly more sense than that. Not a lot more sense, but some. Now if she turns out not to be married to any of the blokes behind her that'll be a different story.*

And another:

#+begin_quote
  "Just a little flame freeze charm, my friend. After all," he said sententiously "secondhand smoke is bad for babies." Johnny growled a little and the green eyed man shrugged. "Sorry chum, but I've got a thing against blond pretty boys and unfortunately you look like their poster child. This will be the first of many pranks, I warn you."
#+end_quote

And finally:

#+begin_quote
  "So what's your power, Mrs. Richards?" said Harry. Before Susan could answer Johnny spoke up "Oh, she can turn invisible and she can project these invisible shields of various sizes too." Harry stopped in space, staring at her in horror. "My God in heaven, that's the most terrifying power I've ever heard of." The others all looked at him in shock. Secretly all three of the men had felt that Susan was a bit of a wallflower in comparison to their own abilities, though Reed, at least, knew it was not so much because of her power, but because of her personality. "Why in the world does that terrify you when my face doesn't even shock ya?" Ben asked, half joking, half seriously. "She can turn invisible," Harry said calmly. "Do you have any idea the number of pranks she could pull on you if she wanted to? Trust me, I'm speaking from experience." "Well, my wife isn't exactly much for pranks," Reed said with Susan nodding in agreement. She wasn't, but the thought did have some appeal. The next time Johnny left her with his laundry or brought home a date who spent the night without first telling her, he would be in for a shock. Or if Ben broke any more of her plates. And if she ever woke up again with Reed having secretly gone off to his laboratory without telling her or at least kissing her goodbye, just wait.... Both Reed and Johnny suddenly felt a bit of the chill go up their back.*
#+end_quote

So is he always like this? There's going mad with lonliness then there's just mentally regressing into a teenager. The first thing he thinks when seeing the Invisible Woman is "Woah, what a MILF," and he's more concerned with pranks than anything. Please tell me he's not like this for the rest of the fic. It's like 1,500,000 words so I I'd rather quit now than sink in hours on a fic I'll never grow to like. The first chapter isn't that great honestly as it has the whole Greater Good Dumbledore shtick but it probably improves. My only issue is Harry.


** He's just a little nutz at that time in the story, literally 5 years with no one to talk to on top of mental trauma of being Harry Potter does not lead to keeping sanity intact very easily.

** If I remember well he's more serious later. But he's still on for pranks. And it's not there yet (but in this or next chapter) but his fight against Voldemort is also AU so it won't be usual useless Harry.

** From what I remember, there is a significant improvement after the first several chapters. His personality definitely changes.

He also gets something of a harem though, so.. fair warning.
