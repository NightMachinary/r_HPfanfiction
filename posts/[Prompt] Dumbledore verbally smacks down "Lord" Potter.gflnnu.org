We've all seen the fic where Harry suddenly becomes a lord of a billion houses and becomes this awful, pretentious person.

Write a response where Dumbledore admonishes Harry, rightfully comparing him to Voldemort or calls him a moron.

** Why would he do this? It serves no purpose other than pushing the "Harry (Lord Hadrian)" you're parodying further into his billion houses. That's literally the first thing "Dumb-as-a-door" does in these types of fics.

*** It's sad that if I ever read one, I root for Dumbledore.

But an articulate, reasonable Dumbledore dealing with a petulant child. No saying "For the greater good, m'boy."

Also, making fun of Lordships is great. Glorifying nobility is disgusting, and Dumbledore calling a 14 year old "My Lord." is annoying and completely contrary to his character, yet it happens every fic.

**** ''harry, while I am impressed you traced your lineage back to discover your nobility, I really wish you had done your due diligence and discovered that a decade after the statue of secrery was ennacted at the conclave of wizards, all wizarding families decided to abandon the muggle titles of nobility and give up any titles they held, ironically given your new friendship with draco malfoy, that it was his ancestor that pushed for the abandonment of muggle titles'

**** Dumbledore is a political figure in canon and especially in fics like this. The "My Lord" is only A. Harry flexing on him, at worst, B. showing a change in the power dynamic or C. Dumbledore doing what Dumbledore's do best (Throw shade).

Glorifying nobility? Never, its always used (Hyperbole) as a convenient power boost or to shit on the pureblood culture by using their rules against them.

And there's nothing wrong in liking nobility, understanding the social economics of it is one thing that shit is bunk, but the pauper to prince story is captivating to many and there's a reason why the trope has stayed for so long through literature.

***** These fics often do glorify nobility - yes, it's used as a convenient power boost, but if it's not examined? If it's presented as a /good/ thing that Harry got all that power just by virtue of being born into the right family? Or, as they often do, if the purebloods are presented as having a point/good, and deserving of their power (again, purely by virtue of birth)?

It's possible that you've read fics that are more critical of such a society, but that's not the default for the lord potter trope.

As for liking nobility, I'd argue that there /is/ something wrong with it. Writing a story involving them isn't wrong, but if it's presented as a good thing/uncritically, that's not exactly a positive.

****** Are you sure this "default" Lord Potter actually exists and isn't the case of extrapolation of this reddit page's complaining.

But let's say it does I still don't get how anyone could complain about how Harry shouldn't have something because of birth when literally the whole magic society we've been immersed in (Still waiting for my fucking letter, I'll even take Illvermorny at this point.) is based on an elitist fantasy. The people we care about, from birth right alone, or random chance get magical powers. Harry Potter has always been Elton level high brow British boarding school elitism. But somehow people are willing to overlook that. And that isn't the fault of the fandom that's just good ol JKR.
