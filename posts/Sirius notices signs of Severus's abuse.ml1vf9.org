The idea is that when searching for a compartment, Severus and Lily come across James and Sirius, something similar to how it must have been in canon. Except Sirius notices something in Severus that points to a life similar to the one he has lived. Maybe it's the way he carries himself, maybe it's something more obvious, like a bruise or some other mark. Basically shoving Snape and Lily in the marauders, possibly as well as or instead of the other two members. Heck, Remus's life probably wasn't too good either...


** I love the idea that Sirius would reach out to Snape as the result of a recognition that they had experienced si.ilar things in their lives. Particularly as their personality clash which would cause their animosity was likely the result of their upbringing and were coping mechanisms to cope with it and appear fine.

** Severus becomes an animagus too.

Of course he's a bat.

Nicknamed Flappy.

** omg yes. I feel like Sirius and Snape had similar lives. Only difference is that Sirius had a better personality and looks and was a bully, but that was probably because of his friendship with James. If the two could get past their past, I think they could be friends.

*** I'm pretty sure he didn't start out as a bully, more just an abused kid lashing out against those he saw as being like his asshole family. Just with the war ramping up in the background and a distinct lack of any kind of good parental figures, that lashing out turned vicious. I'd love to see Sirius running away from home to the Potter's house, only to meet Snape and his mum at the gate doing exactly the same thing.
