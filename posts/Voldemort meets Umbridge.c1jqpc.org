Say Voldemort inspects the newly conquered Ministry early in Deathly Hollows and meets Umbridge. And sees his Horcrux around her neck...


** Well I can't say this exactly happens in linkffn(The Seventh Horcrux by melindaleo), Voldemort does meet up with Umbridge (in the Ministry no less) and proceeds to deal with her in a brutal, if poignant, manner. Happens 3/4th through the fic. Also, Pre-DH fic, so different but frankly better storyline.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

** And he tries to steal it back but Umbridge annoys him with her voice so much that he just stabs the horcruxes and himself to escape forever. The power the Dark Lord knows not is literally just luck.
