So basically I want to be up in 6 hours so I can watch the league of legends championship, and I don't want to sleep, so I need some long fics to binge.

Requirements: complete or really long fics no main character slash, anything else is fine preferably some romance

other then that, everything else is fine


** The Arithmancer by White Squirrel, if you want long this one has you covered. It's also my favorite fanfic ever because it's just so masterfully crafted.

** I'm reading Benefits of old laws - Linkffn(11540013) - its 878k words, so it should see you through.

Fairly well written so far, some romance developing. Interesting premise, but I think the good robot will offer up a better precis than I can.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** California Dreamin' by jenorama is a great read, esp if you like Hinny. Annerb's The Changeling has two completed sequels and the third is one chapter away from being completed, again, Hinny from first sequel.
