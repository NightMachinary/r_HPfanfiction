Can anyone recommend more crossovers in the vein of Havoc Side of the Force? I.E. Harry lands in a new universe and, not having any idea whats going on, proceeds to accidentally the whole thing? The less clue Harry has initially the better. It doesn't have to be Star Wars either as long Harry's explorations do a good job of explaining his new world to me or a decent wiki exists.

*** I have, and it was great... but it kind of glossed over Harry's initial exploration of the Firefly universe. It's that initial wide-eyed stare at everything in confusion that I was looking for more of, and then the repeated 'wait what!?' moments like when Harry discovers that Darth Maul is precognitive mid fight.

*** But isn't Harry already established there before the actual story starts?

*** My favorites so far are Havoc side of the Force, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9068231/1/Last-Second-Savior][Last Second Savior]]. /NONE/ of them are complete as of this moment =(

***** /ahem/

There! I've edited in the links! =P

To answer your question watsonianly however, Harry was searching for ... old things if memory serves. Likely looking for remnants of Earth/Hogwarts. That and boobs. His new apprentice will happily confirm that Harry is obsessed with boobs.

********* Perk of only having read Rebellion era and later books, I have very few attachments to any of the Old Republic Jedi... In that they're all practically OCs to me.

Though... It has been interesting learning about Secura and Brood entirely via fan fiction, piecing together various snippets of backstory.

********** Everything I know of the Star Wars universe (Outside of the films) comes from KOTOR and reading bits of the wiki. These crossovers are nice as they usually explain alot of things.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8005922/1/God-s-Eye][God's eye]] by Todeswind. It's actually Dresden files x Stargate SG1, but it matches the pattern you are describing perfectly.

*** Well... I do like the Dresden Files... and it would still be /A/ Harry exploring a new world.

... I'll take it! Have an upvote.

Harry in avengers universe , long read .It's not finished and the author updates after long periods of time but other than that the fic itself is pretty good.

Looking back at it, the initial chapters with Natasha would also have been a valid example I could have used.

** I can recommend a fic with Harry jumping around saving the multiverse. It's more a parody of fanfics in general but still great. The title is something like "Dimension hopping for beginners." I might have it a bit wrong, it's been a while.
