I have never seen this come up in a britpicking discussion before but it has bothered me for years. People talk about "pranking," "prank wars" and "pranksters" in 99% of fics. I think most people think it is canon that in Harry Potter, the twins (and the Marauders before them) "play pranks."

Now, /obviously/ it is canon that the twins do stuff like bewitch snowballs to hit Quirrell in the head (or Voldemort in the face, whichever way you want to look at it) and create a collection of products that turn people into canaries and so on. It's also canon, as said by Hagrid, that the Marauders "could have given Fred and George a run for their money," so it's a fair assumption they did the same kind of stuff. So far, so good.

BUT what really, really grates on me is twofold. Firstly, the word "prank" is never used in canon. The Marauders refer to themselves as "mischief makers." Fred and George talk about "jokes." The teachers refer to both generations of annoying little twits as "troublemakers." And secondly - this is the bit I've never seen picked up on before - "Prank" is not a term widely used in the UK. We call them "practical jokes", or just "jokes," or generally categorise them as "mischief." In posher public schools they may be known as a "lark" or "ragging" (in UK universities we have "rag week" which is where students do daft things and play jokes to raise money for charity). But "prank" and "prankster" are American terms and it's getting to the point where I find it cringe every time I see Sirius Black and James Potter - wealthy, posh, English schoolboys in the 1970s, talking about a "prank war," rather than saying "let's go and rag on the Slytherins" or similar.

Am I in a minority of one on this particular Britpick?!


** It's also overused to a suffocating extreme. Everything is a prank. Harry pulls off a plot to fool Voldemort? "Wow Harry I can't believe you /pranked/ Voldemort". Time for Harry to reveal his six billion lordships in a wizengamot meeting in order to completely destroy Dumbledores plot? You'd better believe that's a /prank/. It's annoying as hell

*** Yes, absolutely agree with this.

Schools irl do not escalate into prank wars (or trick or joke wars, whatever you want to call it). The teachers don't let it, because they do not have time for that shit. They just want to do their jobs and go home. The fics where the Marauders do horrible things that affect all of Slytherin, like turning their hair into slime or whatever, and /Dumbledore gives them house points for "making us all laugh"/ absolutely grind my gears.

It's a school. Yes it's a school of magic, but the basic rules of being there to learn not to be a jackass still apply.

Part of the prank was to somehow steal the keys from the headmaster and then decorate the school overnight. so yes, prank wars exist.

***** There a difference between a last day of school prank war, and what we see in fanfictions.

I work at a school. Usually, the friday closest to June 21th, last year students comes in disguises,, we have a talent show, and they play pranks to each others.

We know about it. We let it go, we let them blow off some steam. HOWEVER we keep an extra eyes on everything, we're on high alert to make sure that nothing got out of hand.

We might act oblivious and surprised and all, but we know. Most of the time, we let them do whatever they planned, as long as it's safe and doesn't humiliate anyone.

And that is the bit so many fanfics get wrong. The "jokes" are humiliating and the teachers let it go. They absolutely wouldn't. A friendly jokey rivalry between, say, the quidditch teams being ignored or even encouraged to an extent by staff, is absolutely realistic. Harry and Ron covering the Slytherin's in slime and McG basically taking the line that "Slytherin's deserve it" is unrealistic and a really bizarre view of how teachers behave.

They also like to write "banters" that are really mean-spirited. To me, it often more mean mockery and insults than teasing and taking the piss of your friend.

I feel like they have been victim of such humiliations and insults and mockery but they internalized that it was "just jokes" and "not a big deal", ignoring how hurt they actually were by it.

And that rarely turn good later in life.

****** Yeah, but then isn't that true to cannon still? While in a perfect world you're right, hogwarts was far from perfect. Maliciousness went unpunished to a large degree and was at times perpetrated by the very professors you're saying would have shut it down. And if that holds true for canon, which it certainly does even though you could argue the degree to which it was present, I don't see why it shouldn't be extrapolated in fanfiction. There's also the fact that it is a boarding school, which means aspects of life that are usually separated from school in more conventional education settings become interwoven into the school experience.

******* Yeah I agree with all that, but there's fics where something will happen in the Great Hall such as everyone's hair turns pink, or the plates of food disappear every time someone tries to eat, or the candles turn into birds and fly around crapping on everything and this also affects the teachers. And Dumbledores reaction is to /laugh and award points for "creativity"./ That's the point where I think it gets ridiculous.

I can absolutely see Snape ignoring or quietly encouraging Draco to sabotage Hermione's work, for example. He is a mean mean man and shouldn't be a teacher. But the idea that these kind of jokes and pranks, done in front of the whole school, would win points from Dumbledore or even in some cases McGonagall is just laughable.

Teachers in general are more likely to be upset by something that causes disruption than they are by one or two people's feelings being hurt, and that's why the fics when Fred and George (or the Marauders, depending on era) are /rewarded/ for disruption of the whole school day just really set my teeth on edge.

The obvious exception is for fics where everyone is trying to make Umbridge's life hell. McGonagall would 100% have supported that shit.

******** The vast majority of instances I've seen like that in fanfics that resulted in points were either completely harmless or easily reversable by the teachers. Sure there will still be some outliers, but why is it so hard to believe that a character like Dumbledore would play along with or reward a harmless joke that provides entertainment rather than hurting people? I agree with you on Mcgonagall, but that's only because her rewarding points for something like that is so out of character, not because her position at the school makes it unbelievable.

******** I follow what your putting down here, but I think if the teachers are expecting to stop major disruptions, and in general act more as we'd expect professionals to act at a highly rated school, then making Umbridge's life hell would be stopped pretty quick. They may hate her, but I doubt they'd let her spend a week being turned into a toad. Instead, if she acted just like in book 5, then I would expect these better teachers to get rid of her through proper channels, like the board of governors, or even Dumbledore just firing her and then using 100 years of life experience to give proper evidence of her crimes and piss poor teaching.

********* They couldn't though. That's the point. The ministry had them between a rock and a hard place - Umbridge was unsackable. That's why they allowed stuff like the swamp and encouraged Peeves to go after her - they're stuck with her and if she's going to make their lives hell, they will make her stay as uncomfortable as possible. That's explained in canon.

Basically, the reason the staff saw Umbridge as different is that she was. She isn't on "their team," she's literally there to catch them out. She's as bad for the staff as she is for the students, and they have no higher authority to complain about her to - the ministry have decreed she stays. That is now the law.

But the teachers reacting the same way in fics when, for example, Snape, gets pranked just isn't realistic. Snape is a git, but he's still "team Hogwarts" so his colleagues will protect him.

Plus the stuff with Umbridge, they just pretend there's nothing they can do to help in canon (and she's made a rod for her own back in many ways, with the rules like "teachers can only speak to students about their lessons" - "oh I'm sorry Delores, I would be able to fix this but I'm /simply not allowed/ to ask Fred and George which spells they used, oh dearie me" exit Flitwick...) They don't /give points directly for the prank./ That's what bothers me, fics where Dumbledore literally stands up and rewards students for disruption of the school or for attacking a teacher.

*** Given that half of Slytherin are the children of Death Eaters and a good chunk of the school has lost family in the last war, IMO any prank war would escalate into physical violence pretty quickly because there is a lot of bad blood. And that's not mentioning that a lot of fanon pranks are nothing short of sexual assault, or that what the twins did to Montague in canon would have been grievous bodily harm if he had not been working for a woman who tortured children (making it self defense).

Because lets face it, any kind of disagreement between someone who has lost a family member and someone who is the child of the guilty person, would be deadly within moments. We are talking about hormone raging teenagers all holding deadly weapons in their hands. The prank war stuff isn't something anyone in their rational mind would think of for even more than a few minutes in a situation of real war.

- Giant penis burnt into the grass of the front lawn.

They're unruly students and cause headaches for their teachers - they break curfew, they sneak away from school, they sneak into the forest, they get a lot of detentions, they backtalk to teachers (probably), and they pick fights with Slytherins - all of this can be called troublemaking.

*** "Prankster" is an Americanism though isn't it? In the UK we may occasionally refer to a "prank," but we wouldn't call someone a "prankster".

I think it does my head in in fics because so many of them get to the point where every other chapter is about "a prank" and everything that's any kind of trick or joke is described as "a prank." Firstly, other words exist. Please, people, try to use a variety of words in your writing. Secondly, it's lazy characterisation (usually of Sirius or the twins). They're "a prankster" and therefore don't need any other characteristics. Again, other personality types exist, and most people play or make the occasional joke. It doesnt have to be the only thing we learn about that character.

**** The etymology dates back to the 1500s for prank and prankster in middle English and Dutch but I think it would be fair to say it is more of an Americanism these days to be fair. Words are an interesting thing.

I so know what you mean though. Then you get the ones who go too far the other way with online thesaurus and you get heists, capers , malarkeys and gambols, in a variety of confusing contexts....

** To be perfectly honest, half of the pranks in fanfiction, were not in the spirit of good fun. That just makes it bullying.\\
(Seriously. "Pranking" slimy Slytherins whom you hate to get a laugh by humiliating them in front of the entire school (as often happens in fanfiction)? Isn't that, like, a textbook example of bullying?)

*** I really enjoyed that, although there are a couple of things I think the author has got wrong, but not everyone in the UK knows everything about the rest of the UK! The main one that I think fanfic writers might use is that "chippie" or "chippy" isn't just a Scots term, if you ask someone in any part of the UK where the chippy is, they'll understand you're looking for a fish and chip shop. So any character from anywhere can say that.

Lots of Britpicking pulls up on the use of "pants" for trousers or jeans, and they're /usually/ right. We don't tend to say that. Except for in Lancashire, especially Bolton and Blackpool. So given Neville has an accent from around there in the films and the books don't say where he's from, it wouldn't be out of place for Mrs Longbottom to scold him for the "state of his pants" when he comes out of the greenhouses - meaning he's torn or dirtied his trousers.

The author of this also claims it's hard to navigate Milton Keynes without a car, and my fiance who lived there for seven years assures me the opposite is true and its full of footpaths and cycle lanes. He also, however, thinks it's irrelevant to HP fanfic as MK is such a sterile "new" city that wizards would avoid it like the plague 😂 The other ones I don't think are quite right is the claim that you can travel to Europe from the UK without a passport - UK citizens cannot. EU citizens who have a travelcard can, but such a document doesn't exist in the UK for our own residents. If you're leaving the borders of the UK or the Crown Protectorates for a "foreign" country, you need a passport, and that would apply just as much to wizards - I am sure you need identification to be able to take an international portkey or however they go on foreign holidays. Also the link you shared makes a big deal about Cornwall being separate from the UK in terms of culture and so on - yes, it probably has more of its own little quirks than anywhere else, but the majority of UK people (especially the English) treat the political movent for Cornish independence as a great big joke. Cornwall would be a very interesting place to set some HP fic though, as it's got a ton of mythology all of its own. It wouldn't be unreasonable to have a Cornish wizard character who is seen as somewhat eccentric or different by other wizards - if the Lovegoods hadn't been established as being from (neighbouring) Devon, I'd have said Cornwall would be a sensible place to base them.

** Thank you for this. I'm working on a Marauders fic now and I've been wondering about terminology for "pranks." As far as I recollect, I haven't used the term "pranksters" and I'm certain I've never used "prank-wars" (I've never heard that word used in a natural setting anyway), but I think I have a draft chapter or two with "prank" in them. I'll make sure to screen for that when revising. That said, my fic isn't the prank-wars type story, it's just an occasional feature, like the twins' antics in OOPT.

Question: is the word "jape" normally used? I've seen it in a few fics, but usually only used by stuffier characters, so I'm not sure if it's really a commonly-used term or a way for the writers to characterize stuffiness in the speaker.

*** I think occasional joke or prank is absolutely realistic. It's the stories that have no character development for James/Sirius or Fred/George other than "I LIKE PRANKS" and /every other chapter/ is about them doing a "prank." The word, and the repetitiveness, starts to grate on me!

Jape is deffo British English but quite old fashioned. I could see Dumbledore saying it, but not the twins.

** British person, and whilst I agree that when HP was set the term ‘prank' wouldn't be used, and especially not in Marauders' era, I actually don't have a problem with this word too much because it's a commonly used word in the U.K. now. It's a US import, but it is definitely used amongst young people particularly now (and was even being used when I was in secondary school during the noughties) and so for Next Gen kind of era would kind of expect this phrase to get used.

I use the term prank in my own fics, but I use it interchangeably with joke and practical joke. I actually like prank better than joke because it encapsulates some of the nastier elements of practical jokes that I feel the term joke downplays.

** Interestingly, I've lived in the UK most of my life, and I never picked up on this one! I think 'playing pranks' does fit in alright with British English, although to my ear it does sound a bit old-fashioned and perhaps fitting in /with/ Marauder-era better than main canon era! (fitting in with other similar sounding words like 'japes')

I wonder whether perhaps some of those terms /were/ changed into 'prank' in the US editions of the books and as such FF writers have been simply continuing the terminology, rather than replacing it actively. I know we found that in discussion on this sub before re the likes of Mrs Weasley's annual Christmas sweaters (jumpers in the original British English, which iirc in US English is some kind of a pinafore dress, correct?)

** Not completely related, but where I live, ragging is not used in a similar sense that pranking and joking are; it's actually far harsher and is sometimes used as a synonym for bullying, especially when the younger person is the one being harassed. It's interesting to see how words evolve in different places!

** Also the vast majority of "pranks" that people write into their fics are clearly just bullying with a crowd pleasing twist.
