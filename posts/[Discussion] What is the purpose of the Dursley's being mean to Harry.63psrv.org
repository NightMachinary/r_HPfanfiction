I don't necessarily understand this point. To me, it is quite unrealistic simply because the level of abuse directed towards Harry (both verbal and physical such as locking him up in CoS) is enough grounds for a visit from CPS. Now, I know that the Dursley's keep it down but if Ron/Forge know about it, then I'm sure that Hermione does too and I'm also sure that she isn't going to just leave it be and should have done something about it in the books.

Regardless, my question is about what purpose the Dursley's served. Reading HP and enough fanfiction hints that this was to mold him as: 1) Emotionally negleted 2) More receiving towards the love and thus ideals that his parents (and by extent, the 'light' side of the war) 3) More receiving towards the idea of magic as it is a save haven for him, as seen in his consideration of Hogwarts as home.

However, couldn't the above three points be achieved even if the Dursley's were nice to Harry? As a muggle born, I'm sure his awe at magic would not be diminished either way and his stance in the "light" side of the war can still be there. As an orphan, he will still look up to his parents - and would still do so in the case that the Dursley's are nice to him and Petunia talks about his family.

The only counter argument towards this is Petunia's established canon interaction with Lily and Snape. However, I fail to see why this is taken into account so credibly. Sure, Petunia is angry (and jealous) towards Lily and Snape but that was when she was young. Although a lot of adults in Potterverse happen to act very similarly to their adolescent self (ie. Snape, Sirius), we don't know if Petunia still harbors these feelings to this day. Is it implausible to think that Petunia may have gotten over her feelings and resumed her relationship with Lily as a sister? Especially given the fact that Lily does, could this event not shock her into realising her faults and hence atleast trying her best to bring Lily's son up the way that Lily herself would? We see these kinds of realisations throughout life all the time, why can't it happen to Petunia?

We don't exactly have any canon information about Vernon Dursley and so I don't think it is implausible to suggest that he may look at magic in a positive light or if not, atleast accept Harry for who he is. So, Vernon's stance towards magic is simply arbitrarily created - hence making it plausible in AU's to change this stance.

TL;DR: My question is - if we can change it so that the Dursley's are no longer mean towards Harry, what would this change in Harry's life? Would it have an effect on his years at Hogwarts? If not, then what purpose do the Dursley's serve when they act abusively towards Harry?

** Abused childhood is a common trope in children's literature, for example Cinderella and Snow White. The purpose is to create more adversity for the protagonist and drum up reader sympathy. It has worked fairly well so far.

** Without the derision of the Dursleys, Harry might have had too much self-respect and self-worth such that he would not have been prepared to sacrifice himself and allow the soul fragment in his scar to be destroyed.

Or so the conspiracy theorists would have you believe.

*** Police files and court records showed that abused children were far more likely to become criminals. The odds for Harry to become Tom Riddle 2.0 or join Voldemort's anti-muggle campaign were far greater than the all-loving Canon Harry we know, IMHO.

** Here's the thing. Wizarding Britain is stuck in the freaking stone ages. As long as they're not actively murder-ating Harry, the wizarding world won't do dick all to his legal guardians exercising their rights to discipline their child. Period. They won't get involved.

The thing about CPS is that parents lie. Frequently. As long as there's no outward signs of physical abuse (bruising, cuts, malnutrition) CPS won't do anything. I've had adopted friends who tell stories of their adoptive parents telling them that their birth mother was a whore, a drug dealer, and died of overdose. (It surfaced yeeeeeears later, that the mother had died of cancer. Cancer. Something that would have been VERY HELPFUL to tell someone, so that they know to tell their doctor about family history, both for her and her kids.) That because the birth mother was trash, that so is she. She wasn't allowed to have any freedoms at all, and had to do ridiculous amounts of chores. Her adopted mother showed up at the trial of her abusive ex husband to TESTIFY AGAINST HER. The judge took away her baby.

One thing that JK Rowling knows all too keenly is poverty, and what happens to children of poor people. If you haven't met such petty, nasty, small-minded people, I pray that you continue to live in ignorance of it. Whether or not it's a trope, or whatever, I think a big part of it is JK Rowling putting a story out there where all the adults seem to think a child is fine with his legal guardians, and that nasty disgusting abuses that don't leave marks can go on behind closed doors.

Again, this hits a little close to home, because I've seen how shitty adults can be towards children, so I apologise if I'm coming off as curt or rude. It's not at all my intention! I am happy you brought up this topic to discuss, because it's a well worded, well thought out post for sure.

** Without the Dursleys, Harry might have run screaming from the wizarding world, probably around the time of the detention in the forbidden forest. Let's face it, he's treated like crap a lot of the time at Hogwarts and the only reason to stick around might be that the alternative is so much worse

** Yes, it would change Harry's life and time at Hogwarts. Not much, but some. Major events would probably not have changed.

Why was it done? It was done to create conflict in the early chapters and give the reader a tangible target for dislike (later replaced by Malfoy and Snape). It generates sympathy for the protagonist that makes it more likely for the reader to continue reading past the opening chapters.

Vernon Dursley does indeed have a grudge against wizards (in particular, James Potter). By all accounts, Vernon might have been even slightly more rotten then Petunia.

Keep in mind, fanfiction GREATLY exaggerates the abuse that Harry underwent at the hands of the Dursleys; it's an unfortunate trope. I can't think of anything in canon that they did that would have allowed the British equivalent of CPS ( I don't even know if they have a national agency for that) to get involved, at least by most standards. Locking a child up for extended periods of time does not, as far as I know, merit the involvement of government services, so long as that child is otherwise provided for.

****** If it didn't connect, there's absolutely no proof that it happened. It would be his word against theirs. As such, attempted abuse - unless witnessed by a third party - will not provide justification for the involvement of child services.

Threatening to hit someone is emotional abuse, yes. But as others have said: the authorities don't give a damn about emotional abuse, in the vast majority of cases. You have to have something more substantial for them to get involved.

*** Plenty of fanfic /does/ make the abuse way worse than it was in canon, and you're right that authorities don't care about anything other than physical abuse.

But even in canon, it was pretty damn bad. Emotional abuse and neglect is 100% as real and awful as physical abuse.

*** You're right that fanfiction exaggerates the abuse, but its all still abuse. Locking him in a cupboard is abuse. Especially if he goes without food while in there. Locking him in the bedroom was abuse. Refering to him as "boy" and "freak" is psychological abuse. Excessive chores is abuse. Attempting to keep him from going to school is a form of neglect called educational neglect and is also considered abuse. Forcing him to get worse grades than his cousin at the risk of being punished is also education neglect, and therefore abuse.

I hate when people downplay what happened in the books as not that bad. If Harry was a real kid, the Dursleys would be arrested. Fanfics go overboard, that's true, but the books are awful when you see them through the eyes of an adult.

**** Was what happened in the books absolutely awful, and did it show the Dursleys to be awful people? Yes, and it was certainly abusive. It was never my intent to claim otherwise.

My claim is that the government authorities would not have gotten involved unless there was /substantial/ evidence of repeated physical abuse, which is not present in canon. Lethargy is the nature of bureaucracy, unless shocked into movement. The emotional and the mental abuse he underwent probably wouldn't make the cut.

I believe the 'forcing him to get worse grades' is a fanfiction trope - I don't remember that being discussed in the opening chapters of Philosopher's Stone, where most of the other abuse is discussed. I could be quite wrong about that, though, so please correct me if I am.
