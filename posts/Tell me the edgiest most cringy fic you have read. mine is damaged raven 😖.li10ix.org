** While I didn't enjoy reading it, I just stopped and moved on when I realised it didn't match my taste.

If it was so cringe why did you keep reading it?

Honestly if you dislike a fic, and most of us will come across some, we just leave it and forget about it. If you don't like a fic, you don't really remember it.

I'm sorry but your post looks like you're mocking someone's efforts and acting like a bully because you don't need to look them in the eye.

If it was not to your taste, move on and keep walking. No need to be harsh and rude. I know that JustBored21 is a part of this sub-reddit. Did you post this with the intention of harming them?

You're mocking someone's work without giving any reason or justification for the same.

I've read his work. While I don't share the same taste as him, he is a good writer. If you want to give constructive criticism, go for it.

This is just petty and pathetic attempt at bullying.

You don't need to like what he writes. If you don't like it, don't read it.
