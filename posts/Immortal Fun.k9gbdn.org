Harry killed Voldy and now is just...stunned. he's been sitting on a rock with the elder wand in hand and cloak on his back. He can't be moved and doesn't respond to anything.

People keep coming by attempting to interact with him but he just sits there.

What does he do now? Where should he go? He doesn't want to stay in Britain that for damn sure.

After 6 weeks of staying there day and night, a few remaining death eaters show up to attack and Harry doesn't even react. 12 Killing Curses are fired at him and just stop midflight. Harry moves for the first time in weeks and looks at the frozen curses and scared shitless death eaters. The clouds start forming, its dark but mere seconds ago it was a cloudless sky.

"Kill them all." Harry said.

A burst of green shoots from the elder wand as the other killing curses shoot into the sky turning the clouds green.

Every death eater on in the country is struck by lightning at once and Harry stands up. He begins walking. He doesn't know where, he doesn't know why but he is headed for his next mission.

The lich hunter is born. And the next target is in [pick a country]
