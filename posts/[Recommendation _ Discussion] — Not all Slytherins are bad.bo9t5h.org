I recently read an interesting book ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12697114/1/Slytherins-at-War]]) which characterised a Slytherin really well. It doesn't go very far into wether or not purity matters like some books do, rather it showed that Slytherins can do a good thing, even if hey do it in a way usually associated with Lucius Malfoy.

I'm looking for both other books like this, and a discussion with others about the story and why this kind of characterisation isn't more common.

(P.S. Who else now thinks that things like this were happening in cannon, even if we don't see it?)

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

** Well... /of course/.

Ambition and cunning does not automatically equal political ambition, and cunning used to further a political career. Ambition can mean anything, a kid who wants to open a broom store would be put into Slytherin since it's rare for 11 year olds to have such a defined future goal. That's what separates Slytherins from the other houses: They know what they want and are dead set on achieving it.

If not ambition then cunning, cunning can mean a lot of things. Someone who is good at hiding their feelings, someone who is naturally secretive and good at hiding their secrets, someone who can manipulate others, via natural charm or some sort of learned skill. A good shopkeeper is cunning because they know how to pitch their products to the public, and know how to talk to people well.

I'd argue that Slytherins are the most well adjusted kids in Hogwarts, there are exceptions of course, but in general Slytherins are the most mature out of all the Houses, even at 11.

*** That may be the case for the "natural Slytherin" (the one that are put there by choice of the Hat), but I'm not really convinced the Death Eater spawn are the most adjusted kid.

Draco Malfoy for example, never really seemed that ambitious to me, entilted yes, and arrogant, but he never seemed fine to live on the money and reputation of his daddy. As for the cunning, he seemed to have more of it that, let's say, Ron (since he did have some plan like the midnight duel), but even there, most of his fights with the Trio were direct confrontation, with no cunning involved other than doing it near of Snape.

It is even worse with Crabbe and Goyle, these 2 are clearly in Slytherin because they have been endoctrined by their family to go there, so I don't count them as mature.

​

PS: On the other hand, some character would have been a perfect fit for Slytherin and are not there. Harry Potter only meet Percy Weasley when he is 15, but the kid is like a mass of ambition and the Hat probably at least proposed him Slytherin.

** Mostly, I think the problem is that the really REALLY rich and powerful families in Slytherin are all Death Eater tier, and they can basically force everyone else into submission through guile or threats.

  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

**** Thanks for the recommendation. I've seen this a few times before, but wasn't sure wether not to read it because the summary is really vague. Would you say this is a good read or not?

***** From what I remember, follows the canon stations fairly closely. Includes hierarchy within Slytherin house but escapes (I think, it's been awhile) the Lords nonsense.

It is overall a decent read; the author puts a lot of thought into the story and some of the OCs are entertaining and fleshed-out. Ginny feels, for the most part, real, even if she makes decisions that the reader wouldn't.

I think I had some problems with the way the Weasleys treat Ginny after she's sorted - maybe it's my headcanon more than canon, but even despite Percy's leaving in canon, I tend to have trouble believing stories with Weasley family distancing (estrangements is I think too strong a word here) over something like a Sorting.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.
