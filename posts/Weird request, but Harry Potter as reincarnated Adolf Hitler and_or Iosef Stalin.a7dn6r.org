** It's pretty hard to even find a Harry Potter as a reincarnated Merlin or Arthur or founder. Imo most people doesn't understand that reincarnation is the same ‘soul', if you will, in a different body starting again from birth. But erm, what do you expect from a story like that? A dark evil Harry? A repentant one? A dictator with a eugenics fetish?

*** It could be hilarious if done right (and not a real reincarnation)

Just imagine Harry and Hermione, after losing the war and everyone they held dear, deciding to erase Riddle from history by killing him as a child. One botched time-travel ritual later, Harry has the headache of the century and wonders who these voices calling him "Mein Führer" are. Then he opens his eyes and eventually realises that he is Hitler, the year is 1935 and Hermione has replaced Eva Braun. Suddenly, they are in the unique position of having to lead a country which was Britain's arch-enemy (together with the French). Abdication is not an option because then the likes of Himmler and Göring would take over and history would take a similar path. At the same time, some revision of Versaille had to be reached in order to prevent a coup and the Soviets eventually need to be dealt with as well since Stalin will otherwise gob up Eastern Europe one country a time. All while they really just wanted to kill a child.

And that Grindelwald fellow is there as well.

**** Ah so that's like not reincarnation. Erm, your prose was very good so perhaps you could write something like that yourself? That's a very specific idea but pretty interesting. Would throw cannon off the rails immediately, especially if the Harry and Hermione are true to who they are and not OOC. I imagine they would have to stay in control, or someone else would just take over, all the while defusing the boiling war and the genocide occurring all around them. Would definitely be interesting.

***** Sorry, won't be happening from my pen. Since I know quite a lot about German History, I would not be satisfied with any "winging it" and would put an absurd amount of research into the story to avoid mistakes like giving Hitler the wrong blend of coffee/tea. And I am kinda busy with my two ongoing stories anyway.

****** To be fair most of his life is probably extremely well documented due to the tragedies he caused.

** Probably doesn't exist, or at the very least there might be a few fics who uses the concept but gotten nowhere; I'd be very interested to see this though.
