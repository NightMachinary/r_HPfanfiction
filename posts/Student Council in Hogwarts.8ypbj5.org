So I was wondering, that with all the highschool DxD fics coming out of the woodwork, is there any instance of a student council within Hogwarts in the fandom? It can be like the anime version of a student council, where they have an inordinate amount of power and privilege, or the regular one, with a lot of responsibility and hard work. Thanks guys!


** "With a lot of responsibility and hard work" biggest thing we did in student council in my last year was decide to paint the common room hot pink & turquoise, it was pretty controversial to be honest!

** This reminds me of Enid Blyton's "The Naughtiest Girl in School" series. For those who are unaware, JK Rowling draws a lot on Enid Blyton for the boarding school genre elements on Harry Potter. Blyton wrote three main boarding school series: St. Clare's, Malory Towers, and The Naughtiest Girl in School.

The interesting thing about the Naughtiest Girl series is that it's basically communist propaganda. The children are self-governing via a student council and are not permitted private property. Any money, food, etc. that their parents send them is seized by the student council and redistributed on an equal basis. The story arc of the main character is all about how she originally rails against this system but ultimately comes to realise (/is brainwashed) how great it is.

** I now want a HP / Prison School crossover where Harry and his mates perv on the girls using his Invisibility Cloak, so the student council imprisons them in the dungeons.
