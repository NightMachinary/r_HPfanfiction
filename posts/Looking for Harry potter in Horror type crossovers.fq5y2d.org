Looking for any and all stories where Harry ends up in a Horror game/movie/series.

Preferable stories where Harry uses his magic to survive, and doesnt run around as a muggle dodging death, afraid of ruining the statute of secrecy.

Prefer if Harry isnt angsting all the time ;)

  Trapped within the depths of the Department of Mysteries, Harry is entangled in a desperate, violent battle against both the Death Eaters and a horrifying creation of the Unspeakables, with time itself left as his only weapon.
