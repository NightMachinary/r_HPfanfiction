:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Yeah, so I found the one in my last thread, thanks to an actually helpful person who didn't just downvote my thread for whatever dumbass reason you had to do so. So kudos to that one guy who actually helped!

Let's hope that can happen again.

Anyway, I had my memories mixed up with that fic and another fic, apparently, because I couldn't find any Remus and Sirius stuff in that previous fic. So it has to be another one out there.

So. This new fic I'm searching for: Sirius and Remus are involved with Snape taking care of Harry, and Draco tries to kill Harry by pushing him down the grand staircase at Hogwarts under the Imperius, Harry has jealousy issues about Draco and Snape, and they spend Christmases together. One Christmas, his scar goes nuts and Sirius and Remus are there and start freaking out over Harry being in pain.

Harry and Ron are under the cloak in fourth year, and then Fake-Moody shows up and kills Dobby in front of them. Ron runs away to get help, and Harry gets taken to the Graveyard.

Can anyone help me find this one, /please?/
