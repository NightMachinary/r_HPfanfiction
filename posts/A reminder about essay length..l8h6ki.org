It's a major peeve of mine when writers make mistakes about essay length. Just a reminder that a foot of parchment is one normal page (8.5x11). So if your NEWT student (who is 16, 17, or 18 birthday dependant) complains about the fact that Flitwick assigned them a two foot essay it just feels wrong. Maybe it was just me but when I was in highschool getting assigned essays meant four pages minimum an essay of two pages might take an hour tops (and that's if you're really struggling, again just my experience). Just remember that one foot = one page.


** I do want to point out that struggles are relative. If they've only ever needed to write half a foot of essay, then suddenly have to write two feet, that is to them what you suddenly needing to write eight pages would be. I remember complaining when my school cafeteria changed the chips, but schools in more deprived areas might struggle to even pay for resources.

Also, they're students and children. If my memories of being that age are even vaguely accurate, we'd've bitched about a millimetre of homework and no bullet points, nevermind a foot in a quill pen.

My main questions are to the more canon-knowledgeable people though - what essay lengths were mentioned in canon? What was Harry's point of "Fuck this shit"? And do we know what width a HP parchment scroll would come in at?

**** Might also struggle to find enough material on a given topic, given that some topics could have deeper implications and more advanced uses, but not something that a 2nd year student would need, or know to look for.

In my HS experience.... I remember getting plenty of "Exceeds Expectations" on Outstanding work because I'd exhausted the topic on one page, and the teacher expected four. Would drop me lower, but I'd always done my research so all the relevant information would be written down - just compressed and lacking in the usual HS off-tangent babble.

^{Got my revenge when doing medieval times in history. It was something both easy to research and with wide selection of sources. My essay made a nice 'thunk' when I went to drop it off. Because the teacher had a habit of leaving red pen all over the student's work (even if it was just an "OK" next to a paragraph}, ^{she had to read it all and check my sources - some of which were paper-only and available in select places.})

Assuming the parchment-makers are cutting to sheet and folio sizes for writing paper common in Britain since the 16th century (at least, it may be older, but that's the earliest I could find with a quick google), 8.5 inches. They're only cutting for width, of course: length is 'however long the piece of hide is at this point' and then rolled up as a scroll.

*** Well that depends on the assignment. At Uni we have to write essay-like answers when we're taking our exams. Some professors give us a minimum of how many words we have to write while others give us the exact opposite. It's not that they don't want to read too many exhaustingly long essays (well that might be the reason partly), but because they want us to learn how to express ourselves with only a limited amount of space but with a need to explain a topic thoroughly. They want us to be precise with as few words as possible. That might not be entirely the reason NEWT essays aren't that long but I find that writing short essays of high quality is a rather nica challenge. And in the real world, you often do find that the quality of the written trumps the quantity (i.e. the lenght).

I'm a teacher and whenever I get complaints about the amount of homework I ask the class on how long they spent on certain tasks. 1-10 minutes... I get complaints on homework that takes 1-10 minutes. And those numbers are realistic because in class they often do similar tasks that take the same amount of time.

But on the other hand, we should always keep in mind that they also have other classes, they need their free time, they need time for their chores and hobbies and friends.

My 10 minutes might be added to the 5 minutes in another class, 15 mins in math, and so on. After a full day of classes

** I think it's a perception issue. Rowling probably used feet instead of pages because it sounds just different enough (and let's be honest, Magical Britain will be on the Imperial standard for another century if not forever). Although I admit I don't know historically how parchment or papyrus was measured.

Anyway, a foot of parchment sounds very long and while most of us use 8.5x11" paper, we don't think of it in terms of measurement unless we also use legal or some other size as well. It's just a piece of paper. I know I hadn't made that connection until I saw a post pointing it out last year. Perception's everything.

They might do better to say X number of words as opposed to 2 feet; surely there's a charm or spell to count your words?

** 4 pages seems a bit long for an essay. We were thought that essays shouldn't be longer than two pages and should be more abstract and focus on the opinions of the writer. What you are describing sounds more like a report or course work- these should be longer and focus more on the theory from class.

And anyway measuring anything in feet is stupid. Like- how do you even measure that? Is it the foot of a small child or a tall adult? Ron would have to write longer essays cause his feet are probably larger than say Hermione's. Use the metric system as every normal, sane person does.

As far as essays go- it's entirely possible we were thought differently. Our school program was a bit dated and I graduated years ago. We only ever did essays in Literature. At university, we called the homework either assignments or course work and those were indeed 8- 12 pages. Though many professors didn't care about word count so tables and graphs were used liberally. I think it's best just to set a word count instead of pages (or feet) as a requirement.
