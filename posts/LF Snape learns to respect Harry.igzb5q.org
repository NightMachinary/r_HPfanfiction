Lf for a fic which is kind of similar to "A New Place to Stay".

So Snape hates Harry but through some circumstances he learns to like/respects him

**** Yes. Started off as a challenge, but is now basically a trope in its own right. Not necessarily a biological dad (even if the challenge started out that way), but basically fulfilling that kind of role. Biological father, adoptive father, "mere" guardian, etc.
