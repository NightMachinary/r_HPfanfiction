Hello! Could you recommend some fanfiction where muggls turn their weapons on voldemor's army. Or start something like an Insurgency .


** Not Muggles, but Hermione founded her own guerrilla group and had reasonable successes using Muggle weapons against Death Eaters in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]]. On the other hand, Voldemort also knows how to use them effectively.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], UK military and allied Wizards shot up Death Eaters, Umbridge Ministry, and Voldemort.

Muggles spent decades developing a secret plan against Wizards in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]]. They managed to breach the Anti-Muggle charms and struck shortly after the Battle of Hogwarts, their opening move was to nuke the Quidditch World Cup Final, where up 20% of Wizards were congregated in one spot.

** Linkffn(2784825) is sort of this, at least using muggle weapons. I recommend it highly.

Linkffn(7782623) has this, but with some wizard guidance. And it ends in a merging wizard/muggle society. This is a sequel and though the first story is not muggle vs wizards it is also good for what it is.

  This is the sequel to Harry's Had Enough. You don't have to read that first, but it might be better if you do. Harry in a position on power, he's a bit unscrupulous in this one. Dumbledore, Ministry and Death Eater bashing. Also a bit of Ron bashing and general wizard society bashing. H/Hr. Now Complete!
