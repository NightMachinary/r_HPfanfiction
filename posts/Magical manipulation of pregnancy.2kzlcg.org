Are there any fics in which magical people take the obvious steps in regards to pregnancy? I'm talking space altering charms so that the fetus doesn't rearrange your internal organs, modified apparition to extract the fetus so you don't have to worry about labor, and potions to speed up pregnancy or at least get rid of most of the deleterious effects.

I've seen fan fiction talking about abortion, sometimes talking about abortifacient spells and potions, but nobody's mentioned a possibility of locking a fetus in a given state of development indefinitely for people who are upset with the idea of abortion and want to have kids eventually but not right now. Or moving a fetus from an unwilling host to a willing one, which would make sense with the minuscule wizarding population.


** I've read at least one Sirius/Hermione where Molly had a potion to get rid of and prevent morning sickness and made a comment to hermiones mom about "why would anyone want morning sickness?"

If I can figure out which one it was, I'll post it here :) I haven't encountered any that use more interesting things though- modifying the space in the womb and altered apparition? Brilliant.

*** I had a feeling but needed to make sure. The one I was referring to was Innocence.

** I've always thought that abortion would probably be highly taboo in magical society. With their population so low they probably value life more than us muggles with our overpopulation problems.

As for pregnancy magic, I can only think of one where Voldemort's obtains his pre-resurrection body by snuffing out the soul of Bertha Jorkin's unborn child then possessing the body, and then being born as that scaly baby monster from canon. I can't remember which fic though.

** The only thing I can think of that even comes close is Prince of the Dark Kingdom. It's not a very large aspect of the story all things considered and it doesn't come into it until later, but there is a more extensive presence of magics in regards to pregnancy, though more of the preventing or helping it actually begin type than during pregnancy.

** There was a HGSS fic that had a plot point of Hermione being a virgin brewer. There see specific potions that could be made by them, some were powerful such as a 100% chance to guarantee the gender of the newborn.

** I remembered a story, it's Severus/Hermione, "Hermione Granger and the Intended Vessels"

Basically, marriage law, forced breeding, and if I'm remembering right (as I don't want to skim through)... [[/s][spoiler]]

So it has some of what you're looking for, though the spoiler kinda spoils things if you know or realize ahead of time ;D (If the spoiler tag isn't working, I can message you)

** Teufel1987's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] has Tonks's uterus kept in some sort of magical animate state after her passing to allow her to gestate Teddy.

Less seriously, Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother-In-Law's Love]] has Molly Weasley use lightening charms on her breasts to keep them from sagging (quite the feat after seven children).
