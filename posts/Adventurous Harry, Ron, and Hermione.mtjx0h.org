"Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one." - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Chapter 10 "Halloween"

Are there any stories where they maintain this form of thinking?


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis by Starfox5) has the trio going on tomb raiding adventures. It's actually a sequel to linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider by Starfox5), which focuses on the eponymous character's adventures, but also features interludes involving the trio exploring Hogwarts.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** linkffn(Sum of their parts by holdmybeer) is adventurous in the murder-y, revolutionary kind of way. Other than that, I know I've read the occasional great trio adventure story, but nothing springs to mind atm. I'll come and edit this if I remember something good.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12302907/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum][Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum Chapter 1, a harry potter fanfic | FanFiction]]

In this fic the trio knows it gets in adventure and try to prepare for it. That means that they get willingly in a lot of adventure's. Like using the Room of Requirement as their personal portal to (I believe) Monte Carlo were they go to to have fun with Sirius.

The fic certainly get's weird but there is also a lot of drinking, adventure and slight violence....

**** Why is it wrong that three best friends decide to pursue a romantic relationship?

You will be surprised how well poly relationships can work in real world. [[/r/askreddit][r/askreddit]] talks [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ivbcrl/children_of_poly_relationships_what_was_it_like/][about this topic]] from time and time, and that particular thread has overwhelmingly positive replies.

In HP world, the Trio has such a deep bond that I can absolutely see a poly relationship working out well between them, perhaps even better than standalone Ron/Hermione or Harry/Hermione.
