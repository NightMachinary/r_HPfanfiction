Think about something, something that can teleport an object from one place, to another; or something that can force objects to fly, levitate, hover, punch, fall, and whatever you wish. Something that can create something - out of nothing. What fantastical uses would this have? Now remember, we you are reading this on a Harry Potter fanfiction fandom - the story where this magical force exists; Magic.

So why hasn't something akin to the industrial revolution happend in the wizarding world then? Empty factories producing large amounts of goods instantly teleported to other distant locations, whether it be the house 15 meters away, or a distant planet millions of kilometers away. All in the blink of an eye.

Why haven't the truly dispicable wizards exploited muggles to oblivion? Why hasn't wizard Colombus apparted to a distant planet? Why hasn't magic advanced so far that wizards are now gods, not simply muggles with the occasional cool party trick of making something explode.

The dominant question is 'why?' Discuss.

(Everyone welcome to create a story based on this, link a story, or something)


** The main reason why is that, with a couple of exceptions (clothes and food) the goods wizards demand are magical goods, not physical ones.

But it's very difficult to industrialise the production of magical goods. There is no such thing as the self-spelling wand; such a thing is considered an absurd impossibility by Arthur Weasley. In short, you can't automate the enchantment of objects. Every magical object has to be made "manually" by a wizard.

The other main reason is that the population size is not sufficient to get any real benefit out of mass production. Wizards already have a sufficient supply of goods to meet the level of demand in their consumer economy.

*** That is something I've never quite understood. Wizards have better life quality than muggles for at least most of history depending on your point of view, fertility is a no problem, the same with most illness and they tend to live for centuries. Why is their population show to be so low? Even if most choose to only have a child or two per family eventually adding the low mortality to the long life-spam and eventually the population would accumulate and reach hundreds of millions, if not billions, and that is excluding squibs

1. They don't need it.
2. They don't want it.
3. It already happened in other parts, while the rest ignored it. I see Magical Britain ignoring it, and then promptly banning it in their country.

Who says they haven't already? Memory charms, fidelius, unplottable charms, etc. They take what they want and make everyone forget or they can't find it again. Arthur Weasley's job also includes muggle baiting, so if there is a job for it, there is a demand for the job to exist.

Also, #12 Grimmauld place. I don't see the Black family actually buying a house from muggles. My best guess is that they murdered the occupants and then spelled it to hell and back so they couldn't find it, remember it, etc.

** This is something I often agonize about while I'm having a shower.

The meta reason is that JKR started writing a children's tale and also is extremely bad at math. She invented a bunch of spells on the spot to help move forward the plot, even tho if you take those spells to their logical extreme, they become fucking stupid OP.

If we ignore that fact and assume a hypothetical /"real"/ world where such magic exists, I do not see any way (according to everything we were told in the books) that wizards should have such a low population.

You can fix it by adding some sort of magical barrier to a huge population, you have to (imo) if you want to make some sort of sense out of cannon.

You can use basically any possible imaginable reason to answer that "why" question, because the cannon doesn't provide one.

There is no reason (according to cannon as I understand it, JKR retconning notwithstanding) why it shouldn't happen. There is no explanation given.

I do not see how the variables that led to the technological advancements we had the last few centuries don't apply to wizards.

Considering the fact that physics defying magic exists, I always like to dream of the magical society that by our time had grew into a type 2 (or even a type 3) civilization. After all, magic is the ultimate tool. Sadly, I haven't seen a single fic with this concept.

*** It would be an intriguing idea. Could you make a prompt or request thread on it? I'd like to see if anyone else has found such a story. A Marvel MCU/HP crossover I had planned out (before I randomly got bored of fanfic for a year) had wizards eventually leaving earth for a new world. Could have gone that route, but I never wrote anything beyond the 2nd chapter. ðŸ¤”

** I saw someone make a post about similar to this, and one of the replies was basically this: With the industrial revolution, things improved because mechanically they could. But in the magical world there was need to industrialise their community, because magic made shortcuts. There's no need for cars, because they can teleport or go through fire places. Pens aren't used because they can spell quills to be automically refilled. And as other people mentioned, factories couldn't be automated, as magic can't be done by a machine.

So in general, the magical world didn't have an industrial revolution, because they didn't need it, and the bits they did need, couldn't be achieved in any conceivable way

** Well, the â€˜meta' answer is probably that JKR was writing a series of children's books and... most authors that focus on that kind of story don't also have the aspirations to â€˜uplift' humanity, in whatever form that ends up taking, within their stories.

My headcannon is that the world is probably on the edge of such a revolution, though. If it hasn't happened in the millennia that wizards have possessed a civilization and that's not because it's impossible (magic doesn't work in space, the HP world doesn't exist beyond the atmosphere, whatever) then the muggleborn that are entering their society having grown up on stories of Space and the Advancement of Technology will likely seek such answers in the stars. In a world like HP where there's no real limit to their power once humanity stops accepting that â€˜death' is a â€˜natural' part of life then the sort of Singularity type event is inevitable.

Though in regards to mass production the Wizarding World simply doesn't need such a quantity of anything. Unless novel foods are being manufactured I think a team of craftsman is probably enough to keep up with the demand of such a small population. And that population size is probably another reason why Wizards have not gone to space. If your constantly battling wars it's hard to advance as a society and look for things beyond survival.
