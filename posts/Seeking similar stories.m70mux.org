So, I recently read this fanfic called, “To Be a Slytherin”. It's freakin' amazing!:). Harry basically has a twin sister. She's sorted into Slytherin, mentored by Snape, and often clashes with the Trio (especially Ron).

I'd love to read any similar fics. Fics where Harry has a twin sister sorted into Slytherin, and I'd also really love it if there was a lot of Snape mentoring, as well.

Any suggestions, please? I'm not super picky, though. I'm basically just looking for fics where Harry has a twin sister.

Here's a link to To Be a Slytherin if any of you are interested in fics of this kind;). It's certainly the best I've ever read.

** Doesn't quite have the sibling relationship you're looking for, but *The Pureblood Pretense* read pretty similarly and I thought it was quite a bit better. That said, take this with a grain of salt. Pureblood Pretense has very little romance, and I'm pretty sure I skipped most of sixth year in To Be a Slytherin because it got too drawn-out and unnecessarily romance-heavy.

There's also a fic called *Green Eyed Monster* that has pretty much the same premise as TBAS, and a lot of people accused TBAS of plagiarizing from it. I personally found it unreadable after a couple chapters, but it's quite popular.

*Victoria Potter* has mentor Snape to an extent but not in the typical fanon Slytherin way. Still recommend it, it's very good.

Also echoing Welfycat's self-recommendation, you'll like *Swiftly Falling Snow.* A bit more in the Severitus direction than TBAS, but still good.

Swearing. Spoilers in Reviews!

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  Rose Potter spent twenty-one years as the Chosen One. Reborn as Harry Potter's twin, he alone has the scar after that Samhain night. Harry knows there's something odd about his sister - she's too old, too mature, and knows far too many things she shouldn't - but he loves her anyway. He's been there for her ever since they were born, so Rose'll be damned if she lets history repeat itself.(In her past life, Hogwarts didn't unite until the very end and everyone suffered for it) (Lily Potter was willing to do anything and sacrifice everything for the safety of her family. Rose intended to do nothing less)In which not all Slytherins are evil, not all Gryffindors are good, and the Wizarding World is more than just an extension of the Muggle one.Years 1, 2 complete
