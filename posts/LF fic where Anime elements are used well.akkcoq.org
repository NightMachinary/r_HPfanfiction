** Well, so far, I felt that linkffn(Swords and Sorcery: No Route Back) exploits without being broken (which should've been, according to the rules from the travel that he goes into like chapter 3) Shiro's UBW fairly well.

  An accident with the Second Magic sends Shirou to another dimension. Trapped in a different world and a younger body, how will he manage to get back home? Perhaps the Hogwarts library has an "Inter-dimensional Travel" section.

** I don't know about you guys, but I totally pictured the first year of Harry Crow as a shonen manga, complete with martial arts Sensei tomfoolery.

Yes, I know people here don't like robst. It was a simpler time for me back then.

** linkffn(The Very Best by BrilliantLady)

He wants to be The Very Best, like no one ever was.

To catch them is his real test, to train them is his cause!

Pokémon!

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.
