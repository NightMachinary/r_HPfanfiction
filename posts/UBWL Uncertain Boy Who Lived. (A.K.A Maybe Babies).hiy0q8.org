I've seen plenty and I mean PLENTY of WBWL stories, different boy who lived stories, Twins who lived stories and so on (female equivalents included) . But what about uncertain boy who lived fics?

Usually, when we start off with these kinds of stories, we know right off through narration that the one picked is the wrong one and we see what happens next. Sometimes, though uncommon, we see them both get the title and go through it together. But what about straight up uncertain?

Depending on how it goes, it can easily seem like a standard WBWL story, but we learn later on that instead of the expected "twist" we learn that there wasn't a wrong BWL and we've just been following Harry or Harriet or Henry or whoever Potter's POV in a story that is simply... parallel. A meanwhile that keeps you guessing right up until the reveal.

But what if there was no reveal? What if we never actually figure it out? A wholesome "buddycop" twin fic or a seemingly simple WBWL story with a 'in his/her shadow' plot or a drama filled nightmare following the whole neglect or abandonment plot lines and in the very end... no one knows?

​

Lets discuss


** There is two/three I can think of.

The first I cannot remeber the name but there are two twins and they go to Hogwarts on alternate years.

The second is Harry Potter and The Ashes of Chaos by ACI100. It is a WBWL lily died and then the two twins were split up one staying with James and the other to the Durdleys. UBWL as we don't know who the curse hit.

The third is The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter. It is not UBWL but Harry and Archie Black switch places and maybe something you would like to read. (It is very good in my opinion)

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

*** I'm actually finishing up The Ashes, its where this idea came from, sadly however, the fact remains that WBWL is in the summery and of course gives the twist away even though its stated that Voldemort doesn't know. Plus Harry's scar acting up is another dead giveaway. It is well written, though I do have certain issues with certain aspects, but I've gotten over them mostly and their are no deal breakers for me.

Haven't read the other one though, I'll give it a read when I'm done, thanks for that.

**** Yeah, I have not given anything away yet. I will admit, I put WBWL in the title because, one, it does follow quite a few of the tropes off the get-go, though that is mainly so I can subvert them later. And two, honestly, I wanted the clicks XD

Trust me, the whole “Boy Who Lived” thing is quite ambiguous in this story.

***** Good job, my money is still on Harry though from my reasoning, but do prove me wrong if that's whats gonna happen! I'm really enjoying this and now must suffer through the wait for updates, binge reading is such sweet sorrow...

***** Quick question. From skimming the first chapter it appears this fic might have Dumbledore bashing/an evil Dumbledore. Does that continue throughout the fic, or not really?

****** There is LIGHT Dumbledore bashing. It seems like it will be heavy for a period of a few chapters later on, but it is fairly light by comparison to a lot of other stories. Dumbledore is NOT and will NEVER be evil. He isn't paying anyone to befriend anyone else, he's not obliviating people, he's not trying to take over the world from behind the scenes. None of that rubbish.
