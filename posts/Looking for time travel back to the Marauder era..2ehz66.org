I read one a while back that got discontinued. Harry got sent a package with things that got strapped to his wrists. He traveled back in time to the marauders and kept the timeline in tact while also telling people about him. Remus is also sent back and help harry out. If you could help me find a similar fic or just a good time travel fic I'd much appreciate it.

(Or if you could link me to the original fic I talked about, I haven't been able to find it again....)


** Amazingly the one you are talking about seems to be the one I just started reading this afternoon:

**** Just finished it, well written. Scene Breaks aren't always defined so it can be a little confusing. The story is pretty compelling and the humor is excellent. Sincerely hoping for more :)

** Super funny and lot of 80's pop culture references. It's hermione/sirius which some people dislike but I think it's great
