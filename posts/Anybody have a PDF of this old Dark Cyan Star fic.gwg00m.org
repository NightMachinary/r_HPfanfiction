Their works were deleted when FFN was purged. They were put into a Yahoo! Group, but I haven't been able to access it. Just feeling very nostalgic and wanting to reread.

I can't remember the name of it, but Tom Riddle is a genie and Harry is living in the slums with the Dursleys. Harry is trying to get into a good college, but just ends up grinding at a club.

If you have a different fic by the same author I'd be grateful for that as well!

Thank you!
