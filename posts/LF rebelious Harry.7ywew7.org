Looking for fics where Harry rebels at the adults. *Where he gives them the ultimatum of either killing of voldy and his DE's themselves, or stop coddling Harry and start training him. They cant have it both ways. *Rebels against the greasy one *agrees to kill voldy if they (any adult in the wizarding world) kills off the DE's first *agrees hes a teenager and shouldnt be in danger, and leaves the fighting to the adult (training in secret and freaking out the order that he doesnt fight despite wanting to coddle him)

Stuff like that, i want fics where the adults cant have it both ways, and forces the adults to step up or fuck off ;)
