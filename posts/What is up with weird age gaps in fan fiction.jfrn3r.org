I am not speaking about any story specifically, but there are so many that will be like an OC girl in third year and a guy in sixth or seventh year.

How many 16/17 year-olds are out there thinking about 13 year-olds romantically? Or even worse, sexually?

I automatically stop reading when this happens.

Edit// My eyes have been opened to the bigger issue of teenage characters and older adult characters, so thanks for that. You are right, that is way worse.

*** Romanticizing it is the issue.

Hermione was a tad too young (and Rowling was really bad at math, Krum is actually 18 during the World Cup.) for the Goblet of fire subplot. Or she should have left it platonic until later. Sure it's happened before, but is it really healthy?

McLaggen seems more the type to date underclassmen.

***** Hermione is older, but not an entire year older. She's born September to Harry's July and Ron's March.

The other issue is that you'll see that with maybe Seniors and Sophomores. Krum is literally older than what a seventh year should be, 18 during the summer with a chance he turns 19 during the Goblet of fire.

Hermione turns 15 during the school year. She's a high school freshman in terms of age. Her maturity is tied to her peers, rather than just her age. And frankly, you get a sense of that book 6.

Do you know of any college freshmen or people held back a year trying to date high school freshmen? Because that's what Krum and Hermione is.

Then Krum tries to hit on a 15 year old Ginny during Bill and Fleur's wedding, so maybe he is slightly sleazy.

********* Well then, you are utterly wrong for the majority of fics it occurs in.

The definition of pedophilia is "the obsession with children as sex objects". In the vast majority of HP fics that depict the relationship between a minor and an adult there is no such obsession that can be proven. There may be illegal and immoral sexual relations between a minor and an adult (and even that gets muddy when the age of consent differs between the UK and the US and even between the US states) and there may be even more of a legal and moral issue with relationships between student and teacher (even though THAT is so common a fantasy amongst people that it is utterly mainstream in books and movies) in most cases it does not rise to the level of actual pedophilia.

And unilaterally tarring it with that brush does nothing but hide the multitude of issues with these fics and stifles discussion about what is actually wrong with them.

38 would be the beginning of middle-age in a muggle. That's when the ol' "midlife crisis" often seems to start.

** Yeah even 1 year difference is a huge deal in most high schools. Not all 13 year olds have gone through puberty yet, for a 16 year old to have a crush on one is pretty gross. I don't mind as much when people are in 7th and 5th year, it's a little more palatable, but if the romance doesn't kick in till they're both over 18 it's even better. A 2-3 year gap during and pre-puberty is a much bigger deal than a 2-3 year gap when everyone a consenting adult.

Most of the fics I've read with that gap tend to be more about wish-fulfillment on behalf of the writer than anything else. Either the author themselves are around that age, or they're older and forgot what 13 year olds look like.

Speaking of weird age gaps...shipping Hermione or another female character with either Lupin or Snape (or god forbid Voldemort/Lucius) is even worse...

He'd resent her successes and view them as indicative of her teachers favor rather than her actual ability. I get the impression he'll think of any excuse to not like the people he doesn't want to like. Maybe if something happens that Snape can't deny, like she stops the marauders from bulying, he would approach her with more respect for her person.

***** Hermione's birthday is in September, so she would have been 15 at the ball. Krum's birthday and age are more ambiguous. Ron says he's "only just eighteen or something" at the World Cup, but that means he should have graduated already, unless Durmstrang does things differently, Krum was held back at some point, or Karkaroff did something sneaky to keep him around for an extra year for the tournament. And while any of those is possible, Ron doesn't sound completely sure about Krum's age, so he could just be mistaken. The narration calls him eighteen again before the third task, and that can probably be trusted.

The point is, the age gap between them was either 17/15, which seems reasonable, or 18/15, which is probably just on the wrong side of sketchy.

Unfortunely most authors prefer to have their fics set during Hogwarts years but also want to have a romance in their fic and so they ignore the age gap sometimes. I'm a firm believer that for example Harry/Fluer and Harry/Tonks fics would be a lot better if they took place post Hogwarts when the age gap is more appropriate.

Also, age gaps happened in canon too. Remadora, Bill/Fleur for example.

I think part of the attraction between Bill and Fleur was that she was a quarter Veela and was described as having "breathtaking beauty". Obviously, there was more to Bill and Fleur's relationship than her looks but I think it played a big part in his initial attraction to her.

However, I do agree in that guys in their late 20s are typically not looking for 20 year olds (and I'm speaking from experience). I'm friends with a couple (the guy is 30 and his girlfriend is 27), yet the guy's youngest brother (I think he's 23 or 24) is crushing hard on his brother's girlfriend. And that's not even mentioning the fact that the youngest brother is engaged. It's craziness with them!

******* It isn't necessarily always true, but consider the bad points of younger women.

1. They often do not really know what they are looking for especially in regards to relationships. For a good guy, this can be worrisome because they can cause him a lot of trouble, but for a bad guy this is great because he can manipulate her more easily.

2. They often do not take relationships seriously and consequently make very serious mistakes This may have something to do with the fact that many your age have children.

Of course some are very level headed at this age, but most women will admit that they were pretty clueless and reckless about relationships when they were 20 years old. Me for instance, I was good at picking out which older men (late 20's or early 30's) were not good for me, but the ones who I was interested in probably didn't want the drama that often comes with dating someone my age. Maybe it would have worked out with the right guy, but it also could have went horribly wrong.

It was commented at the end of GoF that Bill and Fleur were seeing a lot of each other already, and she was still in her final year of school.

Then again, she would have been 17 or 18, which isn't too young for someone who's 23/24.

It's only a recent thing that makes big age gaps "wrong", anyway. I know a guy, now in his 80s, who's very happily married to a women who he first asked out at 21 - when she was 14. Maybe that's a little extreme, but you can see from that that happy relationships can happen with age gaps like that, even starting young.

** I think it comes down to several things personally but two things I haven't seen mentioned before in this thread are first I think many authorsput themselves in the place of a character when they write at least for the poorer authors which is where I've seen this most often with the end result being a much younger character being with characters who are way too old. Second with the male being too young I've seen a lot of comments over the years showing that the guy being underage or way younger isn't wrong or as wrong as when it's a much younger girl at least. It's possible that they are following this logic to some degree. I'm sure there are other factors and reasons but these are the two I came to when thinking about this a while ago.

Personally I'm not a fan of it and I've run into some Absolutely horrible things over the years. Note that I'm looking at this from the perspective of someone who reads primarily Harry focused stories which I'm sure has had some effect on my conclusions.
