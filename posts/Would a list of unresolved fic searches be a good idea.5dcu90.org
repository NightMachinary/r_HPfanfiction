So I was looking through old threads on this subreddit that involve searching for a particular fic. A fairly large amount of the fics people were looking for don't get found in the thread at all. So it occurred to me, what if we kept a list of all the times someone was looking for a fic and didn't find it, in some format or another? That way, if someone knew what it was, but didn't see the original thread looking for it, they could post in the thread listing them all, saying that they've found it.

Just a little thought.

** If they don't post in the original thread, how would OP know that the fic was found? Maybe tag them in it? Most folks who are looking for a specific fic don't haunt this subreddit looking for the answer forevermore so they would never see that the fic was found if it was posted in a separate thread.

*** On the flip side, some sort of central fic search thread could be useful for getting more eyes on peoples' searches. If there was just a monthly/quarterly search thread that people posted what they were looking for, more people would probably skim down through the thread and go "Oh, I know that one, it's X", where they might just completely skip "LF a particular fic" posts when browsing the subreddit.
