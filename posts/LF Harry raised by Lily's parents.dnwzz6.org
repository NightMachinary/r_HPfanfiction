I know Lily and Petunia's parents died before Voldemort attacked the Potters (can't remember how), but was wondering what the story could look like if they hadn't and Harry could be raised by Lily's blood relations who actually liked him. Is there something like that out there?


** Oooo that sounds really interesting! I hope there is.

** I can only think of a single fic where Lily's parents are even alive and interacted with.
