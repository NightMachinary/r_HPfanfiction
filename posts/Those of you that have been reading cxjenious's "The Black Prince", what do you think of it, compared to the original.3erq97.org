I loved The Prince That was Promised, but have yet to read The Black Prince. I just reread the original a few weeks ago and don't really want to bother reading The Black Prince until it's in new territory. I am curious about how good it is and what's different, though.


** There has been some subtle changes but so far no major deviation from the original. Hope he would update faster so we can see where the plot goes. Love his work but its slow.

#+begin_quote
  He remembered being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the 2nd son of the King, a spare, but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.

** Most of the rewrite has been editing but there are some significant changes (i.e. the scene with Aeryn).\\
It's not that long yet so you might as well read the new version.

*** Do you mean the rape scene?

I'm not going to read it again when there's nothing new. If there aren't significant changes, there's no point to reading it until it catches up.

**** There are changes to the scene. Mostly how Harry handles those responsible.

**** I would wait a couple months for more updates then. It's not caught up yet, even if their are a similar number of if chapters.

** So far there are hardly any differences, just a rewrite. But I am looking forward to Harry's interactions with the Lannisters, which is where the old fic stopped! :)

** I read TPtwP a while back so I don't quite remember enough to nit-pick scene by scene. Having said that, and having binge-read the whole of Black Prince last night, I can say it feels somehow cleaner. More refined and focused. The new version has its ideas in order a little better, and it definitely benefits from the author having a better idea where everything is going.

** I think it's pretty good, compared to the original. But I might be biased.
