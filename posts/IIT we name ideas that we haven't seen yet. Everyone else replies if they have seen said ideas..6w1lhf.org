*** Hmm...what was that fic where Dumbledore and Harry went back in time together? 'Mysterious Thing, Time' by Blueowl I think.

There's a brief scene where Voldemort tries to create a horcrux with Nagini while he has Harry's blood in his veins (you know, from a certain resurrection ritual), and Harry's residual magic in that blood destroys the horcrux and Nagini while calling it an abomination or somesuch. I don't remember the specifics.

I can also vaguely remember some other fic where more magic was put in the world or something like that. The only bits I can remember were some people who tried to do something to a garden or castle being turned into statues, and that Kreacher along with other house-elves became taller and greener from the increase in magic.

**** The interesting thing about Voldemort's horcruxes is that they /are/ what I would call Black magic. He violently tore his soul into pieces to achieve the entirely unnatural effect of undeath. So Voldemort really is the baddest Dark wizard on the block, if we're going by the average Dark wizard. I just can't help but think there are others who have gone even further than he, because Voldemort isn't really a Black magic practitioner, just a Dark wizard who performed a Black ritual several times over.

***** I once came up with the idea of a horcrux that, rather than just being 'split your soul so you live longer', was actually 'let a demon you summoned take your soul and put it in an object so /it/ can stay forever on the mortal plane (or until its horcrux is destroyed)'.

****** That reminds me of a fic. Can't remember what, but Voldemort summoned a demon and allowed it to possess his body, giving him immortality. Or something.

Horcruxes really do need a ramping up, though. As they are now they're just a fetch quest mcguffin. I prefer them as a type of personal immortality, but you really need to raise the consequences and general effects. It's literally a bleeding, ragged edge piece of your very soul. Being a piece of your soul, you would be compelled to place it in a significant spot and check up on it often, just to reassure yourself that it's still there and you're still safe. The horcrux itself would bleed into its surroundings the hatred and malice that created it; The Room of Requirements would become like a miniature haunted house where all the chairs and baubles came alive and tried to murder you. The cave would create the fear potion naturally, no trap installment needed, and you would walk across a frozen lake to get to it. Once the locket is taken, the inferi break through the ice and cut off your escape. The vault would have this giant dragon made out of gold with the chalice in its head or something.

Just needs /more/ for me to take it seriously. Although as it is now, to be fair, making a horcrux is basically taking a hammer and crucifying yourself to the living world with the souls of other people, which is pretty fucking metal when you think about it.

Ramping up the effects also emphasizes the fact that Voldemort is completely psychotic, because having one is taxing enough on the maker and the world around him. And Voldemort made /seven/.

BTW the story's good in the beginning but Harry doesn't really mature and it turns into a cuddle-fest and low-quality slash-romance fic as it gets on. It's very weird for me to say that having actual smut would be an /improvement/ for it (as it would necessitate a certain level of emotional maturity from Harry and Draco that they don't currently have).

** Wrong Boy who lived fic where Harry isn't somehow treated like trash, and ends up supporting his sibling or fight along side them.

Instead of the usual BS about his parent's spoiling the shit out of their child they treat them normally and are a fairly happy childhood.

Then when Voldemort revives himself of course Harry's going to fight.

Bonus points if someone refers to Harry as the Boy/Girl who lived right hand. Just to make the prophecy still match.

Though, by "Magical Nonhuman" I meant VERY nonhuman, as in not based on humans in any way. To use canon terminology, in Fantastic Beasts (the book, not the movie), Newt talks in the introduction about Beasts - those capable of understanding and shaping Wizarding law - and Beings - unable to understand and/or shape law. House Elves classify as Beings, so not exactly what I was hoping for. Sorry, I should've been more clear.

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition.

** Too much obliviation creates a split personality who can access all the locked memories, and most of Harry's childhood magic is so locked away. More is added to this split persona by Lockhart in year 2 before a close encounter with the Dementors breaks the partition and either switches which personality is in front or merges them. Could also result in a regular binary split personality which changes due to circumstance.

** Just had another though: Organic Transfiguration, aka Fleshcrafting. One could specialize in human transfigurations and act as a plastic surgeon for wizards, or one could mass produce transfigured animals, and since transfigured animals act as you mean them to, not as the animal naturally does, it's easy to make a loyal horde. Just get some raw materials and whip up an incubator. Longer and more complex, but much more highly tailored to your needs, and scales well.

** - A story where the pranking isn't dickish.\\
- A long story about a student going into a different realm, or something similar. (Writing something like that right now, but it's short so far and idk if i'll finish it).\\
- A fic that explores the fact that the horcruxes are sentient, and are locked into objects without a body for many years. (This makes how sane the diary horcrux amazing)\\
- Diary!Tom Riddle gets a body somehow, and joins the school the next year as a student or a teacher.\\
- A fic that explores magic deeply, I was hoping methods of rationality would do this but it was mostly ranting for a while and then jumping to the answer.
- Where pureblood families all have some sort of magic that is for their line. Like Potters would have something to do with pottery, Bones would perhaps have something to do with necromancy or burials, etc.\\
- Voldemort manages to steal the philosophers stone.\\
- Dumbledore isn't the current headmaster, but after (or during) the war he decided to become minister instead.\\
- Harry Potter (or someone else) time travels to Riddles time and becomes friendly with Riddle but it doesn't turn into a relationship between them.\\
