** There were a couple by the same author on AFF who wrote one where Slughorn jacked and fantasized about Lily, another one where Remus decides to make a Tonks sandwich with Moody with kind of dubious consent, and another one where, while lighthearted but kind of self-aware in its own fuckedupness, Hermione hooks up with Sirius the summer before OotP. They also wrote an all-inclusive orgy of the Order of the Phoenix which I'm pretty sure was just a joke, but it was still pretty well-written for what it was.

This is a Ron/Hermione/Harry fic that centers around the trio (but mostly Harry) recovering from ordeals (that are explained in explicit detail as they happen). This fic is hard on the soul and is the first time I've ever felt actual remorse for masturbating to another person's suffering. I can't tell you how it ends because I just lost steam during the last 10k words and couldnt pick the fic up again, if anyone who's read it wants to pm me the ending it would be very appreciated.

** There was one HHr fic where Harry and Hermione start giving each other oral during the first year. And then in 2nd year Harry and Cat!Hermione go at it.

** I read a fic when I was first starting out where the Giant Squid does more than save Mr.Ceevley from downing in the lake...

it got way to graphic way to quickly....

** I don't apologise for the things I enjoy, but then they are also mostly very tame. The most risqué thing I genuinely enjoyed was called "sloth" or something like it and had ron/ginny incest.

** I recall clicking into a Sirius/Hermione fic because there were no tags and the summary sounded interesting and it was just Sirius as a dog banging Hermione.

** I had no idea what I was getting into, and I didn't finish it, but it was on AO3 and involved Harry turning Hermione into a corpse before having his way with her. (By 'turning into a corpse' I mean strangling to death)

I still have no idea what the point was. It was surprisingly well-written in terms of grammar and spelling, but the author didn't seem to enjoy writing it any more than I enjoyed reading it - that is to say, not at all.

I'm not 100% sure on the details, since it's been at least half a year since I stumbled upon it, and I've not exactly been trying my best to remember it, but that's roughly what it was like.

** Now that I think about it, most of the HP smutfics I've read were relatively inoffensive. But fics from /other/ fandoms, on the other hand...

There was one story that killed a little bit of my soul to read, but I couldn't stop. I wasn't aroused at all, just... horrifically fascinated with the depths of depravity the author was willing to go to. And it's wasn't even really all that bizzare, just morally repungant. The fic in question involved pedophilia, but the kid /kind of/ consented and just what the hell.

Remembering it makes my soul hurt.

Sure it's 90% smut, but the 10% where it lambastes canon and JKR's later interviews are gold.
