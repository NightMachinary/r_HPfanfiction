If he's a phoenix animagus and gets reborn as a baby that's fine. Or time travel. Whatever. As long as he's a little shit as a baby with an older brain.


** I can't remember if he acted up but he was definitely a baby in linkffn(Mysterious Thing, Time by Blueowl) .

  The future is lost, so to save it, both Harry and Dumbledore go back the moment it all began - that Halloween night. Of course, things do not go exactly as they had expected. Unspeakables, Wild Magic, Time Travel, Vampires, Bonds, Goblins.

  Albus Dumbledore has delved into worlds unknown, clashed with beings supreme, and discovered that of which should have been left well alone. If anyone is to follow in his footsteps, it's Iris Potter. Together, the two hope to stop Voldemort's second rise to power. A fem!Harry's journey of eldritch mysteries, time travel, and Dumbledore's idea of education and guidance. No bashing.
