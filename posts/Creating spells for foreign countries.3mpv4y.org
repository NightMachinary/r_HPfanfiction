I've been wanting to write a story involving the Japanese school of magic, Mahoutokoro, for a while now. The obstacle that keeps coming up is magic. It feels a bit cheap to just say that they use all the exact same spells as the British, but I have no clue how the incantations would work. There isn't really a dead language to base the magic on. Does anyone have some advice on how to go about it?


** I'd say unless you plan on going in depth and AU on how the magic system works, just go with stringing concepts together, even if it doesn't quite make sense in the Japanese language. Remember that HP spells are psuedo-Latin that are heavy on concept at lite on proper grammar: slug vomiting hex is /slugulus eructo/ or slug burp, even though /slug/ has Nordic etymology, /-ulus/ is Latin origin and the actual Latin term for slug is /limax/. Not all of the spells are based on dead languages either, and Latin was not always dead.

 

If you stress to much over it, you end up having to talk about /why/ magic responds to certain words, and that can get messy.

** My theory, canon-compatible: the wand is enchanted with a primary casting language, usually something out-of-use to differentiate from non-casting conversation. As the wand and owner grow and learn, they expand the repertoire based on hearing about and trying other spells.

Therefore, a Japanese-made wand might have incantations in classical (pre-Heian) Japanese, or they may derive from the more influential Sino-Tibetan traditions, since elements of Tibetan and Chinese cultures were adopted and adapted over centuries along with the migrating religions.

*** Thank you for actually knowing something about Japanese historical linguistics.

** In which language will you be writing your story? If it is indeed in English, then I would recommend using the same spells. But if you will be writing in language other than English (Japanese perhaps) or if you have adequate knowledge of Japanense itself which is to say something more than -san, -kun, -kawai and etc (don't mean to sound rude) then you can experiment with Japanese words.

As others have pointed out, don't fret too much on the words themselves. JKR's world is supposed to be vague and finding explanations / details for everything within will rob it of the charm.

** I think using the same incantations could work if you provide adequate explanation for why they're the same.

In the Japanese translation of canon, they didn't change it at all, just copied the spells into Katakana. Search for "ハリー・ポッターシリーズの魔法一覧" on Japanese wikipedia if you want to see.

As others have said, there is classical Japanese, which is mostly dead. Since we only know how they wrote, it would be a lot of trouble to think about the pronunciation. If you want to do different incantations with solid background, I'd suggest checking myths, fairy tales we have.

** Magic itself is the universal language and predates the existence of written word and spoken word. Pretty much, the point is you can do whatever you want. A stunning spell is a stunning spell regardless of what language its in, and once a wizard starts learning how to cast silently, the language becomes irrelevant regardless.

** did you check how the Japanese translated the spells? I know that in French some spells were changed to sound better to a French ear (stupefy is stupéfix, crucio is endoloris, Imperio is Impero, and so in my headcanon that's how the French say it in the Potterverse)... it could give you ideas. (I don't mean read it in Japanese, but there has to be a refference to the Japanese translation somewhere on the web).

** Can they cast magic through some other means than shouting an incantation and pointing a stick? Maybe other, especially non-European, countries don't have the same methods of channeling magic and prefer to do it instead through amulets or talismans, or by hand and body movements (though please don't go full Naruto).

** It helps if you're intimately familiar with the culture you're trying to do the magic system for. For example, you could weave elements of Shintoism into your Japanese magic system.

** There's old Japanese, though I have no idea where you could find out enough about it to actually use it.

Another option could be to just make up a japanese sounding language, and have that as an ancient wizarding language. You could have it use the same script as normal Japanese, in the way that Mandarin and Cantonese have the same written part, but are different when spoken.

You could also just use latin spells. Maybe the Roman empire was the first to standardize magic, and they spread it to the rest of the world.

Do they have to use spells/incantations/wands? Maybe they should use something else, like martial arts, songs, acting, or even just have them focus more on visualization.

You could also use a mix of oriental languages. Some spells used in Britain use a mixture of other European languages, in addition to Latin and English. It would be likely that Japanese spells would also use a mix of languages.
