Preferably focusing on a platonic relationship between her and Harry or as romance but not the focus. I'd like it to be over 100k words.


** Twelve Dark Moons is a good one (even if the pairing in this may turn you off, its LL/LV).. But I dunno, I found it an engaging read. Luna in this one is a bit older so a little less zany than HP Luna. It's completed too, so a big plus for me!

  Listening to Luna usually yielded results. It might not be the results he usually wanted or expected, but results all the same. Though falling into another world when all he had wanted was to find out what Malfoy was up to was beyond even Harry's wildest dreams.

** It's not 100k+ and doesn't have Harry as a main character but it's a fantastic fic:

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
