People like to write Harry's abuse as way worse then in canon, when really the canon version of abuse is pretty bad. I'd like to see the characters maybe getting Harry away from the Dursley's, either before Hogwarts or during, and helping him heal from the abuse.

I'd rather it not be worse then the canon abuse, but wouldn't mind if it was.

NO Dumbledore and/or Weasley bashing please.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on any site, not just fanfiction.net Would rather NOT have OP Harry. Would prefer it to be completed


** Copypasta: This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you're not endlessly wallowing in sadness.

New comments: It /is/ OP!Harry, however, that part of him doesn't really come into play like it does in other fics. This is because, the ending happens early in first year Hogwarts before it can be useful.

While it doesn't have Dumbledore bashing per se, it does have Dumbledore making mistakes consistently. Though he has a character arc with that, where he strives and does so better, so it ends up all good.

Honestly, this is exactly what you're looking for. Just, get some tissues if you end up binging chapters.
