OBLIGATORY: THE FORMAT IS OFF BECAUSE I AM COPYING EVERYTHING FROM MY DRIVE TO REDDIT THROUGH MY PHONE. MY PHONE IS NOT GOOD WITH FORMAT. ENJOY THE STORY.

“Good morning and welcome to Balboa's Diner. What may I get for you all?”, asked the waitress, a mid-40s lady with a 50 style haircut.

“I will have the Sunday meal with a cup of black coffee,” said Katie.

“The rest of us will have the chocolate chip flapjacks. I will also have black coffee and the little girl will have apple juice. They...” I said pointing to Harry and his friends, “will have cokes.”

“Will that be all?” asked the waitress.

“No thank you,” I said, giving her the menus.

The waitress walks away while I turn to my girlfriend.

“So, about the plan?” I asked her.

“I don't think it is a good plan. Didn't you told me that you and your father are not in good terms?” asked Katie.

“I did, but the books never stated where the fountain is at. It told us about the trials but not the location. If we got my father, he will know about it and he can helps us on the search. Anyways the reason he and I are not on good terms is because of a fallout about me joining the military. He wanted me to be college educated like him. He didn't want me to joining the military because of his fear of losing another love one.” I explained.

“I know, but do you even know where he lives?” asked Katie keeping her voice quiet.

“Yeah, I found out that he lives in a big cabin in the middle of the woods. He always like isolating himself from the world. So do we agree on it?” I said looking into Katy's eyes.

“Sure, but I hope your father doesn't shoot us,” Katie said.

“Yeah,” I said.

--------------

I bring the car to a stop as we were approaching the location to where my father lives. We all got out of the car and started walking towards the house. As we approach the cabin, Hermione spoke up.

“Um, Donny, not to be rude but, why are we here?” asked Hermione.

“My old man lives here, and he can help us with our search for the fountain. He has been searching for all of his life and found out the location only just a couple of weeks ago.” I replied.

As I reached for the doorbell, I heard what sounds to me like a rifle cocking behind us.

“Who goes there?” a man said, with a deep baritone voice.

“Your son,” I said without turning my head.

“If you are really my son, then tell me something that my son knows?” asked the man.

“The hills passed us when we are young, but the sky is always with us,” I said lowering my hands.

“Donald,” said the man lowering the rifle.

“Hello dad,” I said walking up towards him.

My father slaps me on my face when I approached him. Everyone was surprised that happened.

“Ow, what was that for?” I yelped rubbing my cheek.

“That was for not going to college,” said my father.

“I did what I had to do. Mom would even agree with me.” I fire back.

“Don't bring your mother into this. And who are these people? These don't look like people you would usually hang with Donald.” my father asked eyeing Harry and his friends.

“Long story short, these people are not from our reality but from an alternate reality where magic is real. An evil man came from their reality to here to look for the fountain of youth. They came and asked for my help and so I decide to help them.” I explained.

“You guys are the anomalies!” said my Dad, wide eye and looking at the wizards. He was walking around them for a good 10 to 15 seconds. For a man in his 60s, my father is a very strong man. A tall man with a great built, no one will know that he was an archaeologist.

“Um, Donny, what does he mean by we are the anomalies,” asked Ron looking at me.

“I don't know, hey dad, what do you mean by what you said?” I asked him.

“I have been receiving read outs that there was a spike of energy in an out of the world proportion,” said my father turning back to me.

“What?” asked Harry completely confused to what my father was saying.

“It means that there was a bend in our reality and I am guessing in your reality too. That is why you jumped to our world,” explain my father, “we should all go inside now, it is getting dark now and you don't want to be out here when it gets dark.”

Everybody started to go inside the cabin, my father walking next to me. “Who's the kid?” my father asked pointing to the four year old girl.

“We were staying at a hotel when we were attack by the people hunting us. The red headed family, Katie, and the girl were the only survivors. Her parents were dead. Everybody else in the hotel were dead. Men, women, and children,” I said tearing up. My father came close to me and hug me.

“Look son, it is not your fault, no matter the feud between me and you, you only objective is to protect the family. Now come on, everybody is waiting inside,” said my father, having a smiling on his rough face.

When my dad and I enter the house, thousands of memories came flooding back to me. While everybody else were amazed, I just remember the time when my father was happy, when my mother was alive, and when I was still a young boy playing war with my friends. My father's house is what you accept a cabin in Pennsylvania and in the middle of the woods will look like. A lot of taxidermy everywhere and a fire roaring in the fireplace. Pictures of my mother, my father, and I are on the mantle on the fireplace. The smell of firewood and smoke meat filled the room. While the family was taking a seat on the leather couches, my father sat in his old rocking chair.

“You have a really nice house, Mr. Maricino,” complimented Molly.

“Thank you. Now I am guessing that you will need my help with the search for the fountain of youth?” asked my father.

“Yes, please sir, do you know where to locate it?” asked Hermione.

“I do, just give me a moment,” my father reply.

My dad got up from his chair and went to his study. He came back five minutes later holding what seems to be a worn out journal. He sat back down his chair and hold the journal in one hand, said, “This journal, for which I am holding, will help you on your journey. This has a map with no names. Only symbols. This also has the answers to the four challenges you will be facing. I am giving it to you because I am at the age where my body is not that well. Keep this journal safe. If it falls in the wrong hands, then there is no telling what bad things can happen.”

He gives me the journal and I put it in my pocket. He turns to the golden trio and warns them, “The quest that you are on is not an ordinary quest. You guys are alien to this world and don'tknow a lot of the laws and traditions so be prepare. Also, the quest that you are on, is not only aquest for immortality, but this is a quest between good and evil. Between the light and dark. There is not going to be second place. You guys have to be prepare. And seeing that you guys are from a world with magic, my son will need to teach you on how defend yourself using a variety of tools.” He turns to me, “my son, you can take them to the back and teach them how to use a gun. I have many guns you can lend them, so don't worry about that," my father explained.

“Yes sir, but I will need someone to take care of the little girl,” I said looking around the room.

“We will look after her while you guys are gone,” said Molly standing up.

“I can let you guys stay here. You guys can take the empty rooms,” suggested my father.

“Thank you so much,” said Molly.

“Katy, you going be with me when we head out, ok,” I said looking at Katy.

“Sure, what about the younger Weasleys though?” asked Katy.

“Its fine, we can stay here?” said Fred.

“Yeah, we don't want to ruin your guy's moment. Anyways, it is better few people go. It seems less suspicious,” added George.

“Ok, well that's that. Harry, Ron, Hermione, meet me in the woods for the training. I am going to get your equipment.” I order.
