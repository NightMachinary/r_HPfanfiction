** I quite liked it. A shame it's incomplete, but the way the author developed Ginny felt different and authentically Slytherin while remaining true to her character. Also, it's rare that an X-in-Slytherin fic handles Harry well as a secondary character, but I think this one did.

Re the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3nph25/book_club_the_changeling/cvq6hir][discussion questions]]: 1 & 2 -- An author can do a lot with the Weasleys once you get outside canon Harry's rose-tinted view of the family. (JOdel over at redHen for instance takes [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/weasleys.html][a particularly dim view of them]].) I liked the characterization here. It wasn't unthinking bashing, but it does reveal the how parochial the family can sometimes be. We also shouldn't discount how much family Molly lost to the Death Eaters in the ‘70s, a group she presumably associates with Slytherin house. Slytherins killed her brothers and in the wizarding world where blood matters and rule of law is a recent and somewhat flimsy innovation family takes on added importance.

The discussion of the tattoo in chapter 3 is a deft bit of writing; it concisely communicates why Molly might react so harshly to Ginny's tattoo in particular and to her sorting in general. It's also a quiet allusion to issues of women's control over their bodies and the sort of shaming that happens in real life when people are taken advantage of in ways like Ginny was. Gender commentary that doesn't overshadow the story, just deepens it. Well done.

3 -- The parallel with Sirius is, in hindsight, obvious and I'm glad it gets developed a bit. Who better to empathize with someone in an unexpected house, at odds with her family? His inclusion and subsequent death is also a useful narrative device to pull Harry and Ginny together.

4 -- I think the idea of being “good” for Ginny gets at why she ended up in Slytherin in the first place. She wants to excel, to be her own person. For all that her first couple years in Slytherin are filled with confusion I think the underlying motivation was there. This whole fic is in many ways an account of Ginny coming into her own as a character, not as a member of the Weasley clan or as an annex to Harry but as her own self. Slytherin ends up making her harder than canon Ginny might have been (at least before book 7) but the independent streak and ferocity are straight from canon, just channeled slightly differently and tempered with a bit more Slytherin cunning.

5 -- I think Ginny adjusts in this story because she has to. I think this is true to canon but not explicitly written in since we see so little of her life during book 7. From context, though, she seems to adjust to being an opposition leader at Hogwarts fairly well, again out of necessity.

6 -- Surely the title is mostly an allusion to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling][folklore concept of a changeling]]. The good Gryffindor Ginny was somehow switched with an evil Slytherin one; this is something she mentally wrestles with especially in the first few chapters but really throughout the story. Her anxiety about whether it is possible for her to be a Weasley at all, much less a “good” one is rooted in her insecurity about what her sorting means.

7 -- The Parlor is an agglomeration of tropes ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolClubsAreSeriousBusiness][1]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse][2]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser][3]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinkOrSwimMentor][4]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterApprenticeChain][5]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPowerfulBystander][6]]) that could have been plot-breakingly bad and cliché, but actually manages to work well here. Dumping Ginny into Slytherin without any help at all would be too cruel, and given that this fic robs her of some of the role models she had in canon she definitely needs some new ones. I also like fics that widen the Potterverse a bit beyond what we saw through the Harry-filter in canon, where I always found it strange that the Hogwarts upperclassmen play so little a role. We only ever even learn the names of a handful. Reasonable perhaps that the rather withdrawn harry doesn't venture outside of his circle of close friends much, but surely Hermione might have sought out some tutoring, or someone in Harry's year might have had an older sibling besides the Weasleys? Outside of Cedric, a quick mention in the DA in book five, and quidditch we barely meet any older students. A house as status-obsessed as Slytherin is also a natural fit for this sort of informal club, and the mention of the darker home life of many Slytherin students feels authentic and is another facet canon didn't explore much.

8 -- Her ferocity, her independent streak, her alternating love of and exasperation with family, her attraction to Potter (though spun a slightly different way in this fic), her strong leadership potential.

*** The Changling aside, really intriguing read over at Red Hen. We as a sub should do a Weasley family discussion post. I don't know that I necessarily agree with everything written, but it was a fascinating delving into the workings of the Weasleys...

I have to say, I didn't realize the idea of "The Parlor" or some such club was such a pervasive thing in fiction. Looking back, I'm really glad that the idea of it does work well, because I felt that Ginny's interactions with the Parlor girls was a cool mysterious element of the story. I think one of my favorite scenes was Ginny realizing that Smita didn't /need/ the group the way the other girls did; I feel like it make Ginny stop taking her cool girl's club for granted... Almost a turning point of her relationship with the group, if you will.

*** On your trope dissection in point 7 - The Parlor looks like a Misfit Mobilization Moment waiting to happen too (albeit not in the traditional sense where it's a ragtag bunch of misfits but a collective of people with socially frowned upon interests and ambitions). Though like you said, it just goes to show that tropes aren't all bad when used well.

** (Going to copy/paste from my previous review of this fic. Some spoilers follow.)

What's great about this fanfic is that it's got some huge "filters" - like, if you're not into Ginny, Quidditch, or canon rehash, you can just skip it.

If you do, you're missing out, though. It's quite well written, and there's some pretty stellar characterization.

So, negatives -

Ginny's OC friends (Tobias and Smita) are pretty cookie-cutter. They follow familiar paths, and while those paths are well-executed, they aren't exactly breaking any new ground.

The plot is extreme canon rehash. I can't think of a single time Ginny being in Slytherin actually had an impact on the canon plotline. Not that it's a bad thing, necessarily - it's more of a stylistic choice, and I appreciate the attention to detail - but some parts I just found myself skimming because there was no tension, because I knew what was going to happen.

Slytherin OC Antonia is kiiiiiinda over the top awesome. She's literally never not the mysterious older girl with all the answers. I mean, I totally ship Ginny/Antonia after the kiss, but she's still a less fleshed-out version of Ophilia Karait.

Harry gets thrown under the bus a bit. You always understand where Ginny's coming from, but after a while it starts to feel like a little much.

Action scenes (Quidditch / fighting) are pretty bleh. You get the feeling the author just kinda wants them to be over with. They're never straight-out bad, but some of them are quite rushed.

And the positives:

A few characters that appear only a few times are done really, really well. A+ characterization of Fleur. Snape came off well, too (by that I mean the canon voice felt real.) Luna was like a B+. Fred and George, very solid.

The writing's extremely clean. I don't think I saw a single typo, which is remarkable. Beyond just being free of errors, though, it's smooth and flows well and has all the pace/structure elements of a good story. Like, Quidditch isn't just tacked on. It's a big part of Ginny's character, it informs a huge arc, it matters.

Ginny feels believably "Ginny" as well as believably Slytherin. Which, when you think about it, is a pretty high bar to clear. She feels like her canon self - the good, and the bad. All that fanon!Ginny nonsense - not even a whiff of it, which is great.

So yeah, overall, if you get the urge for something very JKR-like, very close to the original series, but focusing on different characters, give it a shot.

Echoing Pers, it's only gotten stronger, and Year 7 could be quite special indeed.

4/5

*** I think this fic is the only one in which I've really read and enjoyed the Quidditch games. I loath reading about matches, but something about the way they were written here really made me enjoy them... I'd be curious about why you think they were pretty bleh and rushed.

Otherwise, I agree with many of your comments, especially about the characterizations. I loved this author's Fleur too! I also really liked the interactions we got with Ginny and Harry... They felt pretty believable, and kinda filled a niche for me that I feel like canon may have missed the mark on a little bit.

** Finally read this fic as it's been recommended several times, but I haven't had the chance to get around to it. Going with the questions from [[/u/lurkielurker]]...

1) Really enjoyed the characterization of the several Weasleys in regards to Ginny's house. I think each of them react accordingly in a way that fits their canon personality. The only thing I would say is that all of them travel the same arc (aside from Billl) from weariness to grudging acceptance of Ginny-in-Slytherin. I would have liked to see more contrast between the different Weasley family members

2) I don't necessarily think the elder boys were running from anything. It's a nice line, but it's mostly a throw away as Bill, Charlie, and Percy's motivations are never explored

3) The most obvious parallel would be that Ginny and Sirius are, in a way, ostracized from their own family. Sirius, through his beliefs, and Ginny for being in Slytherin. Unfortunately, none of these contrasts are expanded upon in the short amount of time Ginny and Sirius share scenes

4) In terms of being "good", canon-Hermione and Annerb-Ginny both flirt the line with doing what is right. The difference between them is that Hermione would have never allowed for the Gregor situation to occur while Ginny feels much more vindictive in that regard. The blurriness between doing what is right and what is good never gets challenged, however. I hope to see an opportunity where Ginny has to decide between her friendships in Slytherin and what the Order demands. Then, we will see whether Ginny is capable of doing what is "right"

5) It's impossible to extrapolate if her adaptability is something canon-Ginny can do because we don't actually know a lot about canon-Ginny. In the same way that Anerb-Ginny doesn't know a lot about the background of the trio, we don't know a lot about the background of canon-Ginny. I will say that the fic does an excellent job of exploring and progressing her character though.

6) I don't think the title refers to any magical ability. The Changeling refers to Ginny's transformation from the typical Gryffindor-Weasley to the more grey Slytherin-Weasley. Going back to point 4, she has to straddle the line between the loyalty for her family and the loyalty to Slytherin.

7) I am unsure of the relationship between Antonia, Ginny, and the Parlor in general. Thus far, it has proven to be a niche little club, but I struggle to see the overall purpose it serves to the story besides world-building. Why does Antonia want Ginny as her mentee? Is there a larger purpose in regards to who belongs to the Parlor? While it serves to give character Antonia, Ginny, and Hogwarts, I'm still struggling to see how it will effect the overall story.

8) Again - it is hard to compare and contrast with canon-Ginny as canon-Ginny is painted with very large strokes. I can say that the same abrasiveness to authority, wittiness, and loyalty to her friends exists with both Ginny's.

The fic is very well polished and has great structure. It is very rare to find a fic that is so well built and as a result, it never feels bloated or wastes our time.

The flip side of that coin is that the fic often feels like a breezy autobiography. Annerb avoids going into detail about the larger events of canon, but even in events that involve Ginny (the chamber, the department of mysteries, the death eaters sneaking into hogwarts), we are left to assume the events play out the same the way they did in canon. While I appreciate not having to rehash events we already know, the resulting effect is that the fic lacks a certain depth. No one wants to see so many words invested in writing about the battles or events we already know, but I want to care about Ginny more than just her attachment to Quidditch.

I actually thought the way the author handled this gave us a really good picture of how the rest of Hogwarts understood Harry's school days to be. Reading the books through Harry's narrative definitely lets readers in to almost every plot point... whereas all students besides Ron and Hermione are super in the dark about what's happening. The Changeling seemed to tell the story how students on the fringes of the action behaved and responded to things like Voldemort's return. I thought it was an interesting take. The fact that the fic was well written certainly helped.

** Beautifully written and engaging, though the prose was a bit purple at times.

I especially liked the OC's, Smita and Tobias were both believable and it's nice to see another Indian character aside from the Patil twins, since the end of the British Empire there have been *a lot* of Indian and Pakistani immigrants and statistically, quite a few would be magical.

To be honest, I expected to see a lot more doubt and self-hate, especially in the earlier chapters, if you grew up in a household that frequently told you that Slytherins were evil, and you were sorted into that house, as an impressionable 11 year old, wouldn't you think you were evil by proxy?

All in all, thoroughly enjoyed this story, and I'm looking forward to it's conclusion!
