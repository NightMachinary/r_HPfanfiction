:END:
What's the fic where Dumbledore, Voldy and Harry are recognized in a category of wizard that is just ridiculously more powerful and where the Goblet of Fire, contracts, and oaths are used as a tool to bind those powerful wizards.

â€‹

Dumbledore writes a book about it and gives it to Harry.

Anyone remember that fic? I HAVE A MIGHTY NEED! ...please and thank you

  Harry and Hermione are gifted a handwritten book at the beginning of Fourth Year. A book that reveals horrible truths about the world they live in. Prepare for a tougher Harry and a battle focused on the Ministry.
