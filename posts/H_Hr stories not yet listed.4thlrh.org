#+begin_quote
  Explores the close, loving friendship between Hermione and Harry mainly from Hermione's viewpoint. Is it enough to form a devoted life-partnership even if they're not romantically in love? Might their love be just as true? And if so, what could bring them together? The story is fluffy, sometimes sensual, but never smutty or crude, and, of course, has the touch of magic.

#+begin_quote
  3rd through 7th year story, generally canon but with plenty of AU-goodness. Harry struggles to survive his ever-violent relatives during the summer before his third year at Hogwarts. He dreams of Hogsmeade visits and stumbles through the murky waters of steadily growing and complex relationships. Darkness looms in the distance but will they see the darkness lurking from within?

*** linkffn(6360790)

Here is another one. While some chapters are fillers which don't contribute to the overall plot, I found the concept behind the new threat to Harry Potter very interesting. For those of you whom expressed disappointment over the new Dark threat in Cursed Child, I wonder if you might this one more realistic.

** linkffn(darkness ascendant by Cole Pascal) is likely going to be Harry/Hermione but it may end up being H/Hr/OFC or H/OFC or maybe H/Hr/OFC/Tonks if I feel like I'm up to writing a polyamourous quadrangle. (NOT a harem fic as all women will also be involved with each other if I do do it(so if Harry and Tonks are on date night, then Hermione and OFC are on their own date night)).

Or I may write harry as asexual and only involved with anyone sexually to procreate. I dunno yet. I still have a long time to figure it out.
