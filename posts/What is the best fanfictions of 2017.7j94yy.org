Well yall, its that time of year again.... With only 3 weeks left in the year, i think its fair to ask this question...

The only rules are they have to have started being published in 2017. And you gotta link em!

linkffn(Heros Assemble! By Stargon1) is probably the best crossover ive read all year that fits the requirements. Its a harry avengers story, with some nice plot and solid character work.

For noncrossover fans i recommend linkffn(Stepping Back by theblack'sresurgence) . A time travel fic, and imo one of the better ones out there. Characters are solid, there is progression in each chapter, and it doesnt feel like Harry is a gary stu.


** Pinned this post. I'm going to moderating this to remove any fics that weren't published in 2017. :)

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

***** I think it's a decent enough fic, and is fairly riveting. Is it the pinnacle of great literature? Certainly not. Is it the unique fic that we hoped would define 2017? Most definitely not. It was good, but the overhype and belief that it would be this highly unique fic that would break the mold caused a complete reversal of this sub's attitude towards it once it became clear that our expectations were all dashed.

******* It was around six months back I think. A lot of people were really hyped, and kept linking it in various rec threads. I remember seeing that 3 chapters of the story were out in the ffnbot link. I usually stick to completed fics so I just ignored it. I still haven't got around to reading it though, so I don't remember exactly when people became disillusioned, but I /think/ it was around chapter twelve, could be earlier.

** The best piece of writing I've read this year is hands down "The Augurey" by La-Matrona.

The premise is this: After the Final Battle Harry feels the weight of the casualties on his shoulders. Vowing that no child, even that of a death eater, should have to be raised an orphan - Harry, with Hermione's help, start the hunt for one child born in secret.

It disregards the epilogue and looks to utilize only the best of Cursed Child. Give it a go!

His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck.

He kept his distance until she was in her 20's, so it didn't really matter at the end. I don't know if it's because James/Lily is one of my favourite pairings but I've always seen them kind of as star-crossed lovers, destined to be together in every possible iteration of the universe, yada-yada.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

I usually don't loike fem!Harry but this series is where instead of Harry there are two twins Jen and Danny Potter. Lily and James survive but Charlus, James's father is killed and Danny is the BWL. Dumbledore hears the prophecy that Jen will be evil and dark so he tries to make her a squib and Lily and James abandon her in the muggle world. She's abused and she is saved by Sirius. There's some great world building and I love how there's all these different types of magic that are explained in depth.

Unfortunately, Voldemort spent his year's sabbatical uncovering secrets that she would have preferred him never learn. Secrets that could now prove deadly for everyone.

** Most of the fics that came to mind have already been mentioned so I'll put forth this one which is a bit different. It's really more of a fanfiction of an existing harry potter fanfic, so if you haven't read the precurser fic it won't make a ton of sense. If you have it's amazing. Also it's a crossover with Pokemon.

Wearing the Faces of Men linkffn(12753962)

Basically the main characters from Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus accidentally teleport to the Pokemon universe, and hilarity ensues.

Here's one passage I particularly liked that should give you a feel for the tone of the fic.

#+begin_quote
  Out loud, Lily wondered, "Wait, that's the goal of your life? Catch all the pokémon and beat the Indigo League? That's all you have to do?"

  Ash seemed a bit confused by this, flushing slightly, "Well, yeah, I guess that's it..."

  But Lily, Lily was dazed, it seemed as if a door inside her mind had been flung open revealing a whole universe of possibilities. Life, as she'd come to understand it, was a wishy-washy mess of meaninglessness. Even as Eleanor Lily Potter, who had the most set road for her in life, there was no clear outcome, no clear goal. But here, in this world, not only were there direct rules like travelling with pokémon, not only was there the guidance of somehow getting Lily and Wizard Lenin their own pokémon, but now the end all be all of life, the very purpose of living, was something clear and definable.

Adults either being 100% pro-Harry or 100% anti, no matter what he does? Check. "He doesn't know what love is"? Check.

** I just finished linkffn(the power of pain by vampirulover) - after a false start where the writing style seemed a little off to me, I finally got into it. I really enjoyed it. It dealt with character growth and change after a sudden time jump, interesting magic and consequences, and frankly a fascinating cause to the plot problem. Currently reading the sequel, which is also complete. There *are* typos and minor grammar errors, but they didn't stand out as too distracting to me, but it might for someone else.

  Five years, it had been five years since the battle for Hogwarts. Five years for the students who suffered that day to move on with their lives. To love, to laugh, to marry. Five years since that fateful day that left the brightest witch of their age confined to a bed at St. Mungo's spell damage ward.

  Lily Evans is happy, twenty-three and protected from a world controlled by Death Eaters by her best friend. But she can't remember anything from Christmas 1979 through Christmas 1981, and two names she doesn't know have come back to her: Harry and James.If you're looking for a happily-ever-after with a baby and a marriage, look elsewhere. Happy endings are for people who didn't betray everything they claimed to hold dear.

****** Even if you consider it worth a read, if I could not get through more than just a few paragraphs it means I am not going to give it a chance.

Look, I get it, I am no literary critic. /But/ I've written enough stuff to know that style matters, and so does orthography, and accurate characterisation, and proper mood, and so on. As such, if I feel that the author is throwing those away I am not going to assume that they've had a bad day but rather that this simply is what they are capable of and that the writing will not improve or at least not significantly enough. If someone does things that I've spent time and effort on making sure are not in anything I write, then to me it gives an impression of someone who does not have a drive to improve, be that impression right or be it wrong.

If that is not an issue for you then all the power to you and have a happy reading time. It very much is an issue for me, however, so my reading of it won't resume.

** BrokenWingsHealed had a pretty good writing streak going this summer, although they appear to have pulled back away from the fandom, based on their latest profile update. The later stories declined in quality slightly (although "There's No Such Thing as a Nargle", their last fic, may appeal to fans of Hermione/Luna friendships), but I would expect to see their first two fics go down in the long run as two of the best Harry/Luna fics ever.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12499983/1/Somehow-You-ll-Just-Know]])

On a similar Harry/Luna note, "An Unbelievable Adventure" by Story Please got the year off to a good start, while "Earl Grey, Little Sugar" by Jem Doe is one of the better Harry/Daphne fics I've seen.

  Harry doesn't expect to enjoy his fifth year back at Hogwarts, and would just as soon be alone on the train... but a few hours with a certain blonde Ravenclaw may have an unexpected effect. A "what-if" variant, grounded in canon, but also inviting you to explore the possibilities. For anybody who appreciates H/L as friends and/or a potential couple.

  Luna Lovegood wondered if she would have a boyfriend someday, and her father hoped that when it happened, she would find the right person. If you like Harry/Luna romance with plenty of "Awww..." moments, Luna/Xeno stories focusing on their father/daughter bond, or stories about the tensions at the intersection of romantic relationships and familial love, this is the story for you.

** Linkffn(Hot for Teacher by MotherofBulls).

A EWE Dramione/Scorose fic. Borrows from some Cursed Child characterizations in the best ways and is easily the funniest fic I've read in a long time. Laugh out loud funny. Rated M.

(In this AU Rose is Ron& Susan Bones' daughter. Albus and Scorpius and Rose are in 3rd year. Harry and Ginny are happily married.)

** Thestra's Calling: Calista Snape Volume III - honestly this series is the best! linkffn(12515645). I highly recommend this series. It's amazing and I think the characterization of Snape is spot on.

Edit: Oh also! Tea, Black linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/10997796/chapters/24497349]]) Snape/OC - very well written characters.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
