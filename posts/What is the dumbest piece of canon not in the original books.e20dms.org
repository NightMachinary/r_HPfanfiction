** For me, it's the ridiculous assertion that Hogwarts is the magic school for the British Isles (total population 71.8 million), with the rest of the world having disproportate populations that they serve. Europe has two schools for the vastly larger population, Beauxbatons for Western Europe (397.5 million) and Durmstrang for Eastern Europe (293 million). Meanwhile, North America (579 million), South America (422.5 million), and Africa (1.2 BILLION) have ONE SCHOOL EACH. Not to mention that Asian schools include ONLY Russia (144.5 million) and Japan (126.8 million) in their catchment areas. The rest of Asia, and all of Australia, have no centralized magic schools.

*** To be fair Rowling mentioned that there are 11 great wizarding schools, she has yet two reveal 4(which are probably in Asia), and Australia's population seems way to small to have a significant wizarding school. But they and other places could have one of the smaller less significant ones Rowling mentioned.

She also mentioned that in most places wizards prefer homeschooling their children, instead of sending them to school, so it seems pretty reasonable that Hogwarts while still having a comparably small number of students would be able to take by itself a significant amount significant amount of students since home schooling isn't really a thing in magical Britain.

I took it to being 11 ivy league schools, and countless lesser schools.

Don't forget most of Africa was dominated by tribes until the last century,same with many other regions of the world. It wouldn't be common for africa to have a centralized school. Don't forget africa is made up for 54 countries and most of them are made up of various tribes. (my personal headcanon is the Wizarding school in Africa is more westernized. Thus only 'westernized' wizards attend. The majority are homeschooled or taught by their tribe).

This would be the same in India, most of South East Asia and South America.

We are also missing 3 Wizarding schools, which are probably in China, India, the Middle east/turkey or Spanish speaking regions of South or Central America.

Why? Seriously, why? Do you have any conception of how most people lived before the 18th century (and even after, for most)? Of standards of hygiene? Wizards were fucking /god-like/ in their cleanliness, from Vanishing alone (that's before we get into cleaning charms and House Elves and so on. Hell, just the consistent access to plentiful clean water would have made a staggering difference, if it weren't for the other magic doing even better).

Every Muggle, from peasants to kings, lived their lives surrounded by shit. Not giant piles of it in their houses, sure, but nonetheless they would constantly be encountering it in their daily lives (from themselves, other people, and all the animals), being soiled by it, and cleaning themselves (and their clothes and their houses and streets and so on) very poorly. The smell would have permeated everywhere. And then there's every other source of dirt and stench and disease, that Muggles had to deal with.

Why would wizards bother to invent intricate plumbing, when they were already overwhelmingly and obviously superior to Muggles in every way?

******* You're joking, but the concept of homosexuality as we know it today was only invented in the late 19th century. My history professor explained that one quite in-depth. Basically, before the 19th century, people generally accepted that a friendship between two men could be quite romantic and it was not considered abnormal. There are many examples of such "friendships" from antiquity up to the King of Prussia. Sodomy was were people in Europe drew the line, although that word had changed in meaning throughout history (in church law, it included any sexual act not aimed at procreation, and later anal sex).

Only afterwards people started to differentiate between sexualities as we know it today. Hell, Wikipedia(.de) claims that by 1970, 18% of all men had sexual experiences (compared to 2% in 1990) and they were generally not considered gay either.

The WORD homosexuality was popularized in the 19th century. Men were having sex with men and women were having sex with women since B.C. There is documented history on every single continent (aside from Antarctica, obviously), which your professor should have covered if he was even remotely accurate. In some societies it was even celebrated and encouraged. Do you want me to give you specific examples or are you capable of using Google yourself?

Edit: I'll clarify, because what you're trying to say/imply is somewhat unclear: people have had same-sex relations all throughout history. The language has changed - as language tends to do - but the act itself has been happening without or without the word "gay" for centuries. (Hell, the etymology of "lesbian" comes the island Lesbos.)

It seems similar, but “she's white” or “she's black” locks a character into a race while “I never wrote about her skin color” allows a wider range of people to identify with Hermione as they like, as well as a myriad of other reasons you might feel compelled to point out that you didn't explicitly ascribe a race to a character.

Granted, her character was illustrated a certain way on book jackets and portrayed with an actor with fair skin, but in JKR's defense “I didn't say she wasn't black” and “she's black” are pretty different.

Other than the whole vanishing it part, [[https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sanitation][that is *still* a thing]]. Hell, there are still *CITIES* where this happens on the regular. Yes, she was likely drunk and pulled the comment out of her ass but... this is a real thing that happens now, let alone before plumbing. From that link: "673 million [people] still defecate in the open, for example in street gutters, behind bushes or into open bodies of water."

** I hate that JKR is changing EVERYTHING to be diverse. He was gay, Jewish, etc.. also I'm a fan of colorblind casting so whatever to Hermiones actors race, but to say that no she was that all along. This was children's book that didn't handle any of these issues why now? Like future stuff I get but stop destroying the world you created by trying to please everyone.

Edit:

I think my issue is that she just keeps coming out with statements to the point it feels like pandering. I want JKR to stand by her fics as she wrote them not keep changing or offering “insights.”

#+end_quote

[citation needed]

Rowling, to the best of my knowledge, never said that Hermione was black all along she, just said that she never wrote Hermione explicitly as a white character.

Then, what usually happens, is that people write about the passage with "her pale skin" and don't get the point at all, that there's a difference between writing "her pale skin" off-handedly at one point, and writing a character as explicitly white.

I mean, you already are okay with race-blind casting, so ... what's your problem? Like, I'd like to see an actual quote. I'll make it easy and provide a few quotes of her, and you tell me where she states that Hermione was black "all along"

#+begin_quote
  "I had a bunch of racists telling me that because Hermione 'turned white' -- that is, lost color from her face after a shock -- that she must be a white woman, which I have a great deal of difficulty with," Rowling said. "But I decided not to get too agitated about it and simply state quite firmly that Hermione *can be* a black woman with my absolute blessing and enthusiasm."
#+end_quote

(emphasis by me)

#+begin_quote
  Canon: brown eyes, frizzy hair and very clever. White skin was never specified. Rowling loves black Hermione 😘
#+end_quote

(And since people often tend to make an argument out of the second one, I'll pre-emtively respond: nope, this doesn't mean she says that Hermione was black all along. She just says that she hasn't written Hermione as explicitly white, in contrast to having written her as brown-eyed, frizzy-haired and clever.

  Even if Rowling didn't explicitly mention Hermione's race
#+end_quote

That she didn't mention Hermione's race is the biggest indication that Hermione is white. We know Dean, Kingsley, Lee, Angelina, and Blaise are black because she told us so. We know the Patil twins, Su, and Cho are Asian because she went out of her way to give them "foreign", stereotypical names.

I don't care if Hermione is black. I'm not bothered by color blind casting. It would be hypocritical seeing as I read gay Harry stories, but she is 100% being disingenuous when she says the exaggerated version of herself was anything other than white.

Where did she say this? Like, seriously, I've looked into it a little, and I can't find it. I might have very well overlooked a quote or interview or sth - but I don't think I have?

**** If what she means is that she didn't say that Hermione was explicitly white, then what about that part in HbP where Harry remarks that Hermione looks like half a panda. That seems rather explicit indication. She is being dishonest then.
