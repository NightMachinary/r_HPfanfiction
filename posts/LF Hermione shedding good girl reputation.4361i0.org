  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

Any employee in the Ministry they had captured was dosed with veritaserum, and interrogated about their role in the war. *Everyone among them who had supported Voldemort or his extermination of muggleborns was sent through the Veil* - and since Hermione had prepared the questions, *"support" was defined quite generously.

This is not self-defense. This is not justice. This isn't just trying and executing Death Eaters or imprisoning the people responsible for the marriage law. This is the organized mass murder of all political opponents, regardless of whether they actively took part or materially supported Voldemort/the marriage law.

Overthrowing the government that would establish such heinous laws, yeah, that's all well and good, but then you /make a better one/, enshrining the rights of all people in the new laws. You don't trade the government that endorses mass rape for one that carries out mass murder.

In another comment you name Stalin and Mao Zedong as successful rulers through the liquidation of enemies. While true in a short-sighted way, it can be argued that this "cleansing" eventually lead to the corruption and downfall of the Union in case of the UdssR and the slow death of ideology in case of China.

It also takes you on the same level as them. You are not the saint that cleansed the world of their foulness, anymore. You're just the next vile thing that sits on the throne, waiting for the metronome of politics to swing back again.

****** It's rather sad that some people actually believe that killing mass-murderers and their helpers is as bad as mass-murdering innocents. I guess they think the Nuremberg trials were murder too. Those poor, poor nazis, executed for the crime of not sharing the political views of the allies. And those harsh laws that were made with the goal of stomping out the nazi ideology, so the holocaust would never be repeated... how evil!

Sarcasm aside, in this story, anyone caught who willingly helped the attempted genocide of muggleborns was executed. That included snatchers, people who helped organize arrests, people who provided addresses of muggleborn, etc.. That's all "actively supporting Voldemort". They knew what they were doing, and did it willingly.

In the same vein, anyone who voted to legalize rape was executed. And yes, most of the pureblood aristocracy were mass-murderers, rapists, or both in this story. Just as most of the nazi Elite were implicated in the regime's crimes.

There was no mass-murder of political opponents. Augusta Longbottom was a political opponent, and she was not touched because she had not voted to legalize rape and had not supported Voldemort.

And the government was a better one. Not a perfect one, far from it, but the use of veritaserum and oaths ensured that no innocents were executed. There was no government sanctioned mass-murder - people were tried, and sentenced. It's just that in this story, a sizeable part of the purebloods were all too ready and willing to mass-murder mudbloods. Just as far too many Germans were ready to mass-murder jews and slavs. Only in this story, they didn't get away with it.

Also: "pureblood aristocracy" doesn't mean "every pureblood", but just the rich purebloods who had been in power. The Wizengamot members, the Malfoys, etc..

******* I might get flak for this, but you're being too extreme - and you're making a huge straw man out of this.

I'll agree that [[/u/denarii]] should not have made the extreme comparison of Hermione to a Nazi, but you're whitewashing her and Harry's actions all the same.

I'm going to have to give at least some of the Ministry employees the benefit of the doubt.

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Browning#Ordinary_Men][Ordinary Men by Cristopher Browning]], for example, tells the story of 500 middle class men from Hamburg, in no way very Nazi, kind of like the run-of-the-mill Pureblood in our Potter situation. They were told they would eliminate certain amounts of Jews in each area around Hamburg, and explicitly given the choice to opt out. Less than 12 of them did.

This is related to the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment][Milgram experiment]] and the pressure of orders and of living in such a society.

And the way you put it - "generous"ly defined support (to the point where maybe even the complicit Ministry employee - and who wasn't, in order to keep their job? - would be included in this) - does not make what happens seem much better. If her "generous" definitions were as broad as you make it seem, this is indeed wholesale murder. And if it is /not/, then it is arbitrary and based on whim.

This was just formulated by looking at the text of your story.

Now, as for your revision above - and I /do/ consider it as such -, where you say that only "snatchers, people who helped organize arrests, people who provided addresses of muggleborn, etc." get killed, I have this to remark:

Many Aurors who caught Muggles may have just been doing their jobs - the Milgram effect, once again. It's an open secret that Voldemort is running the show. Perhaps they feared for their families' lives.

Okay, okay, you say, well then Harry and Hermione wouldn't push them through the Veil if they only complied to save their families! They were interviewed with Veritaserum and came off scot-free, they have nothing to fear. Right?

Each of us has unstated prejudices deep within us. Nobody can claim to be exempt. And for the average Pureblood, who may have heard a couple (exaggerated and propagandic) stories about Muggleborns killing people and taking jobs (as a certain demagogue does today), it might resonate. Just slightly. But it wasn't enough to motivate them to kill Muggleborns, no, only fear them a little. They did their job to do their job and protect their families. Would that count, to Harry and Hermione, as "support?" Would they chuck-em in, just in case?

I'll say this: it definitely feels good to read (and write, I'm definitely assuming) about such vengeful acts. But then you look closely. Why not Azkaban for some of them - if not most? And why not the benefit of the doubt when deciding between prison and capital punishment?

And Veritaserum is no silver bullet, in that the interrogator has a lot of power. Hermione can easily frame her questions as she wants. Leading questions and the like are extraordinarly powerful:

"Were you, or were you not, at the Brown residence on the fifth of October?"

"I was." {blankly, of course... Veritaserum-drugged people don't seem to get the ability to explain themselves/context, except at the leisure of the examiner}

"Did you, or did you not, participate in the arrest of the parents of Lavender Brown, knowing very well that it could end in death or the Dementor's Kiss for the two?"

"I did."

"Should you be placed in that exact same position once more, would you do your job?"

"No."

{whistles.} "No? No, eh, you Death Eater scum?" {slams hands on table forcefully.}

"No."

{grinds teeth} "Why'd you spare them, now, then? Is it because you know what'll happen, and that you could get charged for your crimes?"

"Yes." {because that's the only possible answer; the only change from then to now is that they know the good guys will win. ergo, no need to uphold the society that'll collapse in months. of course, a priori knowledge of such a thing is impossible.}

"Gotcha!" {checks off box, pushes mostly innocent man through Veil.}

And Hermione and Harry (knowing government) did not personally interview every single one, considering the magnitude of the Ministry employees involved. Would you want an interrogation where the examiner can manipulate your answers - however innocent you are - into something bad as an excuse to kill you? No time to explain yourself - maybe you aren't as bad as they portray you.

At least if they shuttle you off to prison, then they're giving you a chance should they realize, hey, something fishy went on there. Maybe interrogator Schoolboy-Enemy had some prejudice there and engineered the conversation to send you to jail - or the gallows.

******** With regards to "Ordinary Men": Those 500 ordinary men, minus the 12 who opted out (and didn't get punished for it)? They are mass-murderers, not poor misguided men. Excusing them for "bowing to the pressure of society" is whitewashing nazi murderers. The excuse of "I was only following orders" doesn't work. Not after the Holocaust. It wasn't accept at Nuremberg, it wasn't accepted by the muggleborns (who know about nazi crimes). Once you murder children there's no excuse anymore at all.

Veritaserum is a silver bullet, in that those who didn't want to help murder innocents won't get executed. "Did you willingly help murder muggleborns?" will get them out. Hermione "generously formulated" the questions to prevent the "I didn't help murder anyone, I simply did my job" or "I simply pushed papers" answers from working. But the point is that there was a big number of people who liked mudbloods getting murdered. The questions were not meant to catch those who didn't want to murder children. But those who willingly helped catch and murder muggleborns? Who "were just doing their job" but thought it was all ok? They are murderers. If you help a murderer commit his crimes, lend him a car so he can reach a victim, point out a victim to him, hide his crimes, then you're an accomplice, and will be punished. And if the penalty for that is execution, you'll get executed.

I'm not whitewashing Harry and Hermione - the death penalty is wrong - but they are not nazis, nor mass-murderers. They simply do not let mass-murderers get away, and accept less excuses than others. They are basically traumatized child soldiers who fought genocidal scum for years. Their first impulse when encountering a problem is to ask themselves "Who do I kill to solve this?"

And still they did go to great lengths to avoid killing innocents by using veritaserum. Because one single question - "did you willingly help he ministry kill muggleborns?" - will save those who did not willingly help Voldemort, but acted out of fear for themselves and their families.

And, with regards to your example: That guy was arresting muggleborns for the "crime" of being muggleborns, knowing they would be killed for it. I do not understand at all how you can call a willing supporter of Voldemort "mostly innocent".

To reiterate once again: They did err on the side of caution. People who said under veritaserum that they didn't willingly support Voldemort were spared, even at the risk of letting some murderers who prepared for that slip. But those who did were executed. Harsh, and wrong since the Death Penalty was wrong, but far, far from what the Death Eaters and their supporters had done.
