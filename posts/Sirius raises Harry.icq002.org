  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

*** I don't mind it- it's not something I actively seek out, but I've definitely read fics where they are a pairing. I usually read Harry centric fics tho -so I'd prefer if the main theme was not just focused on Remus/Sirius with Harry in the background. Idk of that makes any sense? I'd still take any recommendations of fics that you think are really good!

**** Totally makes sense! This is one of my favorite childhood Harry fics. Sirius and Remus start platonic and it is mainly focused on them raising Harry. Once Harry goes to Hogwarts it focuses on their relationship a little bit more but most of the story is Harry centric. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/58157][Stealing Harry]]

** Ongoing fic called 'A Second Chance' by Breanie. Canon pairings. Sirius takes aways Harry from the Dursleys. Hinny, Remus/Tonks, Sirius/OC. My only complaint is that there sex scenes when Harry is like 13.

** I'll copy my reply to a similar request:

‚Äã

Oh, thats my favourite theme. Here are some of my favourites:

linkff([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3673549/1/The-name-is-Potter-Black]]) is one of the best imho; it also has a sequel. Although Harry is raised by Sirius and Lupin, the story starts from Harry's first year. Both Sirius and Remus are Hogwarts professors.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4431766/1/Harry-Black]])Harry is raised as Sirius' son in order to protect him from Voldemort and Death Eaters. James and Lily are alive, but they do not know that Harry is their son.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11986362/1/I-ll-Stay]]) is a short fic (20-30k), but definitely a must-read. The relationship between Harry and Sirius is very beautiful.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12262029/1/Heartbeat]]) is similar to the previous one (one-shot)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12312217/1/Harry-s-New-Home]]) and linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12078305/3/A-Gift-of-Love]]) Both of them seem to be abandoned, but I still think they are worth reading.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/662406/1/Of-Western-Stars]])

This one does not really fit your request, but I hope you won't mind me adding it. A one-shot about Harry's birth from Sirius' POV. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243167/1/Fumbles-Up-Those-Stairs]])

If you read them, let me know what you think:)

  The bond between a Godfather and his Godson is a phenomenal one. Through the years, if there's anything that can be known with certainty, it's that Sirius Black will stay, no matter what, with his Godson. No slash, godfather-godson bonding fic. AU, Sirius doesn't die, and he raises Harry. T for slight language.

  6 year old Harry Potter has nothing but a vague memory of being loved; of a life before he had been left at the hands of the Dursleys. One person hasn't forgotten, though, and when Sirius saves Harry from his abusive relatives, can he fix the damage done, and give Harry the life James and Lily wanted for him?
