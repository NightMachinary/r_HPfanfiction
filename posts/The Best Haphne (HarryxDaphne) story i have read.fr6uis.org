** Idk m8. At first I was thinking that it's not that well written but then I read the fateful words "for the greater good" and noped out. Does it get better in the latter chapters ?

*** Do you mean Dumbledore saying greater good? Its basically a manipulative but good intent dumbles and the story is lovely and has bromance and romance without being too mushy. The friendships in cannon seems very passive to me and more of a symbiotic relationship where they depend on each other but here it is really good

#+begin_quote
  Sirius had made a slew of different decisions that night he had arrived at Godric's Hollow. With Sirius' focus on Harry rather than revenge, a very different Boy-Who-Lived is going to make his return to the wizarding world at the age of 13. But the question is, why did Harry return so late? And will he still be the Hero the Wizarding World needs? Haphne! AU-ish, slightly mature!
