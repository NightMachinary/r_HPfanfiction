I've been thinking about this for a while, but what do people think is either not focused on about werewolves, underappreciated in their struggle, or should be extended in cannon as such to deepen lore about them, even if it's headcannons.

I often find my weakspot for Remus expands alot further when I read a different post a month back about how painful the werewolf transformation would be, and the further effects it would have on him. a couple things I read went into the community reaction when Harry usually becomes a werewolf, giving him badass strength and scars and painless tranformations and 6'4 or whatever, instead of thinking about how badly it affects you really.

So i couldnt help but ask others literally anything they think about werewolves, even if its small things, like they dont eat cooked meat or summin, complying with Remus' joke in the Deathly Hallows.

TLDR: Say anything you want on Werewolves, im interested!


** Since werewolves can vary a lot in fiction, I'll limit myself to the werewolves of Harry Potter, and more particulary, Lupin :

- Werewolves does not have to battle "the wolf within them" every day. They are totally normal person until they see the full moon and transform into bloodthirsty monsters. All the mental problems of Lupin are caused by the social stigma surrounded the werewolves, not the curse itself.
- While I am at it, werewolves are indistinguisable from other wizards when not transformed. Their conditions didn't bring any "buff" such as a greater physical strenght or enhanced senses, it's called a curse for a reason.
- Lupin calling Harry "cub" is bullshit. The term would barely be acceptable for someone worshiping his curse like Greyback, and would never be used by someone hating his condition like Lupin.
- Magical or not, most werewolves can't use magic. A minority of them may have been homeschooled, or learnt magic before being cursed, but Lupin is the first werewold in living memory to go to Hogwarts (if not the first ever).
- The whole "Wolf Hierarchy" belief (Alpha, Beta, Omega . . .) has been proved to be bullshit when it comes to true wolves, it's even more true for Werewolves. Werewolves camp probably follow the law of the jungle where the strongest (AkA Greyback) rule with an Iron Fist.

*** I definitely can accept the last one easily. It's made rather clear that Dumbledore's actions are the sole reason Remus can attend Hogwarts.

I see where youre coming from with the third one, and its very understandable, Remus does hate himself for his condition, and in turn I see him shunning away association with it.

With the other two however I have slight contradictions of my own, with the scars of each transformation and the initial attack that would've made them a werewolf being a very clear giveaway, but i 100% agree with no 'buff' appearance or anythinf, although i do see a slight boost in their physical strength. And the first one i disagree with the most, i have to say. From lesser experiences people have ptsd, get anxiety, paranoia, and all such mental health problems, so going tbrough this transformation, and being in constant fear of the moon, in being (probably) constantly watched by the ministry, and having to always monitor the moon's phases would effect Lupin, or any wizard alot

**** By "normal" I meant that Lupin does not have to fight with his "primal" instincts every days of the month, or that he doesn't feel "compeled" to protect Harry because it's the cub of the pack, as it can be seen in some fanfictions. Lupin has a lot of troubles, but they are not directly caused by his curse, they are just a consequences for turning into an infectious bloodthirsty monster every month and all the social stigma it could cause.

As for the scars, I'm pretty sure they are fanon. Sure the initial attack may leave some trace but after this, werewolves are not really more prone to it than a "normal" human. In PoA, Lupin has been a werewolf for almost 20 years, and yet he doesn't show any noticeable scars (yep, not even on his face).

***** Ah okayokay, my mistake.

On the second one, I do believe you may be right on second thought. I just reread a couple things on Harry Potter werewolves, I think I mightve been letting rhe movies confuse me a bit, a trait I need to get out of ü§£

** The werewolf transformation causes every bone in the body to break and repair themselves in the space of a minute. The transformation will always be and cannot not be painful for the werewolf. Even a werewolf under enough painkillers (magical or otherwise) to make an elephant unconscious will wake up when they transform for it is a curse and not a simple human transfiguration. The only known way to alleviate the pain is to embrace the wolf, but in return, you become eligible to be targeted by the Ministry's werewolf hunters and you become beastly even untransformed.

*** Yesssssss! I agree with everything apart from, with the introduction of the wolfsbane potion, I think of it as a slight pain lessener, nothing major, but maybe it feels like a couple bones didnt break, but it's mainly a mental barrier, so you dont absolutely destroy anyone near you if you transform.

I love the inclusion of the Ministry there, really brings it full circle with government intervention with something that could be related to a disease.

(Thought I'd edit after I got the notifacation of ur reply)

I see it as in more of a form of a disease than a curse. Its not a magical spell, or a magical artifact that gives one the pain of being a werewolf. It all depends on how you determine word definitions and proper nouns i guess.

Bur personally, I see major similarities between the werewolf condition and something seen in other pop culture, like a zombie disease/infection. It's transmitted through a bite/other physical action, and then inflicts it's self on its new host. I'd be inclinded to believe that all werewolves are broken and beaten by the 'disease' over time into accepting their 'inner nature' like Greyback is said to have done, bur after a lot longer period of time usually.

At this point they would have strong mental queues and pulls toward biting others to 'pass on the disease'. I have so many combining headcannons on werewolves that I see them completely different to a curse or such.

** I am gonna open this by saying HP Werewolves are kind of boring for most people. They make for good stuff for some characters, but meh.

People give Harry "buffs" when becoming a Werewolf, because if it only just brings disadvantages, it can make for a good story, but it's most likely not the author's intention to make a 'Harry gets screwed' story.

And giving increased senses can also be a disadvantage, he can become vulnerable to strong smells, or sounds. He can become irritable, or territorial, or more aggressive. He will prefer meat instead of anything else. And get lot's of body hair.

The pain of transformation and the days after can leave him vulnerable. He would have to rely on Snape to get the potion.

And then comes the stigma. Can increased strength, reflexes, minor healing factor, and superior senses compensate for the prejudice suffered? The name calling?

Me? I would prefer a proper Vampire!Harry story, especially if it's going to worldbuild vampires. Do turned Wizards keep their magic? Are they stronger? How does their society works? What about the Ministry? Does it truly monitors them or is it being fooled by the immortal guys similarly to how the Wizards fool the Muggles?

*** Honestly, if I were going to do a werewolf protagonist, I'd probably have it be someone figuring out what magic the Curse of Lycanthropy was actually corrupted from.

** I'm interested in the biology of the werewolf transformation. Is there a real origin to the curse? Why are they wolf-ish humanoids instead of wolves? I get they discuss this as blocking the ability to become an animagus, so maybe it was an especially elaborate old age curse on a wolf animagus who slighted the witch/wizard? A fanfic I was reading - Were's Harry? - was kinda cringey with the Alpha/Omega stuff and other stuff, but there was a neat underlying subplot on the origin of werewolves and research into it. You would think a society which hates the affliction so much but is deeply interested in preserving their blood would research how to cure or at least negate the curse.

*** Love these questions... I've never really thought about the origin of the curse but now im gunna be thinking about it all day!

I like your version though so i may just use that, and ur point at the end about blood purity is very good. Even if theyre shunned you'd think the ministry or wizards in general would want a good understanding of them.
