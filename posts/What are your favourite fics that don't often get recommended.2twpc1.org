I've read pretty much all of the fics that are recommended on here all the time and I'm struggling to find anything good lately. Genre, pairing, rating etc aren't important, but I would prefer fics that are well written and complete (or at least not left on a cliffhanger).

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8596476/1/Starnlicht][Starnlicht]] by Marquis Carabas

In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

Rated: Fiction T - English - Adventure/Mystery - Chapters: 20 - Words: 108,793 - Reviews: 37 - Favs: 20 - Follows: 16 - Updated: Oct 27, 2013 - Published: Oct 9, 2012 - Status: Complete - id: 8596476

The language is anachronistic, it's a bit off in the modern perspectives, but I think it's just fun. Judith is a witch bounty hunter being dragged into a task that may have more impact on English rule than anyone expects.
