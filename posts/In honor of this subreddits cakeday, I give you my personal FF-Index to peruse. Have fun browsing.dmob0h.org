:END:
A while ago I started to organise my fanfiction-reading and started to add each story I had finished to a spreadsheet, making searches for a specific fic / topic / trope / genre / etc. much easier.

[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/125pyso4qYCL9ajPCTWKY6SF_P9WD9PDtRgPuVjwRNRI/edit?usp=sharing][Have a look]], maybe you find something worth reading :)

The first sheet is regular Fanfiction, the second is smut only (still very empty though).

For better handling I would like to suggest that you either use the 'Make a copy'- function to replicate the list into your own Google Drive, or otherweise download it, so that you can add a filter.

Oh, and of course, I'd like to invite you to recommend any fics which you feel like need to be included, if they aren't already.

Happy cakeday!


** Bless you

** OMG, thank you so much! I have been having trouble lately trying to find fics that fit my taste (I am currently reading the Mind Arts and it's amazing, but I am finishing it :( ), so this is very appreciated! (Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language)
