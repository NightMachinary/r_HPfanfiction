:END:
So there was a fic about Harry being a Dark Lord with the name of Lord (Volcanicus/Infernius) Please do help me.

Thanks.

edit: I remember that his followers attacked the Order of the Phoenix and Ministry (prob Dumbledore as well)


** Are you think of "rise of overlord vulcan" or whatever it's called? I never read it myself but ive seen it come up. Pretty sure is a smut with plot fic? Not sure. Nothing wrong with smut just never read it, just recognize the name
