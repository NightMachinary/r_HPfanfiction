  After the infamous massacre of the Potters, young Harry Potter went missing. It doesn't really help that years later he turns up again, a bit darker, stranger and more erratic than anyone had hoped for. But Harry hardly cares, in the end it's his decision on which side he will fight; dark, light or no side at all. Eventually HP/LV... of sorts.

** /Sirius checks Ginny, lying unconscious on the ground/

Harry: I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new Ministry.

Sirius: Your new Ministry?

Harry: Don't make me /kill/ you.

Sirius: Harry, my allegiance is to the Ministry. To /democracy/!

Harry: If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.

Sirius: Only a Dark wizard deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.

Harry: You will try.

*Elsewhere ...*

Dumbledore: I hear a new apprentice you have, Voldemort. Or should I call you Tom Riddle, my boy?

Voldemort: Master Headmaster, you survived.

Dumbledore: Surprised, my boy?

Voldemort: Your old age blinds you, Master Headmaster. /Now/ you will experience the full power of the Dark side.

*Shortly later*:

Voldemort: Hehehehehwa. I have waited a /long/ time for this moment, my little gay friend.

/Voldemort chuckles. Dumbledore stands up. Voldemort chuckles some more/

Voldemort: At last, the Order are no more.

Dumbledore: Not if anything to say about it /I/ have!

/Force spell push, and Voldemort goes flying/

Voldemort: Aaaaaaa!

/Lands into and topples over the Minister's chair/

Dumbledore: At an end your rule is, my boy, and not short enough it was, my boy.

/Voldemort leaps forward and action rolls in the air, Dumbledore blocks his escape at the door/

Dumbledore: If so powerful you are, my boy, why leave?

Voldemort: You will not stop me. Harry will not become more powerful than either of us!

Dumbledore: Faith in your new apprentice misplaced maybe, as is your faith in the Dark side of the magic.

*Later:*

Dumbledore: Boy my. Into exile, I must go. /Failed/, I have. Too strong Death Eaters are.

Kingsley: They fly now?

*Later:*

Sirius: I have failed you, Harry, I have failed you.

Harry: I should have known the Order were plotting to take over!

Sirius: Harry, Lord Voldemort is evil!

Harry: From my point of view, the Order are evil!

Sirius: Then you are /lost/!

*Later:*

Sirius: It's over, Harry. I have the Elder ground!

Harry: You underestimate my power!

Sirius: Don't try it.

Harry: Raaaaaaaaa! /Leaps forward. Gets cut/ Aaaaawwwrgh. /Rolls down the bank/ Oueeeaaargh. Eeeeeawgh. Eeeeurgh. Oooowaaargh.

Sirius: You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would destroy the Dark Lord, not join him! Bring balance to the magic, not leave it in darkness!

Harry: Aaah. Aawaaaargh. Ooooowaa. I HAYCHOO!

Sirius: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.

Harry: Naaaaargh. Aaaargh. Ooo --- wait, what?

Sirius: See you around, kid.

**** An interesting idea; guess I focused too much on the 'fearing death' part; a Voldemort having a somewhat 'Dr. Doom-ish' personality in the sense that he wants to be the best and greatest could likely work.

Creating horcruxes to not because he fears death, but because he wants to conquer it.

Subverting the prophecy and training Harry as an heir to conquer fate as it were.

Heck, training Harry to be the greatest wizard since Merlin, to show himself a great teacher surpassing even the founders.

I mean I couldn't write it if I tried, but it could work pretty well.
