  "Now for Dumbledore. The man I love to hate. The master manipulator. People may think I'm being unfairly harsh - and I received a number of 'hate' reviews for making Dumbles look like a bad guy in 'Four Heirs' - but, am I?

  Take these two quotes of Dumbledore directly from the books:

  Order of the Phoenix, Ch 37, to Harry: "Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well - not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years."

  Half-Blood Prince, Ch 3, to the Dursleys: "He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands.

  "The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house 'home.' However miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom."

  That is definitely not the actions of a person who really cared for Harry. That is the actions of a man who was setting a poor boy up to be abused, and stay being abused. And it was child abuse. The books might not have covered physical abuse; but they certainly covered verbal, emotional and psychological abuse. Abuse is abuse; whether it's physical, verbal, emotional or psychological.

  And Dumbledore knew, by his own words, it would happen, and was happening. In other words, Dumbledore was an accessory to the crime of child abuse both before and during the fact. Argue with me all you like on that point; but, you cannot argue with direct quotes and what they clearly demonstrate. And, no; I do not believe I'm taking them out of context - go read the relevant sections for yourself.

  Then there's Dumbledore's continuing to allow Snape - and, later, Umbridge - to abuse students. There's that word, again - abuse. Right from 'Day Two' in first year, Severus Snape was engaged in abuse; with his primary target being Harry Potter. In pretty much his first direct interaction with the boy, he abused him. Dumbledore was fully aware of Snape's behaviour towards Harry, and should have been all over him for it like baby shit on blanket. Snape even did it in Dumbledore's presence.

  Once should have seen him firmly reprimanded; the second should have seen him fired. That Dumbledore allowed it to continue beyond the first couple of weeks made him an accessory before, during and after the fact.

  Of course, Umbridge shouldn't have lasted beyond the first time she handed someone detention - and, that's only if you ignore the disparaging comments she made about 'half-breeds' and other blood bigotry issues."

This was the first justification for what I wondered over the years. I didn't read the HP books as a child, I read them as a young adult, and Dumbledore always rubbed me the wrong way.

**** It looks good, but I think the author draws way to many conclusions from scant evidence, and still doesn't address the quotes that Sinyk wrote.

** People don't necessarily hate him, even if they seem to be bashing him.

For a start, bashing is relative. Take Ron, another prominently bashed character. He's commonly shown being a feckless, disloyal, moronic junior Death Eater. If you see him as a good friend, tactically-minded, and loyal, then that will come across as bashing. Equally, if you see him as disloyal, selfish, and stupid, then it won't. So, what you see as bashing Dumbledore might be seen by the author as being true to their character. Everyone has a decent-ish argument to support their perspective (which they see the logic behind, even if people with the opposing perspectives don't), and none of us really have the Authority to state which is true (and JK's Authorial Authority is a little... tenuous these days). So, yeah. What you see as bashing depends on how you see a character, and that varies considerably in this fandom.

That idea actually works with Sin-washing too (making them good when they aren't, or shoving them into Leather Pants) - some people see Draco as the tiny, pretty Neo-Nazi bigot, others see him as pushed in over his head in a conflict and bigotry he never really understood. So, some would see nice Draco as Sinwashing, others would see it as an accurate portrayal of his character.

And well, a villainous and manipulative Dumbledore doesn't necessarily mean they dislike him, either. Because, well... people are horny for bad guys. Moriarty, people in Game of Thrones, Snappy and Draco and Voldemort, etc. Just because they're villains, doesn't mean people hate them.

Finally, to answer your initial question, it's likely popular for the same reason anything gets popular. One person did it, another person saw it and liked it and mimicked it, and so on and so forth. At this point, this fandom has a lot of fics of certain trends in cliches, so those fics tend to be easier to find and thus for a lot of people are their entry into the fandom. So, a lot of people see them, a lot of people enjoy them, and a lot of people mimic them. And people enjoy them for a lot of different reasons, and they mimic them for even more. Some people find curbstomping Dumbledore to be cathartic (usually those people blame him for various things in canon and think the 'just desserts' is deserved), some find manipulative Dumbledore villains fun (and don't care if a Dumbledore is In Canon Character or not, etc etc etc.
