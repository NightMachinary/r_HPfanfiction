Just a random wondering. How would you go about making Voldemort an absolutely nasty terrifying monster that would make Super!Harry nervous?

I suppose that in canon, he's scary enough; the fact that he /survived/ getting killed (and came back 15 years later), that if Harry/Dumbledore/Neville/Regulus hadn't gone to all that trouble to destroy his Horcruxes that he would have come back again, and also the somewhat literal Speak of the Devil where if anyone said Voldemort out loud someone could immediately apparate in and kill them.

   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
What else, though? I suppose that given the rules of the setting (magic can't fix death), Voldemort being able to return is part of his amazing evilness. Would breaking other rules help make him scarier? Having backup clones and other redundant ways to resurrect/cheat death, using magic that's supposed to be impossible, hacking the dementor thought-sucking ability to appear and attack whoever even /thinks/ his name?

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-2
   :END:
I dunno, can anyone think of more ways to make Voldemort an ultimate evil villain of legend?


** 1 - Don't wheel him out unless it's /absolutely/ necessary, and when he appears, have him really put the hammer down. Voldemort is both more and less than a person, and his inhumanity - both in physical resemblance and behaviour - helps set him apart from the rest. The issue with his showing up in any situation, however, is that canon Death Eaters are kind of weak, with the exception of maybe Bellatrix. Voldemort /is/ their hope for wizarding purity, and his soldiers should be fanatical, skilled and /extremely dangerous./ If they aren't, then the reader will mostly wonder why Voldemort doesn't just do away with his incompetent henchmen and do it all himself.

2 - Have him really strike fear with his magic, for instance maybe use Legilimency as Snape described. Canon-Voldemort delights in pain and suffering, and although that is fun and can definitely be scary, a better way to do it - as described by [[/u/Epwydadlan1][u/Epwydadlan1]], is apathy. Voldemort should be so removed from humanity that he should be disinterested in being hilariously punitive, as making him reactionary to the protagonist diminishes his threat. The more terrifying concept is someone that is ruthless, yet utterly amoral and unfettered by laws or respect for human decency - that if you meet this person, they'll kill you because you're in the way if for no other reason. Maybe have him conduct experiments on prisoners, just to see what he can learn from magic.

3 - Tying on to his ruthlessness and need to /not/ be reactionary to the direction of the plot, Voldemort should have his own objectives, and furthermore should truly embody his cause. Too many authors, I think, use the fact he's a half-blood and is sort-of insane to say he was just /using/ the purebloods and their ambitions as a means to start a war, but I think he is /much/ scarier when he is a true believer in the cause. The idea that a charismatic, physically unassailable and utterly ruthless Voldemort could be driven - and in turn drive suicidal loyalty into his soldiers - to achieve an ideological aim is much more interesting than "duh, he's insane."

4 - If he is targeting Super!Harry, and is unable to do it directly, then he should do more of what he didn't in the books: target Harry's friends and associates. He should operate with equal parts surgical precision and unfathomable cruelty, using death, torture, dismemberment and rampant destruction to force Super!Harry onto the defensive, or to draw him out into a planned confrontation. I'm talking /heinous/ levels of shit here, for instance targeting Harry's friends' families - Hermione's parents are ripe for murdering in their (I'm assuming unprotected) household in the muggle world.

5 - More strategy, less grouping the Death Eaters up and letting them get caught red-handed in the Ministry. The Death Eaters should operate like any terrorist organisation, in cells that barely communicate and of which only Voldemort is aware of all. For every magical ready to fight directly, there should be sleeper agents, informants, mercenaries and creatures operating in loose communication and association with one another. Hell, even just encouraging your average criminals to get out on the streets and cause mayhem in Voldemort's name helps build an image of an omnipotent opponent, who can strike anywhere, anytime.

6 - Tying on to number five, there should be a total lack of clarity about Voldemort and his forces, /a la/ OOTP. The news outlets should be flooded with false information and scaremongering, Death Eaters should fraudulently report emergencies to the Aurors to draw them out and at the same time spread distrust amongst members of the public. He should rarely ever show his face, and the crimes committed in his name would set the stage for his eventual arrival, once the time was right.

7 - In duels, make him perform incredible feats of magic. Throwing out AKs like they're going out of fashion is cool, sure, but I think Voldemort could really be served by a wider repertoire of spells.

8 - In the end, things are "monster" scary when you don't understand them at all. Things are "Hitler and the Nazis" scary when you can understand only too well their aims and how far they will go to achieve them. To me, Voldemort should sit firmly in the middle - real enough with achievable aims that make him an idol to his supporters and terrifying in a long-term sense to his enemies, yet inhuman and cruel enough that he doesn't lose the mystique of being /something else,/ in the most terrifying sense of the word.

To add to this, have him use a wider array of dark magic too. Use gore if you can, describe the reactions of the characters to watching a man die of a blood-boiling curse or having their eyeballs burst, things that Voldemort wouldn't think twice about and would give others PTSD.

I like this one, I think it's the most important, but all of your suggestions are very good as well. You mention somewhere that a lot of authors love to just make Voldemort completely insane and he'll throw tantrums and such when things happen. It definitely makes him less scary in my opinion. Having a Voldemort with clear (to him) goals and a plan that he follows through is important in making him seem powerful and scary, if he is just reactionary to everything Harry or Dumbledore does then he's not quite so intimidating. In my opinion, in canon and fanfiction alike, Voldemort is like a force of nature like a tsunami or hurricane and that is what makes him so terrifying. You can't reason with him, you can barely understand him, and if you're in his path then you're going to be completely crushed if you take no precautions.

*** Just to add on to this, you could have a very interesting mechanic with the Imperious Curse and terror cells. Voldemort commands the Inner Circle. Each one of those Death Eaters has imperioused five wizards, and each of those wizards Imperious five others. They would then work with absolute loyalty, and be perfectly willing to kill themselves for the cause. If you ignite Fiendfyre in the Ministry Atrium, while simultaneously poisoning the Burn Salve supply with Basilisk Venom, you can kill massive amounts of people.

The problem is that magic is powerful. There should be a careful mix of making horrific choices which kill dozens, but don't make it too logical, and too OP. Yes, we know that Geminio on nuclear weapons is possible, but you as the author need to figure out a way to keep the bullshit contained.

I just can't imagine Voldemort being remotely intimidating with a "high" voice, no matter how cold it is. The raspy take of the movie versions is about as close as you can get to that.

** Don't wheel him out unless it matters, then have him devastate with ease. You become accustomed to things easily, you make everything overpowered and nothing is overpowered. He should be on another level above and beyond with no effort on his part, he simply is. Bellatrix delights in cruelty, Voldemort has already killed them and their family in the middle of the night and left his calling sign because he wants everyone to know it was him and you still can't stop it from happening.

It wasn't the surviving that made him terrifying, it was that he'd nearly won a decade long war and the only thing that could stop him was a baby and a fluke. Moody shows Harry the old order picture, most of them died. You didn't oppose him, you died. Harry's friends, regardless of how much you like them should be wiped out if they came across Voldemort. Too many people want to show that Hermione/Neville/Ron is strong so they hold off Voldemort, he should have no equals other than Harry (through luck or super!Harry) and Dumbledore who had the elder wand as a crutch.

When was this? Safeguarding Harry with her love doesn't really count in my book - there's no evidence it was ever intentional, and was likely a mother simply protecting her child to the bitter end.

#+begin_quote
  I've always been of the opinion that Harry survived Voldemort's first killing curse because of /Snape/.

  Snape asked Voldemort to spare Lily.

  Voldemort offers to let Lily live if she abandons Harry.

  Lily pleads to take her instead.

  Voldemort (attempts) to kill them both.

  There are a lot of conflicting variables in that kind of situation and in a world where you can apparently be binded into oaths and contracts without your consent, it's always been my opinion that Voldemort somehow /accidentally/ agreed to kill Lily if he would spare Harry. When he broke that "contract" by attempting to kill Harry immediately afterward, his magic backfired on him.

  Think about it - how many mothers must have pleaded to spare their children during a /war/? This seems like the only logical reason that Harry should have survived, and it all starts with Snape.

** Give Voldemort a sense of omnipotence without actually adding to his list of powers. Adding secret powers, spells, or plans doesn't really do anything for me if the protagonists don't actually feel a sense of despair, like they can't run or hide or fight, only hope for quick death.

Voldemort was cunning, and wielded fear better than he ever did his wand. I mean, he enchanted his name with a taboo so that it worked as a tracking device, giving the impression of terrifying omniscience and omnipotence, which resulted in the entire wizarding population of Britain frightened of even uttering his name.

*** To add on to this, he needs to have absolute control over any situation he's in. It bothered me that JK Rowling made him so emotionally volatile. He should be cold and calculating. One of the best examples of what Voldemort should be is Hans Landa from Inglorious Basterds.

The cruciatus curse is all well and good, but he needs to /mentally/ torture people. We see this a bit in his powerplay tactics with Lucius and assumedly with those that fail him, like Rowle and Dolohov.

He can't be forever stuck behind three teenagers. He /always/ has to be a step ahead of them, creating a well of despair for the protagonists, being beaten at every turn.

** A good way of setting up a powerful character is to have other, already proven powerful characters, be scared of him. Don't go for the simple tactic of having <character x> beat Harry then lose to Voldemort; rather, have pretty much every powerful character refuse to take on Voldemort head-on. Show their fear, show how much they hate Voldemort but still can't bring themselves to face him.

Voldemort should be a powerful presence even when he's not there. When the characters are nominally safe, there should always be that undertone of fear. /What if he's found out where we are? There's no way he should be able to, but he's done impossible things in the past./ Casual conversations suddenly turn serious and unpleasant when something someone says is even tangentially related to Voldemort.

Basically, to make him a fearful presence for your readers, you should /show/, not tell, that he's a fearful presence in the minds of your characters.

** I personally never found Voldemort to be scary in the books and most fics make him act like villain from a children's story where he explains his plans when he has the hero tied up. If you want to make him appear scary and feel like the insane psychopath that he is, keep him unknown in his abilities, have him live up to what people say about him, and if you are going to have the hero beat him make it a truly epic fight where the hero barely escapes, whether through luck or someone else's intervention like in OoTP with Dumbledore. One of the things that I find that can make or break the character is how he acts, if you want him to be a truly terrible /thing/ have him act the part, as I said before don't have him explaining everything the first chance he gets. Have him use magic that the hero would never use, for moral reasons or something similar, or simply can't use by some limiting factor, just don't have it be magic that requires 8600 mana to use, it's a story not a MMORPG.

** I've planned a few fics and quite a number of them involved a very competent Dark Lord.

I've found that the Voldemort character is greatly improved by a couple things

- Efficiency

- Efficacy

Voldemort made competent (more so than just in comparison to the incompetent ministry, he's efective at achieving things at rates no one else is). Think of it for a moment; the Dark Lord would likely not worry about paperwork and others idle things. He will be brutally effective, utterly single-minded on achieving whatever his mind is set to, and he has /time/.

Imagine a politican who could apparate across the country, manipulate with magic, inspire fear and awe with an incantation. Can you even imagine how much they could get done and how many people you could meet? Now imagine you swear those people to secrecy, or kill them if they don't join you. Now months down the line there's a veritable army of people sworn to secrecy through magic, fear, or loyalty - and you had no idea this was going on? As the months progress perhaps you catch a rumour or a hint of something that, surely, isn't possible - /"The Goblins have allied with him? But they were on our side! How do we safeguard our gold!"/

You're blindsided.

One thing leads to another, leads to another, leads to another - and you've got a seemingly insurmountable series of opponents who sprung up out of nowhere.

Assume you get creative and the Dark Lord has created legions of inferi, delved into the blackest of magics and is poised to release them to astounding impact, not to mention that this guy is just so damn good at magic itself.

--------------

Finally, I want you to think back to the Order of the Phoenix film when Dumbledore is accosted by Fudge, Umbridge, and aurors (Kingsley among them). Dumbledore escapes a seemingly inescapable situation by utilising a skill (Phoenx travel) that no one else can use. This elevates him above the rest, and in Kinglsey this inspires a bit of awe ("You can't deny, Minister. Dumbledore has got /style/.")

Now imagine instead of Dumbledore, that you've cornered Voldemort. He's seemingly caught off-guard, and outgunned. Yet he's in control of the situation, and he escapes through a means you can't hope to replicate. Instead of inspiring awe you'd inspire terror, fear, horror.

** Hmm ... that's a fairly good question, I think.

I feel like the way to do it is to capitalise on the immortality thing of his. Horcruxes ... well, they do /sound/ all-scary and stuff, but in the series proper they, other than the diary, never amounted to anything more than plot coupons. The Dark Mark, as scary as it sounds on paper, is also woefully underexplored and while that is understandable because sometimes less details means more ... something, they too could be used better if /some/ things were known about them.

So let us start by changing the way the Horcruxes work. In this version, rather than being mere plot coupons that have to be destroyed and that's it, let us make them items that lay where they are and take some kind of life energy (or magic, or whatever) from everyone in the vicinity in a way that does not do /permanent/ harm but certainly is not a good thing, gathering it until the end of time, and every time the spirit of Tom gets to one of them a part of this gathered energy can be used to fairly quickly (depending on the amount used either days or hours or even minutes) make him another body that he can use. Imagine a man of his power, capable of duelling many at the same time and even winning them, and when you grab that victory by playing on the opening he just left by murdering half the people you were fighting with, it only stops him for days at most. And with the Horcruxes in the places they are: Diagon Alley (the Cup), Hogwarts (the Diadem), some obscure Muggle village (the Ring), middle of London (the Locket), the energy certainly isn't a problem. Furthermore, because the items are so full of energy, destroying them without first ridding them of the energy will cause terrible destruction.

Albus has a reputation of being able to stand up to him, for he is capable of fighting him one-on-one and surviving with nary a scratch. But he does not dare kill Tom, oh no, for he knows /something/ is at play but does not know what terrible costs are extracted and from whom when Tom is revived. He is wrong, of course, for the costs are extracted regardless, but he does try; it is not mercy for Tom and his Death Eaters that made him look for an alternate way, but mercy for those who could be pulled to their graves along with Tom.

Now, Harry being a Horcrux is a bit of a cop-out because seriously, but we shall do something about their connection. So let's say that in his act of breaking the contract he unknowingly agreed to by killing Lily, he managed to get /something/ of his stolen and attached to Harry, the ability to /use/ his Horcruxes. He does not die, for he still has them, but all the energy from them has to go through Harry first now and that is where it stops. Harry recovers from everything dealt to him, but he does so by draining from the Horcruxes. The Diary, rogue as it went due to Lucius's attempts at making it work for his master again, is defeated not by the fang of a basilisk but because Harry's wounds are so grievous that all of the Diary's energy gets used up to keep him from dying from the venom; certainly, though, the fang does not help it. Harry does not know it. The ritual at the end of the fourth year now serves not to make a new body for Tom, for he is not a weird foetus thing, but to tear the thing out of Harry and give it back to Tom. The tear is why Harry's mind is connected to Tom's: his very spirit, his soul, so aches for what it now feels is missing that without his input it reaches out to where the thing is now missing, to Tom.

Such a thing cannot be stopped by Occlumency, and Albus Dumbledore knows it. But it can hide things from himself, and on the off chance that Tom can see all of Harry this is one of the two things that could help, the other being Obliviating Harry. But Harry does not manage to learn Occlumency, he wears his heart on his sleeve, of course he could not manage, and by the time this is known nothing more can be done for Albus is dying and cannot rid Harry of what he knows.

The Dark Mark can only be taken willingly, but you need not perform any heinous acts to accept it. No, the very act of accepting it is enough for Tom to be able to brand their bodies and their souls, to scar their very beings forever, and it need not be an acceptance borne out of sharing their beliefs, accepting in exchange for them not doing horrible things to someone you know is enough. Because it is far more terrible when it is not a mark of the evildoers, but rather a mark of those who agreed and those who were forced to agree alike. The Dark Mark does stop the Horcruxes from draining the people whose souls are marked, that much they get from it, and they can hide it from view if they wish unless Tom wishes for it to show itself and betray their supposed allegiance; it can also cause them untold pain, as if the entirety of their beings burned, if Tom so wishes and has another Dark Mark at his disposal to trigger it.

Severus Snape fancies himself a spy, but it is futile. He cannot learn anything for people are willing to speak of nothing if the price is agony, and the few things he brings are from people who so despise being pulled into it again when they were forced the first time that they are only waiting to annoy Tom enough to die. And however much he thinks he is the member of the inner circle, there is a reason why his Dark Mark is always visible.

The Taboo on his name is light nowadays, when compared to the old one. Now, you only get snatchers, nothing more than werewolves who want you to suffer. Back in the days before his fall, when you said his name aloud, you woke up the next day to get tortured, see your family be tortured, and that only ended when you accepted the Dark Mark; then, you were tortured until you either killed those for whom you took it or until you were no longer able to raise a wand. Not everyone got through their initiation. Severus's act of bringing Tom the part of the prophecy that he heard was his /penance/ for not being able to pass his even though he sought to take the Dark Mark and was not forced into it.

Regulus did not die because he drank the potion. He died because he tried to confront Tom about Kreacher and was tortured to death. Tom did not know that Regulus took the amulet, and he certainly did not tell him for he was in too much of an agony to speak of anything.

The werewolves follow him not only because of his power, but also because he is rumoured to have a cure for Lycantrophy, and Greyback is well aware that if he truly does have it and they rebel he will not ask for permission before simply using it and then watching them break. The Dementors do not follow him but the ministry which by then is so compromised that it could as well be his, but he does not care, he just points them to places with people and they are eager to go there and sate themselves. The Giants, he recruited with the help of Dementors.

Even when the Horcruxes are destroyed, Tom still cannot die. They would know, they did kill him in the battle of Hogwarts, only for the Death Eaters to use a ritual to revive him. Though Harry is not a Horcrux, he still is an anchor, and the only way to kill Tom, to actually slay him rather than merely reduce him to a wraith, is to have both him and Harry die and then have Harry's soul take his away. It is only the title of the Master of Death that allows Harry to do so, that is the one power granted to the one who unites the three Hallows of Death, for souls normally cannot touch other souls, they all have to move on on their own, and Tom's soul cannot move from its place for even without the Horcruxes it still is chained to what they were. Harry does not need to surrender willingly, so he kills Tom as Tom kills him, by forcing the Elder Wand to turn back on Tom just as he is being slain.

The Goblins do not make faces at Harry after the whole thing, for Gringotts is no more. Hogwarts remains, for the Diadem was recovered by Death Eaters and only destroyed part of the Forbidden Forest later, and both the Ring and the Locket devastate some countryside. Nagini goes down without much of a disaster.

It is still love that is the power Tom knows not. Agape. Tom knows the other three, even if he thinks he does not need them, but agape, no, that will never be in his reach. Though he does not go gently, Harry still goes to the slaughter and he still does it willingly, and all that for the people he knows. Petunia gets his Order of Merlin, throws it thrice like a worthless bauble until the fourth time when the new Minister arrives personally. She does not recover, because she can no longer call Harry a freak, but that is worth nothing to no-one. The epilogue ends with Luna placing a painting of him that she made on his grave.

Peter Pettigrew went to Tom willingly, to take the Dark Mark before they would torture him so that he would take it. During the first war, he was only a Death Eater for a single day, but that was enough: his loyalty towards those he swore to protect broken, he did not even need to share the secret with Tom for it was no longer hidden from anyone.

** I'll put this here again, first time I found a truly terrifying voldy was in the fic linkffn(the power of the mind by Landstradd) . Voldy shows up as a construct as Harry's greatest fear( his second greatest fear was a balrog). Voldy just shows up and everyone collectively shits themselves. Dude is handsome, suave, and realizes he is a Construct at only part power, and just decides to test Harry on the pillars of dueling. He proceeds to wipe the floor with Harry iirc, and then just let's him go. Making him as powerful as you can, but just uncaring for small details, don't make him insane, make him apathetic, don't make him desperate for life, give him a goal to remake the world and just view people as things unless they are smart enough to matter to him.

**** Let me clarify, when I said 'desperate for life' I mean don't make him some idiot ranting like the Master from Doctor Who 'I'm eternal! Never dying!'

Make it a facet of his character, but not the whole point, he wants domination of the world for magic and he's a bad ass, he's suave, he's manipulative as hell, and he pisses concentrated power. He is not a volatile child that somehow managed to inspire a good old fashion civil war by throwing crucio's out like it's candy, that is my biggest gripe about the cannon character.

He's the proper villain of the series, he's supposed to be that thing in the night that goes bumping around that did things so horrifying, a decade after he's died to the masses, they refuse to even whisper his name. He's given a nation PTSD, and Rowling made him a cartoon character. She is amazing at world building, I love what she layed down the basis of, but she's not very good at a lot of character development or exposition.

***** I have disagree with you there. Her worldbuilding is wonderfully imaginative and inspiring, but is also inconsistent and illogical. It's her characters that captured my attention a decade ago and hold my interest now.

I concede that the antagonists aren't portrayed very well. The Dursleys, for example, are exceedingly cartoonish. Voldemort fumbles alot, and is defeated by a child consecutively for years, which is frankly ridiculous.

At his beginning, Voldemort was exactly as you described. He was charismatic, cunning, and powerful, yes, but he was only so successful against Dumbledore because he struck from the shadows, and instilled fear into the masses. But then tearing his soul in seven took his sanity, and that's when he started cursing anyone and everyone near him.

In my head, Voldemort was defined by his childhood: a neglected orphan, abandoned by a mother too weak and sickly to care for her own child and a muggle father who never cared in the first place, bullied by his peers and dismissed by his supposed caretakers. He wanted to leave a grand legacy, to leave an indelible mark on the world. Somewhere along the way he discovered horcruxes, and initially planned to use them as a backup, but then realized their potential for immortality - why worry about your legacy, if you never die in the first place? It's why he chose his name; it certainly isn't because "I am Lord Voldemort" is a convenient anagram of "Tom Marvolo Riddle."

Finally, I believe that the only reason why he failed, in the end, was because of his obsession with escaping death. If he hadn't made horcuxes in the first place, it's likely he'd be ruling Britain by the time canon starts.

** What a lot of fics miss out on is showing the terror going on in the background, people disappearing, people being imperioused to do heinous crimes, deaths that are unexplained.

Voldemort is terrifying for the crimes against magic he's committed, but also because he's a strong leader whose shadow army had the ability to fade into society and wait quietly for their chance to rise up again.

Have any fics used Voldemort using his time as a wraith to scout out his enemies? I doubt that he just chilled in Albania for 9 years.

Voldemort can be written as terrifying, but it takes a lot of thought to make him scary without falling back on "he murders in a blink of an eye with no regret" which to be honest, loses some of its impact over time. Yes, killing is terrible, but Voldemort is a killer and if you don't show why this should have an emotional effect it probably won't.

** I would try to make his more psychotic tendencies show. Raping, using overly creative ways of torture, sending Harry his friends' bodies in pieces just to make a point, mind torturing someone to insanity - all the things that,I think, canon Voldemort would have partaken in, had he not been a character in a children series.

That would be some truly fucked up psychological torture. Worse than any cruciatus for sure.
