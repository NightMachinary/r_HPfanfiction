Molly gets a bad rap in fandom. The Weasleys in general get their fair share of bashing, but Molly seems to take the brunt of it, even in otherwise pro-Weasley fics. She's not perfect, but one of the things I love about the Harry Potter series is that none of the characters are perfect, and I think not very many people try to understand Molly's POV. (Sidenote: I'm not a parent myself, so I wouldn't try to presume, but I am curious if people who were parents when they read the books the first time have a more sympathetic outlook on her.)

[[http://branwyn.mirrordance.net/molly.html]]

I just read this oneshot about Molly (really good, btw) and it got me thinking about her and her motivations. We know she lost her brothers in the First War, and considering that no Weasley grandparents are ever mentioned and she seems to have inherited Fabian and Gideon's stuff, it seems fairly likely that her parents died either before, during or shortly after, as well.

No wonder Molly likes having a big family and having them close to her. Then she thought the war was over, and everything would be okay. Then it came back, and she was terrified she would lose her entire family... AGAIN. Her reaction to the Boggart in OOTP seems a lot like PTSD to me, especially because we know perfectly well that Molly is an accomplished witch and duelist (which is true regardless of whether she chooses to fight most of the time; being a warrior is not the only worthwhile thing you can do, and just because you DON'T do something doesn't mean you CAN'T do it).

Anyway, I was wondering if anybody had any more fic about Molly, specifically fic that touches on these issues, and talks about her past and motivations. Probably angst, but it doesn't need to be. Any length is fine, and any era from the beginning of the First War on. I'm not really interested in her Hogwarts years. This would obviously be gen, or Arthur/Molly if there is a pairing. I'm not worried about when it was written (i.e. it's fine if it doesn't include DH canon or whatever).

Thanks in advance!


** The only one I can think of is over on Harrypotterfanfiction.com, The Unsinkable Molly Prewett series, it covers her last two years at Hogwarts. I know this isn't exactly what you were after but I think they're worth a whack.

*** The story gives loads of information on her brothers and family too.

I wouldn't say we know this. The Weasleys seem to have loads of family members running around, and just because we don't meet her parents doesn't mean they probably don't exist. I also don't think her having her brother's watch means that she has everything. It's normal for the sibling of the deceased to keep a few things with sentimental value, even if one or both parents are still alive.

Molly gets a bad rap in fanon. I mostly like her. She's not a perfect parent, but she's got a lot on her shoulders.

I know linkffn(8941789) is supposed to be good.

*** Oh, you're completely right that I'm making assumptions. That's why I said "fairly likely". It just seems a reasonable guess to me based on grandparents never even being mentioned (aside from Ron's chess set) and what we do know of Molly. But yes, it's [not canon and I hope I didn't give the impression I was trying to pass it off as such.

Thank you for the rec! I will give it a read.

** Shameless self plug, I've written a story about Molly (and her relationship with Minerva) that partially explores how her life might have been different if she'd chosen a different path than being a wife and a mother, specifically if she'd chosen to be an Auror rather than marry Arthur. It's called [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1028945][Roads Not Taken]], if you'd like to check it out!
