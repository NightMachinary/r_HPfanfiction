:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was this one fic where Harry Potter came to Hogwarts deaf but managed to, at least at the start, get by without anyone noticing. He wasn't born deaf; it was from abuse from the Dursleys, I think it was a kitchen accident? Ear infection which went untreated, so Harry lost his hearing.

Harry became extremely good at reading lips and reading the room from context. The person who figures it out is Snape, and he had a small test to confirm it in detention. Harry was embarrassed, but Snape ends up mentoring him. I think he ended up teaching Harry BSL?

Even if you can't find the specific one, I appreciate any fics where Harry is disabled and has to overcome additional challenges which come with it.

Edit: Just remembered, Snape also tried to speak slower and exaggerate his mouth movements once his suspicions were confirmed, but Harry told him he didn't need to since it actually threw him off when reading his lips.

Edit 2: He still faced off Voldemort, and in the graveyard in Goblet of Fire, Voldemort is furious he can't hear his monologue and forces Wormtail to teach him BSL so Potter can understand his monologues.

Edit 3: Found! Look in the comments

  Slytherin Trio. Deaf Harry. No ridiculous modification of beloved character behavior to turn them into evil monsters. Because fuck that shit.Ron is a Slytherin and he is perfect. Because for some reason Slytherin Harry fics tend to demonise Ron and I am not about that shit.

** I don't know of any "deaf Harry" stories, but linkffn(The Wizard of Silence by Corwalch) is a "mute Harry" story - it's a crossover with Charmed, and Harry can't speak due to complications from strep.

  HPCharmed XOver. The Dursley's hate magic so much they are willing to try & handicap Harry to insure he doens't become a Wizard. However the wizarding community aren't the only ones watching over Harry & someone intends to intervene. Rating T to be safe
