Hi everyone! I thought I'd use my cake day to do a little self promotion. I am writing a series with a female Slytherin Harry with Severus Snape becoming her guardian. It has POV sections both from female Harry and from Snape.

The series is primarily friendship and family focused, and it's gen (there will be no main pairings and very rarely will background relationships be mentioned). There is no bashing.

The first fic is completely posted, the second fic is half posted (I update every Saturday). The third fic is being edited by my beta. The fourth fic is in progress.

Here is the summary of the first fic:

When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

If any of this sounds intriguing to you, please give it a try!

** I caught up on the latest chapter just half an hour ago, and it was great! I must admit, a Harry that actually has a competent adult to depend on (and does so) was quite cathartic to read.

Plus, I'd just finished a fairly intense fic before I found these, so it was nice reading a calmer, fluffier (does this count as fluff? ...I'm pretty sure it does) fic afterwards.

I have to ask though: /why/ change her surname from Potter to Snow? Was it for the sake of the title? Is there a hint I missed somewhere? It's been driving me crazy. (Not so much the name change itself, but the fact that I might be missing a plot point/implication somewhere.)

Anyway, it's very well written and excellently paced, so I'm really glad to see that there is this much written that has yet to be posted.

*** Thanks so much. I think it's a combination of fluff and light hurt comfort.

The more I write of a competent adult helping, the more I feel bad for canon Harry. He really only had Hermione and Ron to help him through most of the books and even though Sirius was trying to help he had so many limits on what he could do because of his situation.

I've written most of the fourth year, so that should go to my beta next month, I have year back from my beta and I'm doing one last pass before I start posting.

Essentially this is an AU where James' last name is Snow instead of Potter.

Basically, what happened is Rachel and Harry originally started out as two different characters when I was writing this fic, but as I was drafting it I realized they were occupying the same space in the story so I merged them. I decided to keep the name Snow as an homage to a teacher who saved my life. She's passed on now, but I like to remember her in any way that I can.
