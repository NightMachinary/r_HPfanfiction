Something that's been bugging me is how did the Basilisk venom not destroy the Horcrux inside of Harry? Was it due to it not being on the scar or just an oversight by Rowling?


** Officially its because he didnt die. Ive seen it portray in fics that if the venom had hit the scar first instead of his arm it would have destroyed it. But other arguments that if it had hit there it would have got straight through to his brain with no time for fawkes to save him

*** That seems weird, but it raises another question: the killing curse in DH didn't hit the scar, so why would that destroy the Horcrux?

**** I believe becauee harry died. At least temporarily. Therefore his body couldnt support the horcrux thus it was destroyed and taken on as we saw jnnthe spectral kings cross

**** I think both soul and horcrux was ripped out of body, but Harry's soul came back due to his blood in Voldemort was an anchor to him

** I think the answer is that Harry's scar wasn't a Horcrux when /Chamber of Secrets/ was written or that Horcruxes weren't an idea yet.

*** God. That makes it even worse, cause the Master of Death stuff could've been a great substitute. Three Deathly Hallows, three Killing Curses being rebounded, and the entire prophecy sets it up perfectly

*** Horcruxes were always an idea and definitely were in Chamber of Secrets. The diary itself was a Horcrux we just didn't know it's true nature because Tom made it seem like it was a regular thing to “preserve a memory” of yourself in an object.

**** Yes but j.k rowling admitted to not having the idea of Horcruxes until the fourth book was being written, the foreshadowing was done extremely well for something that was not originally intended but it could have been handled better.

** What will follow is a headcanon so I may be wrong. But the way I understood it, there are a lot of misconceptions concerning the way Basilisk Venom (or Fyendfire for that matter) work.

The Basilisk Venom is not some kind of poison that directly attack the Horcrux. The Venom is just some kind of magical super acid that can destroy anything that is put inside, regardless of the magical protections that may have been put on the item. The Horcrux is then destroyed because an Horcrux is incapable to "survive" without its vessel.

In the case of Harry, the Horcrux was not destroyed because the vessel was not destroyed. Harry didn't die, and didn't even lose consciousness before Fawkes healed him. So, the Horcrux was not destroyed because its vessel (Harry) was not irremediably destroyed.

** Supposedly it's because there is supposed to be irreparable damage to the object the soul is stored in, which is confusing because there was no irreparable damage to Harry when he got rid of it in DH.

I agree with you though, feels like it doesn't make much sense.

*** Well that was because they used the killing curse ti rip the soul shard out of harry. Or at least thats the explanation that makes the most sense to me. Jk said that jarry would have had to die to destroy it which he did in DH albeit temporarily

****** Nah, intent being required for the Unforgivables is canon - it's both why Crouch!Moody has no issues in teaching the curses to children and why Harry fails to Crucio Bellatrix later on.

*** Harry's body is not Harry, Harry's body is Harry/Voldemort. It's implied the AK works by killing the soul, as there is no physical cause of death. But what happens if an AK hits a body/object that has two souls? Let's assume it kills BOTH souls. Well, alright. But Harry's soul has Lily's sacrifice protection, and is the Master of Death, AND Voldemort was using a wand against its own master to boot. So there are at least 2 possible protections and 2 weakening effects here:

1) Lily's sacrifice protection

2) Master of death protection

3) AK power dilution as it is hitting a body with 2 souls

4) AK power dilution as it is cast by a wand against its own master

We don't know what is the factor or combination of factors that ultimately saved Harry's soul. We also don't know what would have happened if he had somehow been given a Dementor's Kiss while protecting his soul - could it have sucked out /just/ Voldemort's Horcrux? Interesting questions...

** According to DH the container has to be damaged beyond repair (in the case of a living container that would mean dying). Also from DH, the Horcruxes are opposite to souls. While a soul will continue to live no matter how damaged the body is, a Horcrux will cease to exist when its container is no longer functional.

JK's explanation was that since Harry didn't die due to the basilisk venom, the Horcrux remained unaffected, while he died temporarily in DH. Of course it's a convoluted situation but it stays consistent with the story. The basilisk venom doesn't destroys the piece of soul but it typically damages whatever it impregnates beyond repair if Phoenix tears are not applied immediately and as a result, the piece of soul is destroyed.

That's the best somewhat canonical explanation we have.
