I just finished a fanfic series and now have to wait for it to be updated. But Harry gets sorted into Slytherin. The whole Blood Purist thing is still a thing, but the Slytherins turn out to be not all shitey people. I often read fics where the Slytherins are borderline evil, and are already basically full-blown Voldy supporters, but in this series they look out for each other and don't bully every other kid who isn't a pure blood or Slytherin. It was quite refreshing and I need more pleeaaase


** Highly recommend Evitative by Vichan on A03 (sorry not sure how to link it), it's one of the best Harry in Slytherin fics I've read.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

  Harry Potter's been away from the wizarding world for nearly ten years. So now that he's back, he's ready to get out there and learn to the best of his abilities. Mysterious bank-package? Not interested. All that matters is getting settled into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and perhaps leave the Dursleys for good as well.

** If you don't mind self recs and female Harry, my Slytherin is a pretty welcoming and friendly place to be.

Leo Inter Serpentes also has good Slytherins.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  A retelling of the original series, but this time, our hero wears green and silver, not red and gold.
