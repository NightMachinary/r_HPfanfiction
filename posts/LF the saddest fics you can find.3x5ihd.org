I'd prefer that they're *not* sad because they're terribly written. I'd prefer stuff from the Harry Potter fandom, but fics from others are fine too.

My current favorites are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10027124/1/Playmate][Playmates]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8766329/1/A-Promise-From-Her-Boy][A Promise From her Boy]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7949998/1/I-Am-Not-There][I Am Not There]]


** linkffn(Twine Bracelet) and linkffn(Cauterize)

Some on here have derided them as being full of more style than substance, but I believe them to be two of the better one shots around.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
