I want fics with an interesting plot that keeps you guessing and you keep reading to see how it ends or you can see the end from the first few chapters but you keep reading to see how they get there.

Romance preferably doesn't exist or isn't the main focus.

I would rather not read tropes like noble houses or WBWL but if you think it's really good I will check it out.

I usually don't like bashing but again, if the plot is really good I'll have a look.

Thanks in advance.

My man.

So I'll just throw out an array of fics since this is a bit general and you can pick what you like:

- linkffn(Realignment): I won't spoil it too much, but basically this is hpff equivalent of Terminator 2, with Tom Riddle, Dumbledore, and Harry as the John Connor, the T800 and T1000 respectively. Its also great to see time-travelers from an outside perspective. Great action sequences, and amazing magic visuals.
- linkffn(Ectomancer): a wild ride that really manages to capture that sense of wonder that the original Harry Potter books did as Harry deals with his new magical abilities.
- linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) is the best available 'Voldemort won AU' that exists, with some outstanding characterization on Harry, Voldemort and Snape in particular.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone) is sort of like what an HP/Hatchet crossover would look like in eastern europe. Yeah.
- linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) imagines Harry Potter but with a 'Groundhog Day' twist (or 'Re:Zero' if you prefer anime).
- linkffn(Concentric Wavelengths) is a oneshot (25k+ words) that takes a very sharp spin on the DoM break-in during OotP.
- linkffn(The Weapon Revised) is a completely romance-less Harry trains after Sirius's death in OotP, and is honestly one of the most believable portrayals of what kind of damage that would do to a teenager.

If these are to your liking, let me know and I will shoot out some more. I feel you on romance and tropes getting tiresome.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

- linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): one of the most believable 'Harry-in-Slytherin' stories I have come across, and shows how utterly exhausting it would be for Harry if he wasn't in a safe environment like Gryffindor (relatively speaking of course).

You ever feel like so many of those get bogged down repeating the old storyline, not just finishing off the bad guy? Well this is the fic for you. Harry wastes no time and goes straight for the jugular - blasting, burning, slashing, maiming and ripping shit up to take out Voldemort in twelve hours.
- linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure): a novelty as a 2nd person fic, but this is truly an adventure as Harry and Bill rampage through South America along with a ragtag band of psychopaths (the most americanized HP fic I can ever remember reading). If the perspective is jarring, I found its easier to /listen/ to than actually read.
- Linkffn(Shadow of Angmar): the best crossover in the fandom for me, Harry dives into the middle 3rd Age and becomes wrapped up in his quest to find and best the Witch-King of Angmar. Bonus points for both beautiful writing and incredible potions ideas.
- Linkffn(The Resistance of Azkaban): one of the truly original works in the fandom, if somewhat unpolished. Voldemort took over eventually, and now Harry manages the last British safe-haven for the light - out of the fortress of Azkaban. Some very epic scale battles, though my favorite is honestly the Morsmordre scenes.

Tried to keep romance to a minimum, otherwise the range becomes somewhat wider.

  The crumbling island prison of Azkaban has been evacuated, its remaining prisoners left behind. Time growing short, Harry Potter will make one final bid for freedom, enlisting an unlikely crew of allies in a daring escape, where nothing is as it seems.

** I generally dislike WBWL, but if you haven't tried linkffn(harry potter and the prince of slytherin) it meets the rest of your requests and is very, very well done.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  A true single point of departure leads to a world without Harry. Changes compound- and no one is safe.

** Linkffn(Democracy by Starfox5)

The war is over. Harry, Hermione, Ron and Neville are heroes. While Harry and Ron clean up the criminals and remaining Death Eaters, Hermione and Neville go into politics.

Unfortunately their political opinions differ greatly....

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

** [[http://www.hpmor.com][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] fits your specifications: oodles of plot, basically no romance, minimal noble house stuff. One of the most popular fanfics ever written.
