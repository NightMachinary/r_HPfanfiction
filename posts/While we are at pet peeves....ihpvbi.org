/Miss. Granger/ is incorrect. It should be written without the period.

you have Mr. Potter, Mrs. Weasley, only because those are short forms. Miss is a normal, not shortened word, so it should just be Miss Granger.

way too many fics put a period after Miss. waaaaay too many.


** Probably more to do if you're using British/American standard? They're all titles to me, so I may be wrong!

#+begin_quote
  British usage favours omitting the full stop in abbreviations which include the first and last letters of a single word, such as Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr and St; American usage prefers (A) Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr. and St., with full stops. Most other abbreviated titles, however, require a full stop, as shown above.

** Miss, Mrs, and Ms all stand for "Mistress" - they are all "short forms". It's just a British vs American English thing, as [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] notes.
