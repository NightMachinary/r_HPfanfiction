:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a HP fanfic a long time ago and don't recall the name and hence not able to find it now. These are the some of the points I remember from the story:-

1. Harry goes to Marauders era. Not sure time travel or alternate dimension.
2. He saves Lily Evans when death eaters attack diagan alley.
3. Lily has couple of friends and harry starts getting attcahed to one of them.
4. There is a dueling tournament organized in Hogwarts, harry wins against lily and sirius and faces snape in the final. The winner of the tournament gets to face dumbledore and need to last 1 hr in duel with dumbeldore. Harry duels and lasts a full hour.
5. There is a running battle between Harry and a death eater (Macnair?) and in the end death eater is captured.

I would appreciate if someone can identify the story and let me know the name?


** A Last Resort - linkffn(4196344).

It was Dolohov, not Macnair, IIRC.
