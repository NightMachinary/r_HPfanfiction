I've been re-reading Serpentine ( linkffn(12459242) ), an incomplete fic in which Harry hatches a Basilisk and keeps it as his familiar.

One scene that stood out to me, is Dumbledore taking Harry to the Unspeakables to get the Horcrux removed - thus firmly abandoning the notion that Harry needs to die for Voldemort to be defeated.

That got me wondering, are there any other fics in which something like that happens, where Dumbledore doesn't raise Harry "like a pig for slaughter" but actually tries to make sure Harry survives the war, up to and including finding a way to remove the Horcrux?


** dumbledore actually succeeds in linkao3(souls touch, and the future changes) - it's a pretty gruesome method, though. it also might not be your cup of tea, as it has a dark, very cold harry that's fairly similar to tom in some ways due to the method of horcrux removal.

the fic also has voldemort dead entirely since dumbledore just hunted down all of the horcruxes instead of the whole politics thing, so fair warning.

  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets. Usually. When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.

** He's not really the driving force behind it, but he's part of the process of researching how to de-horcrux Harry in linkffn(The Arithmancer) series. It's a long series, though, and that's only one part of it (and only in book 2). Pretty neat resolution, though: Hermione develops a variation on the Killing Curse and uses it in a ritual involving both Harry and Ginny - who inadvertently become horcruxes for /each other/ as a side effect.

** I remember some fic that I read years ago had Horcruxes actually be so much harder to destroy than in canon. Basically, they could /only/ be living things because their function was to take over the victim if the original died, and would jump to the nearest viable host if their current host was killed. This meant that not only was Harry a Horcrux, /so was Ginny/. They ended up having a big ritual in which Dumbledore severed the connection to Voldemort with the Sword of Gryffindor.

If you'll excuse the self-plug, it's a major plot-point late in one of my fics. Fair warning, it's a novel-length Naruto crossover, but one of my biggest goals was keeping the ninja stuff from overpowering or overshadowing the Potterverse so things would stay balanced without feeling forced. Dumbledore spends a lot of time and effort helping construct and carry out a cleansing ritual. The de-scarcruxing takes place in book six, linkao3(Umino Iruka and the Covert Cabinetry) of linkffn(Umino Iruka and the Will of Fire).
