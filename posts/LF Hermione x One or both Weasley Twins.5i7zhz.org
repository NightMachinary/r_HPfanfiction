Hey guys,

As the title says, I'm looking for recommendations for fics involving one the following pairings:

- Hermione x Fred
- Hermione x George
- Fred x Hermione x George

Preferences/Likes:

- Time Travel (serious bonus points for a fic including one of the above pairings and time travel).
- No incest (icky)
- Multi-chapter (no one-shots)
- Good grammar/spelling.
- COMPLETED (no abandoned or WIP, I read too quickly)
- Indifferent to smut, I don't mind either way, but I'd prefer a fic with a plot and not PURE smut.
- I love DARK post-war fics, but during school fics are GREAT too! Really just recommend me what you've read and liked!


** I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] and it's sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]]. It's basically novel length so it takes a while to get there, but it's eventually Hermione/George. It's extremely well written and very very enjoyable. There is no time travel, but otherwise it fits your criteria - no incest, multi chaptered, excellent writing quality, very plot based, and a school fic (the first one covers years 1-4, and the second years 5-7). The sequel isn't complete, but it is updated once a week, so I feel comfortable recommending it. It will take a while even for a quick reader, as there are 84 chapters in the first part and already 36 chapters in the sequel.

** The potential of a 50 shades of grey style story with the Weasley twins dominating Hermione.

Hermione the good girl who focuses on her studies and doesn't like to break rules dominated by the bad boy Weasley twins who like causing trouble and flirting with the ladies.....

Just saying...

Hermione is not by any stretch of the imagination like that. She set the robes of snape on fire in first year, stole from him in second. Even if she were a submissive person she would research it and do everything properly.

  Complete. FWHG. Hermione and Fred accidentally go back in time to the Marauder's Era when a potion explodes. Hilarity ensues when Fred creates their cover story.
