While Harry Potter is a magical world and meant for children, it doesn't mean that adults don't enjoy it. However, in some cases, a few small details make many people question themselves. These small "strange things", as I believe, led to a genre of "bashing" (with Dumbledore, Ron, Ginny... being the most famous targets)

One detail I found "iffy" is the total disregard toward technology of the magical world. As an engineering student, I find such action questionable and I'd like to ask: what if we throw in some serious tech inside HP? For example

- In-universe: Military and their toys. The UK defense force (including army and intelligence force) was included to get rid of the magical menace. Preferably in a curp-stomp battle. Also preferably when the Hogwarts students get their eyes opened

- Hellsing: While Allucard is an undead vampire, he has guns... very very dangerous guns. I wonder what happened if Voldy pisses him off

- Halo: 23rd-century tech is almost magical to the early 21st-century, I wonder how the magical view it (and when Harry gets rescued from the Dursley from a young age and transferred to a new planet)

- Deus Ex: I remember there is an unfinished HP fanfic (listed in Harry Potter section) using this franchise. Harry, after an accident, was augmented and adopted by Sharif, he came to Hogwarts to compete in Triwizard Competition and got laid with Luna and Hermione (in the same time).

So, do you guys know any story following the idea of "tech-savvy" and/or "Muggle do it better"? Thanks in advance


** No battle here, but only because the other side is as peaceful as it gets. "Curbstomp" is very appropriate. Basically your Halo example in a non-Halo setting. (A bit unfinished though.) linkffn(Culture Shock by Ruskbyte)

And it's probably way too magitech for you (not much to do with actual muggle technology), but one of my favorite "tech-savvy Harry" fics (plus the first sequel - didn't like the second sequel, too much of a timeskip): linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist; Madness at the Gate)

And, um, I'm not sure if the bot even works that way, but I'll still try to link to the Inquisitor Carrow series and see what happens: linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow)\\
Basically, at some point between early first and late second year (can't recall precisely), Harry Potter is thrown into the WH40k setting, and gets trained as an Inquisitor (among other things) in the Imperium of Man. Then he gets back, 200-odd subjective years later, and tries to introduce all sorts of M41 stuff to both magical and muggle society. Very funny.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

** I think Stargate has great crossover potential, and it took place slightly after Voldemort's defeat, just in time for heroes to embark on their next great adventure. The Goa'ulds were serious bad guys and worthy of an enemy. However, well written fics are rare. /The Stars Alone/, linkffn(12040341), is very entertaining, but that story also contains elements from the Star Wars universe.

If you remove magic completely, there is always the [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. But I don't think that's what you are asking.

As for in-universe 'curb stomp' fics, try these three:

/Agent Potter/, linkffn(8465414)

/Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution/, linkffn(10595005)

/Long Live The Queen/, linkffn(11500936)
