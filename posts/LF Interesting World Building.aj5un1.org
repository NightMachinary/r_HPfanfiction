My favorite stories are the ones that broaden our understanding of the wizarding world. It could explore other magical human cultures, the society of other sentient magical beings, or even just how Magical Britain got to the state it's in. I'm looking for any recommendations on such stories. Bonus points if the main character is involved in shaping or changing some aspect of society.

Some examples of stories I've enjoyed are: - Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Bungle in the Jungle - A Second Chance at Life - Delenda Est

Obviously there are a lot of stories that could fit the broad criteria I noted above, so if you have a recommendation, please tell us why you're recommending it.

Thanks in advance!


** Well since no ones said it yet have linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) I think it has the best world building I've seen in a fanfiction

** I think I've recced some of these before on world building requests so please excuse any duplicates.

â€‹

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11517506/1/The-odds-were-never-in-my-favour][The odds were never in my favour by Antony444]] has excellent worldbuilding with a much darker magical world. Harry is the unwitting avatar of a Goddess and Voldemort is only a minor danger compared to what she has to face. Warning Harry is female and the latest chapter has some femslash. linkffn(11517506)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3000137/1/On_the_Wings_of_a_Phoenix][On the Wings of a Phoenix by makoyi]] Harry learns about an unplottable community where many dark and neutral families live lincluding Regulus', Snape's, Percy's & Charlie's families. He learns the history of the first wizarding world war and that it is very different from what he's been told. linkffn(3000137)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit_of_the_Raven][Wit of the Raven by japanese-jew]] features a wonderfully complex Hogwarts where quartets composed of individuals from each house are created, challenges are given every week, & merit points are used for currency to provide amenities & access to advanced information. linkffn(2740505)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4544781/1/What_They_Dont_Know][What They Don't Know by Lil Nezumi]] linkffn(4544781) is a really nice fic where Hagrid starts visiting Harry every year on his birthday after he turns 7 and educates him about the magical world by use of an Arcum learning trunk

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1535306/chapters/3249581][Harry Potter and the Kindling of The Fire by TigerShark]] is a great timetravel fixit series with a more fleshed out magical world. linkao3(1535306)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8215565/1/Knowledge-is-Useful-But-Power-is-Power][Knowledge is Useful, But Power is Power by DisobedienceWriter]] has a fascinating view of the Ministry, oaths, and the reasons for Dumbledore's poor choices. linkffn(8215565)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6573724?view_full_work=true][Beyond the Breaking Point by FalconLux]] in which Harry raises Harry and they travel the world while he makes a living as an enchanter linkffn(6573724)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12957404/1/Subversion][Subversion by Myricle]] linkffn(12957404) Interesting twin fic where occlumency is part of a larger, complex psionic ability and Harry is a mind magic savant.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12367941?view_full_work=true][Abhorsen-in-Waiting: The Philosopher's Stone by KageKitsune13]] is a great crossover with the Garth Nix books and a much more complex magical world. linkao3(12367941)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12550081/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Polymagus][Harry Potter and the Polymagus by jlluh]] has a completely original take on transfiguration and animagus forms. linkffn(12550081)
