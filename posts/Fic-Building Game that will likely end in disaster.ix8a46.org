I'm bored. Anyone else bored? If so, maybe you'll play this game.

I'm going to start by commenting a made up title. Someone can respond with a made up chapter title and then someone can respond to that with the first couple sentences of the story. Then a new person can add on to it, and then another person can add on to that and so on and so on.

The goal is to end up with a fanfiction. This will likely end in disaster. Oh well.

****** First, he drank his long awaited bottle of felix felicis that he was brewing since he knew the party was going to take place. Little did he know, he was 1 percent immune to it, so one percent of what he did would fail miserably.
