** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]], while Harry goes to Durmstrang, his brother the Boy Who Lived attends Hogwarts.

Lily and James are alive and Harry occasionally hears from his brother. Book 4 is in progress, on DLP, and his brother is a more significant character.

** This one is still in progress, but everything by this author is amazing. There are a few stories up and I ended up picky about other fanfics because her writing was so excellent, nothing else could compare. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2790804/1/Child-of-Four]]
