A lot of people dislike the Epilogue of DH and ignore it when writing their stories, and a lot of people don't. Some people take anything that comes out of JKR's mouth after DH's publication as undeniable canon.

What camps do you folks fall into, and what are your views on the division in the fanbase?


** It's *fan*fiction. The fans have the say. How is disregarding the epilogue any different from shipping Hermione and Draco or not killing Dumbledore?

If you, as the author, want to disregard something, who the hell cares? If you want to follow JKR as a god whose word is the truth/law, be my guest.

But don't go after people saying, /"Well, JKR said that Draco and Astoria have marriage problems in an obscurely-worded tweet last month, so your fic doesn't make any sense!"/. That's just stupid.

*** My problem with that is that many authors take that as an excuse to change anything they want for no reason at all. Of course it's fine to change things, but there has to be a reason. If we did know that Draco and Astoria had marriage issues, for instance, it wouldn't make sense for them to disappear just because the fanfic author wants them to. There has to be a reason for every change presented, or it's just bad writing.

** I write post-DH and next-gen stuff, so it can get really frustrating because there's all these little tidbits out there from pottermore or the wiki (like Fay Dunbar, who the hell is she? She's never mentioned in any of the books, but she's listed as one of Hermione's roommates). My primary source is 'if it's in the books then it's canon', and then from there I'll pick and choose what out of the interviews/pottermore I'll include. I use most of the major stuff, like Neville/Hannah, occupations for Harry and co. who all the Weasleys married and their children's names. Some of the details for the minor characters I'll ignore, like there's some debate whether Lavender lived or died and I wrote Umbridge once and was told she went to Azkaban.

I'm pretty flexible with the pottermore/interview stuff since not everyone's caught up on it. Especially since JKR likes to tweet or give extra things out, so for all I know she might say tomorrow that Neville never had any children and that would completely mess with anyone who ever gave the Longbottoms a child.

** I dislike the epilogue not because of its contents but because of the damage it caused and still causes in the fandom.

I feel that the chances for new people to enter the fandom almost vanished because of the epilogue, there's almost no space for the whole "I wonder what could happen" thing that motivates writers and readers. I mean, I know the fandom still exists but there could have been /more/ writers, /more/ readers, /more/ ideas, and that loss is what makes me dislike the epilogue and the barrier to entry it created.

** I am very much of the EWE camp. I hated the epilogue with a fiery passion because it felt so pat, even twee and it did not add anything of particular value to the plot or story.

I simply cannot be bothered with Pottermore, although I have read all the extra material out of interest.

Moreover, there are times when I simply disagree with assertions JK has made, things which simply don't simply follow the internal logic of the world (happy to expand on that, but I won't bore you unnecessarily in the meantime) but more than this, I get annoyed with the constant drip feed of new information that self appointed "Canon Police" want to beat you with.

Its been almost 20 years FFS, either write more books set in this world or /shut the fuck up about it/. No work is perfect, even if written by genii (How many children had lady Macbeth?) and there is a massive, enormous section of the fanbase whose enjoyment is derived from finding those grey areas, gaps, holes and loose threads and using them to create new tales of fan fiction, after two decades to still be embroidering over them because you made it up and are the boss of the whole thing just seems... mean.

Regarding the divisions within fandom, my interactions for the most part have seen me find lovely people with a "live and let live mentality". There are exceptions, and you can engage and let it get nasty and rob the enjoyment of the experience or you can let it slide by and do your own thing or seek out people who engage with the material the same way you do. I don't see much point in the drama to be honest.

But honestly all the pairing up of characters made me cringe, the "Ginny Potter" and "Hermione Weasley" nonsense did not fit with canon characterisations at all, and the naming of Harry's kids ALL AFTER DEAD PEOPLE made me want to AUGH.

***** Except we don't know that. For all we know she picked the names because her children know her family. They grow up with them and they're in their lives. So to give her children a link to HARRY'S family they get their names. (Which is why I still wish it was Lily Nymphadora not Lily Luna. I have fan wanked it to them leaving Nymphadora for Teddys future children)

It's an old fashioned society. Even now it's not uncommon to have children named after dead realtives.

And on the surnames I can aboustly believe Hermione changes her name. It's aboustly fine to change your name. It's fine to keep your name. It's your choice.

Whilst I don't hold the same opinion, I can sympathise with this view. In fact as a friend of mine said about this, they viewed the entire epilogue as 'fan service' for the Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny fans. The same friend is of the opinion that the ending was designed to make it all have a fairytale ending, much like the fairy tales you read as a kid. Which, in retrospect, is nice if you're a kid who's reading it all for the first time. But with age and re-reads, opinions change.

** I think it depends on the story, honestly. I mean, if the pairings in the fanfic are not canonical (and let's face it, a whole lot of them aren't) then you can't really use the epilogue of DH. The whole thing becomes an AU before it's even really started.

Personally when it comes to the divisions in communities, I've learned it's best to keep your opinions to yourself and not get involved. Because when you open it up to debate then not everyone wants to be civil in it and can get quite aggressive when they say their piece.

But when it comes to canon, my foremost source is the actual set of books that she wrote. I regard Pottermore and any of the other fansites as secondary sources. They're more headcanony than anything else.

Same here. If things are hinted at in canon, but not really explained and they get expanded on Pottermore then I'll consider it but won't really look at it as canon. But when something comes out of the blue with nothing linked to canon at all like [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America][this]], I'm more hesitant about thinking of it as canon.

The only thing that ticks me off are people who insist canon is /always/ better and any deviation from canon is seen as a flaw--reinventing canon is part of what fanfiction is about.
