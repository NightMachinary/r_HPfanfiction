OK so I'm kinda embarrassed to put this because in and of itself I dislike Twilight, but surprisingly there are some OK crossovers. What I'm looking for are fics with Harry Paired with Edward, Emmet, or Jasper where Harry convinces them that it's OK for them to Drink Human Blood.

A great Example of this is -

  After Jasper slips and kills Bella Swan, he breaks away from his family in the attempt to come to terms with his mistake. While hunting in the magical world, he finds his true mate in a chance meeting in the Forbidden Forest. Harry Potter, after having just witnessed the death of his beloved godfather, finally decides to turn his back on the Light Side of the war. Both Jasper and Harry embrace each other as well as their darkness and relish in the destruction left in their wake.
