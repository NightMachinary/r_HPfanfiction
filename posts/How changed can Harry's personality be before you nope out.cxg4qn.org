I'm working on a few drastic AUs, mostly crossovers where Harry grows up in very different circumstances from canon. I'm unsure how much of his canon characterization is innate and how much is dependent on his upbringing. I personally enjoy crazy divergence AUs where he's totally different than canon, but I've seen a lot of people don't like that sort of thing.

So, the question: as a reader, how different can Harry's personality be for you to enjoy the story? Are there any core Harry-ness traits which must be present for you to suspend disbelief, or are you good with anything so long as it's not written abysmally?

Thanks!


** For me, it can be "Harry Potter" in nothing but name. You can write about a complete psychopath that shares nothing but the name and looks and I will still read it, IF:

1. It is well written.
2. The personality change makes some sort of sense.

I don't read fanfics for carbon copy Potters of the original. Be creative. Go nuts.

** I think the answer to this question is the same for why I would drop a lot of canon-divergence or AU stories. Really, it boils down to this: /Does the change here follow a semi-logical or believable progression?/

For example, all those fics where Harry meets X person prior to the Hogwarts Express and ends up wildly diverging in personality - this is not a believable progression. People are not like that. Its even worse, because...well honestly Harry should not have had the personality he had in canon anyway.

What I mean by that is that Harry is more or less not affected by the neglect and emotional abuse he endured in any real way in canon. He is constantly described (and its valid too) as having James personality as well, with perhaps a touch of his mother. Having never met them at all, this implies he would have been about how he was in canon except in the most drastic of circumstances (say torturing him or raised as a child soldier).

Ironically, that last part is actually to Rowling's detriment, though I think it may have been accidental. One of her themes (particularly in CoS) was that its not how we are born but what we choose to be. That genetics don't really matter. Problem is Harry, and Voldemort if you want to get down to it, sort of imply the exact opposite in canon. Ultimately they both had their fathers' looks and personalities with just a hint of their mother (also important because of blood), despite having never met or known them growing up (and no, the Graveyard shades and Tom murdering his dad at 16 don't count).

** I personally can't stand it when Harry's written as this over confidant cool headed lady's man who's more politically savvy than god. Part of what makes Harry interesting is that he's not perfect: he's awkward, got a temper, not that ambitious, and not very outgoing. Like, being raised in a different environment allows for some pretty drastic changes, as long as you account for why those changes occur and don't make him this perfect all powerful being.

** I'm personally not interested in a deeply dark Harry, not even if the changes that brought him there (raised by Bellatrix, etc.) are a valid explanation.

And I'm not interested in a womanizing Harry, not even if the changes that brought him there (fragment of James' soul sticks to Harry and reacts to Lily cheating by disparaging all women) are a valid explanation.

But I'm more open to other changes--- more trusting or more into academics because he was raised by a loving, supportive adult. Or more timid because he was scarred by Dursley abuse.

It's a personal preference thing, like everything else, with the one golden rule being that you'd better explain what about your AU made Harry into Harry-in-name-only.

** As long as it's a good story and somewhat makes sense, anything goes.

If the entire premise of the story is that Harry has a completely different childhood, then obviously he's going to be different. If Voldemort did ....something.... to him as a baby, he's also going to be different, and that's perfectly fine if it makes a good story.

Because if Harry grew up in a loving family reading science fiction and nonfiction books then it's perfectly reasonable that he might ride a broom with transfigured rocket motors attached to escape from the baddies at some point in the story, and I'm okay with that because it makes for a totally awesome scene.

If Harry with exactly the same background as canon Harry tries the same stunt, then that's a bit out of character.

(I guess you can tell that I'm currently re-reading Methods of Rationality)

** Edgy, sarcastic but in that bratty sort of way that seems kind of artificial? Like I can't describe it but he's less Harry more Bart Simpson?

Also too many pop culture references, too many pranks or trying to act like how the author thinks James would act.

Overly mean to Ron, thinking he's a lazy idiot- Harry loves Ron and respects him.

Harry at the end of the day, is a decent person with a good head on his shoulders

** So long as the personality changes are coherent with the rest of the setting I don't really care how different Harry is.

Mind you, that's not to say I'll gladly read all sorts of personalities. It just means that I won't read them because they're (relative to my tastes and preferences) shit characters rather than because they're too OOC.

** It does depend on the departure point.

I personally prefer a more in awe of magic Harry. One who approaches what a Hogwarts age Voldemort was like in skill.

His flaws shouldn't be exaggerated like fics that try to copy canon do.

** I usually read fics where Snape mentors/, adopts Harry and lately more so have been when he's at Hogwarts. In quite a few he goes from being semi normal (other than dealing with depression, abuse etc) and then he's a huge crybaby that needs to be tucked in and all

I understand him being weepy and all but I can't stand when he's a bigger version of a toddler

** The ones I have a problem with is an OOC Harry in a post books setting. If he's going to be a completely different person, then the backstory to justify it has to be there.

** I don't like to read fics where Harry's evil. I hate even more fics where he does evil things for evil people and somehow he's the one in the right.

Don't mess with his instinctive knowledge of right and wrong. That's his only super power that's canon, and rooted in his personality as separate from the vagaries of his upbringing.

If Harry becomes apathetic, that means he's not actually invested in the plot we're reading, and that's boring.

To me, no matter what changes, Harry Potter is basically a decent person, who cannot help putting himself in danger sometimes.

** I don't like fics that make him a casual murderer of innocents, but that's a general nopezone for me. For example, I started reading one a while ago, which had some pretty good worldbuilding with "druidic" things, but by the end of the second chapter he first flirts with a muggle barista, then leads her to a pier and then murders her by drowning, all described in very visceral detail.

Not really something I like.

** I'll put up with a super smart Ravenclaw Harry, a somewhat dark side Harry, a gray/neutral Harry that doesn't want to be involved in the war no matter what, an independent Harry that doesn't put up with anyone's crap or nonsense, but I'm done when I read about a pureblood raised Harry that's racist in the way that he can't stand muggleborns.
