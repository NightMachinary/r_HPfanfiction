What are some interesting Defense professors in fanfiction that have their own little side plot or are maybe concerned with the main one? I just want someone different than Lockhart or Quirell but they don't necessarily have to be a replacement. Well-written as well.


** Black Luminary has Aenor Rose who is pretty awesome and one of the better OC's I've read. She features quite prominently in the fic and is competent.

Unspeakable Things by Darth Marrs has the the DADA Professor as an undercover Unspeakable, who then trains Harry, Ginny, and Luna as well as being their coordinator for future missions.

Prince of Slytherin has a very clever DADA Professor who is not Gilderoy Lockhart, but rather Lazarus White, who is in fact Regulus Black. The sheer genius behind this is the projects he gives the students throughout the school year are all meant for his own use; to break his brother Sirius out of Azkaban. He is very competent and has a few very solid interactions with Harry.

  Unspeakable Things by Darth Marrs

How is this fic overall? I don't think I've read it, but it looks interesting and I definitely enjoyed the other two fics on your list

**** Hmm. I'll be honest I am a big Darth Marrs fan, so I'll try to be unbiased.

The story itself is well written but not on the level of the other two. It is not a large AU, but it does leave canon stations very quickly. The most off putting thing is the Harry/Ginny/Luna dynamic, although I personally didn't mind it. Luna's characterization is also a point of contention, as in this fic she is deeply messed up after the Death of her mother and has no morals.

All in all Darth Marrs as always delivers a quality fic that is probably still worth a read, although it won't make any top 100 lists anytime soon. It isn't his best work by any means, that belongs to The Firebird Trilogy.

** I am writing an eight-year fic where my DADA professor is the granddaughter of Professor Galatea Merrythought, who was DADA professor from around 1895 to 1945 in canon.

** linkffn(The Stag and the Dragon) has probably... probably the most unexpected Defence Professor. You have a look.

** Off the top of my head, year two of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by the Sinister Man]] is different. It has Lockhart in it but he's smart and not who you think he is.

Edit: oh wow, I really should have read the other comments first. But yeah, if you haven't read this fic, 10/10 recommend.

** My line-up so far in linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor):

- *First Year*: Quirrelmort (no surprises there, though he isn't defeated the same way)

- *Second Year:* Lokchart is ousted within weeks, replaced by Professor Alexander Max, the Ghoul Studies Professor. He's very old, very creepy and completely nuts, but actually kind of competent.

- *Third Year:* Lupin

- *Fourth Year:* Grindelwald
