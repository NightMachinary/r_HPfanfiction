I'm looking for a Power Couple kind of set up; the idea that they both are abnormally strong and really driven to learn as much as they can about magic. I know this is kinda specific, so any tropes are fine. Bonus points for Ron bashing.

Thank you :)

**** You're welcome. Let me know if you want some more when you're done, I've got more. Mostly time travel, so it will be one or the other being OP, but I have a few more where they both go back (robst has another In this World and the Next that's good if you like his writing)

***** Sounds good. I enjoy time travel as well, but the ones I enjoy the most are where both Harry and Hermione go back together. This is off topic, but do you ever read a fanfic with a certain pairing, finish it, then read one with a different pairing? It gives me a strange feeling of wrongness. For instance, I went on a Harry/Tonks binge for a while, but recently I have switched to Harmony; whenever I see Remus with Tonks its strangely uncomfortable to read. The same thing happens with seeing Ron/Hermione after reading Harmony. Sorry about that tangent but I was wondering if I'm the only one.

******* I can tolerate Remus/Tonks if its not focused on much in a story, but I can't stand Romione. It just does not make sense that they would like each other that way, at least to my eyes. IMO J. K. Rowling REALLY had to force their relationship. The only thing they have in common is Harry.

  Harry learns of the plans and plots that have been laid out before him. He is tired of never knowing what is coming his way and he takes matters into his own hands. Along the way he has a set of parents that he has adopted, a crazy elf, a best friend, and a friend like no other to help him out. Let the adventure begin! Pairings H/HG/SB.

  Despite how impossible it seemed, Harry was sure his dad had saved the three of them from the dementors. After Hermione's time turner took them both back three hours, he was desperate to discover if who he'd seen casting that patronus was truly his dad. Harry certainly wasn't disappointed when his mum turned up instead, and changed the entire course of his life. Harry/Hermione

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

  A hopefully different time travel story. Adult Harry and Hermione jump back in time to the Halloween the Potters were killed and baby Harry became an orphan. These adult versions change the past in the hopes of a better future. Won't-know-what-hit-him Dumbledore, AU, Harry/Hermione. Summaries are hard.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
