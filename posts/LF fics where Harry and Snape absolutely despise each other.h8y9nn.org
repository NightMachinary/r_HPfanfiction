A lot of Harry-at-Hogwarts Era rewrites and time travel fics have Harry and Snape either maintaining their mutual dislike or, more often, growing to like or at least respect each other. I desperately want to read a fic where the opposite of that happens. Like a Sirius and Snape level of animosity between them. Similar to how Harry feels at his worst moments in canon, inspired by these scenes from Goblet of Fire (chapter 18):

#+begin_quote
  Snape looked cold­ly at Hermione, then said, “I see no dif­fer­ence.”       Hermione let out a whim­per; her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the cor­ri­dor and out of sight.       It was lucky, per­haps, that both Har­ry and Ron start­ed shout­ing at Snape at the same time; lucky their voic­es echoed so much in the stone cor­ri­dor, for in the con­fused din, it was im­pos­si­ble for him to hear ex­act­ly what they were call­ing him. He got the gist, how­ev­er.”
#+end_quote

And immediately afterwards

#+begin_quote
  ”Har­ry sat there star­ing at Snape as the les­son be­gan, pic­tur­ing hor­rif­ic things hap­pen­ing to him....If on­ly he knew how to do the Cru­cia­tus Curse...he'd have Snape flat on his back like that spi­der, jerk­ing and twitch­ing....”
#+end_quote

All tropes, pairings, and time periods are fine, but I'd prefer no Harry/Slytherin Girl, Harry/Harem, Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-etc., and OP Harry.

The one solid no-go is bashing. No Dumbledore, Weasley, or Hermione bashing.


** "What is your quest?"

"to seek the holy grail."

Sadly, op, what you're asking for is just as elusive and rare an item as that very grail. It almost certainly exists, but just as a trillion cups exist and only one grail, so are there millions of stories and few, few few that have none of the almost universal failings you've listed.

** Complete and total side bar; Has anyone noticed that, despite his good nature and generally non-evil actions, Harry has one /hell/ of a vicious streak? Listen to him in that last quote! He's actually thinking about how great it would be to know the Cruciatus Curse so he could have Snape "on his back like that spider, jerking and twitching.". I mean, seriously. People like to act like his use of the Cruciatus against Carrow came out of nowhere, but I honestly wasn't all that surprised.

*** Absolutely. I was watching this [[https://youtu.be/lgj2rQTmymw][review]] and the video pointed out how Harry could really be cruel at times. During HBP, he repeatedly shoots langlock curses at Filch. It seems funny and offhand at first, but the text makes it clear that Harry was doing it unprovoked and for the sole purpose of amusing himself and his friends. Filch is definitely an annoyance, but Harry using magic against a squib unprovoked and for /fun/ is the equivalent of kicking someone when they're already down.

** This definitely seems to be the case in Resurrect the Living by fascinationex. It's a time travel fic where a grown Harry is forced to go back in time for reasons I won't disclose (spoilers!). In his first-year Potions class, he one-ups Snape with his impressive knowledge of Potions and then proceeds to skip all of his classes.

*** That's such a baller move and I love this fic already for that. I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but I looked at some reviews on the Dark Lord Potter forum ([[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/resurrect-the-living-by-fascinationex-m.38555/]]) and it sounds incredible. I'm kind of a sucker for MoD, time-travel, and Harrymort so this is really hitting all the marks for me. Thanks!

***** Yeah, that's really the kicker with Snape. I see, for the most part, why time-travel fics stay within the gradient of ignoring his dickishness to befriending him.

But the authors of canon-rewrites (Harry is sorted into X instead, Harry met X before Hogwarts, Harry has X ability, etc.) are definitely writing Harry as if he had the knowledge that Snape was actually an ally. It's really odd to see Harry, who immediately dislikes Malfoy because he reminds him passingly of Dudley and who hates bullies, see Snape, an adult, insulting kids and being like “You know what, I see the burning hatred in this guy's eyes he looks at me and have seen him threaten kids my age using his undeserved authority, but I, who am suddenly a very emotionally aware eleven-year-old will hold off on reacting or otherwise thinking unpleasantly of his actions because surely there must be reasonable justification for them in the long-run.”

Lmao, this turned into a rant somehow, but tl;dr, I really hate when authors suspend Harry's (or whatever MC's) judgement on something just so they can avoid conflicts later. It's a lot more subtle with the Harry and Snape's relationships and is literally so common that I didn't notice it until recently. The more glaring examples of this are the “Hmm, Sirius Black never had a trial, maybe he's /not/ guilty” halfway into PoA fics or “Professor Quirrel's stutter is a bit too periodic, innit?” in Philospher's Stone rewrites.

*** Oh dear, a few paragraphs in and you're already hit with “manipulated” and “Dumbledore's pawn.” It does look really well written, though. I like Dumbledore too much as a character to be able to sit through it if it gets much more critical, but I'll definitely set it aside for when I'm in the mood for a Dark! or Gray!Harry.

Haha, I was thinking more of Harry acting in righteous anger and getting back at Snape through a good yelling at or maybe a few curses, but the idea of Snape getting Kissed is oddly satisfying.

Thanks for the rec.

Considering Dumbledore is Snape's closest relationship and (for the most part) only loyalty coupled with time-travel fics' MCs generally not involving Dumbledore, I see why authors might decide to keep Snape at arms length.
