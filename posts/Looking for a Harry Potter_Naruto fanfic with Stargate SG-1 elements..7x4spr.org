I am looking for a story where in the beginning Harry, Voldemorts horcrux and i think either Sasuker or Orochimaru is fused/mixed together, and the only reason Harry survives is because of Lilys love/charm. This happens before hogwarts during his upbringing at the Dursleys.

Throughout the story I think he becomes a god and has Orochumaru as a subordinate, and i think it is a Harry/harem, nut i am unsure.

Thanks for any help finding it.
