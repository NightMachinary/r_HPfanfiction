Looking for fics where Harry has ambition and has a long term goal past Voldemort. He can start working towards it while he's still in Hogwarts or it can all start post Hogwarts. An example would be linkffn(13653786) in which Harry has a goal of propelling the magic world forward(as its extremely stagnant from his point of view) and making it as dynamic/innovative as the Muggle world is to him. Definitely not the normal "Salazar teaches Harry ancient magic" fic, as he hasn't even taught Harry any magic but is acting as more of a mentor to guide him in his ambition and keep him from turning into another Tom. Linkffn(13022013) is a good example of a post hogwarts version of my request as well.

Thanks

  Following the events of Third Year, Harry Potter explores the Chamber of Secrets and finds a portrait of Salazar Slytherin. Following Slytherin's advice, Harry will attempt to break out of the games set upon him and finally be free. But how? And is freedom even possible for the Boy-Who-Lived?

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.
