May or may not feature Tonks as a secret assassin. While she enjoys making friends laugh by morphing her nose to resemble a pig's, what she really *loves* is bringing the gift of her God to people.


** Now that is combining two of my favorites

** Melisandre and Trelawney have a similar amount of correct predictions. Them meeting or even swapping places would be hilarious - Trelawney telling every king that they're about to face a horrible fate, while Melisandre picks a new "Prince that was Promised" every class. She then burns Dobby in a pyre.

*** I just can't help but think about how McGonnagall's reaction will be

  â€˜Ah, of course,' said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning. â€˜There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you are The Prince this year?'

**** And the sequel

#+begin_quote
  /Neville ran starkers through the halls, screeching loudly and getting some annoyed reactions from the figures in the paintings. Harry and Ron noticed that he left a trail of slugs behind him, with a lot of them still attached to his body. "Oi Harry, maybe the red lady heard about you and Neville having the same birthday and decided to have a go at him now" said Ron, a disappointed look on his face. "He's had a better time with slugs than you then" replied Harry with a smirk. "You should ask him for snogging tips, seems like he's got more experience than you now, innit?" jabbed Ginny with a giggle and proceeding to run down the hall, making Ron's ears turn as bright red as his hair./

** Go a step further, make the original God of Many Faces a metamorphmagus. :) Metamorphmagi are basically ageless immortals anyway.

** This sounds awesome. I just started a GOT X Star Wars crossover but now I want to write this.

I'll probably never finish either even if I do! ðŸ˜‚
