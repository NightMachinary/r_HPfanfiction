** Not quite what you're looking for, but [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/salve-worm-hp.353642/][Salve]] features Bonesaw from [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] being summoned to help the Death Eaters. It's worth checking out if you've read Worm.

** A couple of Danny Phantom crossovers (Though they use shared universe rather than a summoning ritual)

linkffn(From Dust by ConstructiveWriter) Which /does/ play with some characterization (notably, Harry is far more snarky, sarcastic, and hammy; to the point where he contemplates what language to make the Ominous Background Chanting when he asks Snape for Occlumency lessons - which he is marginally more successful at than in canon (He did manage to force Snape out, but with disgust rather than willpower) )

linkffn(No Rest for the Wicked by Enigmarr)

linkffn(Phoenix Phantom) the Phantoms were just passing through when Dani intervened in the Dementor attack.

The only DP/HP crossover I've read that involved a summoning had him being summoned by the Death Eaters and escaping.

  Danny Phantom already had to deal with the problems of two worlds, so what were more mortal problems to him? Even if they were problems of a magical nature. And Harry Potter's got even more on his plate for his fifth year at Hogwarts.

  After news of Danny Phantom defeating Pariah Dark spreads to Hogwarts, Dumbledore suspects he may have found a new ally for the Order of the Phoenix, and Remus Lupin is sent to contact him. Little do any of them know that there's more to be found at Amity Park than just the ghostly hero, and Hogwarts just might find itself with a few new students. Rated T to be safe.

  Challenge response. Danny and Danielle are in England and happen to witness an introduction to a world they never knew existed when they see Harry Potter face Dementors in an alleyway of Little Whinging. When the Order of the Phoenix finds out that the Phantoms could somehow also see dementors, despite being muggles, secrets of the Wizarding World and their upcoming war unravel.

***** They're souls of sinners put into penguin suit bodies (think possession) made of explodium as a way to work off their sins. It's unknown why exactly penguin suits, but that's basically it, and whoever gets put into one gets randomly assigned to be a servant of either the angels or the demons if any of the many underworlds.

Etna is pretty much the right-hand person of her underworld's demon lord, so she has fairly wide access to Prinnies. And in the Disgaea series in general you always play as someone who has access to them anyway so it's pretty much hand-waved.

But yeah, don't expect the lore of Disgaea to make much sense. It's ... bizarre, at best.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7564997/1/The-Son-of-Death-At-Hogwarts][The Son of Death At Hogwarts]] by JackBunjeeKiki is a decent crossover involving HP and Percy Jackson and the Olympians Series. The main character that is involved is Nico do Angelo. It's sadly incomplete though.

linkffn(7564997)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12221534/1/Percy-Jackson-and-the-world-of-magic][Percy Jackson and the world of magic]] by I'mjusttryingtofindmyway is another favorite of mine and it updates consistently. For this one, it's Percy who joins Hogwarts.

  Harry's 6th Year at Hogwarts isn't going as well as he'd like it to. Slughorn, Voldemort, and a weird new student called Nico di Angelo all add up to a massive headache for the BWL. What he doesn't know is this is just the calm before the storm. Can Harry manage to trust Nico when he needs his help most, even if he doesn't want to accept the possibility of another life lost?
