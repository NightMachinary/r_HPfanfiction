I am Wolfstar trash and need your best fic recs. The longer, the better.


** What does "wolfstar trash" mean? Sorry if that is a dumb question haha.

But here are some of my fav. wolfstar -

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5204258][Annual Honesty]]- linkao3(5204258) - This is a beautifully written, almost poetic series of vignettes from the POV of Remus spanning from the Marauder's third year through Harry's 5th year. The time jumps around throughout and it is a little disorienting but compliments the writing style. Also the author's fanon reason for Sirius revealing Remus' secret to Snape is one I've never seen before - really creative and heartbreaking.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/42273][Midnight Conversations]] - linkao3(42273) - This is a Well written series of MWPP stories spanning from 6 years old until just before Harry was born. There's a lot of beautifully conflicted parts with Regalus - which is surprising because at the time of writing, only GoF had come out and the author couldn't have known that Reg turned good in the end. I loved the addition of Sirius's sister and Remus's parents as characters.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/1/Casting-Moonshadows][Casting Moonshadows]] - linkffn(3378356) - One of my favorite marauder fics. This spans from first year until the end of 6th year (although it is still being updated occasionally) and is one of the most detailed and beautifully written MWPP fics in fandom. The downsides are that it is really dark (especially Remus' and Sirius' back stories) and assuming it sticks with canon going forward, knowing what happens to the Marauders (especially Remus and Sirius), makes parts especially heartbreaking.

The pranks in this fic are amazing. The friendships are heartwarming. It will make you laugh and cry. There's a reason why this fic has 7k comments and is such a favorite almost 10 years after it was started. The author is also a published author in her own right, so you know the writing is great.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3726304/chapters/8256829][The Untold Story of Sirius Black]] - linkao3(3726304) - This isn't a favorite, but I am including it because I thought this was an interesting Marauders - especially an interesting James/Sirius. In this fic, Sirius knows he is gay for awhile and is attracted both to James and to Remus. Remus is also into Sirius, but there is a lot of homophobia and angst. James (weirdly imo) WANTS to be in a relationship with Sirius, but just is not attracted to guys no matter how much he tries (and he does try). I thought all of the hogwarts stuff in this fic was good (about the first 7 chapters) but that is where it went off the rails a bit for me. There is a really good party scene with spin the bottle etc. that I liked and that was probably the highlight of this. The writing is just okay - feels a bit childish. I tried reading the author's other work (a Harry time travels story) and it was interesting, but I am really picky about my time travel fics being super consistent and this one wasn't. Anyway, if you want a really unique slashy Marauders, this is a good fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4181253/1/Very-Bad-Things][Very Bad Things]] - linkffn(4181253) - by Freudian Fuckup. This fic isn't plotty or action packed, but it is a really sweet and fluffy glimpse into how Sirius and Remus got together during 7th year. A definite favorite. The writing is just so good you will be grinning while reading.

I encourage you to read through some/all of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1461919/freudian-fuckup][Freudian Fuckup's]] other works because s/he has some really unique wolfstars - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4003221/1/I-Know][I Know]] is another favorite.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1145357/chapters/2318859][Teenage Kicks]] - linkao3(1145357) - A really sweet and well-written wolfstar where sirius finally tells remus how he feels on the train on the way home from 7th year. They start a romance right as Remus is going to join a werewolf pack for the Order. Their relationship is so cute and well-balanced, I LOVE how sirius was such a man-whore at hogwarts and remus was such a prude, but now that they are together, it is sirius who is the shy one.

The biggest downside to this story is that it is not complete, even though it is listed as complete! It is a trick. I sincerely hope that soupy_george decides to update this because I LOVE this fic and I would love to see how it turns out - even though if it follows canon, it probably won't have the happiest ending... :/

A non magic AU fic that I actually loved (usually I hate these!) is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109/chapters/3501239][Text Talk]] - linkao3(1651109). This fic is a non-magic modern MWPP AU where Remus isn't at hogwarts. He is homeschooled and has a chronic illness (it starts a little "a fault in our stars" like). I LOVED this fic. It gave me butterflies about 1000 times and I was just rooting for Sirius and Remus so much I couldn't put this down. Second, other than some funny HP references, this fic is barely fanfic. It could stand alone just by changing the names of the characters. I wasn't bothered by that because it was just that good, but it should be known that this is so so far from canon that it's just a whole different thing. Third, it is super dialogue heavy (through the plot device of the texts) which is what made this fic so addicting- I was seriously grinning while reading some of the parts. I loved this fic and would recommend it to anyone.

And a few honorable mention "get together fics" are [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/304166/chapters/486338][A Lie Gets Halfway Around the School Before the Truth Has a Chance to Get Its Pants On]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/529032/chapters/937186][Our Blood, Still Young]], and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/319467][The Problem with Eggnog, Uncommon Thoughts, and Sharing a Bed with Sirius Black]]

  Seeing Sirius Black through Harry's eyes is bound to result in a blind spot or two. Actually, three: Sirius was gay, had feelings for Remus, and had an oddly convoluted---albeit strong---relationship with James. A kaleidoscope of over 70 moments in Sirius' life should set the record straight (pun intended). *A pseudo-sequel to Turning Time*

** linkao3(Of Leaves and Stars) is an on-going texting fic, but magic AU rather than muggle! Probably my favourite of the genre.

linkffn(The Promise by ZairaAlbereo) and its sequel dance on the edge of being Wolfstar (and the author has written other Wolfstar things) but never actually crosses the line. That said, it's got most of the emotional/domestic elements of the relationship and can absolutely be read that way. Often overlooked; the author is not a native English speaker and it shows a bit early on but gets much better! Unfortunately the second story isn't quite finished, but the cliffhanger is at least mostly resolved.

linkao3(The Lines We Cross by REwrites) is an AU with Remus as a professor and Sirius as a student. All of REwrites' stuff is amazing!

linkffn(Another Prisoner, Another Professor) is a PoA rewrite. Possibly discontinued, but 125k and totally worth it.

[[http://rosie-writes.livejournal.com/1468.html][Bring Me a Boat by Rosie_Writes]] breaks me every time I read it, which is regularly. Author's summary, because I don't have words for this fic: This is an alternative universe fic, exploring what might have happened in 1981 if Remus had never stopped trusting Sirius. I rec it to everyone I know, often more than once.

As far as authors whose whole collections are worth reading, copperbadge, picascribit, pommedeplume (potatoalchemist), and angryspaceravenclaw top my list. Those are AO3 usernames. Angryspaceravenclaw also has a number of works listed as Orphan Account; [[http://angry-space-ravenclaw.tumblr.com/post/146184951229/lady-elena-fic-masterpost][here is the masterlist of those]], and a version with summaries, pairings, lengths, and ratings is being worked on by myself and a few others.

Happy reading, and if you have any more specific requests, hit me up!

** Chicken - linkffn(10493432) - The marauders play truth or dare and it leads to some cute fluff.

Kisses - linkffn(1873704) - Remus and Sirius talk under the clouds. I love the flow of this author's writing.

Between Dreams and Reality - linkffn(6787968) - Sirius' dreams are a bit more than dreams. This one really held my attention because of the mystery of what was going on and what would happen next. Well written and makes you question what's real and what's not.

The Sickness Unto Death - linkffn(10350781) - University AU. I liked the Muggle spin on canon.

Blast from the Past - linkffn(2617515) - Sirus travels back in time and shows up in front of Remus. Set during PoA.

The London Underground Book of Love - linkffn(10862395) - Muggle AU. A short fluffy piece that makes me smile every time I read it.

The Wizard and the Blue Box - linkffn(11294538) - Dr. Who crossover. Sirius' flirty banter is hilarious.

  The cardinal rule of the London Underground is to never, ever make eye contact. It is a rule that, among many others, Sirius tends to follow despite his otherwise rebellious, non-rule-following nature. So the first time he makes eye contact with a human being in the subway comes as much of a shock to him as anyone else. Especially when he's unable to look away. RL/SB

They weren't calling Wolfstar trash. WE are the Wolfstar trash, because we love Wolfstar.

#+begin_quote
  It's December of 1976. The Ministry is more concerned about cracking down on werewolves than it is about disappearing Muggleborns, Remus is a lousy prefect but a decent friend, and James has declared that all Christmas gifts must be "creative" this year. Includes strongly worded letters to the editors, Muggle protest tactics, Quidditch games, and a very temperamental Sirius. Happy Christmas!One part a day will be posted from December 1st to December 25th.
