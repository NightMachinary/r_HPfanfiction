I get that people give up their time to write said interesting stories for free, but I get really disappointed, and annoyed when i'm say half a dozen chapters into a story that's got me hooked, is labeled as complete, and then I check the chapter index(I don't usually, but certain stories seem suspiciously short, and i'm willing to take a possible spoiler risk to check), and see rewrite, or authors note. Whay can't they put it in the summary, or just go back, and put it in the AN.

Again, I understand that I shouldn't really be complaining about such a small thing, but i've recently gotten into three stories that I just loved, but then found out about half way through(suspisious feeling) that it was not completed when it said as such, but was instead going through a rewrite. I just feel it would be the polite thing to do to inform your audience that the story is not actually complete, and is going through a rewrite. If I ever post any of my stories up on Fanfiction.net, I would be 100% upfront about the stories status from the beginning, because I know that not doing as such would just be a sucky move from me.

So what are your opinions/thoughts on the matter.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** I DUCKING HATE WHEN AUTHORS REWRITE FICS! I have yet to see a rewritten story that's actually complete.

Even worse, a lot of new stories have a nice start, reach less than chapter 10, the author decides to rewrite it 'cause people liked it but ends up abandoning the story with even less chapters than the original >:C

*** There was this one author who wrote some fics I liked the idea of. But he/she had a habit of writing some chapters, then /deleting the entire fic/ and (sometimes) start over. He/she even did this with the rare fic that they did complete. It was really annoying to deal with.

** For those of us who are unaware, could you mention which fics in particular do this?

While I don't remember running into this issue, I know I wouldn't appreciate getting to the end of reading something that isn't complete /if it is labeled as complete./ At least if I haven't seen it updated in five years I can assume its been abandoned.

** I´m an author of a Fic myself which I´m now struggling to stop right in the middle. I told my readers why and that I would make a cut at the end of a certain story arc which creates an ending but also the possibilty for a continuation.\\
I get told to keep on writing, but I´m at a point where I´m unsatisfied with my writing, and I announced that if I keep going I´m about to rewrite some parts and shorten a good amount of the story to fix some logical mistakes and to keep my story simpler (it´s very complicated with a lot of confusing plot-lines which are just revelead step by step etc).

I understand that readers get annoyed and disappointed to find a story they´ve been reading and following for several months get abandoned, and I agree that an author should at least point that out in the summary.\\
But, you know, sometimes they´re forgetting there might be problems in real life, and that the authors just don´t have the time to care for a project, which, as you said, is for free and they don´t get anything in return for the time spent with writing and plotting.

In general, though, I agree with you.

*** My issue (and op's also) is when it is marked complete when it is not. A story should only be marked complete when it is... /complete/.

Story in the middle of a rewrite? not complete. Life is hard, so you abandon it with an epilogue to wrap things up? Not complete. Flames get you down, so you wrap up the story before it isn't even started? Not complete. Continued in a sequel that hasn't been updated since 2009? Not complete.

We understand why a story could be abandoned, but marking am incomplete story as complete is problematic on multiple levels. (And I do count stories that don't have a good ending and are just continued in a currently being written sequel as incomplete.)

You expect a resolution for a complete story, while you can give a pass to an incomplete one. It's all about expectations. If I get to the end of a incomplete story knowing that it is incomplete, then I get a bit sad but I am ready for it. If I get to the end and there is NO end? It feels absolutely HORRIBLE. I feel betrayed, I feel unfulfilled, and I feel disappointed. If I knew it was incomplete beforehand I would have been prepared, but I wasn't.

Never mark a story complete if it isn't.

*** Yeah, I completely understand that, and wholly agree with you. The only thing I dislike are stories either getting rewritten, or are in progress, but labeled as complete, and not giving a heads-up to the reader in the summary, or in the authors note at the beginning of the first chapter.

I'd be fine with even just an update to the summary saying to read the last chapter first if they dedicated a chapter to explaining it being rewritten, or whatever else. Like I said, it's the polite thing to do. I know plenty of people who have even abandoned whole authore, because of this happening. So not doing it hurts both the writter, and the reader. So I don't even understand why not to do it. Sorry for venting at you.
