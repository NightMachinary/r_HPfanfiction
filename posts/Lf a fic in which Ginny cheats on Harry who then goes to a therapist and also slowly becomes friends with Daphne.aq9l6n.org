** So now that the fic's been found, can someone please tell me in what universe ithat Ginny would /ever/ want to have sex with McLaggen?

This is exactly the type of fic that I was talking about in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/an9gqp/any_advice_for_a_first_time_writer/efskmht/][this post.]]

Just, /why/? Why do authors feel that the only way Harry can fall in love with someone else is if he is betrayed by half of, if not everyone he'd ever known?

It just makes the ship feel like two pieces of a puzzle jammed into each other to /force/ them to fit.

I mean, fine. This fic wasn't too badly handled as far as Ginny is concerned. She's out of Harry's sight and all this is Harry's introspection. We don't even hear her full side of the story at first.

That's then all thrown out the window, as Harry then goes on to think about how Molly, Ron, and Dumbledore all betrayed him and he's actually been super mad at them for it.

What a farce.

Sorry. I know this was a fic that you were looking for and really wanted to reread or whatever, but I had to let this out.

In the fanon universe where Ginny is gold-digging slag rather than the canon universe where she's the only character in the series who truly understands Harry's struggles, on account of literally having lived with Voldemort in her head for a year.

Because it's easy, and it provides drama. A lot of people don't know how to write a romantic relationship that kind of just withers away, or where two people naturally fall out of love with each other. It takes a skilled writer to make that kind of character dynamic work, because both characters have to be at fault, but you also have to sympathise with both as well.

Conversely, turning either Ginny or Ron (because this happens a lot in Hermione-centric fics where she breaks up with Ron as well) into a cheater is easy, because you don't have to write nuance anymore: Ginny is now coded as the villain, Harry is now the wronged party that the new love interest can put back together, and you already can predict one of the plot strands leading to Ginny getting her comeuppance. In fanfiction, where most of the audience aren't looking for deep, subtly written characters, this kind of binary conflict "sells well," so to speak, because you can shut your brain off and hate a character that the author tells you to hate.

Also, so many people have been influenced by fanon backlash to Ginny and the entire Weasley family, that some people /genuinely/ think that portraying Ginny as a shallow tart taking advantage of Harry's fame and money is a canon-compliant portrayal of her.
