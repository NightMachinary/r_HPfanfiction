** I feel like any recommendation for next gen stories isn't complete without mentioning NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series. It's 7 stories that follows Albus Severus as he grows and matures in his world of magic and the various dark plots that threaten to overwhelm the Wizarding World. It's not Scorose unfortunately--in fact relationships I feel take a backseat, so be warned--but it's incredibly well-written with a very detailed and even complex plot that cumulates in an awesome climax at the end of the series. Definitely worth the read.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!
