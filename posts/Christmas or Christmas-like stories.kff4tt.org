Doesn't have to be set in Christmas, just that feeling of helping each other, being with each other, etc. Maybe healing type of stories, or anything similar.

Anyone can be the MC/Any site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes etc

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune/no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.

Self promotion is fine as long as it fits.

  Knitting Christmas jumpers is a Molly Weasley tradition, and not one either of them intend to give up.

** Okay so a bit of self-promotion, but I love the holidays so I have 4 works from this month to link. Pick your fancy!

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27946247][Unlocking Christmas Joy]] - Harmony Christmas one shot, which I think might best fit your healing vibes request. *Summary*: Hermione is just a friend and a roommate? Right? Right?! Spend Christmas Eve with Harry and Hermione at 12 Grimmauld Place several years after Hogwarts and a few weeks after a comment by Ron deeply confuses Harry.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27481705/chapters/67194439][Chestnuts Roasting Over The Open Firewhiskey]]- this is my Christmas multi-chaptered WIP that will be completed by Christmas Day. *Summary*: Theo Nott is worried about his best friend and takes a desperate measure to save him from taking the mark. Will Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger survive Christmas at Hogwarts while dealing with the consequences of his friend's decision? It's a HBP, canon divergent, dramione Christmas story!
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28118769][Escaping Fred Weasley's Magical Mistletoe]] - Fremione Christmas one shot. *Summary*: What will Hermione do when she falls victim to one of Fred and George's newest holiday inventions? Post-Hogwarts Christmas fluff and Fred Weasley is alive!
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27827920/chapters/68128204][Finding Hermione after the Yule Ball]]- this one is less overtly Christmas, but it is set at Yule. *Summary*: Ever wonder how different characters would act if they found Hermione Granger crying alone after the Yule Ball? Inspired by a tiktok about how HP characters would react walking in on you changing and the fact that so many Hermione fics start the night of the Yule Ball. These are all romantic pairings and the chapter is named for the other half of the pair. Just a bit of holiday "what if" fun. Hope you enjoy!
