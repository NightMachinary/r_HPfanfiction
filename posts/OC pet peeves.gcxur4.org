i'm currently writing an OC and trying to avoid annoy cliches and things that will piss off a reader. Anything I should avoid? Anything you hate in an OC? Any advice writing and OC?


** What makes me wary of OCs is the expectation that they won't have any real flaws, or that their flaws will be made out to be endearing (oh, look at me, I'm so adorably clumsy and awkward), justified because of trauma (I don't trust people and I like to do everything myself because I was abandoned as a child), or have no real impact or consequences (I have a tendency to think I'm always right, but the one time that tendency bit me in the butt turned out to be no big deal because [insert resolution]). We all want our characters to be likable, but if they never screw up or display negative qualities, they're just insufferable. That's one piece of advice I'd give- don't be afraid to let your character screw up and face the consequences.

Another more minor issue that annoys me is when an author spends a lot of time describing the OCs appearance and backstory. With canon characters, it's easier to avoid, because the readers already know this information. Even so, don't give me a whole soliloquy about OC's long flowing hair and glowing silver +orbs+ eyes. And I don't think anyone wants an entire chapter detailing the characters history before anything interesting actually happens. Important aspects of the character are best revealed naturally, through snippets of conversation, actions that character takes, and other events that allow for a brief explanation or description.

That's all I can think of for now. Good luck!

**** Not necessarily. Plenty of ordinary names even among the pureblood elites. They're still English, after all.

That said, obviously it's your character, so if a weird name suits them better in your eyes, that's still totally valid. Just thinking in terms of what people can get turned off by.

****** You can either latinise normal names like Charlus, Billius and Filius or old-fashioned and not really popular names like Horace, Amos and Gideon. I'm also quite sure Rowling invented the names Fleamont and Elphias, so you can always do that.

******** I personally 'Frenchised' an English name for my French OC main character so that it's still a familiar name for my audience while still having this French aesthetic in written words. I also had bad experiences with people named in the French variant and the connotation that came to me with this name was the opposite of my OC.

** What's the point of an OC if nothing changes. I've read quite a few stories where the OC is basically just a spectator. They're there and interact with the charachters, but when it comes down to it never have any impact on the plot.

** special looks: blue hair, white eyes, face tattoo, weird birthmark not important for story, scars not important for story.

weird name that doesn't fit muggle or wizarding world.

overpowered, too many skills, all knowing, no mistakes ever made Mary Sue.

no double of canon characters. a dreamer is already Luna, smart is Hermione, the joker are the twins, the clumsy one is Neville etc.

backstory at the beginning. we don't care. make us care first, then drop the backstory at us.

visual description of the character over three sentences. also, we don't have to get their personality description. at all. just put them in the story and we will know them then.

I personally hate tragic backstories in OC's. why can't they have normal parents for once, not being raised by snow foxes.

and please, let's not go full millennial and go all wix antisex multigendered character with "their" and "them" pronounces. they can be gay, but ugh, if I see another "them" I'm going to jump off the bridge.

tbh, I would just say, keep the weirdness to the minimum. this no anime.

To be fair, the examples you listed are archetypes and it's tough to avoid them, and Rowling has already used most of the archetypes. The one I'd avoid completely is the Mentor, since Dumbledore is almost entirely an archetype but made out to be unique in the books. There's so much more to these characters than 'Neville is clumsy'. That's the point of this thread and in my opinion, why people hate Mary Sues.

If OP wants to make the character a dreamer, then they can because Luna isn't the only person who dreams. It adds so much more substance to the character. The jock has already been used for Cormac McLaggen, Ginny and James Potter (and even Harry, to an extent) and yet they're three completely different people. I guess what OP must truly avoid is a used archetype + the same background. For example, this OC needn't be a fiery jock and a seventh sibling to a redheaded family, etc.

Otherwise, I agree with you completely. If I see one more character with eyes that change colour based on their mood...

** There are a lot of ways you can write an OC in HPFF and there are also very different types of OCs.

If you're planning on writing an OC into the original trio, think very hard about how you're going to subtly change the characters in the trio. It's hard to find a niche for an OC in that particular set of characters without changing something.

If you're planning on /substituting/ an OC into the original trio, think very hard about how you can give them a /unique/ presence (read: not a bro like Ron, not a genius like Hermione, at least for book 1). For example, if the OC is replacing Ron, Harry probably has less of a connection to Dumbledore and the Order. If they are replacing Hermione, Harry probably doesn't even stand a chance of getting past Fluffy at the end of Book 1. Or maybe he does, if there's a valid reason the new OC helps him do it.

If you're writing an OC in a completely AU setting, make sure that their character is totally and utterly distinct from Harry Potter, or James, or any of the protagonists of HP. Inverarity is an author who does this exceptionally well, almost to a fault.

If you're writing an OC into Hogwarts during the Second War but not interacting with the original trio, play around with what's possible. All sorts of different people go to Hogwarts and the frame from which Rowling approached it is only one avenue from which you can tackle the story. Slide's fics are exceptional examples of how to do this well. Her characters read nothing like Rowling, yet her stories are totally canon compliant.

** You have to decide if this is a HP story with an OC or if it's an OC story in a HP setting. If it's well written people are happy to read both. For me the most important part is that the OC serves the story and not the other way round. The way that most OC's are written disrupts the natural flow of the story and ruins the experience. When you find the right balance an OC can be a great addition to your story.
