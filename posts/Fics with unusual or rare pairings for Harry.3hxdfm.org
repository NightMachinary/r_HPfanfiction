This one is Harry/Alicia Spinnet. I remember it being pretty good. It was never completed, but still a nice read.

  Astoria Greengrass wants to set up Harry Potter with her sister, Daphne. But her plans don't really go the way she wants them to. Not your usual Harry/Daphne/Astoria fic. Rated for some language and sexual content.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.

  Harry believed he was alone. He wasn't. A gathering of great minds was all he needed, and whether this was Dumbledore's wish or not, it was what had to be done in order to gain sure footing before the coming war. HarryAngelina Romance. Mature content.
