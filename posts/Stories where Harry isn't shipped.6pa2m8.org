*** I was sure Harry was shipped with Luna in Poison Pen, even if there wasn't much emphasis on it. I must mix it with some other fic. I'll have to reread it.

***** Yes. I was mixing it with Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7377441/1/How-Xenophilius-Lovegood-Saved-Britain]]). I think I read both of those fics around the same time, and both are about letters.
