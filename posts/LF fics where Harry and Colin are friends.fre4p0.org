Because I think that'd be nice to see in a fic. I would prefer fics where they are both prominent characters, but if its only going to focus on one, I'd prefer the focus on Colin. Will also accept fics where they have a close professional relationship.

Thanks in advance!


** Would you look at that? I am currently writing a fic where those two will be best friends actually. The first chapter should be up in a day or two. I could send you a link, if you don't mind the fact that the story is new XD

***** No, not romantic. It will be purely platonic. My story actually is gen, and I don't see it changing so far. I probably won't write any tbh. Not between the main characters anyway.

***** Sorry, for the late reply but I haven't been on reddit much lately. For various reasons, I am not in a good place right now and the will to write has left me. I also have higher priorities at the moment which are taking most of my free time. I will continue the story as soon as the aforementioned priorities come to an end though.

****** It's a canon divergence centred around the question on what would have happened if Harry was a year younger. That's all I'm going to say about it for now. You have to wait until the chapter is out to find out more. XD

#+begin_quote
  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...

****** No problem

The fic is amazing by the way

As is linkffn(the elemental's power) though I can't remember if they are friends, but it is probably the best or the second best written fanfic that I have ever read, competing with linkffn(severus snape and the art of war by cypresswand)
