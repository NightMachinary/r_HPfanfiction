I've been thinking about writing something like this, but am not sure how to hash out the logistics of the world before I go on to the plot. Would people here mind helping me?

1. Would there be interest in a fic set in this world?

2. In a school for disabled magic people, what setup would be plausible? Grouping by disability? Accomodations?

3. Any other suggestions?


** You need a plot before you can decided anything else. For example, what are you classing as the impairments these disabled wizards have, cognitive? physical? magical? remember they are wizards a lot of the impairments we would consider debilitating may mean nothing to some. Moreover, how are these wizards going to be treated? I cant imagine it would be at all well considering both the time period and the wizard treatment of those they consider lesser.

For accommodation I'd look at the old English institutions and then magic them up somehow. I thought 'plausible' question was pretty funny , these are wizards anything is possible.

*** Better to develop the characters and the setting together, or even the characters first. You want characters who have personalities that are interesting to rub together, that create drama just from them interacting.

*** As to plot, I was thinking something similar to the regular HP books.

I was probably going to go with physical disabilities only; treatment: often marginalized, similar to modern-day treatment.

**** That's a very large spectrum, and I would be wary of physical impairments as we've seen that wizards can enchant prosthetic and even recreate bones and limbs, they even cured the common cold.

In that sort of vein, I've always sort of seen wizards as largely above the physical plane of us muggles due to magic. For example, there is greater (human) race and gender equality because if you have access to magic the precursor to the original cause of inequality (strength and power) is removed, particularly if you stick to cannon magic principals.

What I would find interesting and I think would be more of an issue for the wizarding world is magical forms of impairment, and the effects neurological diversity on magic e.g. how high-functioning autistic wizards use/learn magic, dyslexic magic or even magical dyspraxia. You've also got things like magic addiction, ocd spell casting etc.

I have a bit of experience in fields of disability being dyslexic, a disability studies academic and working in special schools, so if you would like a co-writer if you like? I could help you explore some of the issues that being magical impaired might have. You'd have to stand my spelling and grammar of course ;)

***** Quite interesting, yeah. That's definitely something to explore. But I always felt like in-the-womb disabilities couldn't be combatted with magic, such as cerebral palsy. I don't know, it'll have to be fleshed out.

Sure, I'd love a co-writer. And I'm a nitpicker over spelling and grammar but worse with plot brainstorming, so it might work out. PM me your email?

***** They already did "magic addiction" in Buffy the Vampire Slayer when Willow kept going to this dark magic crack house or whatever and turned evil because she liked feeling the power. That whole story arc was pretty lame IMO because it did not develop her character, did not even explore the ethical or moral implications of having a good character turn evil. It was just a special-effects laden picture of addiction that ended up being too derivative of real life.

****** Aww, I liked that story line it help me realize what was going on with my brother at the time. It was probably where that suggestion came from, although looking back it wasn't explore as deeply as it could have been but then if magic is apart of you and your in a situation where you have to use it. In that vein, addiction wise it would be more akin to 'food addiction' than drugs.

******* The thing is, I see magic as a means of achieving an end. Being addicted to magic in and of itself is just meaningless to me, you could replace it with any other addictive substance and have basically the same story. If Willow had gotten addicted to actually DOING something with her black magic, that would have been different. For example, if she used it to hurt people, or commit crimes, then it would be a truly dark story instead of just one with a bunch of special effects.

I believe the farthest she ever went to get another high was to bring Dawn with her into the house where she got high. It was not extremely clear what was at stake.

******** Yeah, addiction story lines always seem a bit forced. I put this down to the person being the junky playing the role how /they/ think a junky would act, instead of what junkies actually are like in real life.

Add magic to that and your gonna end up with a whole lot of meh. I assume in the case of Willow they were trying to make (dark) magic feel really good to use, plus the power trip, and that this was the addictive element of magic. It that way Willow sort of #/slipped/ into addiction, which was why it never got too heavy. Full on heroin junkie Willow would have been interesting but waaay to tragic for one of/the fav'd characters of the show.

**** Ok, well, if you want to write about a marginalized character, you have the central conflict right there, and also the beginnings of a plot.

Here are places where you can introduce conflict (and thus develop the plot):

- Main character has difficulty getting accepted to Hogwarts because of discrimination, and almost doesn't get in. Maybe include a scene where a school official talks down to her because he doesn't think a student with her disability "would be able to keep up" with Hogwarts classes.

- Main character has trouble making friends. Maybe she is blind and the other students look right through her because they don't know how to interact with a blind person.

- Main character might have issues with the floating staircases in light of the fact that he/she uses a wheelchair.

- If you're going off of the regular student experience in the HP books, you may as well add more depth and intrigue to a preexisting villain. For example, maybe in your fanfic, it turns out that Salazar Slytherin had a disability, but was good at hiding it to protect his reputation and his image (sort of like FDR). And then your disabled protagonist learns more about him and realizes that she has more insight into that villain's motivation and thought process than most people, because they share that disability.

** The idea of a "school for disabled witches and wizards" raises a lot of questions. In the real world, or muggle world, you do have schools for the blind, communities of the deaf, and special-needs classrooms - all examples of times when students with disabilities are separated from other students. But that separation in and of itself (separation between "normal" students and "disabled" students all lumped together) is kind of problematic, because many people who are blind or have a physical disability or something like dyslexia would actually be better off integrated into mainstream society, where they could progress at a faster pace, and get more preparation for the real world, than in a special needs class that might have to go very slowly to accommodate those with mental disabilities.

So in light of what I said above, I would actually prefer reading a story set at Hogwarts that features some disabled protagonists (with some supplementary assistants, guide animals, and extra classes) than I would a story set in a completely segregated school.

Other brainstorming ideas:

- we are assuming that magic cannot cure these disabilities, otherwise they would not be disabled. And we already know magic can completely heal broken bones. If magic can cure anything else, that eliminates disabilities in that area.

- A paraplegic or quadriplegic wizard might be interested in out-of-body experiences, where the consciousness can be cast out during sleep to spy on people and things

- People with disabilities might be able to do certain things that would be more difficult for students without disabilities. One thing I have heard blind people say is that when your sense of vision decreases, your other senses increase over time. So a blind person usually has enhanced senses of smell and hearing (possibly even using echolocation) and enhanced sensitivity in the fingertips if they use Braille. You could run with that idea by creating a magic specialization that is easier for people with enhanced hearing or touch. Some kind of magic that is cast through music, perhaps. Or you could say that in an Ancient Runes class, blind people are at an advantage to become expert in the field because they are not distracted by what the runes look like, and can be more in tune with the magical properties of each one.

*** The increasing other senses thing is a myth, what actually happens is that without visual distractions you come to rely on your other sense more and become more skilled. I know that's probably what you meant, but some people genuinely believe that their sense become enhanced at the point of losing another sense. Saying that, this is magic and we know that sensing magic would be pretty useful, although it would difficult to utilize.

*** As to magic curing disabilities, I was thinking, for an example, of a Muggleborn student before age eleven in a car accident, who hadn't had access to magic techniques at that time and thus healed partially the Muggle way.

Awesome idea, thanks.

Sensing magic directly is also really cool. Thanks.
