  She almost smiles, and true alarm starts to build in his chest. “I'm afraid I'm not here for something so small. Professor Roberts has resigned.”“Good,” Draco says honestly, “Would you like a list of suitable alternatives? I know a number of competent potions masters abroad, but then of course you'd have to hire another teacher to act as the Slytherin head. I'm afraid you've dried up all the half decent Slytherin Potions masters.”“Not all of them,” she says quietly.He blinks. She can't be serious. “You can't be serious.”“Gravely,” she says, “Mr. Malfoy, I am not above begging.”What the bloody fuck. “I don't even like potions!”~Draco returns to Hogwarts. He has a duty to his blood and his name and his house, and he will fulfill it.

Blaise is forced by his mother to play the perfect Pureblood, otherwise she threatens to kill his muggle father. He secretly keeps his friendship with Harry and Hermione.

Oh, and Draco has a more evil brother, which causes him to be good.

There's plenty of other excellent plot before they start at hogwarts.
