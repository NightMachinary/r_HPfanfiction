:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fanfic a while back but cant remember the name. Basically harry gets sent to a alternate universe where he takes over the body Voldemort but is still the boy who lived


** Wait I need clarification:

is this where Harry is possessing Tom riddle and Tom is aware that another entity is with him so he creates horcruxes in hopes to split Harry off him?

Or is it there is no Tom riddle just Harry?

Or where Tom is Harry and Grindelward is the V's equivalent?

Or a Harry is in V's body but people realize he's not V so he must be V's kid then there's a baby Alt!Harry.
