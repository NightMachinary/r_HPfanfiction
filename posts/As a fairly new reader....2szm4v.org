So I've only recently got into fan fiction (think six sort of months) and I use this sub reddit to find new fics to read. I so often see someone mention a fic, and sooo many people shall reply like 'I totally agree', or 'I've read that. I thought it was terrible too.'

Basically, what I'm trying I say is, what are some classics that you'd recommend? Some golden oldies that every fic reader needs to know, because I'd love to be in the loop!

Give me your favourites please!


** Here's what I'd list as classic stories /(classic ≠ the best)/:

I'd also like to add that, in my opinion, you don't “need” to read a story just because it's considered a classic. Try them out and drop'em if you find them to be silly/unfitting your interests.

**** The majority of "classics" are terrible compared to the stuff that's followed regularly these days. It's kind of funny, as people grew up and HP got older, obviously the FF writers grew up and became better writers as well. You can see the overall quality of what people normally care to call the "best" HP fanfics rise dramatically over just 15 years or so.

The "classics" from the early 2000s are almost universally bad compared to stuff today. Look at Barb's "Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent". For the time, it was legendary, and I'd definitely call it a classic. It's not bad, not really. Is it really /good/ though? Not really.

** A few more classics that OutOfNiceUsernames didn't mention.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] - COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]] - *takes around 10 chapters to get good* - DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]] - Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] - Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]] - Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again]] - So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** I'm a fan of Nonjon's Brown coat, green eyes. A HP/ firefly crossover that's well written entertaining and complete. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5554780/1/Poison-Pen]] Poison pen by Genkaifan is another excellent story.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]] If you like long stories check out Miranda flairgolds Second chance at life. Extremely detailed story and there are two sequel's although the entire arc isn't completed yet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7591040/1/The-Queen-who-fell-to-Earth]] Bobmin356 has many excellent stories especially the Queen who fell to earth which is completed with sequel's.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/]] When a lioness fight's by kayley silverstorm is one of my all time favorites its Hermione centered and can be extremely dark in places, the epilogue is brilliant.

Hope these help there are so many awesome stories out there it's hard to keep track of them all. I just added the links, still figuring out how to add them via my phone.

** There are two 'classic' series that haven't been mentioned here:

The Sacrifices series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]] - I'm not actually a fan of this series, I find it to be far too long and far far too angsty, but it is one of the most popular series in all of HP fanfiction and I think it merits mention for completions sake.

The Alexandra Quick series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]]- I'm mostly mentioning this because I consider it to be the best written story in all of fanfiction. It features original characters, Magical America and a plot that is more complex and darker than the original series. There are no characters from the books in this series, and Harry himself is never even mentioned, but Inverarity's writing is more similar to Rowling's than anything that I have ever encountered.

** You can always sort by number of reviews or favorites on fanfiction.net--that gives a good overview of the most popular stories. Sorting by reviews favors longer stories, since readers can leave one review per chapter, while sorting by favorites provides a more even distribution of length, since readers can leave only one favorite per story.

They may not be classics in the sense of being "old fics" but we will certainly look back on them as such when they're all finished and done.

** Don't feel pressure to read the classics. First of all, some of them were good for their time, but aren't really going to seem that amazing now. The Shoebox Project is an example of this, in my opinion. Sort by favorites on FF.net, and read the ones that look vaguely intriguing. I find favorites a better way to sort through than reviews, because it won't be as biased in favor of longer stories.This isn't English class, you don't have to read fics just because they're classics.

In my opinion, little0bird, A Black Comedy, Stages of Hope, and Oh God Not Again! are all classics that have stood the test of time. There are others that have done reasonably well (Delenda Est comes to mind) and others like Poison Pen that were great at the time but haven't aged well.

And keep in mind that there are some great fics being written at this very moment. Against the Moon comes to mind. Don't worry too much about the classics.

** If you are interested in hermione/snape fics, you should definitely read roman holiday and its sequels, jewel of the Nile and last tango in Paris. I'd consider them classics of the ship. Here's the author's page- [[http://www.witchfics.org/anna/]]

One of the problems with universally popular classics- that I've found to be true, at least- is that they are universally popular. When you get into different niche areas of fandom, that's where the hidden gems are. Not saying that I don't enjoy the fics listed- it's just that often some of the most poignant, well written or enjoyable fics I've found are in ships or genres I wouldn't normally read. Unfortunately I am terribly unorganized, so I don't really have that many I can list off the top of my head.

If you're looking for some of the big compiled lists, I'd also go look at tv tropes page of hp recs, painless j's list of hp recs (mostly slash, some het), and also see if you can dig up any good old livejournal fic competition pages if there's a specific ship you're looking for. Knowitalls can also be good, but after awhile I've found its kind of hit or miss.
