Like the title says, I'm looking for fics with Dumbledore as an antagonist or even the main antagonist, but I don't want him to be stupid like you see in bashing fics. Dumbledore is supposed to be a genius, and I'd like to see a fic where he actually is this grandmaster chess player using people as his pieces against Voldemort or whoever.

What I don't want is 11-17 year old Harry/MC out-witting him at every turn.

No romance is preferable, but definitely no slash.

It doesn't matter who the main character is.


** Seems like most 'manipulative Dumbledore' fics try to make sense of his motives by having him be some mixture of malevolent, incompetent, and/or senile. If he's less incompetent then he's more malevolent, and vice versa.

Here are a few fics where Dumbledore's power games are more subtle, outwitting his enemies or slipping under their notice.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** linkffn(Imprisioned Realm) Has imo, one of the, if not the, best actual GG Dumbledore, besides canon. By that i mean, a Dumbledore that is smart, powerful but knows he isn't powerful enough to end the war by himself, so he manipulates and guides everyone and does everything he can to do his bidding in the hopes of wining the war. Where no sacrifice is too much for the greater good (aka world, not "his" gg).

Not to mention this is a fantastic read in and of itself, with great world development and heart wrenching and agonizing character development for both Harry's (Mirror Dimension and Canon).

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war?

**** Its ok, you'll eventually start to understand and relate to Mirror Harry. I thought he was an asshole at the start too. Just know that there's reasons for him to be the way he is, and that, although he's kinda crazy, he's also a victim from several things that weren't in his control, both because of Dumbledore and Voldemort.

***** I'm pretty sure it's more about how much effort it takes to say than how much effort it takes to type.

'Dumbledore' has 10 letters. 'Dumbles' has 7 letters. This is a 30% reduction of effort.

'Dumbledore' has 3 syllables in a cretic (stressed-unstressed-stressed) pattern, which at least to me feels kind of unnatural to pronounce. 'Dumbles' has 2 syllables in a trochaic (stressed-unstressed) pattern, which feels much easier to pronounce*. Syllable count alone gives you a 33.3̅% reduction in effort, and I'd be willing to bet that the syllable pattern deducts even more.
