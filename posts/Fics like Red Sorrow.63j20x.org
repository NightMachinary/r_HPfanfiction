Red Sorrow is an amazing fic, and I'm wondering if there are any like it. Fics where Snape has a daughter with Lily.


** Why would harry have to go to privet drive if he has a sister carrying his mother's blood? The protection would work with her anywhere they're both at.

***** They were still both marked; I'm not sure how yet since she's only at Prisoner of Azkaban, but I also think it goes along with they don't know either, so Dumbledore is unsure of how the blood wards would work in regards to one another. They still needed somewhere to GO, seeing as they're still children.
