-He's secretly three Acromantula in a Trench Coat.

I'm very tipsy at the moment, but the idea of bizarre impersonations is amusing me considerably. For some reason, my brain has seized on the idea of a time-travelling Trio landing in the past and accidentally killing Hagrid (or him dying to save them, more likely) and then having to take his identity - both to prevent investigations into his death and to keep their cover as totally-not-illegal-time-travellers.


** You're dangerously close to my idea of a bad Hagrid fic. Something, something, magic comes from the patterns on creatures and plants' souls. Wizard souls have a blank pattern, but wand wood & core allow them to cast spells and through repetition, this carves patterns on their souls, eventually allowing wandless magic.

Hagrid is obsessed with creatures, not because he's a softhearted giant, but because he is obsessed with splicing their souls onto his and gaining their innate magic.

Don't really know where to go with it, or what the plot would be, but I do really want evil!Hagrid.

**** He knew that acquiring the Basilisk's deadly gaze was a key step in Hagrid's plans to breed and control an army of Acromantula. Without that hanging over them, the spiders were able to escape and live freely.

** Well that's just total nonsense.

He's obviously 6 giant squirrels with a coat and a wig.

***** Since you're an Arachnid Friend, are you /sure/ you aren't just protecting the identity of a fellow Acromantula?
