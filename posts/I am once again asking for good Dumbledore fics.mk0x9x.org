I'm so so tired of horrible manipulative adults in Harry Potter, especially Dumbledore. I'd like some Fics where Dumbledore is a nice old man genuinely trying his best.


** Well, I wrote a short one-shot about this a while back actually...

Basically evil!dumbledore summons a hero and gets... good dumbledore. IDK. YMMV.

** linkffn(10639968) is a kinda WBWL, and is probably my favorite fic of the genre. Voldemort died, and Harry was neglected. Dumbledore, whose only involvement in the raising of the children was to warn them about Death Eaters coming for Jacob, is horrified by the situation. One shot with two sequels on the author's page (I really wish FFN has a series function like AO3).

** They aren't Dumbledore centric, but both linkao3(Victoria Potter by Taure) and linkao3(Aim & Ignite by shostakobitch) have an extremely well characterized Dumbledore. His aura, sense of humor, ability to control the conversation and belief in the power of love, his empathy, etc, everything's there. They're both Girl!Harry, but extremely well done.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord.

Also, the Ministry is still opposed to Voldemort as well, they would certainly take action against him if he decided to attack Hogwarts.

******** The problem was that if Dumbledore openly turned against the Ministry and used those - quite effective - tactics who would the Ministry turn to? Voldemort, of course. It was always a balance act for him to keep the Ministry pointed at Voldemort, doubly so after the Muggleborn Resistance attempted to kill Voldemort and caused a lot of collateral damage. The problem in the early parts was that the great majority of purebloods didn't really care about "a few restrictions placed on muggleborns" as long as it kept Voldemort from starting a second war.

** This is, admittedly, a still in progress fic wherein Dumbledore's a minor character (I think he's only in three of the six chapters so far) but the author goes out of their way to establish that Dumbledore really is just a kind man doing his best but with too much on his plate in pretty much all of his appearances thus far.

Don't know if that's what you were looking for or if you wanted more Dumbledore centric works, but it's what sprung to mind when I read your request.

** This is basically a Fem Harry with Tom story. Only thing is she had a Twin and Lily Potter lives. They overlook her that night as she was under some rubbles and fireman later found her and put her in an orphanage. Kinda a WGWL with Albus as a good mentor later on.

Very good read with great world building.

** There's this one fic, it's not focused on Harry nor Dumbledore (focused on O.C. who is a demigod (Pjo x marauders era Xover) but ol' Dumbles is a nice dude. (It isn't finished either but I like the so-far story-line/plot)

** linkffn(9818387) This one has pretty cracky, but good portrayal of Dumbledore. It matches the rest of the story perfectly.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this
