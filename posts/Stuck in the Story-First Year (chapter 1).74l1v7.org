** What is this supposed to be? Is this a "self-promotion" of a story of yours and your stuck on an issue and want help? Also, if this is posted on another site, a link would've been better instead of posting an entire chapter here.

** Of all the methods of sharing, you chose the format of a .txt file?

I'm sorry, but this is simply unreadable in this form. Reformat, repost and then add a statement of what you want us to do with that in the first place. Do you want feedback? Do you have problems with something specific? Is it just self-promo?
