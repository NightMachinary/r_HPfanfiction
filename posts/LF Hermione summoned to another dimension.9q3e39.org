I read Harry summoned to another dimension but... well, I read them all and I want more! Maybe something like: Hermione doesn't exist in another dimension or dimension Hermione died living behind love of her life and suddenly they get Hermione from Harry Potter universe? I don't know. I never read about Hermione in another dimension. Only Harry or Harry and friends or Harry and Sirius or Harry and Teddy... There was so much and in the same time not enough for me.. :)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]], linkffn(6092362), has a Hermione being pushed into an involuntary dimensional travel. Harry eventually found the clue and began actively seeking her out. The rule of dimensional travel in this fic is that if the traveler's counterpart is alive in a dimension, the traveler can't affect this dimension in any way except talking to ghosts; on the other hand, if the traveler's counterpart is dead or does not exist, he or she will take physical form.

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8127][Shadow Walker]] is the sequel to "Shadow Walks". It features another Hermione, whom Harry from "Shadow Walks" met during his travel, trying to find a new home.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327): Hermione from another dimension is seeking help from canon dimension 4 years after the War. The Trio and Ginny once more entered the breach and kicked some serious asses. Canon Hermione is one jealous prick.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville were all catapulted into a new dimension during their raid on Lestrange vault. With the exception of Luna, they were either dead or did not exist in this new dimension.

Otherwise, Hermione dimensional travels are extremely rare, and her being summoned does not exist according to my knowledge.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]] Hermione gets summoned to a dimension that's almost an inverse of the canon one. She replaced her counterpart and must keep up an elaborate deception so that no one finds out. At first she just wants to return to her home dimension as soon as possible, but she can't help but get pulled into the drama once she sees how terribly this world treats the innocents. linkffn(4025300)

A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM

** If you don't mind crossovers, linkffn(The Winter Witch) has Hermione somehow wind up in the Game of Thrones universe in the middle of I want to say season 2? Maybe 3. Anyway, she proceeds to upset the balance and cause the GoT plot to go off the rails.

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom and finished with a battle outside her tent. The deciding line between staying and helping Robb Stark, or returning to her universe, is getting harder to see the longer she's in Westeros. But it's a decision that she has to make, or it's one that will be made for her. Part 1 complete; Part 2 is now ongoing!

** Ms Figg wrote one where Hermione ends up in a Star Trek-style mirror universe where Dumbledore is evil and Tom Riddle is the beloved Headmaster of Hogwarts. I think Snape was either a Gryffindor or a Hufflepuff, and I think mirror!Hermione was a Slytherin.

I don't really remember a lot of the details, iirc it was mostly an excuse for lots of smut and people were having sex for extra credit.
