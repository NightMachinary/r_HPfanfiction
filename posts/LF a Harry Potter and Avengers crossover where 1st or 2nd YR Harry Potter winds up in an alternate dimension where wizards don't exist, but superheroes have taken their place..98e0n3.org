There are /a lot/ of crossovers between this fandom, but it feels like most of them follow the same path:

A.) MoD Harry shows up and wrecks everyone\\
B.) Jaded, Retired Harry shows up and wrecks everyone\\
C.) An Avenger adopts Harry and somehow the whole wizarding world is okay with that\\
D.) Harry or Hermione show up and have a romance with either Loki or one of the Avengers but otherwise don't have any meaningful impact on the Avengers plots.

I've read a story called "Ink Stains"which has a 2nd YR Harry Potter sealed inside Riddle's diary before being tossed into a different world, where he is found by Bruce Banner. That probably is my favorite Avengers/ HP Crossover.

I'm kind of interested in seeing how a 12-year-old Harry would adapt to the Avengers' world, especially when there's no restriction on his magic (although he may be limited to 1st and 2nd YR magic).


** Don't forget the ones where Harry is actually the son of an Avenger, like Thor in my fav Crossover linkffn(Child of the Storm)

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

** Story looks abandoned and Harry is 14 other than that I think this fits, though I found nothing of any consequence in it, at least as it is currently linkffn(11146299)

  When Harry faces the newly reborn Voldemort in the graveyard, something goes wrong the instant their spells connect and both of them are transported to another world where witches and wizards don't exist. It's a world filled with advanced technology and sciences; a world where super heroes had been created through science, technology, accidents, and human evolution.
