** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7670511/1/The-Unlikely-Pair][The Unlikely Pair]] It's more friendship than romance, but in the sequel there should be more of the latter. I didn't finish it, but I liked it very much.

  One day in the library, Hermione and Percy strike up a comfortable friendship. As they grow closer, their secrets grow deeper. How far will this unlikely pair go to keep the other's confidences? Only time will tell. Hermione/Percy Friendship to start. Canon to start, but will deviate. COMPLETE. Sequel now in progress: An Inch To The Left.

  Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot.
