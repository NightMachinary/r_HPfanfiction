After the fight between the Marauders and Snape near the lake, James Potter comes to his senses and realizes that Lily Evans never will love him. So he moves on.

A few years later, Harry Charles Potter, the only child of James Potter and his wife, Marlene Potter n√©e McKinnon, is born.

On Halloween of 1981, Lord Voldemort attacks Potters' home and is banished by a rebounded killing curse caused by a sacrificial ritual James and Marlene had set up. And whilst the two adult Potters die and fuel the ritual, their son, Harry survives with a scar and no piece of soul inside it.

Dumbledore, seeing that Harry's expended family from both sides were slaughtered by Voldemort, and knowing that Harry would need to be trained to be able to survive (seeing that there's not a stupid shortcut like Harry self-sacrificing himself to defeat Voldemort), has no choice but to raise Harry on his own as his apprentice.

Harry lives with his guardian and master in Hogwarts, learning from his master and other Professors and making many friends in different houses.

He never joins Hogwarts as a student and only lives there with his master. Because of that, he doesn't have biases and can freely associate with different people from different houses. Using his master's training about how to influence people (a topic some could unkindly call manipulation), he slowly bridges the gap between Slytherin and other houses and turns the Slytherins away from their destructive beliefs.

Note: I changed Harry's mother firstly to get rid of Dursleys and make Harry a pureblood (just because); Secondly, to change how he survives; And finally just to change things a bit. I have seen some fics in which Harry is someone else's bastard spawn (Honestly, the thought of Snape reproducing gives me shivers) but I've never seen a fic in which Harry's father is James but his mother is someone else.


** Oh, I love this idea. Somehow, I can see how this diverges into very interesting things.
