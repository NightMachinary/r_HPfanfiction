I've seen plenty of Harry/Hermione and Harry/Ginny soul bonds. Never seen a Ron/Hermione. Would be interesting to see. Preferably also Harry/Ginny and Harry has no soul bond.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
