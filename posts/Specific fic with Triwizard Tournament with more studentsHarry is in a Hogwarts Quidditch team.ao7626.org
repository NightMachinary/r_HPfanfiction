Asking for a friend :)

Exact words were:

"hey, wondering if someone might be able to identify a fic i read once upon a time... it was a fourth year fic, which revamped the triwizard tournament to include a lot more students... the main thing i remember was that Harry was part of the Hogwarts Quidditch Team (i think he may possibly have also been an individual triwizard champion but i'm not sure?). But it had lots of depth and detail around the camraderie built by the team during the course of the year, i think it may have left him looking into playing quidditch professionally? Had some really great depth and world-building structure when it came to making the triwizard (trischool?) tournament something that might actually occur and i remember it really fondly, but haven't been able to relocate... probably read it on ff.net. If anyone thinks they might know the fic i'd LOVE to hear it!"


** linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) had a revamped tournament including Quidditch if I recall correctly.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** Does it involve broom racing too? I think I might be getting fics mixed up but it does sound familiar. Any pairing?

** Maybe its this one. I am not sure if there are more people in the tournament itself, but harry is in a quidditch team and he looks to play professionally.

  AU Fourth Year: Harry has been entered into the GOF. With his best friends and quidditch team by his side, can he handle the tournament, a nefarious plot to kill him (again), and a blossoming relationship with the Beauxbatons champion? Follow Harry as he fights for the cup, and for his life. All rights go to J.K. Rowling. Everything in bold is from original story.
