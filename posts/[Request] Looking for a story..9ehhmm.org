Looking for a story I read many years ago. The basis was Harry and Hermione had a child somewhere around 5th year, her parents were taking care of the child while they finished school. They got married secretly while in school.

I remember it starting in the Gryffindor common room shortly after the final battle. I believe Harry was pacing and Hermione was sitting in a chair talking to him or something along those lines. The Weasley's were completely in the dark.

I also remember a scene of them walking towards the burrow a few months later with Hermione pregnant and her little sister with them.

Any help finding this is very much appreciated!


** Starting is different but pretty much same premise.
