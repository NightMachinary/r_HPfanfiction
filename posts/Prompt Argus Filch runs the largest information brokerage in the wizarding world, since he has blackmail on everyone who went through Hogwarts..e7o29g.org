Bonus points if he recruits Neville, who everyone thinks is nearly a squib, as his apprentice/successor.


** Professor Longbottom had learned one thing above all others during the second wizarding war. Information was power, without it you were powerless. So taking the Herbology Professorship had been an easy call. Getting to know every single member of the future wizarding world was a great start.

Pulling a Quirrel he made himself slightly goofy, a bit of a duffer though an expert in his field. Someone anyone could comfortably lend an ear to. Someone exactly like the former professor of Herbology in fact. There was a scary thought, spymaster Sprout.

Only one thing had been bothering him. It was to easy, entirely to easy in fact to set up his network. It was as if he was picking up the pieces she had left behind and linking into someone else's network as well.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Broker watched from the shadows as he always did. He had been slightly surprise by how quickly the Longbottom boy had started his little work. He had so very Hufflepuff about it but still, there was signs already showing. The boy had already dug into the Brokers network more than Pomona ever had.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Neville was sure now that Spymaster Sprout head of House Hufflepuff was not simply a joke. He had found the records, the notes passed on to the right people to help head off any dangerous people ever turning out another Riddle.

Still he had made serious developments into the other network. This one paid the galleons he used to fund the other quiet well. He just had to find the identity of the Broker so he could move forward.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Broker stood there leaning against the entrance hall. Ignored by all who passed he sneered lightly in joy as they had no clue as to his true identity.

"Professor Longbottom sir, if you have a minute I need to speak with you."

It was finally time, he was ready to retire and Longbottom had proven himself these last three years well enough.

Neville nodded friendly enough and followed along portraying the friendly nature all saw him as.

Entering the empty classroom his wand snapped to the ready as he felt magic wash over the room, only to be meet with a glowing wand tip inches from his face.

Neville had no choice but to laugh hard and loud as it all made sense to him now.

"So Filthy Filch is not a squib. In fact he's the single most dangerous wizard alive, afterall knowledge is power, Broker."

"Knew I picked the right one to take over for me. Come by my office tonight, I'll hand over all my parchment you'll need. After the leaving feast tomorrow I'm retiring finally."

** "Ah, you're here. My portrait is... a mess."

Argus Filch got out his restoration kit. Honestly getting a doctorate in art restoration was the smartest thing he'd ever done. You wouldn't think it would be a good specialty for a spy, but walls were ears in the magical world. "Eh, that's what I'm here for," he said. "Bad news with Black though."

Perhaps he could get something worthwhile. He usually could when he spoke to the portraits--and there were a lot in Hogwarts, many of which had frames in other institutions like St. Mungo's or the Ministry.

The Fat Lady draped herself dramatically over the divan of the painting next door, shoving its occupant Viola all the way out of the frame. "Oh it's terrible, terrible I say. Let me tell you. He said the strangest thing though--about Harry, the dear boy."

Filch grinned. The Lady, for all that she was a professional door-guard, was a terrible gossip. "The one he's trying to kill?" he asked.

"Indeed." said the Lady. "Now, some of this is speculation, but when he was coming up the hall he was muttering about two names--Potter and Pettigrew-"

She went on to explain some interesting tidbits of information, and Filch could already feel the galleons flowing in.

** May this is inappropriate since it's just a prompt, but why? Why would Filch have blackmail on everyone who went through Hogwarts? Why would anybody care about a detention you served with Filch when you were 14?

*** Why would anybody care about tweets celebrities made 10 years ago? People love to be outraged. Maybe he has some dirt on the heir of a prominent blood purity family making out with a muggleborn after hours. Maybe he's caught an Auror practicing dark magic. He probably manages to catches a lot more students when they don't have access to invisibility cloaks. Not to mention the amount of casual eavesdropping he might manage.

**** No, muggles in the social media age do those things. The wizarding world in the 90's cannot be compared one to one with the muggle world in the late 10's. Especially when you consider Filch is the most looked down upon class, a squib, in their society. His word means nothing to the people in power, and even less so when the media is basically controlled by the people he'd be blackmailing so the general public would never even have the chance to get outraged.

***** He wouldn't exactly approach and threaten them in person. Information brokers don't do that. He'd send letters and use third parties.
