i've been reading way too many fics where “whoops this happened let me pull some plot armor out of my ass” happens. i'd like to see something at least semi-realistic, at least where consequences are concerned. oh and please only put ones with good writing i don't want to have to reread the same sentence over and over again because of awful grammar.

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.
