:END:
To save you the trouble of googling it; the short story 'Evidence' is about a man, Stephen Byerley, who got in a severe car accident a while ago and is now running for mayor of his city.

His political opponent, Francis Quinn, runs a smear campaign against Stephen by claiming that the 'real' Stephen died in the car accident and the Stephen running for office is in fact a robot, which would disqualify Stephen (since robots aren't allowed political office) if it were true.

However, rather than prove one way or the other whether he's a human or a robot, Stephen uses various tricks and methods to prevent himself from being proven to be man or machine, letting the question of what he is blow up into the global eye; eventually, once enough eyes are on him, he punches a heckler (at the latter's request), smashing the First Law and 'proving' himself human, sinking Quinn's campaign...except it's never proven if the heckler himself was a robot either.

--------------

I'd like to make a very specific request for a fic using similar plot points to Evidence, but set in the Harry Potter world, and featuring a potential werewolf. He might alter his physical traits, eat rare meat as part of his diet, order ingredients for Wolfsbane, have a cage in his basement and disappear every full moon...but never actually prove whether or not he's a werewolf. Bonus points if he's a registered wolf animagus.

...I'm not sure it could be translated into Harry Potter, mind, given that nobody in the Ministry of Magic is democratically elected...hmm...

Why would you think that? Canon barely gives any information how members are selected. But if you consider how much the Ministers are attempting to have the public be in a good mood you can expect at least some amount of democracy

*** Fair enough, I suppose. It's just that all the fanfic I see tends to have the Wizengamot be inherited positions and the whole civil service hires rather than elected.
