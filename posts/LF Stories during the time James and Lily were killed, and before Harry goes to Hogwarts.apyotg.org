I'm looking for the in-between stuff; stories set after James and Lily were killed, and before Harry was sent to Hogwarts. What did the Wizarding World do during that time? Doesn't have to be Harry centered; would rather prefer that, actually. (As much as I love Harry, and love reading stories about him).

Any stories that focus on the after affect of the first war. Can center around Severus Snape, Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, Arabella Figg, Amelia Bones, the Weasley's, or just about anyone that you can think of.

No Weasley Bashing, No Dumbledore bashing.

Would rather the story be completed, but if not; as long as it's well written or long enough, that's fine.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

Time travel fic. 8 year old Harry makes a wish and starts off events a decade earlier, during the later part of Vold War One.

The changed events continue until the day after Harry's wish.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

** This one is set during this time. Not completed, but is quite long and gets updates quite frequently:

** And this one... not exactly during that time, it's more set during the time before, and then jumps ahead, but it's REALLY freaking good. :)
