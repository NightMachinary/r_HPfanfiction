Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash, Asexual/Bisexual/Threesomes, etc. Doesn't have to focus on pairings.

Would rather not have Bashing of characters. Now, bringing up good points from canon is one thing, but Dumbledore taking Harry's money or Dumbledore blocking Harry's power, etc would be considered bashing. Similar to the Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune would be considered bashing.

But bringing up plot points about canon Dumbledore or canon Weasley's is fine.


** It's possibly the 400th time The Second String has been recced but yeah, I'm doing it.

They capture Harry really well. He grows and matures, he makes mistakes, he's brave and scared and confused. They nail all of him and it's just perfect. Every character is so unique and wonderful, Pel and Ab especially. Wonderful adventure story. linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down)

Also, anything by TheDivineComedian. They really have nailed what Fear is. They truly understand the Black family, Remus's conflicts, the grief and anger that comes with fear. Everything they write is fantastic. linkao3(Calibration by TheDivineComedian)

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)
