[mild spoilers for Into the Spiderverse] “[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Into_the_Spider-Verse][Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse]]” features many different Spider-Mans (Spider-Men? Spider-Beings?) in alternate universes. In some universes, it's Peter Parker. In another, it's Peter Parker's friend Gwen Stacey, or Spider-Ham, or an anime girl version, etc etc... but they all have the same powers, and have a loss that drove them towards their hero's journey. Then they all meet.

I would love to see this concept applied to Harry Potter. Who are the chosen ones in other universes? How did they come to be the chosen one? What do those universes look like?


** Waiting for someone to take the prompt more literally and have 'Hammy Potter, the boar who lived' involved.

  All his life, Harry Potter had heard voices inside his head. He never expected to learn that the voices were his own. Five different Harry Potters, from five different worlds, must work together to survive life, school, and the second war.

***** Yeah, that's true. When I read it I was sure it was an untagged crossover to something. Guess it was just nicely done.

Mainly just putting the bot link

** Nonjon wrote a fanfic with this promise: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366][Dimension Hopping for Beginners]]

The usual nonjon disclaimer applies: nonjon is a solid author who tells interesting stories with solid themes, characterization and plot, but it all hinges on the reader liking his humor.

If you find him funny, you'll probably love his stories - but if you don't, you won't like em, and that's fine.

** Joe Briggsby. Orphan from the orphanage that was adopted before Riddle got revenge. Born on 7/31. Wouldn't do what Riddle told him to do. Thrice. Ends up running him over with the garbage truck while working by accident when Riddle apparates in front of him in an alley. The power he knows not: Garbage Collection happens on tuesdays. Oh yeah, actual power... HORSE POWER! 350 of them.

** Oooh, Hermione is an obvious one, "new to power, from outside our world, proves magic is its own authority", basically first in her family, non-Wizarding Britain, needs no permission to have magic other than actually having magic.

Cedric, "champion, house of the humble".

Not sure what to do with Neville....

Ron could work, or Ginny, trying to prove themselves?

The twins would could be hilarious, tag-teaming and pranks.

(edit, modified the HG's prophecy to be a bit more cryptic)
