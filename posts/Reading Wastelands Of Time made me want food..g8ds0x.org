** Yes... that was a parable on how Harry's very existence and loop through time had become nothing more than dangerous, unsustainable consumption. Or something.

Did I use the word parable right?

*** Google says "a simple story used to illustrate a moral or spiritual lesson, as told by Jesus in the Gospels." So kinda, I think?

Really enjoyed Wastelands and Heartlands, you've really got a sense on how to write action. The ending was cool, but I was kinda sad that Harry didn't get to do a proper right ol' 'fuck you' to Saturnia, the fae, and all the other 'antagonists', but I understand that that'd be a happy ending and Harry might not deserve that! Still an amazing fic! Thanks!

*** Thank you for the wonderful stories Joe! Reading Sword of the Hero on Schnoogle is one of my favorite memories of high school.

** George Martin is the best for this. Lots of food porn to supplement the violence porn and porn porn.
