I just finished chapter 153. They've just graduated, and joined the war efforts. I really don't want the entire story from here on out to be depressing war stuff with brief intervals of flirting and stuff, so I'm asking. I do have to assume it's not, though, because it wouldn't get so popular if it were all stressy depressey. None of the flairs fit this post, so idk what to do, I'm just gonna pick the one that fits best


** It follows book canon (although not Pottermore canon) and book canon is pretty sad. I definitely enjoyed the story. Grant becomes an important and interesting original character. There's also an interesting take on werewolves.

I came back to edit my comment to say that sad isn't the same as depressing. It can be cheering to consider that no matter what problems you have, Remus's problems are always worse.

** I'd recommend contacting the author and letting them know and asking if they could tell you which direction it's going to be heading towards.

Most people whom I've interacted with, while they won't give outright answers, are often kind enough to speak to you and let you know what you need to know so as to avoid an unpleasant experience.

** It does get pretty depressing. However, there is a great addition about Grant at the end that cheered my up post reading the entire fic.

*** Ok, thanks. I'm probably just going to skim for the rest of it, maybe read only the happy parts if that's true
