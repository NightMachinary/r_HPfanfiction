Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived is a very worthwhile read despite it's incompletion.

Deprived is, despite some cliches, okay since it's a old/er/ fic.

Guilty pleasure is Knowledge is Power by Defenstratable. Harry is literally good at everything.

Sacrificial Second Chance had a entertaining idea, and then it turned into a shitstorm. /cough/ ^{incest incoming} /cough./

Uhhh. Anything else that's Tolerable to Good?


** if you can get past the numerous spelling mistakes and grammar errors, i think /Too Young To Die/ had a lot of potential. Honestly, i think with a good edit it could become one of the better fics using this particular trope, because of its original plot. This Harry doesn't give a shit about Voldemort and Dumbledore. His only goal is to resurrect his dead sister.

  I actually liked the ending. I feel like it was the only possible conclusion that didn't diminish the overall story line. after all, Harry wasn't the good guy by the end and i don't think his sister could have accepted him.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.

** How would a "good WBWL" be an oxymoron ?

Anyways, one that I enjoy a lot is linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) from the Sarcasm and Slytherin series. It has the same feel as HP and POS but diverges quickly around year 2 or so (its on year 5).

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** If you haven't read it yet I REALLY recommend Antithesis. In my opinion it is one of the only genuinely good WBWL fics out there. The emotions feel real and are well written. The usual tropes are written in quite an refreshingly good way. This is the WBWL fic that all other WBWL fics want to be.

Being abandoned and abused doesn't turn somebody into a well adjusted badass.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
