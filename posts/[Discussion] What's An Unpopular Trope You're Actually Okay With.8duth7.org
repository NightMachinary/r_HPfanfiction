Title says it all.

For me, I'll mention the Inheritance Test. It has a bad reputation because it keeps showing up in bad Lord Potter fics, but in and on itself it seems like a very reasonable example of what that "wandless Goblin magic" we keep hearing about might be, and the fact that it's an expensive service only Gringotts performs, and then again only when they already suspect something needs to be found out, prevents it from being a story-breaking, OP bit of magic.

What are yours?

*** I get amused when people go off on rants about notice-me-nots. Like, you can get away with that without any magic. Attention blindness covers a lot of things.

If you are paying attention to something, really paying attention there can be a guy in a gorilla suit wandering around and you might see him but your brain won't register (actual study done).

Also there's the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BavarianFireDrill][Bavarian Fire Drill]]. Look busy, look like you should be there and mostly, people don't question you. Lots of people have conned lots of other people that way.

So why not a magic that does the same thing. Probably wouldn't work on someone like Moody, Snape or Dumbledore but for walking down a street relatively unnoticed, it makes sense.

I'm absolutely fine with it being something that nudges the attention away from you, makes you easier to overlook, but stops working if they're actively searching for you and doing it properly or if you pull attention to yourself via, for example, being loud. The spell working as a universal “now everyone automatically fails a spot check when looking for you no matter what” thing is so low-effort that it's just sad.

  “This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It's a famous place.”

  It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. *If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there.* The people hurrying by didn't glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.

** I'm actually okay with a lot of tropes that are not well liked. I think their infamy stems mostly from them being employed poorly and cheaply:

- Children acting like adults: It's fine. Better than reading a story about pulling pigtails. Other attempts around this like "everyone starts Hogwarts age 17" never make sense to me.

- Magical cores and their depletion: A sensible idea if you want Magic to be more tangible and rule-based. Rowling avoided such problems for the most part by using friendship, love and strength of character to resolve difficult situations, but her track record isn't entirely spotless. Brandon Sanderson has addressed this well in his [[https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sanderson's_Laws_of_Magic][Laws of Magic]]. Magical cores are only bad when they are used as an excuse to make Harry mega powerful.

- Soul Bonds: Actually quite intriguing. One of my favourite stories is about a Hermione/Bellatrix soul bond. As long as the bond is a premise and not a solution it can be an asset (as opposed to trashy romance novels that use accidental pregnancy as a solution; a bad use of soul bonds is similar in function in bad soul bond stories).

** *Soul bonds*: They could be interesting, but 99% of the time they're often ridiculous excuses for OP!Lord!Harry, used for instantly perfect romance (no fun) or in one case that I know of used to make characters hate each other for being bonded when they didn't want to be. They could be cool if they were just this rare occurrence which could lead to a blossoming romance, but the characters still had to work at it like an actual relationship. Like perhaps instead of giving telepathic conversation abilities, make them allow for empathic communication. They can feel what their bond-mates feelings are (unless they're using Occlumency) and so they have to work on their relationship until they can be verbally honest about what they're feeling as well.

*Runaway Harry & Metamorph!Harry*: I'm not sure if these are actually unpopular (I haven't actually bothered to read any stories with these tropes), but I give them a mention since they're the premises upon which I wrote my own fic, "Break the Limits". I think they have a lot of potential if used properly.

*Manipulative Dumbledore*: Now I've grown tired of Dumbledore bashing to some extent, at least when it proceeds to make Dumbledore outright evil. A Dumbledore who is much like canon, but has to actually own up to his mistakes rather than the nonsense we got in canon where he bears his heart and (seemingly) all is forgiven until DH is interesting. One where it's not clear whether he was in the wrong or in the right to dump Harry on the Dursleys. Grey!Dumbledore could fit this but I've rarely seen it done convincingly.

Dumbles has been shown in canon to, after Ariana dies, never aspire to seek out power. He was shown to honestly care about Harry's well being. Yet many a story have him treating Harry like a weapon, with Dumbles trying to achieve power over all (including actually trying to overthrown the Minister desperately, which makes no bloody sense since he turned down the role like three times).

Granted, I'm a Harmony dude and I've found a whole bunch of Harmony writers hate Dumbles with a passion. But damn, Dumbles has his faults and, as he said, they have dire consequences since he's a powerful wizard and highly respected. You don't need to make shit up, just use the ones he already has.

Whether he wanted it or not (pretty clear these positions weren't forced on him), he had power, even if he didn't seek all the power he could have had.

The manipulation would be his unilateral decision on how and where Harry would be raised. You can argue the merits and negatives of doing so, but it was manipulation either way. And I ship Harmony as well~

** My philosophy is that any trope can be made to work in the right hands. I'll indulge in Dumbledore-bashing, soul bonds, Super!Harry, and so forth if it's already well-rated because sometimes, you find gems like /Core Threads/ or /The Amplitude, Frequency, and Resistance of the Soul Bond/. As for specific tropes I actively like:

- Magical exhaustion--not magical /cores/, but the idea that magic is like a muscle that can be overexerted, because unlimited magical stamina breaks the story more.

- Muggle-wank. Even if muggle technology isn't an advantage or is even somewhat behind magic, the enormous population difference is going to tilt things heavily in the muggles' favor if it comes to it.

- The "standard" fanon characterization of minor characters like Daphne Greengrass. I've always liked how there's a sort of lore beyond the canon for things like this.

- Political kids. Eh, more of a guilty pleasure than anything else.

Indeed. In my head canon, I liken casting magic to other intensive physical+mental tasks like playing piano or competitive fencing. To borrow an analogy from [[/u/taure]] there's no finite "piano mana" one can conjure from one's musical core, yet playing complex pieces at a high level for a long period of time is exceedingly difficult. Though I'm admittedly not a concert pianist, I don't think I have ever practiced for more than two hours in a sitting, and when I do pass hour mark, my mind and my forearms are often exhausted and it's not my most effective playing.

I'd imagine magic would have a similar drain on the caster.

**** The problem with this analogy, canonically, is that (with the exception of a few notable spells) there's no evidence that magic involves any active effort at the time of casting, other than saying the incantation and making the wand movement... both of which wizards frequently dispense with anyway. All the effort is in the past: mastering the magic in the first place. Once mastered, magic appears no more taxing to cast than saying a word is. This is quite different from playing the piano, which still takes concentration.

Of course, in fanfiction writers are free to change this up.
