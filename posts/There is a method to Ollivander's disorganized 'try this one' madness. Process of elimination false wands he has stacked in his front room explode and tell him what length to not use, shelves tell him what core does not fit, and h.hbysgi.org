There are false wands mixed in with his merchandise which attract volatile magic - it's insurance for his real stock as well as a tool to narrow down what wand make-up would be best for his customers. Which ones explode, how they explode, and in what quantity they do so is as much a highlight experience for the young folk as it is informational for the wand maker. There is an indicator for wrong wood, wrong length, and wrong core.

'Tricky customers' he finds to be a fun logic puzzle.

*** It's canon in the film, where the wrong wands Harry gets handed cause boxes to fly off shelves and vases to disintegrate - I think it was added there because Harry getting his wand is important, and it's a bit boring to just watch him wave sticks around and being told "no, that's not it" a few times over.

In the books, you're absolutely correct and the wrong wands do nothing.

******* If you start going down the rabbit hole of applying logic and safety to wizards, you pretty quickly run into the issue that the core of the books is handing a wand capable of conjuring fire and breaking things to any and all 11-year-olds that show up, and then letting them wander around a giant castle full of moving staircases and fatal plants and other children with weapons (wands) with minimal supervision. Even a relatively poor student like Ron was able to kill (well, stun because it's a kids' book) a troll with one of the first charms he learned within 2 months. An angry first-year could blind someone with Lumos in their first few weeks on accident in an emotional tantrum, if logic applied. The level of concern they all show towards accidental death/injury hazards in their day-to-day lives can only be explained by a massive magical resilience to death/injury combined with incredible magical healing if you start applying logic to the whole thing.

******* I always read it as more of unsuited wands will act unpredictably. If you don't focus on anything (11 year olds just swishing the wand), it'll do whatever it feels like but is likely to not have drastic consequences as you aren't trying to bend the wand to your will. But someone who has intentions? Who is trying to do something specific? Nah, that wand will do whatever it feels like doing instead.

Like if you wanted to cast lumos, it might clean the dust off a table in front of you, or cause a plant to grow, or apparate you to London, with no way of controlling what it does at all.

Basically I just assume wands have a minor level sentience to them and if the wand doesn't fit, it's going to be more or less (depending in how close a match it is) of a toddler about having to listen to you

He had a interested career, close friends and now family with Andromeda and his godson Teddy. Unfortunately his Potter luck struck and Harry finds himself in another universe, with new powers and a more established Voldemort wrecking the world. As much as Harry would love to just go home, it turns out he can't until he defeats Voldemort again...so much for retirement from war.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort fired off another volley of curses and Harry dodged most of them. A few he rebounded at Voldemort, causing the wizard to dodge his own curses. Both men paused to catch their breaths.

  "Harry, you only think you know of Albus' manipulations. You've been duped, boy, and you don't even know the half of it. We have it in us to hurt each other greatly and you've been trained to be Dumbledore's obedient little prophecy weapon. You haven't been given all the facts."

  Harry glanced around the clearing making sure no help had arrived for Voldemort. "Oh? Enlighten me then," he replied with a feigned casualness. He had known a lot about Dumbledore's manipulations, but Voldemort was making it sound like there were still pieces he didn't know.

  Voldemort lowered his wand and used the international dueling sign to signal a lull in the fighting. Harry nodded and marginally pointed his wand away from Voldemort, acknowledging the lull.

  "I never killed your parents. I was surprised to find you home alone, unattended."

  "Liar! What about when our wands locked up at your rebirth?"

  "A sham. Dumbledore arranged for you to get the brother wand, a wand he had already prepared in case you and I fought. What we saw was a carefully crafted trick created by Dumbledore. I mean seriously Harry, 'a wand chooses the wizard'? How silly can you get? How can a stick with a feather or a heart string choose anything? You were tested against multiple blank wands until finally they gave you a wand with a magical core - the wand they had prepared for you."

**** Yep. Lots of fanfic sprouted from the films, which is where the "wands do fun stuff if they don't choose this particular wizard" came from.

In the books, not being chosen by a wand just means the wand does nothing for you. It might as well just be a stick - but that's not fun to watch so the film changed it.

It's one of the few changes that can be really cool worldbuilding if done well (see: Victoria Potter, where the worst that happens is the wand jumping out of Victoria's hand and I /think/ there was some explanation in the accompanying magic-theory document), so I don't exactly /mind/ it, but people should be aware that it's not a book thing.

** If we mix book-canon and film-canon a little (because the stuff-blowing-up reactions only happen in the film, but I like the idea so I want to use it), this is the headcanon I personally arrive at for how wand-matching works:

- Mismatching wood doesn't conduct the person's magic into the wand-core as it should. The result is usually that nothing happens as a connection to the wand-core is entirely prevented.
- If the wand core needs to be an entirely different species, the result is very destructive as the incompatible magics of the wand-core and the person react quite violently.
- If the core material is the right species but the wrong individual creature, the results are less destructive - but may be equally or more spectacular if it's a close match.
- A mismatching wand length makes the connection feel weak or uncomfortable - if it feels weak, the wand is too long and not enough magic reaches the core to connect fully. If it's uncomfortable (hot or painful) then the wand is too short and too much raw magic is going through the core, making the connection "short out".\\
- People who need exceptionally short wands might be unable to tell whether a wand is way too long, or made of an incompatible wood. Conversely, if your magic suits an exceptionally long wand, you might get a weak connection from a short wand that's made of the wrong wood.

This gives us an explanation for how the scene played out in the film:

The first wand we see Harry try is holly and phoenix feather - but it's not Fawkes' feather, it's a different phoenix's. That means the result isn't actually that destructive - but due to being "almost right" in practically every way, it's pretty spectacular to the point where it /looks/ destructive. This makes Ollivander go looking for a holly wand, similar length, but a wand-core from a different species.

The second wand Harry tries, shatters a vase. Since this result is obviously destructive but /less/ spectacular, the first wand was actually a better match - holly, different phoenix feather, roughly eleven inches. This clues Ollivander into something - he has a wand that's pretty much that, and poetically it's the brother wand to You-Know-Who's.

PS. I wouldn't be surprised if, given this headcanon, Ollivander specifically buys cheap knickknacks and non-working magical items to decorate his store with, in order to prevent any bad wand-core matches from blowing up anything expensive or important.

My assumption is the film skipped a bunch of "that did nothing" wands because it's kinda boring to watch nothing happen over and over again, and only showed the first wand where something actually happened (which would be after significant narrowing-down).

Incidentally, according to Pottermore's wand woods article, a beech wand is best suited to someone who is, if young, wise beyond their years, and if older, rich in understanding and experience. Harry was neither of those at the age of 11, though he'd probably have better luck after the war.

That is, if it was a given that for a sizable chunk of the wand-buying population, a wrong wand would blow up in their face, they'd definitely be making easier, quick versions of wands to help 'fit' the correct one.

An artist isn't always going to jump straight into a masterpiece - you're usually going to find multiple sketches and practice attempts first. This is the equivalent for wands - practice attempts for help identifying the correct wand type easier. Obviously he wouldn't call them wands, since they wouldn't be complete.

I don't think you can compare the two crafts one for one. An artist might keep a sketch book, or a planning notebook, but those are never for public consumption. A soap maker, a glass blower, a wood carver--these are all people whose art is also meant to be used. Craftspeople tend to make these sort of quick and dirty pieces to test out a concept, and see if it works.

Just as you're not going to make your first stroke of the pen on that good quality vellum, or using that $100/yard silk fabric, or that expensive crystal that you're using for that vase, Ollivander probably wasn't going to go spring for the perfect combinations right off the bat.

** I don't know about them being fake wands, but I could definitely get on board with his process being one of narrowing down the field - x combination not working means that y combination in also out, but that z combination may be more promising.

** So he's deliberately filling his showroom with volatile measuring equipment because testing wands is inherently unpredictable and volatile, and thus broken shelves are preferable to getting a splinter in some kids eye when his wand blows up?

It kind of turns his entire shop into his personal magical focus, one that he needs to do his job well. Highly specialized, very wizardly. I love it

** I like the idea that Ollivander is completely aware of each and every component he uses in wandmaking and their personalities and puts them together to achieve combinations that feel right to him. Everything in wandlore is symbolism and personification. What personality traits differ between a piece of willow from a tree by a still pond compared to one by a bubbling creek? An old oak versus a young one, a new branch versus an old one. A curious unicorn versus a suspicious one. A vicious dragon versus a reclusive one. Etc, etc.

The magic of wandlore is in being able to sense the traits, inclinations, talents, and personalities of each component. Finding which ones will work together, and then putting them together with a length and shape that they are happy with. Olivander already knows what type of person and what type of magic each of his wands is suited to, and making a match with a witch or wizard tells him a lot more about them than they think it does.

A witch, wizard, (or goblin or house elf or other oppressed species) that attempts to make a wand without understanding the magic behind finding pairings between wood and core that will work is far more likely to create "wands" that do nothing at all, or backfire, or explode catastrophically than they are to create anything useable.

** Given that wand woods at least are matched to particular personality traits, I presume that Ollivander gets at least a broad idea of the character of each of his customers. This leads me to wonder if he's got any "oh f*ck" wands in his shop that, if they match someone, it's a /really bad sign/.
