Looking for decent Marvel (avengers) crossover started in the last year. Someone from the avengers team or AoS raising Harry, saw an idea about Aunt May raising him (no Tony or Natasha as I've read all those already) Harry being a sibling of one of the avengers, Harry/Hermione joining the team. Just anything as long as it's good. Preferably 20k wording but would read anything under it if it's good. Would prefer Harry or Hermione being a MC

Thank you!

*** Warning for those who haven't read it, this is pretty much a wish fulfilling Gary Stu rainbow coming out of his arse type of story. Everything Harry does in the new universe is unbearably and sickeningly perfect. There's not an ounce of real tension or struggle surrounding the main characters, like at all. It's not really a spoiler as it doesn't give away any plot but better be safe than sorry and if you're into that then go for it, the writing is not bad and updates frequently as well.

  Harry wakes up in a strange jungle seemingly de-aged and without his wand. He has to figure out how to live in this whole new environment that he has seemingly warped to. And what the hell is a Wakanda? First few chapters will be about entry into the world and not much else. Obviously takes place in the Avengers universe. Will primarily use the MCU as a reference.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.
