I don't know why but I like these stories, I think it has to do with harry being either being really mature or just harry learning to be a dad while he is still in school, I would read ones that's post Hogwarts but there seems to be no spark when I read them. I would like your people's opinions on what stories might be a good read whether it's a crossover or not


** You might like linkffn(5621051). Harry having a baby to take care of at Hogwarts is what made me quit reading. XD

** Oh, Harry raising a kid, I like this trope a lot. Linkffn(3123443), The Little Child to Lead Him, was a decent fic about this and one that I enjoyed. For post-Hogwarts have you read linkffn(11111990), Grow Young with Me? This one was a very good Harry focusing on being a dad fic that I liked a whole lot and one that I found had a spark. Hmm, this one isn't quite Harry raising a kid completely, but its a story about Harry and a young child that I find stupidly endearing, linkffn(12265183) Picnic Panic. This one is an absolute favorite and super endearing, once it moves past the Ron bashing that happens in the first half of the first chapter.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
