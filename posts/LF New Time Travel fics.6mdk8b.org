I'm looking for new time travel fic that are Harry centric and not slash. If anyone knows of any that have been published in the past 3 to 6 months it would be appreciated.

Thanks


** linkffn(Wind Shear by Chilord) is one. Just been completed. Had a lot of potential but ended up average, sadly. The writing isn't terrible, just felt rushed and unfocused. Gave me ideas for a future story though, so that's my plus. :-)

*** Yeah I saw this one it was kinda disappointing especially since Harry/ Bella is a guilty pleasure of mine.

**** Yeah, Delenda Est made me love it! I can't see grown up Bella w/ Harry but the time travel makes it believable and, dare I say, cute.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
