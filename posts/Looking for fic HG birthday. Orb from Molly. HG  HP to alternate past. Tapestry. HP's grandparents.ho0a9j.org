:END:
I'm looking for a Harry Potter fanfic I probably read at AO3, for 6-12 months ago. Was then a WIP. I may be mixing together two stories... It's Hermiones (20th?) birthday and they're celebrating. From Molly (even though she and Ron is broken up) she gets an glass-orb that's supposed to show her her soulmate. It's a Weasley heirloom, that belonged to a great aunt or something. Hermione suspects Molly has spelled it to show her Ron. While later walking with Harry, the orb activates and starts pulling Hermione into a vortex. Harry tries to save her and is dragged with. In an alternate past - where Harry's grandparents are alive together with Sirius' parents/grandparents - a new name appears on the Potter's (and Black's) tapestry - Harry Potter. This cause lots of talk between the Potter and Black patriarchs. I think it's set while/before James and Sirius goes to Hogwarts. Harry and Hermione seeks sanctuary at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore checks the orb - finding Molly's spell, but also some unknown magic. Harry reunites with his family. Harry and Hermione pretends to be married. That is what I remember from as far as I got. Anybody recognize it and know the title/author?

  When Harry saves Hermione's life, they find themselves in a different world and in the middle of another magical war - but at least they have each other.
