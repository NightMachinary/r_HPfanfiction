This has always greatly frustrated me. I've always preferred to read completed stories, or at least know going in that it wasn't completed. I've read maybe a dozen or so HP fan fiction stories and more often than not, I go in thinking it's complete because it contains 300,000 words and hasn't been updated in 3 or 4 years; then get to the end and realize that the author is either still working on it, abandoned the story, or disappeared in some form or another.

I recently just finished Harry Potter and The Nightmares of Futures Past, which is what prompted this post. While I'd say it's my favorite fan fic I've read to date and definitely the most well written as far as I can judge but was very disappointed when I got 2/3 of the way through and started to realize that it wasn't going to wrap up in the time left. And when I got to the end, my suspicions were confirmed but I was still very disappointed. I'm not complaining about the authors or anything, obviously writing Harry Potter fan fics for free on the internet isn't always priority #1 in people's lives.

But do I just have to make a post here every time I start to read a new story to ask if it was been completed or has a sequel or not? Or hope I stumble across a list that someone wrote on some forum stating if a story was completed? Maybe I've missed it somewhere, but I haven't seen anything stating is a story is complete on fanfiction.net. hpfanficarchive.com does have something for sorting searches by how they are updated and completed, but their search function seems pretty good, but doesn't seem to have a comprehensive list of works to me. There are popular works I've searched for that I haven't been able to find there.


** Fanfiction stories have a Status field that the author can set to Complete when finished. It's done manually, so there may be finished stories that aren't marked.

You might also check the last chapter to see if there is any indication that the story is finished.

Let's try an example: linkffn(11333287) - second line under the summary includes Status: Complete.

*** I have seen that, but those are few and far between. I'd always just thought that it was the author changing the description at the top.

Also, I know I could check the last chapter, but that is dangerous territory for me. I'm pretty bad about accidentally reading something I'd rather not yet, and it's not always going to be painfully clear from reading the author notes.

**** It's a flag in the system, but the author has to set it. In some cases it's forgotten, but I'd think most would remember to set it as part of the celebration of finishing a story.

I think that's mostly because there are /a lot/ of incomplete fics on ff.net. OTOH, if that "complete" flag is there, you can be 100% sure it's complete. Except for the people writing trilogies. Or seven-book series.

**** As an add on, when filtering your search on FFn where is says /status: All/ you can change that to complete and it will remove all of the ones not marked complete. That way you don't have to scroll through all of the fics looking for the complete tag. You are missing out however on some of the better written fics, sure they aren't finished and that's frustrating but there are some gems.

Yeah, it wasn't always there so if the authors didn't come back after it got added their stories aren't going to have it. It's mostly an issue with older stuff.

That said, you could always check the author's profile as some do keep a list of which stories of theirs are completed there. And there is always checking the chapter titles as finding one called “epilogue” or “the end” is fairly telling.

** FF.net has a marker listing stories as 'Complete,' AO3 has the number of chapters be something similar to "20/20" if they're finished (whereas unfinished would usually be "20/??" or "20/30") and so on. Just pay a bit more attention to the stats and you'll be fine.

I don't deal with sites dedicated to HP fanfiction often, so I can't help you there /specifically,/ but my advice will still probably help anyway.

*** Never been to AO3, I mostly use ff.net when looking around. But I haven't seen that marker, though I have noticed there are some story descriptions that state if it's completed. I don't think it's exactly 100% especially for stories that were long running or very long in general. But that's useful to know.

I guess I'd really like to know if HP and The Temporal Beacon is completed, that was what I was planning to read next; but like I said, I have trouble finding out.

****** Well you could always embrace the madness and just read incomplete stories. Endings are overrated anyway.

FWIW, I don't think many people survive among fanfic readers reading only complete stories. You run out of those eventually and one day, you just cave. It gets easier after the first.

Temporal Beacon is totally great, totally worth a read, and incomplete status be damned, it's fine anyway.

*** I can't tell if it's bc I'm on mobile, but I don't see a 'complete' tag at the end of the summary metadata on the ffnet website. I remember 'Complete' used to be the last tag listed, after the character tags, on ffnet.

Just checked on the ffnet app, and Status:Complete is listed in the metadata in between 'Published: MM/DD/YYYY' and 'id:#######' on the app. So the info is available, it's just not being displayed to you. It might be a mobile browsing thing.

** You can even look at the reviews for the last chapter of the fic. If people are complaining and asking for more, you know it's incomplete. Likewise, if they're happy and gushing, the fic is complete.\\
Always check the summary as some authors will state if the fic is complete, abandoned, on hiatus etc.

** The "complete" tag was only added to FFN a few years back. Anyone who wrote before that tag was added, generally stories from pre-2010, needed to log back in and mark it complete. If they have stopped posting, the fic will be forever unmarked.

Your best bet, usually, is to look at the chapter index. If the last chap is titled some variation of "epilogue" you are generally good to go. Sometimes you can do a quick check of the last chap too, as said in the thread.

** Like everyone else has already said, there's a "Complete" tag.

But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's finished. I have read a couple that were marked as "Complete", and they just abruptly wrapped everything up in a chapter or two, leaving me with the impression that the author gave up.

The safest bet is to read the reviews, but they often contain spoilers.

** I stumbled upon a lot of new fanfictions on AO3 who are listed as completed after a few chapters in but aren't actually (plot is unfinished and author's note clearly talking about the next chapter). I use the "complete only" filter a lot and I guess the author list it as complete so more people like me will find it.

Though I understand why someone would use this trick, it annoys me and I usually stop reading it.
