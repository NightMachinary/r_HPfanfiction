** I deleted this ages ago so I'll just explain my first masterpiece. It was an OFC story starring Lucy Potter, James' much younger sister. She went to school in the same year as Charlie Weasley for age reference. She had blue highlites in her hair, came across her parents' dead bodies at the age of 5, was hidden in a closet the night James and Lily died (they were her guardians at the time), gets sent to a magical orphanage since she's not family to the Dursleys and no one else wants her, the Weasleys quasi adopt her after she befriends Charlie (but never mention to Harry BTW you have an aunt until she shows up with Charlie for the World Cup for dramatic suspense), she's bullied by the other orphan kids (who all end up in slytherin) and she's Charlies love interest. The real /brilliant/ moment was in the sequel when he admits his feeling to her... not by asking her on a date but asking her to marry him. She says yes. Yes the sequel. It was abandoned halfway. Oh and I oh so cleverly used the mirror tactic to describe her appearance in the second chapter (cause I was avoiding describing her in detail the first chapter cause I read writing tips that said not to do that) she was supposed to die tragically saving Harry at the end of GOF. But let's be honest, I probably would have resurrected her cause I was 14 and hated the idea of my OC not having a happy ending.

** I started writing because I was tired of all the dumb Ice Queen Daphne bullshit, so I said fuck it, I'll do it proper! So, I wrote it without using "Ice Queen" at all, but it still turned out to be a massive piece of shit. Portrait of Salazar Slytherin, secret library in the CoS, basilisk hide armor, nundu animagus, line of sight teleportation that you could use in Hogwarts... it's awful. All I ended up doing was ruining an already ruined pairing (and keep in mind, this was 2009 and things haven't gotten better since). But, somehow it's still my most popular fic, with 1.5 million views, so I decided I'd keep it up as a testament to where I started.

I can just picture you, a wide eyed, innocent FanFiction lover who wants to do their pairing justice, but just ends up strangling it in their enthusiasm.

** Oh, god I have a beauty. I started it in 2009 and am trying to rewrite it. Basically Harry is heavily abused by the Dursley's (over the top) including some pretty explicit sexual abuse. Snape picks him up, and seeing how he's treated becomes much nicer. Harry get sorted into Slytherin so of course he's best friends with Draco and hates Ron, though they become less hateful after CoS. Snape basically adopts him. They do an inheritance test with the Goblins and Harry is Heir of house Black and Potter and rich, he also has a couple manors.

I am currently trying to rewrite it because some of the stuff concerning the abuse is a good catharses for me, though I am trying to at least present some of the Lord Potter-Back stuff in a new way.

I had Sirius adopt Harry as a 'third' parent, and basically mix his Genetic info with Lily and Jame's. Also given that it was fannon that Jame's mother was Dorea Black, Harry then was more closely related to the Blacks and became the Heir by default.

Also Harry's magic combined with Lily's protection gave him special healing abilities because of the abuse, as a way to protect him.

** I wrote a couple of absolutely trashy Immortal!Harry fics in high school. Harry was reborn after every death- kinda like Wastelands of Time, but with a new universe after each death instead of a time jump- and proceeded to hang out/fuck things up/kinda just exist in a series of original and existing universes. It's been a fantasy of mine since I was probably nine or ten and I have some of an abandoned original novel written about the fantasy as well, and the seventeen thousands words up on my profile are an embarrassing tribute to that. They're littered with really obvious pop culture references, poor grammar, and shame.

The worst part is that they still get a handful of visits.

** I changed a summary to say: don't read this.. still not sure why I left it up, in fact most of my stuff is crap. that's part of why I try to be gentle when I review, cause damn if a sharpish smack down isn't painful.
