Just a thought, but what is a Basilisk's range of their deadly eyesight?

I don't think it's discussed in the Harry Potter mythos.

It just says if a Basilisk looks at you, you're dead. Basically. ,One shot instakill.

But is that automatic? Even at a distance?

I can see it being effective at a distance of maybe 10-20ft, if the Basilisk is a big mamma-jamma.

But what if you're in the wild, you see a basilisk down the road a ways away. It glances at you as it looks around, is that an instakill as well?

Can somebody please find this out?

**** Unfortunately for the sight-typical, we can apparently see a candle flame flicker at 2.76km and can see at a range of 5km (though that's only limited by the Horizon). Fortunately, Snakes are also quite limited in their visual acuity - though there's no research I know of on how amping up a snake to the size of the Chamber Basilisk would affect that. Bigger eyes = more light absorbed = better vision, generally, but I don't know how that would work in a snake specifically.

It's also pretty instinctive in a significant portion of the population to make eye contact when we feel ourselves being watched - literally, a neurologically-enabled and installed reflex perfected throughout our years of evolution - and we can often detect people watching us even if they're walking past and their faces are blurred from our perspective.

We also have no real idea on how the basilisk stare would affect blind people or those of sight-difficulties. If it's about how light reaches the eyes and not some degree of neurological/biological processing of light, then anyone could be petrified, but if it requires conscious acknowledgement that you've seen some eyes (ie. processing the light reflected off those eyes in your own brain) then it'd be significantly more limited.

** Good enough to almost instantly kill an entire attacking army.

I strongly suspect that Salazar did not intend the Basilisk to be used as assassination tool for muggleborns inside the castle, it's way too bulky and a group of small venomous snakes would be far more effective and could perform dozens of assassinations in a single night instead of a petrification a month or so.

Instead I think that if the horde of muggles is standing in front of the gates, getting rid of the muggleborns inside that may or may not betray the wizards is a low priority compared to using the death ray monster to quickly and effectively destroy the attacking mob.

There's no evidence that Slytherin hated muggles/muggleborns for having inferior blood apart from modern blood purists believing so. The legend suggests that he saw them as a legitimate threat (which a large number of attacking muggles might very well have been to young inexperienced wizards in the pre secrecy era) and took rather extreme countermeasures out of paranoia.
