No OP Harry, please. More powerful then in the books is fine, but nothing insane.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes

Anyone can be the main character, can be any site, any length, old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but doesn't have to be

NO Weasley Bashing. No Ron abusing Hermione, no Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche

No raping of the characters.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** Ok, so, you need to read the 1st one for full context. However. Weeb Adventures is one of the best "Harry goes on adventures" type fics.

Not to mention weeb is fun. In and of itself.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

  Harry's leisurely life as Britain's celebrated hero is upended when his best friend helps him realize he has lost sight of what's truly important. Armed with harebrained plans and driven by manly dreams, they set out for Central Europe in search of the legendary harpy queen. Sequel to Weeb.

** In my story "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", the trio are Curse-Breakers searching for Atlantis as they travel the globe - the Americas, the Caribbean, North Africa, Turkey.

In my story "Patron", Harry travels to France, Bulgaria and Jamaica. Other characters visit the Balkans, Turkey and Scandinavia.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  “I'd like to give an announcement,” she began, feeling like she was about to give a formal address. When all that got her was expectant silence and focus, she cleared her throat again. “It's been a year now, and the repairs are mostly done, things have calmed down, the trials are mostly over with and things are returning to normal,” she began. “Hermione, Kingsley, Percy and Arthur are all at the Ministry to make sure nothing disastrous happens and Neville is keeping the Auror Force on track.” She glanced at her friend, who blushed bright red at the praise. “Ron's joining him and, I figured I should go on an extended vacation.” Harry was silent a moment to let her family absorb the news. Deciding to go on a Migration was the best decision Harry had ever made.
