Sooooo. I'm in the mood for some BAMF Neville. I don't mind if he is the main character or just being a badass on the sidelines. Any pairings or no pairing at all, preferably complete fics. Please and thank you ☺️

  Neville Longbottom took in a deep, satisfying breath and looked down at his feet. His new shoes broke up the yellow warning lines at the edge of the platform, but he didn't move back. The pristine brogues made the mottled, old paint on the ground look worse and Neville wondered if he had ever looked better than any place he was before, but he still didn't move. He couldn't.

*** I would not say this is a BAMF Neville. This is a pretty good Neville centric fic, but with the exception of the ship felt like a straight canon rehash. I skimmed the first third, very bored, and then enjoyed the ship as it developed more in fourth year and beyond. However, he didn't really develop any major skills or exhibit any traits that I would characterize as BAMF. good canonish defiance of Voldemort at Hogwarts battle, but it literally says he does his big thing by sheer dumb luck. That kind of deus ex machina is exactly what dragged me down from canon. The protagonist squeaking their way through on luck is not BAMF.

**** I think we may have different definitions of BAMF. You do you I suppose, but I think it was really faithful to his character as the quiet man whose spine you can't bend. Even in his most fearful and helpless, he stood up to lead the charge. I think that was pretty bad-ass of him.

But like I said, to each their own I guess.

** So, this entire fic is dark as fuck, but Neville is absolutely a badass in it. However, let me be very clear - he is not a good person in this fic. None of the main characters in this fic are good. This author is /amazing/ at writing sympathetic villains as main characters in such a way that you are engaged and kind of want them to win while at the same time being completely unable to deny that they are not good people and while their enemies may be not the best people either, the MCs are objectively worse.

So. If that isn't an immediate hard stop for you, I very much recommend Pygmalion by Colubrina.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.

** The fight scene at the end of significant digits has exactly this

"Bellatrix!"

The cry came from above.

"Bellatrix Black!"

It was otherworldly.

"Bellatrix Black!"

It was enraged.

"Bellatrix Black!"

It was magnificent.

"BELLATRIX BLACK!"

It was Neville Longbottom.

He came from the sky. He didn't land, exactly - rather, he plummeted to the roof in a swooping dive, so steep that it seemed as though he would simply crash straight through the slates, but Longbottom pulled up at the last minute dead even with the slates, alighting and walking without even an instant of transition. He stepped forward and the broom clattered to the roof and Longbottom was already attacking, once twice thrice, as though gravity and timing and all the laws of possibility were mere formalities that he'd chosen to discard. Tall and terrible, the Lord Longbottom moved like the wind.

He attacked Bellatrix, and it was a thing of beauty and glory - choreographed, as if it had been practiced every day for years. High feint drawing a shield, which put him into position for obfuscation, and which in turn flowed seamlessly into three glowing offensive bolts. It was a series like any auror would learn... but rather than two or three spells in sequence, Longbottom attacked without ceasing, a rhythmic and timed flow of variety and passion. He switched from low attacks to broad ones, raised wards and then shattered them with surprising new offensives, and stripped away Bellatrix's defenses with a hurricane of attacks.

In an existence that threatened to become overcrowded with the unbelievable, Pip still found room for astonishment.

Bellatrix laughed; high-pitched, insane. "Silly little do-" she began, but a flurry of attacks cut her off, and she was forced to defend herself. "Silly bi-" she began again, only to again be forced to bark out a shield of crystal and dodge away from danger.

"You -"

"Silly bi-"

No one could be standing after attacking endlessly, relentlessly, unstoppably, but Neville Longbottom never broke his stride and never broke his sequence. One spell followed another, one attack followed another, one shield followed another. No openings, no weaknesses, no opportunities, no respite.

Bellatrix Black's laugh broke. She lashed away attacks and raised wards and cast curses, but she was not fighting a wizard. She was fighting an elemental force.

And every taunt and every joke and every insanity was cut off by some new attack. Every word broken by offense. Every moment under siege.

"That's -"

Longbottom advanced without pausing, never breaking stride. He was discarding his humanity, and doing it despite eyes streaming with tears.

"No -"

"You -"

And finally, Bellatrix's mad smile cracked as she desperately ducked the hundredth attack, and she shrieked with a voice full of fear, "Stop!"

And like a wrathful god, Neville Longbottom, a thousand feet tall and burning with brimstone, roared in return, "That's what they said to you! Avada Kedavra!"
