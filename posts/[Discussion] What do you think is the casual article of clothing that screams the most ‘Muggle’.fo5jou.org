Let's ignore flashy colours and/designs and everything that doesn't cover what it should. I'm wondering what people in the fandom think is the article of clothing that seems the most Muggle? For my part, I thinks it's jeans, although I may be biased against jeans since I haven't worn any in the last seven years.


** Anything with a logo on it for something not popular in the wizarding world for various reasons. Imagine wearing a T-shirt with Pokemon all over it.

Alternatively, dressing up as monsters in costume form that are actually real (i.e. werewolves, ghosts, goblins, etc.)

*** I can see where dressing up as a ghost and calling ghosts evil or monsters could even come across as offensive to a wizard.

"Now see here, my granny wouldn't possess anybody, even if that was a thing that ghosts could even do!"

** Jeans would make a lot of sense, as the garment was invented with a target demographic in mind that needed something durable and comfortable. Iirc, miners in the late 1800s were the first to wear jeans, and then jeans caught on with farmers and other manual laborers.

A wizard wouldn't necessarily need jeans in the first place. A muggle would have to be crawling around on his hands and knees, mucking about in the soil with a set of hand tools, but a wizard could float about on a broom, using his wand to charm an army of hand tools into doing all the heavy lifting.

** In DH Ron is wearing jeans. I just checked, it is in the scene when they are in the muggle café on Tottenham Court Rd and get attacked by the DE.

Considering how wide-spread jeans are I can easily see quite a few working class wizards wearing them, especially those who grew up with close contacts to muggles.

** Athletic shoes/sneaker/trainers, especially in bright colors like white. Wizards would only wear handmade leather shoes.

I always thought JKR repeatedly mentioned Harry's old beat up trainers in part because this was something that marked him as “other” 24/7 as they'd show under his robes.

** In general, I have to agree with jeans. I just have a /really/ hard time imagining any pureblood wizard (or witch) wearing denim.

More specifically, I think the words used to describe the clothing matters a lot. "Simple white cloth shirt" vs. "t-shirt", for instance. Same thing, different mental image.
