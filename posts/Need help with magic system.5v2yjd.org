So in a story I'm working on, Harry can speak magic. Not spells, which force natural magic to do the caster's bidding. So instead of "wingardium leviosa" (which even saying makes him feel dirty) he can say "float" and the feather floats. Except I don't want it to make it that easy/simple. I don't want him to just be able to look at Voldemort and go "kill" and boom, he dies but I don't want the limitations to be "some stuff just can't be done without spells".

I was thinking maybe he needs specifics like "make the feather float" or specific words like "levitate" rather than "float" and it's trial and error to see what works. I dunno. Thoughts?


** Ooh, I love these plot lines.

Some ideas for you:

A sentient magic. Like in the Sacrifices Arc, you can make it so that magic is aware and let Harry be able to communicate with it. And because magic is sentient, you can talk to it and ask it to do things --- the catch being Harry must first persuade magic into following his will. This idea is also explored in murkybluematter's series.

Maybe spells are just pleasing combinations of words to the personification of magic.

Latin-based spells wouldn't have existed before the language, and it makes sense that other regions of the world have their own spells that would accomplish the same thing. Maybe have your Harry research into cultural influences on magic, the effects of each language.

See what happens when you change inflection, or have conflicting intent behind the spell.

*** Yeah, but "spell" is the wrong way to describe it. Spells as they are in canon, Harry HATES. Even just saying the words makes him feel as if someone is forcing him to spit fiery grease. The words though, he could research yeah. Maybe through magic words he learns the first ever language on earth or something.

Sentient magic is also a possibility I like. Would open up new plots too. Threats to magic and such and Harry being its champion or something.

** This sounds a bit similar to linkao3(A Year Like None Other by aspeninthesunlight). You might like to take a look for some inspiration.

In this one, Harry loses the ability to do magic normally. Later he discovers that he can do spells in parseltongue so has to translate the spells he does. This does cause some problems since the words don't always translate that well and the words he says are taken literally. It also uses the idea you had about having to say a specific phrase and using trial and error to get that phrase.

Edit: The bit you would want to look at starts in chapter 59

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** What if instead of english literal translation you had a different language system. Kinda like the magic system in Eragon. If you haven't read the series, basically magic is woven from words, and you can accomplish basically infinity things provided you have the will, power and are able to string together a sentence. However, since its a totally different language, you have to learn its nuances and subtleties. This could help overcome Harry's hatred of the spells. Furthermore, it could be a good reason why he can't do super op things- he either doesnt know the words to do it, since he hasn't figured it out yet, or the words themselves can't accomplish certain things due to language differences.

For instance, float in english could mean something like "let the wind rise". In which case, Harry might not be able to just "kill" or "explode" Voldemort.

-Sorry if Eragon reference is a bit off, haven't read the books in a while.

Edit: Also maybe the price/energy required for longer/more complex incantations requires more energy, and saying the equivalent of "kill" is just too impractical.

*** Yeah, I was considering magic being it's own language. Harry has to work out the words and in the heat of battle it won't always be practical to do. I think I might make it teachable, so not like parseltongue but any other foreign language. He'll still hate any spells not said in magic since they force magic rather than coax it and ask it to perform what you want, but knowing he can teach people will make him not just peace out in disgust.

** It's sounds unnecessary and pointless. Incantations were never given much stock in canon, sure, when you're just starting out they're required (unless you're Hermione 'I was created as wish-fulfillment for the Author' Granger) but at some point you don't even have to say the incantation when you're learning a spell. It's kind of pointless to make a whole story surrounded by a premise that no one really likes.

**** Yea, the number of bad HP fics far outweigh the good. I can hardly remember the last good Adventure/Action fic. Trust me, it may seem fun to play around on google translate and add Io and um to every word, but at some point it gets plain tedious.

***** Oh i don't do the second thing. Google translate, yes. But then it's mostly for my own amusement. I very rarely put it into fics. I think in the one I'm currently working on, I have like a good 100 spells and their incantations, but in the actual story it only mentions them by what they do. Like "ancient Egyptian spell designed to confuse tomb raiders" or something. Plus in battles it gets clunky and flows wrong if you have them just shouting incantations at each other between describing what each spell does.

But it's always good to have all this stuff written down so you keep consistent, I say.

Regardless, I know what you mean. So many bad fics now. Hell, its hard to find action/adventure period. Everything seems like romance and drama nowadays.

****** Exactly! Plus, I rarely see any Harry-centric fics worth mentioning, if you go on FFN and filter for Harry, stories with him only make up 25% of the total.

******* I mean he's gotten enough time in canon. On the other hand, fics centered around essentially canon OCs (I.e Daphne Greengrass or Susan Bones) are kind of odd. It's interesting that so many people will read Harry x Daphne but Harry x OC scares them off, even though they're kind of essentially the same thing.

******** I mean, Harry's characterization in canon was effectively null, due to being written by a female. I'm not saying that females can't write, period. I'm saying that when dealing with a Young Adult Male, especially going through puberty, females have these misconceptions about their thought processes. Like, Harry was moody throughout the entirety of the last four books, but it wasn't the usual sporadic moody, mixed with making eyes at any female that walked and describing it in detail in your head, moody. It was a highly female moody that involved the usual "my life is sooo unfair" while doing effectively nothing productive.

There was also the highly Christian way of writing things, partly to to the fact that JKR herself is Protestant, at least I think so. But I found it highly odd that Harry randomly started liking Ginny, with the 'odd monster in his chest' one day, yet couldn't describe anything about her that he liked.

** Remember Ron's attempt at a Color Change Charm back when he first met Harry? How about, Harry can do almost anything with magic, but he has to speak in rhyme for it to work.

This might be more suited for a parody or a crackfic, I guess.

** Sounds close to the wish!magic that some fics have had, in that if Harry feels strongly enough about something it can happen. A way to limit the power on this is using moral or situational conditions. If you do limit what ways it can be used then you need to be consistent with it. It's okay for Harry to have something work or fail and not know why, but it's not okay to say Harry couldn't kill the Dursleys because as a child he doesn't have the concept of what "Die of a heart attack" means and then have him kill someone without going over the actual implications of death.

Just make sure that you get the why's and how's of your system down before you commit to it to prevent weak plot later.

*** Oh yeah. I was gonna have him accidentally "kill" Dudley. He accidentally triggers sending Dudley somewhere far away (while looking for an escape during the event that led him to pop onto the roof in canon) and he's never found again. But I felt that'd either make it too angsty with him blaming himself for Dudley's disappearance or risk turning him into some "I will vanish anyone who makes me mad" person.

I do plan on him having a thesaurus at all times and possibly a dictionary. He also has a notebook filled with all the phrases he's found so far. Like "make me unseen" turns him invisible.

He can tell when a phrase isn't going to work, or when a specific word isn't the right one to use, but it's trial and error until he finds the right ones. Like I think "die of a heart attack" wouldn't be the right phrase to use if he wanted to kill someone of a heart attack. Nor would "stop his heart".
