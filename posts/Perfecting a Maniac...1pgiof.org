Hey all. I've been drafting a rather large fic of mine for weeks now and I've been testing different characters out to see how well I can write them; balance their personalities without going crazy like I've seen in so many other fics. So far I've loved trying Voldemort. Simply because I've never attempted such an evil character before. What I want to know is how anyone else here has gone with writing the Dark Lord. Do you find him hard or easy? Thanks

*** Do you mean the fic I mentioned? Not yet, at least not until I'm happy with the end result. I just wanted to find out how others have gone about him and whether or not they found him hard or easy to write.

** Voldemort is easy if you remember his primary motivator is always fear, and how he can distance himself from that fear. He is afraid, and so strikes out at the things that he fears. He creates his Horcruxes because he fears death, he strikes down the Potter family because he fears the outcome of prophecy. It doesn't mean he does everything out of immediate fear, or that he's a cringing child, but he always carries that close with him, and it influences his larger goals.

It's also worth noting that Voldemort is mentioned as having been quite charming, but always in the past-tense. Attempts at guile for a post-resurrection Voldemort should be ham-handed at best. He's out of practice and much more used to using force, and his charisma is utterly shattered by his repulsive appearance. A rehabilitation of that aspect of his character into the snake oil salesman (apologies for the pun) he's reputed to have been might be a unique take on it.

Edit: Accidentally a vowel.

*** Also, he's a stickler for the theatrical and poetry in action, probably part of his megalomania. If he's doing a ritual everything has to have a purpose, from the location, the day, the... ingredients, its all has to have a reason, its part of his whole psyche.

*** Fear. Thank god I didn't forget that. I agree totally, without it Voldemort would not be, well, Voldemort. To often do I see other novice fanfic writers forget that simple fact.

** I see Voldemort as hard to do strictly as a canon character. Entirely AU and OOC treatments, however, are mostly kind of cartoonishly sad.

Since JKR wrote almost literally nothing about what Voldemort /actually wants/ other than immortality, and much more about what crazy pure-bloods want, I'd try to find new purposes that fits his actions.

An example: he isn't actually a crazy pure-blood himself and their horror and fear (especially the Malfolys') at his actions in DH shows this. Voldemort doesn't appear to actually care about killing all Muggles (in canon) or even ruling them. He is mostly focused on the dangerous encroachment of Muggle-born and the social issues they bring. He was abandoned by a Muggle father and left to rot in a Muggle orphanage, remember.

So you could see him as being more of a cultural isolationist than a genocidal maniac, like most people writing complicated Voldemort-centric fics suggest. Fearing Muggles might just mean keeping them from being able to hurt Magical Britain, solved by doing things like Imperiusing their current PM, not building complicated (and surely expensive) concentration camps. Snatchers also seem to be more a sort of thug force than SS troops.

Also remember that in DH, his Death Eaters and suborned Auror corp let an entire wedding party of blood traitors go after questioning them about Harry Potter. He didn't kill them all or immediately put them all in camps or something. He seems to try to avoid killing pure-bloods who don't get in his way, and was possibly even willing to not kill Lily Potter, a sworn enemy.

For historic themes, think more annexing Austria than Trail of Tears.

--------------

So long as he isn't a cackling villain who fails all the time, like some stories I've read, I'd be satisfied. But he needs a goal beyond killing Harry Potter and being immortal. Ask yourself, "if my Voldemort won tomorrow because Harry Potter choked on a pretzel, what would Voldemort do next, and why?"

** Writing villains are always more difficult in writing your protagonists. Often, a villain is just a vehicle to move the plot or affect your protagonist instead of having their own character. They're usually the ones that springboard a character change for the protagonist and as a result, you'll often have them perform in such a way that isn't really logical or consistent with their character.

I think the best way to avoid the pitfalls of a villain simply being a plot device is to have two stories in your head. Your main story with your protagonists and then a separate story that you never write down of the villain.

** I'm currently writing a HP fic with a maniacally evil character. He's so fun to write! What I've found that helps is to not only remember the character you are writing (the maniac), but keep in mind who the maniac is conversing with. This is more important with evil and manipulative character. Don;'t just get in Voldemort's head. Get in Voldemort's head as he gets into the heads of others. Know your OTHER characters and what would cause them the most pain. Then allow Voldemort to draw out that pain in a glib and cold manner.

For example. I have a scene where Harry watches a maniac torture an adult Greg Goyle. He taunts him over the murder of Vincent Crabbe, then threatens painful death to Goyle's wife, Millicent Bulstrode, if he does not get the information he desires. When the maniac gets the information that he wants, he reveals that Millicent is currently in hell getting violated by Crabbe and probably enjoying it. Then he kills Goyle with a smile on his face.

Easy-Peasy!

** Here's what you have to ask yourself: do I want an evil character who is evil for the sake of evil and kicks puppies and spit on grannies and has no redeeming features or shred of humanity or anything other than a big flashing sign saying: "VILLAIN", or do you want a balanced villain with goals and intents and who sees actions as means to and end?
