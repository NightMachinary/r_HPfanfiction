This was before "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" and I completely imagined USA Mage Society.

Due to even the poorest of Mages, like the Weasleys, being significantly better of than the poorest of Muggles, like 19th century factory workers, immigration from Europe into the US was significantly more attractive due to all the /cough/ "free land" that people could use for their own little farms. Hence Americans Mages are a far smaller and thus better integrated part of Euro-American Society. The average American Witch is a far more competent expert on Muggles than Arthur Weasley.

My character is the son of an American Industrialist and his British Mage Immigrant Wife. She insists that their Son visit Hogwarts and his father, always the calculating type, also reasons that a large, prestigious institution like Hogwarts must be better than the small private schools that exist in American Mage society to foster his sons magic talents. So the son is sent to Hogwarts, becomes completely fascinated with trying make his laptop usable in Hogwarts and becomes close friends with Hermione (and to a slightly lesser extent Ron and Harry), with whom he could discuss Muggle science and politics topics endlessly. Ron understandably doesn't understand any of this but Harry had such a shitty Muggle life that he just doesn't give a fuck about Muggle affairs any more.

What do you think of this char?


** What character?

This is all you wrote that we could judge about this particular OC. That is /at best/ an initial idea for a character.

/We don't even kow his name!/

To the rest: It's alright. I don't necessarily get why being in no need of economical advancement would get people to emigrate from their homes, but that is a worldbuilding issue. The reasoning of the parents and his friendship with the three canon MCs is okay and depends on execution.

And who the hell had a laptop in the early 90s?

Right? I did tech support for AOL starting in 1996. Windows 3.11 was still king, Win 95 was just starting, Mac OS was I think 7.7.5? The first Pentium processors had come out. We had a guy who worked on the Mac queue and he would bring in what was called a "luggable" and it was just about the size of a small suitcase.

Users were still on dialup, most commonly 28.8, but there were still plenty of 14.4 and even some 2400 baud users. 802.11b didn't exist and Ethernet was still 10Mbits. The new iMac Pro that just came out supports 10GB. The first Mac product with 802.11g wireless came out in 2003.

I didn't get my first laptop (and computer of my very very own) until 1999 and that thing weighed more than 10 lbs and it cost around $2000 and that was with a discount from my friend at Dell. I still have it because it's the only machine I have that will run Magic: Duels of the Planeswalkers. I remember when I was speccing it out, DVD drives in machines were new and games were just starting to come out on DVD.

It's easy to think that laptops have been around forever in this era of Chromebooks, iPads and phones, but that is simply not the case. The machine I work on now, a MacBook Pro with the touch bar, would have been looked at in absolute amazement 25 years ago.

**** Oh, I remember the good old times with Windows 3.0, and 640KB RAM was thought to be enough (even by Bill Gates!).

There was one kid in my school who bought one computer with 2MB RAM and 125MB Hard Drive, and we all envied him.

***** Okay, so. My first machine was an IBM PS/2 my dad bought the family for Christmas. It was a 486 SX 25MHz with 4MB of RAM and a 120MB HDD running Windows 3.1. No optical, no sound card. I added those myself later. I adored the game El-Fish by Maxxis. You could catch, breed and evolve virtual fish and it was just the best thing ever. You could create fish tanks and animate the fish. This machine did not have a math co-processor (DX had the co-processor), so I'd have to set up the machine to animate a few fish OVERNIGHT.

My now-husband had a 486 DX 66 machine and I was just amazed at how much faster his machine animated my fish. Minutes! I might have gone a little crazy.

Me and my BFF used to set up stuff to download at her house on her 2400baud connection and then leave to go to the minimart. Maybe it would be done by the time we got back, maybe not.

I still remember the first time we dialed up with a 14.4 modem and creating my first web page (El-Fish of course. You could download tanks and fish compressed down to .roe files). 28.8 was even better.

The first 1GB HDD we got, my husband proudly proclaimed, "We'll never fill that up!" Haha! I look at 1 and 2TB drives now and think the same, but I know it's a lie.

Kids these days don't know how awesome everything is now.

*** Erm maybe rich kids xD The idea behind that is that desperation makes ppl willing to take risks more.

Yeah it was meant as an idea for starters :/ But really, isn't a name basically random?

The idea behind is basically witnessing one of malfoys ""racist"" attacks on Hermione and having the same background as her (except for the "minor" issue of their massive difference in their Muggle sociel level) befriends Hermione then the rest and becomes really obsessed with fusing magic and modern tech.

And yeah maybe for this to work we have to transpose the Harry Potter series into the 21. Century, but does it matter? There is so little Muggle tech in the original and magic probably didn't really change in that time, so what?

**** 'Massive Difference' in muggle society level? I mean, arguably, Hermione's family is likely the 'best off' of the trio as is. Her parents are literally doctors. With proper investing and management they are likely doing very well for themselves. Having something be massively better off than that immediately goes into Gary Stu territory. Super-wealthy youth characters typically end up reading as wish-fulfillment and often end up being incredibly boring.

Names can be random, but no they aren't. Mine are chosen for specific reasons. They don't need to have some grand meaning or symbolism, but they should reflect something about the character.

Fusing tech and magic has always struck me as uninteresting. I also feel like if it was possible, more people would have done it. One of the greatest 'technological' ages in the world was the Victorian Era, which is what we're supposed to believe the Wizarding World is stuck in (I don't myself but different argument). The Victorians saw and embraced technological change more readily than any society to that point. If Wizards are of that era it stands more to reason that they'd be winning to try to improve upon things with magic, rather than hide away from it, as that was more the Victorian mindset.

I think a more interesting story is instead exploring the dichotomy of the two and having a character decide which he'd rather live with. Of course this would tend to delve into the 'X IS SUPERIOR BECAUSE BLAH BLAH' arguments which instantly cheapen it. I feel like if someone were to write something that explored it more in the style of 'would you rather live in the city or the country' could make a phenomenal story. But it has to juxtapose the virtues of each.

Without getting two long winded into details there, I'd say you have a more interesting story if he fails at fusing the two than if he succeeds. Granted, I also think the story is more interesting if it's a daughter rather than a son. Especially if you're going to go the super rich route, then make it a complete foil for Malfoy.

Do you know how much a laptop costed and weighted in early 1990s?

Do you know the specs of such laptops in early 1990s?

** Replace "laptop" with "computer". Maybe even give him some old "Home Computer" from the 80s - C64, something cheap that he can experiment with - and an old TV serving as screen. (I had an MSX2, bought in 1986 or so, and kept it until the early 1990s). Having such a project would also probably be fascinating for Hermione, who would likely try to help. With regards to Ron, he could try to help as well, seeing as his father managed to enchant a flying invisible car and is generally fascinated with muggles. Ron could see the project as a way to do something his elder brothers never did - something that would be his. And Harry likely wouldn't junk everything muggle just because of his shitty family. (I'd recommend toning down the abuse - if you take the Dursley antics seriously, you'll end up in "angst/trauma" territory.
