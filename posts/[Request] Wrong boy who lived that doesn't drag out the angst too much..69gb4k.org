Ok you have to have Harry neglected and overlooked to set up a good reveal/ comeuppance scene, but when we're 20 chapters in and Harry still hasn't got any recognition and voldemort's horcux has just forced his girlfriend to cheat on him with his brother, you're milking it.


** Well, there's linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) . It's my favorite WBWL.

*** I really liked it but I just haven't been able to get through the Hermione and Blaise chapter. Yes Hermione is amazing and learning things faster/better than anyone else ever in the whole history is magic. Oh look she is even awesome when they are getting chase by the Wizard Mafia which is really absurd. I clicked the X when Blaise started telling her his big secret. Yawn.

I understand wanting to tell a story from multiple perspectives and to do that correctly you need the read to feel something towards the character but holy cow who cares? I want to see more of what Harry is capable of and what's really up James butt about the whole Potter/Slytherin thing. Does it get better? Can I skip the non-Harry parts without losing too much of the main story?

Sorry if I came off whiny.

**** I can't remember exactly where the Hermione and Blaise chapter is, but the later chapters definitely are really good! There's a lot of intrigue later in the story (not sure if you have gotten to the actual "Prince of Slytherin part, but if you haven't, boy oh boy does the story start to get interesting at the end of that plot arc) and you definitely need to read all the chapters. There's a lot of subplot going on. Just be patient. It'll be worth it.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn(Too Young To Die).

Harry is an asshole, but with complete and total reason to be. It is also nice, because we can clearly see his unapologetic turn into the villain, but a really sympathetic one, despite being completely evil, sadistic, and self-destructive. Weirdly, it is really one of the few fics which hit me right in the feels. Something about watching a good person with a good cause turn into the epitome of evil is depressing. Downward spiral, self-destruction etc. It is also nice because the author doesn't really smooth out the bad bits. Yes we see things from Harry's unreliable perspective, so we get his thoughts about it being justified, but if you ignore that point of view, all the dark magic is hardcore, evil, and monstrous without any of the little things that authors use to smooth out the edges, like in romantic Voldemort stories or what not. Worth the read IMO.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
