** I've finished it. Thoughts:

Likes:

- The hiding the broken wrist subplot.
- Draco and Pansy as friends, Sirius as a parent figure, all interesting and well-done
- The plot was suspenseful throughout
- Original(?) plot ideas (I haven't read Alana the Lioness, so I will charitably assume all of the cool plot points were the author's idea)
- The author delivered a good ending, with heaps of tension and lives on the line, that tied up the plot. Finding something like that is extremely rare in fanfiction, and I was impressed.

Dislikes:

- Lack of consequences: at some point, Rigel should be caught doing something like wearing a wig to the library, or helping Flint cheat, or having a broken arm by the teachers. The fact that she gets away with everything she comes up with is implausible and removes some of the narrative tension.
- Lack of consequences (medical edition): If Rigel spent two days in meditation, shouldn't she be thirsty and hungry when she comes to? Shouldn't her mouth taste like she didn't brush her teeth for days? Shouldn't she be exhausted? Also she constantly pushes beyond even a time turner-era Hermione output of schoolwork and never has a single emotional, mental, or physical breakdown or symptom from it other than noting tiredness when she does full-time brewing. A lack of medical consequences (other than the arm thing which was nicely done) makes it feel like the hero can do literally anything she wants. Or more like a video game character with a resetting health bar rather than a real person.
- The prose and dialog. Never before have I powered through a story with so many overwrought, tortured, convoluted sentences and metaphors. The author uses the word "orbs" for eyes unironically. Eleven-year-olds speak like they learned English solely from reading Pride & Prejudice. Maybe Alana the Lioness has "big words are better words" syndrome also, and the author was trying to copy the style. I don't know. It was super frustrating because the author would pack sentences with "I found this in a thesaurus" words but then mess up on common homophones and make basic writing errors that made the whole story hard to read.
- The characters never talked or behaved like 11 year olds; they were too smart, too strong, too focused, too good at lying, too concerned with appearances and posturing, too concerned about crushes. The story read a lot better if I imagined the characters as being 14+.
- Too much instant powering up. The storyline with uncontrollable/too controlled magic was interesting, but I would have liked to see some progress, some setbacks, etc. rather than "I realized I have to ask my magic nicely and now I'm instantly amazing"
- "Only an 11 year old can save the day!" I am willing to accept Rigel's unique talent in curing the illness. But the brewing is absurd to believe. I'd be okay if Rigel were helping the competent adults and older students brew the tricky medicinal potions, but having the entire burden fall on her shoulders was just stretching belief. I get that it's tricky to set up a situation where only your very young protagonist can save the day, and even JKR wasn't perfect at it. So this is the least of my criticisms.

Yeah! What a treat to not be rehashing canon, and to have something besides the Sorcerer-Stone obstacle course be the Big Bad. The 3rd book also tells a story that is nonhashed, and which I consider fabulous.

Yeah, I feel similarly. It doesn't get better in the later books, either. She goes to absurd lengths to preserve her secrets, and it always works out.

I'll concede only a tiny shred here. If you consider potions to be akin to something like art, it is really believable that an 11 year old is good enough to be in a position to save the day. And not just good enough, but good with a recent track record of delivering while under a heavy work load.

** I've read this story and its sequels through twice and thoroughly enjoyed them.

Others have already dealt with some of the major issues, such as the main protagonist starting out as an 11yo acting 30 from the start. I'm not going to disagree with any of that.

I see two big problems that haven't been addressed yet. The first is that the story requires every adult, especially Sirius, James and Lily, to not just be holding an idiot ball but to be juggling about five at once. For all that Harry and Archie take precautions, there's no way their parents are going to be fooled for long. It's a problem that only grows as the series continues.

The other problem is that the two kids are prepared to take such a huge, life-changing decision at such an early age: Harry is prepared to risk life in Azkaban so she can go to a particular school, and Archie is happy for his best (pretty much only) friend to risk that.

A minor quibble for me is that I don't think you can read this story on its own. Each canon book encompassed a complete story while being part of a larger arc. I don't think this quite pulls that off - there's not much point to this particular story on its own.

Having said all that I'm prepared to forgive the series its faults because the stories are well-written and highly inventive. Several original facets of potion-brewing are introduced and developed believably, for a start. A lot of stories dismiss potions as just following recipes but this story starts a process where it becomes a truly complex and enthralling subject.

Another great feature doesn't make an appearance in this particular story but the depiction of what murkybluematter calls The Lower Alleys is superb and introduces some great new OCs and story elements.

I put off reading this for a long time because the summary didn't appeal to me. I'd never heard of Alanna the Lioness for a start and didn't want to start a million-word series that I wouldn't understand. But you don't have to have a clue about the other series to enjoy this one. Once I started, I stormed through the entire series in a few days and eagerly await updates now.

Yes, you need to suspend your disbelief at certain points in the story but it's well worth reading despite that.

*** Since you're a fan, can you help me out? I've tried to start it twice, but I can't get past the first few chapters. One of my pet peeves is children who speak like adults/politicking Slytherin kids. Like, I want to read a story where the kids are kids. Does that carry forward through the plot, or is it fixed soon? If not, what makes this story worthwhile enough that I should get over myself?

For me at least, I can ignore the "speaking like adults" thing because I like the characters well enough. I've also read a lot of fanfic, and I'd rather have decent if adult-like dialogue than horrid attempts to write kids dialogue.

If you're not a fan of the Slytherin politics tropes, this probably isn't the fic for you. I personally like it, tho it has to be done well (and it is here).

**** I agree with pretty much what u\Akitcougar said.

Just to add, the author does a great job laying out Harry/Rigel's personality and motivations right from the very beginning. She's portrayed as a girl who's mature for her age. Also, at the onset, murkybluematter establishes that she's very driven and singleminded to achieve her goal of learning potions - even going so far as to break the law to do so. Because of this, she knows she can't afford to be so free and childish with her dealings in Hogwarts.

Same goes for Archie as well. As for the other minor characters, remember that we're focusing on Slytherins interacting with fellow Snakes here. These are heirs/heiresses to old Pureblood houses who put so much stock in tradition. Of course, they're going to be stuffier than the average kid. It's also not outside the realm of probability that they had lessons in elocution when younger. In real life terms, think Harrow or Eton who had similar subjects.

murkybluematter is an awesome author because, despite all of everything I've said before, he/she doesn't forget that at the end of the day, they are still kids. The characters, for their mature way of speaking and politicking, are petty, jealous, and immature in a lot of different ways.

I hope you can get past this because his/her series is truly great. Characterization, plot, and worldbuiling - freaking amazong. Like I seriously wonder why he/she writes for free. If she had a Patreon account, I would seriously like to support this author.

***** OK, I am now choosing to imagine the kids as being 14 rather than 11 and it makes a lot more sense. Also, I admit I'm still skimming past a lot of the dialog where it gets more clunky and uses words like "eclat." Seriously, I went to school with rich kids and no one except the outcast weirdos talked like that. Maybe British people are different (I doubt it...)

** So I've reread this many times and this is one of my favorite fanfic series. In her early author notes, Violet said she wanted to write a good fem!Harry. I think this is very interesting even though Harry/Rigel is very OP. Like others have said, the eleven year olds don't act their age, and its easier to imagine that they are fourteen or slightly older. In terms of this book in its series, this is eclipsed by later "books" in the series as the ruse thickens. I'm biased but the years get more and more interesting.

Overall it's a very enjoyable read. There are a lot of characters to keep track of, especially with the sequels. I like how the time is used to make more story. The winter and summer holidays aren't just glossed over, things actually happen. There are also some interesting ideas about magic which is nice to read in HP fanfiction.

This series feels like ideal HP fanfic for me. There are fantasy/magical elements, not a huge focus on romance (yet), and is obscenely long. Some foreshadowing details are embedded within the story so it's nice to hunt for new clues.

I'm torn between wanting the smarter characters (Dumbledore, Hermione, Snape, TMR, etc.) to figure out the ruse or for Harry and Archie to keep making the ruse more complicated. Getting found out would be the climax of the entire series and anything after wouldn't have the same urgency as before. But I still want to see everyone's reactions.

Side note: there is a discord for discussing this fic series in depth and communicating with the author and her sister. This fic also has fanfic deriving from it which are nice to read while waiting for new chapters.

** I kept avoiding this fic because of the description and because I've always prefered fem!harry where everyone knows she's a girl. At some point I just said fuck it and read it anyway, and I ended up liking it. There are things about it I don't like, but all in all the series has been a pretty good read thus far.

It's got good characters, the magical system is well thought out (although I don't like magical cores.) The expanded world (mostly with AIM and the lower alleys) is a nice touch. The premise of two people switching lives and going way out of thier way to keep the secret is interesting. I like that there are multiple close calls along the way, and the only thing keeping people from figuring it out is that it's such a bold and absurdly complicated plan that no one would think it might be a thing.

That said, I'm waiting for the moment where characters who in canon are known to smart, logical, good at deductive reasoning etc (Snape, Hermione, Dumbledore, Lily, James), end up figuring out the whole ruse. I'm also waiting for a moment where because they feel guilty lying to people the care about one or both of Harry and Archie end up just telling either their parents of friends the truth and then the person or people they tell are probably pissed for a while but end up helping keep the secret because they're friends and/or family. I haven't read the most recent two chapters of The Futile Facade yet, so it's possible one of those things has already happened but I don't know.

Also, as much as I like the premise, I'm not 100% sold on it's necessity. I mean, I know in the fic Hogwarts is substandard for learning healing and AIM is not a great place for learning potions, but, I'm not convinced that a. two eleven year olds are so concerned with the quality of their education that they're willing to inact an elaborate and illegal ruse and b. that two students who are as advanced in their chosen fields and as passionate as they are wouldn't get a lot of extra attention from their professors. I'm also not sold on the idea that Sirius would see how important learning to be a healer is to Archie and still insist on him going to Hogwarts.

A fic where Harry and Archie have to succeed dispite not having access to the highest quality education might have made for just as good of a story. Harry ends up impressing Snape with her work off her own merit anyway, due to her time working in knockturn alley and the lower alleys. Archie and Harry could still find ways to help each other achive their dreams, they'd still have to engage in lots of self study due to the limits of their education. Harry would have to deal with predudice due to being a half blood, as well as potions in this fic being a bit of a boys club. As Harry gets older her success maybe could have an unitended consequence of pushing her further into the poltical limelight as she ends up challenging the notion that half bloods aren't as good at magic.

I think this is a frequent mistake that even the best fanfiction writers make, and it's something I've learned to accept without judging too harshly for it, mostly because the quality of writing is otherwise 99% better than anything else out there.

The eleven-year-olds don't act like eleven-year-olds. They don't go through the stages of optimism, insecurity, or immaturity that other pre-teens and teens go through. They are always grades ahead of their peers in terms of research and general magical knowledge, and often have their futures planned out already. Sometimes everyone in the main characters friend group is this way, sometimes the main character is the only one that's set apart, and this is used to convey how smart they are. And this is mostly because the writer is unintentionally projecting themselves a bit too much into their characters.

Rowling has the ability to show that children are more capable than adults believe them to be, but still maintained a long-term character growth. Hermione is brilliant, but she still works through character faults as she grows up. She's starts out as a bit overenthusiastic, a bit haughty, and cares more for rules than principal. She has insecurities about the way she looks, and doesn't always handle personal or social issues well. But she's extremely intelligent and responsible, and in the end, her friendship with Harry and Ron helps her improve on her other attributes.

I'm fine with the premise that each school has its specialization, but I feel like an eleven-year-old would be more caught up in the image they've built up in their mind. I mean, it's /Hogwarts./ And in this world, it's only for the best of the best. Similar to how people choose colleges.

** This isn't really my cup of tea.

That being said, the idea is interesting, as with a bit of tweaking it could almost be a magical "Gattaca" analog: where purebloods actually do have better magical talents (or something like that), and our half-blood hero tries to pass off as one despite everything.

Hell, maybe there could even be a similar goal or similar securities/suspicion on him for his duplicity, it could be a really cool drama.

If you've ever seen the movie, you'll know what I mean - and this would be a perfect setup for a Daphne Greengrass pairing, which is one of my favorites to read :)

Of course it'd have to be a bit more AU, as in canon JKR almost made it seem like purebloods were /weaker/ (which doesn't make too much sense), but what's the point in fanfiction if you don't change things around?

*** These are mostly world building background details, so not really spoilers, but marking it as such anyway. But in this fic, the average muggleborn is magically weaker than the average pureblood, so sort of fits, but it's not a drastic difference and would only matter with certain career choices. However a small number of muggleborns are way stronger than average. Lily Evans was one of these. So muggleborns are either slightly weaker, or super powerful. Though half bloods seem to also benefit from the chance of extra poweredness, since the three most powerful wizards shown, Dumbledore, Riddle, and Harry are all half bloods. Plus purebloods have some sort of genetic disease making them unable to conceive more than one or two children, presumably due to inbreeding, so that evens things out a bit.

He is my biggest pet peeve, the tall dark stranger who is immediately interested in our lead and set up to be a romantic partner. This is not necessarily bad in itself if not for the whole 'Prince of the lower Alleys' hogwash. You're telling me in this world of dark magic where 500 yr old vampires are walking around and the greatest wizard (dumbledore) is like 200 that a young teenager can become the mafia boss of the entire British magical underworld? I can't take his character seriously in any of the many scenes that exist to showcase how good he is at dueling or how all the people in knock-turn look up to him for protection.

** Quite liked reading this, but, as other people have pointed out, there's some pretty major problems. The plot is pretty well-structured and engaging- I was surprised that I didn't give up on this story very quickly because I usually dislike major canon divergence AUs, so the fact that it kept my interest anyways is a credit to the author- but the dialogue is really, really clunky, especially because just about every character (regardless of age) is written as Incredibly Formal And Eloquent. My biggest pet peeve, especially as the story went on, was how massively powerful Rigel/Harry was. I mean, the skill at potions is one thing, but consistently surprising every adult around her with her impossible talent is a bit much. One of the things I like the most about the way the original Harry Potter books handle the whole Chosen One thing is that Harry /isn't/ particularly better at magic than his peers, so it just didn't make much sense to me that this Harry has such extraordinary natural talent.

​

Probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone in particular, but it was a fun read despite the problems

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

*** I could have sworn when I first read it that Tom Riddle and the SOW party had an emergency Wizengamot session on Halloween 1981, as the story's AU version of the climax of Voldemort. And they did, but that wasn't when the anti-muggleborn-at-Hogwarts legislation was passed. (See Ch. 12)

I don't know when the anti-muggleborn-at-Hogwarts took effect.

Lily didn't go to Hogwarts, instead she went to AIM. Kinda glosses over the fact that she married someone she only saw for 1 hour per year for 7 years... She went, presumably with Snape, to King's Cross earlier than needed for the AIM train.

** I don't like it unfortunately and have given up. Rigel/Harry seems far more like a 30 year old than 11. But the story was original and interesting, at least until the point when I fell out of it.
