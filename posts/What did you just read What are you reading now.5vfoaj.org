I finished off linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9248096/1/De-Aged]])

And I'm on chapter 22 of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7151727/22/The-Magic-Of-Torchwood]]) at the moment. Really enjoying it.

I'd definitely recommend both.

Now if only I could find some good tosh/gwen/jack without anyone else.


** Probably have the most WIP that I've ever followed before. When I was new to FF, I stuck to just the completed works because there was so much out there I had not read I could be picky.

Right now, I always find myself hoping for an update to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-With-Me][Grow Young with Me]]. Probably my favorite OC in all of fan fiction with Abigail Waters, a muggle who develops an interesting relationship with Harry. Really good story. Also following along to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11732213/1/Impose][Impose]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12181042/1/Order-of-Mercy][Order of Mercy]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12201337/1/Red-Sorrow][Red Sorrow]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11936311/1/Child-of-Hogwarts-Part-II-The-Marauder-Legacy][Child of Hogwarts, Part II]]. Most of them are updated fairly frequently, with a few of them on a nearly weekly basis. The only one that is updated slowly is the best one, Grow Young with Me, but I'd recommend you try them all out. FYI- Impose and Child of Hogwarts are sequels to other stories so you should probably find the authors' previous work in the series.

** I'm reading some HP/X-Men crossovers, most of which feature Harry/Gambit smut (Gambit is typically known as the most slashable X-Man and X-Men was the first fandom I got involved with almost 15 years ago). There aren't that many fics with this pairing and they're of questionable quality, but I just like the pairing. Currently reading: linkffn(4561123), which has Weasley and Hermione bashing, Super powerful/smart Harry and all sorts of things that would make me abandon ship immediately, but that pairing tho.

*** That is a super interesting pairing to say the least. I remember reading a fic a long time ago that paired Remy and Bill.

I too got into fan fic about 17 years ago starting with X-men and specifically Gambit slash fics or Romy (Gambit and Rogue 4 evah!). It's nice to see a fellow mutant lover here! Did you ever read any of Lori McDonald's stuff? Her fic literally influenced canon and gave Remy his middle name.

I'd love it if you could link that Bill/Remy fic! I actually have started writing a Charlie/Remy fic, which I might post some day before I die! The problem with these outlier pairings is that you kind of have to take what you can get.

The original five were brought to the future (long story) and young Bobby admits that he likes men. Older Bobby is still struggling though, but it's an interesting dynamic.

  Here's an interesting fact that I just made up. In a strange universe slightly disconnected from this one, Harry Potter was born premature on the 31st of July 1980. In this story, he wasn't. Born 27th of September 1980 this is a Harry Potter with no scar, new classmates, a sinister looking wand, and somehow he's got a strange diary belonging to T. M. Riddle.
