** I maintain my own [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Elaneanasazi][Top 20 list]] (updated fairly recently) on my FFN profile, along with a handful of honorable mentions. I like to think it's a pretty good cross-section of the fandom, though with such a wide landscape it's of course going to be horribly subjective.

It's a good place to start if you're just looking for fics that are good in different ways, and there's no slash. Some of them are less than 20K, but they're excellent in their own ways.

*** I'll tentatively second his list. Not all of the fics are to my liking -- generic stories like C'est La Vie, Hero's Path and Sixth Year are probably good for beginners to HP fanfiction, but if you try them after reading loads of fanfics, you will feel like you've read the same story a thousand times before.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3415504/1/Prodigy][Prodigy]] - AU- Given up after that fateful night, a prodigious Harry Potter ends up in America, working as a Lab Tech/Federal Agent. Now his family wants him back, but can he trust their motives? Can he trust his own? Multi-crossover.

- Very AU, you don't need to know anything about the crossover shows, definitely out there but excellent

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] - So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

- Hilarious and excellent. Fairly compliant with canon

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]] by Jewels5. Although it hasn't been updated in awhile, it's one of the best Marauder-era stories out there. Totally reads like a daytime TV soap opera, and it's about 35 chapters of glorious drama.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] by Stoplight Delight. This is also another Marauder-era fic, but it focuses on the story of young Remus Lupin going to Hogwarts and learning how to make friends.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]] by Inverarity. This is the first book in a series about a young American witch with a dark family secret. Super well written, amazing world, great plot...it's almost as good as the original series, but with a slightly darker plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8255131/1/Ignite][Ignite]] by Slide. Scorpius Malfoy gets stuck in the middle of a horrible tragedy at Hogwarts, and he has to work together with several other people to help save the other students. Has a sequel, addicting plot.

[[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/muggle_index.html][The James Potter Series]] by Norman Lippert. Some guy literally wrote an entire series about James Potter II for his son. They are downloadable in an ebook version, and they even have some illustrations. Almost professional quality.

[[http://shoebox.lomara.org/][Shoebox Project]] by dorkorific and ladyjaida. Oldie but a goodie. One of the first Wolfstar (Remus x Sirius) fics that paved the way for many other Marauder-era stories. Also downloadable. Read it on a plane ride to LeakyCon and while sitting in line at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Very fond memories.

*Ignore the last one since it has slash (it's pretty mild, though, if you were still curious). These are my favorites stories out there. I read mostly canon-compliant, and I prefer long stories with lots of character development.*

** /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]]/ (300k words, last updated 8 days ago): A young wizard from Dungeons & Dragons gets randomly teleported into Hogwarts. How is he /young,/ when D&D wizards are supposed to be /old?/ He's an ultra-munchkin, and continues his munchkinny behavior at Hogwarts--especially since humans don't seem to be able to roll saves against his kind of magic! Starts off like a crack-fic, but gets more serious later on.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3494886][Eden]]/ (300k words, complete): Hermione is abducted and tortured by the Death Eaters, for information on Harry's location. Hermione/Lucius, somehow--I was very surprised to like it.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3784000][The Scarlet Pimpernel]]/ (50k words, complete): Under Umbridge's Ministry, Percy has a change of heart, and is inspired by a Muggle hero to help the Ministry's targets.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771][Partially Kissed Hero]]/ (500k words, last updated 3 years ago): Harry gains all Voldemort's memories and skills when the Dementor on the train shakes loose the Horcrux in his scar. With the help of the Fairy Queen, he then realizes that Dumbledore is evil, and starts fighting him, with the help of Hermione and Luna. (Extremely divisive, but still very fun to read, in my opinion.)

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]/ (600k words, last updated 3 days ago): Harry is a genius, and does various genius things, such as inventing new forms of transfiguration, trying to convert Draco to good, and investigating the nature of magic. (Many people find him to be an insufferable know-it-all; YMMV.) A genius Quirrell (evil or not?) serves as his mentor.
