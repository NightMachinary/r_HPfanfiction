**** I would attribute this to the lack of resolution in the epilogue and the absence of a strong female character (other than Hermione)

Ginny and Harry in my mind do not make any sense ending up together. Harry becoming an Auror after being terrorized by Dark Wizards his whole life? Unlikely.

The Canon Epilogue was not believable hence the need for Daphne. Unfortunately we see her poorly portrayed as A Mary Sue nearly all the time. The lack of creativity leads to the reuse of the same tropes.

******* Except that doesn't make sense, since if the reason why is because Ginny isn't developed enough, then just have a fic where you develop her more. If H/G isn't believable because she isn't developed enough, how does that explain Daphne who isn't developed at all?

Also, H/G makes complete sense for reasons listed many times in many threads. You are correct that she wasn't developed properly since any character development occurred mostly off page. But she was developed. She went from a crush that prevented her from uttering a sentence in front of Harry to being the only one who had the guts to set him straight in OOTP.

There are many issues with how Rowling handled Ginny's character, but I think she clearly showed why they work together as a couple.

******** While it's true Ginny had some development, she went from sticking her elbow in the butter in front of Harry to marrying him a large part of their romance together felt rushed and just didn't fit. Personally I don't like H/G because I just don't think they would work long term. Harry craves normality and acceptance and from what we saw in the book (or maybe just from so much fanfic) Ginny aims to be a professional quidditch player which would make it even harder for Harry to lead an average life. Even so it always felt like Ginny saw the boy who lived instead of Harry, as opposed to Luna, for example, who seemed to understand him a lot better. Luna could relate him to based on past experiences about bullying and losing parental figures and she never treated him differently than others.

There's also the issue that many people just don't like what H/G represents, (would like to clarify that I don't dislike Ginny, just dislike her paired with Harry) H/G is another case of Gryffindors marrying Griffindors and does nothing to redeem Slytherins. Yeah we, the readers, know not all Slytherins are bad but Rowling never really shows this in the book. The best example of a "good" slytherin is Draco's mum when she lies to Voldemort to save Harry. A lot of people would like to see a well developed Slytherin who actually embodies some of the characteristics of Salazar's house; cunning and ambition. Daphne being basically an OC allows people to make their own character with which they can "redeem" Slytherins from just being a bunch of bullying blood purist grunts.

For clarification, do you not like them because it felt rushed or because you don't think they'd work long term? And do you not think they'd work because Rowling didn't develop Ginny well?

If the latter, I find that flawed logic. Rowling's technical skills as a writer have little to do with whether the fictional characters, with the traits they have, would work together.

Thinking H/G was rushed is a legitimate complaint; thinking Ginny could have been developed better as a literary criticism is also completely legitimate. Not preferring H/G because you couldn't connect with their relationship due to literary mistakes is also completely legitimate.

But canonically, they do make sense together, at least as much as any other character, if not moreso. Rowling's technical issues with developing Ginny and her relationship with Harry has no bearing on whether they actually make a good couple. Hell, Rowling could have literally wrote one long paragraph listing Ginny's traits and that in and of itself justifies their pairing as logical, even though as literature it would be crap.

I really disagree on this. Ginny by OOTP (and probably even before that) has a completely different view of Harry. He is not the famous boy she couldn't talk around; he's just Harry. Yes, she still is attracted to the fact he plays the hero. And thats ok! Being heroic is an attractive trait to have. But in OOTP, it was Ginny who broke through to Harry by yelling at him and putting him in his place. If she was still just a fan and only saw him as the boy who lived, she would never have yelled at him like that.

Ginny being a Quidditch star, if anything, helps Harry by taking some of the attention away from him. Let's face it, no matter who he married, he'd always be famous. The only place where he felt normal and not a celebrity was with the Weasleys. So marrying Ginny, and being a part of her family for dinners, birthdays, etc would be the most normal thing he could do in the wizarding world. Harry could not have such a normal life with any other woman since even if she was cool with him as him, her family would need to adjust to being in-laws with Harry Potter.

Luna could've been a good partner, except they simply weren't compatible as more than casual friends. Harry is polite about Luna's eccentricities, but he never embraced them or understood them. She understood a part about Harry since she shared a similar experience, but an actual relationship isn't just based on shared histories, especially a rather morbid and depressing one. It's about who you can have a conversation with, who makes you laugh, who you find attractive, and who shares your values. Can you honestly say Luna checks off even most of those boxes? Certainly Ginny does. Oh, and she has a shared experience with Voldemort.

This does effectively explain why there are so many Harry/Daphne fics. But I personally find it a rather weak reason to dislike H/G because you want to redeem Slytherin.

********** Hmm I think one of my main peeves with H/G is the rushed nature of their romance, my concerns with it working long term honestly stem from my reluctance to believe their relatively short term relationship through 6th year would have held up after the war enough for them to get married afterwards. Looking at it closer I'm not adverse to H/G I just dislike how simplified their relationship is in canon. Your points on Harry and Ginny's relationship working are completely valid, denying that H/G working based on Rowling's development is wrong.

While Ginny being a celebrity would shift some of the fame off Harry I feel it would just make people even more interested in him but that's just my personal thoughts. Your points on Ginny and Harry connecting through their experiences being possessed by Voldermort is good and honestly I would have loved to see this in canon but that's the thing, hardly any of their potential chemistry was explored in book. While some people may prefer this I wanted to see how Ginny and Harry could work out their trauma and past experiences with Voldemort beyond their fast romance of the 6th book. My main problem with H/G isn't that the couldn't work out but rather that what romance were given in book is lacking and the sudden epilogue rushes their relationship even more. Rather than exploring how well the two could have worked together Rowling pushed her generational similarities thing further by having Harry and Ginny marry straight out of school.

Perhaps my griping is expecting too much from what was intended as a children's book but the central characters romance and marriage being, what seems to be, a way for Rowling to show "look another Potter man marrying a redhead Gryffindor" rather than being a well explored relationship of acceptance and love between Harry and Ginny just rubs me the wrong way. The unsatisfactory nature of the epilogue, as well as the multitude of badly written H/G fanfic that I turned towards to find resolution in their romance largely turned me off towards H/G.

Perhaps Harry and Luna wouldn't have worked out in canon but I would have preferred him getting together with someone like Luna who is arguably more character developed, from "loony" and friendless to always being there for Harry and helping end the war in the final battle of Hogwarts. I will admit my love of H/L is largely due to her being one of the few developed potential love interests for Harry and me wondering what could have been, maybe H/G works better maybe H/L does, regardless H/G didn't click for me so I gripe about how H/L could have.

The redeeming slytherins point I feel isn't so much because people dislike H/G but rather because they want a strong slytherin character to be shown, I'm sure many people who read the books resonated with the core ideas of Slytherins house and were annoyed by their lack of representation. Daphne is an easy way to achieve this by essentially making an OC without actually saying its an OC.

*********** I actually agree with a lot of what you're saying. When it was all said and done, I was happy it was H/G because it made sense, but upon numerous other readings and delving into a lot of canon-compliant post-war fics, I too realized that the H/G relationship was really lacking. Not necessarily that it didn't make sense, but that we did go from a few weeks of dating and barely any interactions during that time, to an epilogue where they are married. I believed in them as a couple, but I agree with you that it was important to show more of them together to solidify that with the reader.

It's a shame because not only was Ginny this great untapped resource of juicy character development, but the book was about love. Harry defeated Voldemort because of love, yet Rowling barely showed what would be the biggest source of love in his life, Ginny. Maybe it's a bit corny, but I would've loved a scene where Ginny tells Harry she loves him, which is the first time he ever hears anyone say that to him, and have that play a role in how he defeats Voldemort.

Accidentally calling Ginny "Hermione" would worsen his relationship with Ron for two different reasons, and accidentally calling Ginny "Fleur" would do the same thing to his relationship with Bill.

That's the problem with Harry and Ginny ever having a fight (not just over this, but over anything): it would cause a giant rift in the family, with some members and in-laws stepping in to defend Ginny and others taking Harry's side. Arthur would try to get everyone to stop fighting, and Bill (assuming he hadn't already picked a side) would be the cool-headed negotiator who finally brought everyone to the same table to talk it out.

I don't think Bill would be particularly threatened by the idea of Harry fantasying about Fleur. I imagine Fleur would be much more put out because of the strain it would put on any kind of peace between her and Ginny, which could lead to Bill getting dragged into it.

I agree that Ron would probably lose his shit at Harry if he called Ginny "Hermione". Hermione would try to convince him it's not important and then Ron would lose it at her too and oh god Harry what have you done you fucking nonce this family is so incestuous get outttt
