I would just love some fics where Harry is raised lovingly and well adjusted, and how that affects plot. I adored Meaning of Mistletoe, and blasted through the You're a Parent, Severus series. I have a soft spot for reformed!Snape but Harry raised happily by anyone would be fantastic. I also liked the Initiate (i think was the title) where Sirius "kidnapped" and raised Harry when he was a young kid but not a baby.

Slash and genderbending is fine with me, but no Weasley/ Hermione bashing please.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]]: Harry is blind, and Dursleys are good. But he can't go to Hogwarts, and grows up to become a mad scientist.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]: James and Lily got Voldemort that night with a nasty trap and some luck. They burnt down their own house, faked their deaths, and fled Britain for continental Europe. But being raised by his own loving parents doesn't mean Harry will turn out to be a nice guy. Dark war epic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]]: Sirius raised Harry and he never went to Hogwarts. After the war, he hires Ginny to accompany him on some adventures.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]]: Harry was raised by his loving and very capable aunt Petunia Evans, who along with Sirius, Bill, and Fleur, did the heavy lifting against Voldemort. This Harry thus could actually enjoy his childhood and school life, and is already a confident young man at age 11.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13786171/1/Stranded][Stranded]]: Peter is a double agent and lured Voldemort into a death trap on Halloween 1981. Harry grew up under his loving parent's care, but doesn't like Hermione at all, until they are both trapped in a mysterious location through a Portkey accident.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]]: Gilderoy Lockhard found and raised Harry to become a cunning memory charm specialist. Together they completely changed the plot.

  All it takes to make all the difference in the world is for one person to care for another. Baby Harry Potter found caring in the most unexpected of places.Dumbledore/Weasley bashing, Bad Language, Violence, Sex.

  AU with canon themes/happenings as we go along. Begins in late 1979 and will progress through the "HP era." A series of impulsive decisions by Sirius leaves Harry raised by a different family. How will the repercussions of those events echo through the established narrative?
