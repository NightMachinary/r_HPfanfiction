Hello all,

Some of you may know me as the author of /'Honour Thy Blood',/ /'Stepping Back'/ and more recently; /'A Flower for the Soul'./

Well, I have begun hosting a weekly podcast around fanfiction/writing where I host some of the best creators of HP fanfiction. On the show, we discuss their works, answer fan questions and a plethora of other things all fanfiction and HP related.

So far, I have hosted the following:

- Darkness Enthroned - 'A Cadmean Victory'\\
- ACI100 - 'Ashes of Chaos'\\
- James Spookie - 'The Legacy Preservation Act'

Being posted in the coming weeks are shows with;

- Teufel1987 - 'Rise of the Wizards\\
- TheEndless7 - 'Letters'\\
- CatsAreCool - ' A Marauder's Plan\\
- Rorschach's Blot - 'Lord of Caer Azkaban\\
- Zaxaramas - Barefoot

And many more to be confirmed.

If this is something that may interest you, please do drop by my patreon page and check it out. (There is always a show completely free to listen to).
