So, in 2nd year, Ginny had the diary and was exposed to what everyone agrees is the most charismatic version of Riddle.

What if she became obsessed with him afterwards? After all, he showed her understanding and acceptance, and she only has the word of others of what actually happened. It wouldn't be a stretch of the imagination for a traumatized and confused pre-teen to build it up in her head that Tom Riddle, aka Voldemort, was her soulmate.

Of course, she'd be keeping her true feelings hidden, probably by laying low like she did in canon. In 5th year, it would make her stand out more an draw unwanted attention if she refused to join the DA, so she joins. Given that she's probably talented, she'd rise to the top of the DA and get recruited to go to the DoM like in canon.

What happens when the group of 6 has an Voldemort obsessed traitor in it when Voldemort shows up?

Well, to get this cleared up. Nobody got recruited. They all went with Harry against his will.

For the premise: I like it. Maybe the possession fucked her up big time. Maybe (and I think this is one I already read somewhere) the process of Riddles Resurrection is completed and Ginny's body is Riddles new one. Having Ginny as a traitor for these reasons is pretty interesting.

If Riddle truly took over Ginny and assumed her form, don't you think Ginnymort would do everything to sabotage the real Voldemort, such as in *Seventh Horcrux* or *A Black Comedy*, linkffn(10677106;3401052)?

**** I really like this idea. A more assertive Ginny ingratiates herself with Harry after 2nd year and starts influencing him. This would work best with large divergence. Come the end of PoA Harry kills Wormtail, Voldemort keeps chilling in the woods for another decade while Harry and Ginny graduate and do their thing.

***** i was thinking more about 5th year. when he starts getting angry, and she decides to liberate him from all the hassle of not just killing snape, or something. showing him he's not as nice as he thinks he is. he's all in charge and charismatic with the da, and ends up starting his own death-eater like recruitments.
