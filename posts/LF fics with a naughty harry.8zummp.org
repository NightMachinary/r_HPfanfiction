Im looking for fics where Harry has glasses/contacts that can see through clothing, and where he abuses that ability to peek at all the girls.


** I'm sure you've read this, but there's exactly that in linkffn(A Black Comedy). Both Harry and Sirius are seriously perverted in this fic.

*** Ohh i know how awful this would be in real life! But i can read this and also remember that i am reading about fictional characters, in a fictional setting, and it doesn't really compare with real life. Its not like we are reading about real people ;)
