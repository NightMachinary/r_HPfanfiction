Hello and please yes read the title! :) Also I made a link! Okay so this is one of my other stories on my computer that I have decided to /upload to my/ Quotev! It is an Elsewhere story, which means it is set in the Harry Potter world but it is about entirely original characters in an entirely original story of their own! It is about their lives and has no connections to Harry's or Dumbledore's or anyone, and no one will make any appearance in it except mentions and maybe /cameos/ on newspapers. It is like Fantastic Beasts movie! It takes place during the ten years between 1981 and 1991, between the prologue and the real start of Philosopher's Stone. It explores the peace and aftermath of the first war, and how my main characters and their families deal with it and learn to move forward. :) Please I would love it if you could all look at it and maybe comment? Thank you!


** If you want to maximise your readership (and I presume you do, given that you are self-promoting) your best bet would be to upload it to an accepted and widely-used fanfiction site.

*** No they are supposed to be there, at least at first. It is third person /limited/, so I am trying to /reflect/ how everything is so confusing and /uncertain/ inside the character's head and on the outside as well.

** Not bad at all! Much more /adult/ than I expected, maybe you should put a warning at the beginning that it includes dark themes like sexual assault. But aside from a couple of typos, well done!

I concur with other people's recommendation: you should also post your story on fanfiction.net or on Archive of Our Own, it will give it a lot more readership.

*** Thank you Achille. Yes, the situation my main characters are dealing with is something I decided to make for them because the war was adult, and how people would feel and what they would do after would be adult, and JK Rowling was never interested in showing the /adult/ of things like Imperius and nonconsent, or the actual war effects, or complicated situations where maybe no one is really right or really wrong. But I want to show it how it really would have been in our world, like any of /our/ wars. It is real, sick, and confusing, and horrific. And I want to go into that. But, I also decided to write this situation for them specifically because I've been sexually assaulted before. Too many times, over years. And it was all so confusing in my head, all the time, even without magical mind control. And I wanted that to reflect in Josephine's head. That's why there are so many elipses and question marks and things. I wanted to show how confused and frustrated she is about herself and the situation. Thank you Achille and others, I will think about uploading it to another site instead of Quotev. But I really love Quotev, it is simple and cute and easy to use. Are fanfiction.net and Archive easy to use too?

**** FanFiction.net is easy to use. After creating an account and confirming it via e-mail, you can upload documents on the Doc Manager (under the Publish menu). Then you can edit it and then post it. (This is all explained on the site, of course, in greater detail.) I can't say much about Archive of Our Own as I've never used it before.

**** Oh. You have all my sympathy for what you went through!

Fanfiction.net is probably a bit harder to use but I could give you directions. The Archive is easier to use but at the moment it's very hard to register there, so you might have to wait. Also, no one's asking you to take the story /off/ Quotev, just to cross-post it elsewhere as well.

***** Thank you Achille friend. Oh. And okay, thank you, I did not think about posting it in different places at the same time! I will try Archive first and then Fanfiction.net. :)

******** In theory, Archive of Our Own has a better system. However, it's somewhat less reputable, since it doesn't ban lemons and is very much sorted by ships. There are certainly more good stories on fanfiction.net. Really, the best is to post in both places.
