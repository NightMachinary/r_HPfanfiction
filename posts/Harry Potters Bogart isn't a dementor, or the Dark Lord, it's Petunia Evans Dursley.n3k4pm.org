** That sounds like an interesting lead-in for a Severitus story. Snape has to sub in for Lupin because it's near a full moon, he just reads off the notes while sniping at people and docking points because he doesn't want to be here and can't teach any of the things he wants to or feels they should know.

Harry's turn comes up and Snape decides to let it happen. Lupin and Dumbledore both warned him that his boggart would almost certainly be Voldemort, so he should intervene and stop it from happening. But Snape didn't even want to be here in the first place, and after listening to Lavender Brown titter with Parvati about who has the best or most gossip-worthy fear, and having to put up with Granger bouncing up and down with her hand in the air, he decides fuck it. Let the stupid children see Voldemort. Maybe they'll wise up.

But what steps out of that closet isn't the dark lord. It's somebody ELSE that Snape recognizes.

It's Petunia Evans. Little Tuny.

With a frying pan. She has a frying pan, in her hand. And she starts going after Harry while calling him a freak.

And Severus Snape's neat little world of black and white grudges and debts crumbles to dust beneath his feet.

** Yes, the argument can be made that Petunia was actually worse to Harry than Vernon (and she was actually the blood relative, not him). And although I love her redemption stories, is it just a common misandry, that most such stories describe her as half-victim herself, when the books are rather clear that she was the one who instigated Harry's abuse?

*** I would say Petunia is the worst of them all due to one single fact.

She is the core source of the hatred against Harry. It is her hatred for all magic that spread to Vernon and Dudley and her hatred for Harry that spread to Marge. After all, she is the only one that knew of magic. No way Vernon could have hated it before he knew it even existed.\\
I am 100 % willing to bet she filled Vernon's head with poisonous ideas of what wizards are like and what magic is like, giving him a completely fucked up view on the whole thing, and then proceeding encounters with magic users only reinforced that idea (Dudley getting a pig-tail, getting shouted at through the phone, the stamps, his living room getting nearly destroyed in book 4.)

Maybe if Vernon had a better, and more neutral, introduction to magic and less unfortunate encounters with magical users afterwards, he would not have been as awful. Still bad as he is naturally judgemental towards anyone 'not normal', but maybe less so.

**** I'm not sure if it's canon or fanon, but there was also some trouble with James Potter during the wedding (I would like to say it was Petunia's wedding, not Lily's, but I'm not sure). It was probably the first real experience that Vernon had with wizards and it did not go well, so it only helped Petunia's narrative.

***** I don't think Petunia attended their wedding and the fandom wiki supports that statement.

[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wedding_of_James_Potter_I_and_Lily_Evans#Wedding]]

A bit unreliable source but it tends to be decently accurate IMO.

****** Yeah that's what I thought. According to the same source (and I agree that it's not exactly reliable) it was when Lily and James were attending Petunia&Vernon's wedding. Or more specifically, when those two couples first met. (I quickly skimmed Petunia's wikia page)

I cannot agree here: what we don't understand, we fear, what we fear, we hate, what we hate, we want to destroy. Of course, he was informed about magic by Petunia, but otherwise he could very well manage to want to destroy Harry's magic all on his own.

***** except that is by far not the case.

Do you understand how every electronic device works in your home, to the point where you can explain it accurately? Do you want to destroy electronic devices you do not understand?

And as said, he would still not like it, but that is more due to him wanting to be 'normal' rather than some idea that 'lack of understanding = hate'

As anybody who ever tried to write a story, where Dursleys exist, can tell you, there is just crazily little about who Dursleys truly are. We have just absolutely unbelievable caricature of three human beings as viewed through eyes of very angry (rightfully) abused teenager, and that's it (films are even worse). For any attempt to write a story with them as real characters, you need to add a lot of character to them. That doesn't mean justifying them, they can be as horrible people as you wish, but making them more realistic and less caricature.

Big statements like this and generally deciding who is the source of what are mostly just projection of your own opinions on these caricatures.
