** "What do you mean they are fighting with me as the prize?" Harry asked wide eyed.

"Just that Mr Potter. The one who wins gets to bond with you." McGonagall replied sternly.

"What does that even mean?" Harry asked dumstruck.

"What part of my answer are you confused by?" McGonagall snapped.

"The bond part? The prize part? Everything?" Harry was starting to panic. He had a feeling this was going to be the worst year so far.

"It means.. perhaps you could visit me after dinner so that we can discuss this."

Harry walked out of the class in a daze. He really needed to get out of this.. whatever it was. He must be drunk. Seamus has always tried to convince him to take a sip. He must have finally relented and this was all some alcohol induced nightmare. Yeah that is it. He is just dreaming.

*** "Sirius, please," Harry pleaded. "How do I get these veela off my back?"

"Well... There is a way. Are you sure, though?" Sirius stared off into the distance. "They're /veela/. Damn, but I wish I had your problem."

"Positive. Please, you're my last hope. The professors are just telling me to bond with whoever is the winner."

Sirius sighed. "Right. So here's what you do. Once she throws herself at you, you lean real close to whisper into her ear."

Harry bobbed his head. "And?"

"And you say 'Begone, thot!', turn three hundred and sixty degrees, and moonwalk way."

** Guilty pleasure read this would be, heh.

Three old prompts of mine may also be relevant/salvageable here:

#1: You know, in the few, non-slash veela-centric fics I've seen, I've never seen one where /Fleur/ is the relatively sane one, and all her family/extended family/other veela like the Mascots are utterly batshit insane.

I noticed one on FFn ("Wait, what?"), but the execution was pretty poor and the concept of batshit veela lightly touched on.

#2: Harry makes a joke that veela must be like swans or geese: proud and utterly nuts when aggravated. (You ever seen a geese or swan attack? Those bitches be crazy and can seriously hurt you!).

Fleur wonders how Harry worked out/discovered her species' true origins, which is kept as a well-protected secret: they're not descendant from a race of proud mountain nymphs, but are the results of an ancient, Quintaped-like Transfiguration experiment involving swans.

Her grandmother orders her to watch Harry, to prevent the secret from spreading.

#3: Veela aren't considered Dark Creatures because they can make men be foolish or become vicious hell-harpies that sling fire... they're Dark Creatures because they're like yandere/tsundere Animaniacs!

Fortunately, only being 1/4th veela means Fleur and Gabrielle are considered eccentric, not insane.

--

After seeing the veela at the Cup, Harry develops a healthy amount of caution and a bit of unease about them. Time moves on.

Fleur accidentally lets it out that Harry is mostly immune to a veela's aura to her family (maybe Gabrielle in a letter), and what little susceptibility he has is rapidly diminishing, it spreads like wildfire amongst Fleur's extended family and friends.

Unsurprisingly, women with such... circumstances seek men with whom they can have actual conversations with.

Next thing he knows, a lot of Fleur's relations and friends increasingly appear over the course of the Tournament, and try to set him up with relations close to his age.

Unfortunately for Fleur, her mother and her sister are fully on board with trying to set the two of them up. And she has to deal with cousins and family friends trying to "poach" him.

*** Horrible mental imagery of the Bulgarian mascots stopping mid-dance, sniffing the air, and then looking directly up at the top box.

Cue everyone but a confused Harry and a paralyzed-with-fear Arthur bailing out in a blink of an eye.

"Uh." Harry slowly moved over to the Minister's vacant seat and, surely enough, the veelas' eyes followed him from left to right as one. "That's... odd."

He tore his eyes away from the omnioculars, blinking owlishly as his eyes readjusted from the strain.

One of the veela, a slim, pretty red-head, smiled up at him, not that he could see it; her teammate, a dark-haired beauty with intense blue eyes, scowled at her and promptly shoved her away, sending her careening to the muddied ground.

She was promptly jumped on from behind by a particularly lithe blonde, and before anyone could blink a vicious brawl had broken out.

"What's going on, Mr Weasley?" He blinked and looked around. "Mr Weasley?"

Arthur Weasley's seat was vacant.

--

"Veela, Lucius!" said one of his Masked associates. "Veela! *Angry* veela!" He cradled his burned hand to his chest, his charred fingers still holding tightly onto what was once his wand.

"No names, you fool!" Lucius gestured wildly to the outside. "And how was I supposed to know that the Bulgarian mascots would be prowling around at this time of night!"

The second Death Eater made a sneering sound from the back of his throat and took a step forwards...

The wall of the tent they'd sought refuge in began to smoke and smolder: a perfect hole burned its way into existence, and the visage of an avian demoness came into view, the contours and highlights of her face lit up by the fire wreathing in her clawed hands.

Her cold, inhuman eyes blinked once, and she /snarled/.

** Fleur had done it. She had been named the winner of the One Wizard, Many Witches tournament, and her prize, one allure-immune Harry Potter, was right there ready for the taking. None of the others would dare challenge her right to him now, not after the performance she had displayed. It had taken every ounce her magic will and stubborn ferocity but eventually, the other girls of Beauxbatons had fallen beneath her.

Now it was time for her to collect.

Fleur gracefully marched up to the Gryffindor, who now looked very nervous. She couldn't help the satisfied smile that twisted her lips. Oh, the fun she would have with him.

"'Arry Potter?" she announced, knowing fully well who he was and why she was here.

"Yes?" the young boy asked as if she was about to bite his head off.

"I 'ave 'eard zere eez tradition in 'Ogwarts, that ze boys take zere dates to ze 'Ogsmeade," she enquired knowingly. The boy's face flushed.

"Yeah, some do," he stammered.

"Oui?" Fleur sung. "Zere is un weekend very soon, oui? And you will be zere, non?"

"Yes, I will."

"Tres bien," she smiled radiantly. "You may pick me up at 10 o' clock from ze Beauxba-"

"But not with you."

Fleur stopped, glancing at the boy, as if she had misheard him.

"Not wiz me?" she repeated. "Zen wiz 'o?"

"Harry!" she heard someone shout from the other side of the hallway.

The moment the sound reached them, Harry's face lit up. His eyes were sparkling like the night sky had its home within them and his smile stretched across his face. He looked like a completely different person; had she not been talking to him moments ago, Fleur would almost have failed to recognise him.

A large mass of brown, frizzy hair came rushing past Fleur's side and latching onto Harry's arm.

"Harry, we're going to be late," she insisted. "Do hurry up."

"Hermione," Harry doted, rolling his eyes, "its history of magic. I doubt Binns will notice if I'm there or not."

"But I will," the girl replied firmly, "and if you think I'm going to let you skip lessons, you're sorely mistaken."

"Alright, alright," Harry conceded. "Just give me a few minutes, okay? I promise I'll be there."

"Thank you," and with that the girl planted a small kiss on his cheek. Fleur could only stand there, awkwardly watching the two teens ignore her, and for the first time in her life she suddenly knew what the term 'third wheel' meant.

"Though I'm not promising I won't fall asleep half way through the lesson," he added with a grin. The girl merely slapped gently on the shoulder, not even trying to hide her grin as turned and headed for her lesson, leaving Harry and Fleur alone once again. Except, now, Fleur was far less sure of herself.

"You are going wiz 'er?" she asked, although she was already mostly sure of the answer. Her thoughts were only confirmed when Harry nodded. "You picked' er. Over a veela? Over me?"

"You say that as if you were ever part of the decision," Harry replied with all the warmth of winter.

Fleur flinched.

"But... 'Arry, I fought for you. I beat everyone else, for you."

"And yet until two minutes ago you and I had never said five words to each other." Harry sighed, fiddling with the strap of his schoolbag. "You know how much my life has sucked since this stupid tournament began? All the lads in my house were jealous of me, all the time. Those who weren't would just stare at me, for no reason. No one wanted to be my friend anymore. My best friend refused to talk to me because he was so jealous. And then there were all these girls who did nothing but try to get my attention, to the point where I barely felt like a person anymore.

"Hermione...she was the only one who actually talked to me. She was only person I could rely on to treat me like a regular person. All those people fighting over who loved me the most, and yet none of them actually helped me like Hermione did. She stayed by me, and eventually... I grew to really like her. I asked her out about a month ago and she said yes. If you had actually paid attention to me, you would have known that."

Fleur could only stand and stare, suddenly feeling very ashamed of herself. Looking back, she realised just how ridiculous she had been (how ridulous they had all been). Combing through he head, she tried to remember. All that she knew about Harry Potter... And came up blank. She he had an owl, that she didn't know the name of. She knew that he beat Voldemort... 13 years ago. And she knew he was immune to her allure. And that was it. Looking back, she had barely even noticed that brown haired girl before, the one that was almost always with him. She didn't even know her name. But now she did. Hermione. Harry and Hermione.

The Gryffindor boy sighed, his jaw tightening in irritation.

"But no," he shook his head. "Guess I was only ever a prize for you, wasn't I?"

He turned to leave, when Fleur gently placed a hand on his shoulder.

"Wait."

He did stop, but his gaze was kept firmly on the far end of the school corridor, away from her. Fleur knew that his patience was running out.

"I... I'm sorry," she said earnestly, her shield of haughty aloofness completely gone. "I know what eet feels like, to be surrounded by people who stare at you like zat. To lose friends to jealousy. 'Ow no one treats you like a person. That eez my life, 'Arry, the life of so many Veela, like me. Ze Allure... makes eet so. You do not know - well, now you probably do - what we would give to 'ave a lover who sees us a person, and not something to be won or conquered. We would kill for zat. So when I 'eard zat you were immune to ze allure, we saw zat chance and... I never realised that we were merely passing zat pain on to you."

She let go of Harry's arm, half expecting him to run once she did, but to her surprise he stayed rooted to the spot. His anger wasn't entirely gone, but it had eased a little.

"I weel tell zem to leave you alone," she promised. "And... I weel never speak to you again, if zat eez what you want."

"Fleur," she heard Harry call as she was about to leave. He turned to her, facing her, looking her dead in the eye. "Look, me and Hermione are going to Hogsmeade next weekend, together, on a date. But... If you behave, if you would like to... Maybe I can convince Hermione to let you come along too. As a friend."

Fleur gazed at the boy - Harry, she reminded herself, Harry - as if he had grown a second head.

"You would do zat for me?" she asked, dumbfounded. "After all I did?"

"You apologised," Harry pointed out. "No one else has done that. And... hearing what you said about the Allure, I can almost understand what you all went crazy. Guess we both know what it feels like to be lonely. And like you said, I don't want to pass that pain onto someone else. So, coming?"

Fleur shook herself, readjusting herself into her natural, tall posture.

"Oui," she replied, her confidence slightly restored.

Harry smiled at her, less vibrant than the one he had worn when Hermione was around, but still warm and welcoming either way.

"Then I'll see you then."

With that, he jogged down the hall, leaving Fleur to her thoughts.

What a strange boy, she pondered. A strange boy indeed.

Hermione was lucky to have him.

For now.

Why do all the people writing French people trying to speak English do this? "me" is literally among the simplest words to remember; there is no chance for anyone to not be able to say "me" and saying "moi" instead when they are so close.

There are plenty of other more complicated words that a French would have problem with or some that have not the same meaning in French as in English despite being written the same (e.g. sensible).
