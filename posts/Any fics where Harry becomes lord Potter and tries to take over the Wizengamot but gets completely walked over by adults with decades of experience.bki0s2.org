As fun as it is reading about Lord Potter-Black owning Dumbledore/Fudge/Malfoy I'm in the mood for seeing something a little more realistic. He doesn't have to stay on the back foot, he can catch up and learn but I'd like see him suffer loses of some importance.


** I've always wanted to see this but I don't think it exists. The problem is that the kind of author who is inclined to have Harry face genuine conflict is not the kind of author to write a Lord Potter fic in the first place.

It's probably best as a one shot as it's little more than a meta-fanfic joke.

  When Harry needs Daphne to tutor him so he won't make a fool of himself in the Wizengamot, she suggests a very unique method of compensation.

**** I think 100 pages is enough benefit of the doubt for a reader to give to an author. It reminded me of the Enid Blyton novels I enjoyed as a kid, /The Secret Seven/ and /The Famous Five,/ Even /Malory Towers/ reminds me of Hogwarts, great for that age, not my taste any more. Weird though that I enjoy a lot of fanfic though.

Still, thanks for the tip. The movie was my favourite.
