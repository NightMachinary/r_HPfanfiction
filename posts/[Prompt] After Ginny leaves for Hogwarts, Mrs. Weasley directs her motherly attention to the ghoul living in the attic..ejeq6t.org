** There's a bit of ghoul and family interaction in linkffn(Percy take the wheel), but the fic is very "artsy" in its writing. I couldn't stand it personally.

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

**** The entire chronology is very disconnected and episodic, and much of the dialogue is done minimalistically, which reminds me of both action movie one-liners and old Noir films.

Second, the people are widely OOC, and the Author didn't really convince me with his justifications. For example, I just don't see the entire family become actively hostile to one another.

Third, nothing seems to really matter - the aforementioned hostility is gone when the author wants to use the normal family dynamic, and there when he wants to be a little edgy.

The magic itself doesn't make sense, too; it's revealed that Molly died because she used "hedge magic" to place her own life before that of her family, accomplished through a magical setup in her kitchen. Percy uses this setup, without knowing about it or the magic it's based on to much greater effect. It lacks internal consistency, the effect should have been MUCH stronger for Molly's act, done willfully and as the creator of the setup, as well as the emotional component of her protecting her own family, and still, Arthur is grievously injured and in a coma.

The plot itself doesn't make much sense, too. Much of canon is diverted for the prose's sake, like Dumbledore not doing anything, Harry and Hermione not doing anything, no authority doing anything, and so on. The whole "Us against the world" rests on a flawed concept that destroys any suspension of disbelief.
