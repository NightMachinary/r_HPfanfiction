Ok, I just read a couple of re-do fics where Harry travels back the the first year with all of his knowledge and powers intact, but everything proceeds almost exactly the same as canon because he wants to "preserve the timeline" (i.e. The author didn't have the brains or balls to come up with original plot).

So, any fics where super! Or re-do! Harry defeat Voldemort significantly earlier than canon.


** *We are the Golden Trio!*, linkffn(7405516), must hold the record time in defeating Voldemort.

*Harry Potter and the Gift of Time*, linkffn(6386016), finishes him off at the end of first year.

*Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059), deals with Voldemort early, but Harry wasn't done at that point.

*A Second Chance* and *Oh God Not Again!*, linkffn(5251301;4536005), have Voldemort terminated in the Graveyard.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** Any time we're talking Re-Do fics, i feel like Backwards With a Purpose has to be mentioned. Single best fic i've ever read period. It technically doesn't meet what you say because they don't do it fast, but they (being Harry and co) go pretty far out of their way to make sure that Voldemorts resurrection at the Graveyard at the end of 4 happens, and despite some key events happening at the same time everything was NOT "almost exactly the same as canon". Definitely give it a read. It's sequel is worth looking at too, but it A) won't make any sense without reading the first as well as B) kind of ruining some of the twists in the latter half so don't even glance at a summary till you finish Part 1.

** Harry was helpless, Voldemort raised his wand swiftly "Avada Kedavr-", He was interrupted, "Finite Incantatum!" Albus Dumbledore stepped into sight "Immobulus", He shouted. The wizard's wand was still pointing at the stunned figure, he saw Lily's body, then saw Harry, The orphaned child, still smiling, oblivious of what has happened. "No... more" Dumbledore croaked, looking back to Voldemort. "Avada Kedavra."
