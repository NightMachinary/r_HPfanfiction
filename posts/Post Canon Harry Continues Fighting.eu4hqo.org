Often times you see Harry Potter stories where he defeats Voldemort and or Dumbledore and retires to a beach OR he lives a normal life as a Auror. What I'm looking for is Harry's Adventures continuing, Dragging him to different places and fighting new villains. It can be super Harry fighting DMC Demons along side Dante or In the Midst of Underworld's Vampire VS Lycan War or goes off to fight more dark wizards around the world. I'm looking for stories that just have Harry continuing his ways. Not necessarily universal jumps (although that's OK) I'm looking for it being more Harry is just an guy in the thick of it

  Newt/Harry, Timetravel Shenanigans, Canon Divergent. His plan was to avoid changing the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist if the opportunity presented itself. So he fled to Africa, where opportunity found him instead.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** There was a Harry/Gabriel fic it was just a very long one shot where Harry ends up travelling the world fighting darkness He ends up everywhere but is slowly losing touch with the world not like going insane just everybody else has “normal” lives with families and he is still fighting for a long time it ends on a happier note not going to spoil it

  Seven years after the fall of Voldemort Harry doesn't know what to do with his life. His love life, and everything else, is an absolute mess. Everyone around him seems to be moving ahead with their lives but he isn't moving. Eventually he finds someone to remind him of things he has forgotten and things he treasures. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.
