:END:
Okay so it's a very mixed time line (marauders, and the golden trio era kids are there as well as Tom being a teacher) and Harry is in Ravenclaw and has a writing contest. In this he's seen as really shy so everyone submits a erotic story, but then Harry humiliates then by reading them out loud fine and sending them to parents. James challengers him, he gets sorted again (into Slytherin)... and Tom gets a boner from Harry humiliating his classmates lmao

  7th Year Gryffs learn why it is never a good idea to piss off their favorite victim, shy Ravenclaw Hadrian Morgan. The orphan's payback during Professor Slytherin's class is BEAUTIFUL & piques the interest & libido of the Lord Marvolo Slytherin, who courts him with the aid of most of the School. But just how naive is Hadrian Morgan, really? TMR/HP Slash OOC AU
