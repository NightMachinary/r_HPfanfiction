For a bit of background, my fic is called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28119780/chapters/68898909][Hbi Hr At]] and it's where Harry and Theo, who have been Auror partners for three years after the Battle of Hogwarts, are sent back in time to their eleven-year-old bodies by an old Egyptian ritual on accident (on their part, anyway).

I just posted the chapter where Harry gets to Hogwarts and I'm currently the chapter where Harry is sitting with the Slytherin first years and they're talking about how all of the pureblood children more or less know one another.

#+begin_quote
  No one introduced themselves to each other, just to him, and Harry commented, "You all know one another, don't you?"

  Draco took the lead, nodding. "All of the old pureblood families know each other," he said. "Our families used to set up 'play dates' for us to get to know each other."

  Harry raised a brow. "Play dates?"

  "Oh, you know," Blaise jumped in, "*insert text here*. It's a way for our parents to set us up to get to know each other young."

  Harry stared at Blaise. He knew that some of the more traditional pureblood families formed marriage contracts between their children but he didn't know how Blaise was so, well, blase about it.
#+end_quote

I want Blaise to mention about how the play dates are an excuse for their parents to set one another up, for them to get to know one another, for them to brag about who knows the most magic, and that sort of thing. I just can't figure out a way to write it. I was considering something in a list form like "playing, trying not to kill one another, bragging," but obviously not that. Just in that sort of style.

Can anyone help?


** Ugh I feel so bad. This is almost word for word my own fic. I used tea parties.

** Maybe more like, "The people who run society are all closely linked, and it's best to get started networking early."

That's poorly matched to an eleven-year-old, I think, but might illustrate a different way of putting it that you might want to consider.
