Exactly as the title says. The consensus is that Voldemort is probably asexual and manipulated others with his charm despite his disgust with humans. However, there's a glut of sexy school days Tom Riddle justified by teenage hormones and a pre-Horcrux body. And there's a decent amount of fics where he's active with his born again body. One of the symptoms for diagnosing sociopathy is a high sex drive, so it's not out of the realm of possibility that he would be sexually active in his normal body. I know of a few, like Three Years, but I'd like to see any suggestions.


** Time travel makes this one an AU. It's the best Tom/Lavender story I've ever read.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

** You might enjoy the fics written by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Atypical16/pseuds/Atypical16/works?fandom_id=136512][Atypical16]]. They have many short smutty fics with similar themes set during the same time period, but personally I prefer their longer fics which have a strong plot and surprisingly well-written OCs.

Of their stories, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9559742/chapters/21614084][Recipe for Disaster]] is my favorite. It's a point-of-divergence fic that picks up in 1947 after Dumbledore has been assassinated by a few remaining Grindelwald loyalists in Britain.

linkao3(9559742)

Without Dumbledore's influence, Tom Riddle manages to secure a teaching position in Hogwarts fresh after graduation. Meanwhile, the sister of Dumbledore's assassin tries to cope with grief over her brother's death and the infamy that has been thrust upon her family.

What I love about this fic is that it's not a stereotypical 'OC turns bad-boy good through the power of love' story. Instead, it's a believable progression of how prejudice and bitterness can ruin a person's life as well as lives of the people arround them.

  Welcome to 1947: Gellert Grindelwald has been defeated, Albus Dumbledore is dead, and Tom Riddle is hired for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post at Hogwarts. It all goes downhill from there.
