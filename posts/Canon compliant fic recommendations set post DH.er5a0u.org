It's been a very long time since I read any fanfiction but I have that itch again and really want to read a few, unfortunately I'm really struggling to find anything I'm interested in reading, so I thought I'd come here for help. I've got a few requirements and preferences for them as follows:

Requirements: - Canon compliant, as I said in the title. (Although I'm willing to be flexible if events in the story contradict the canon epilogue) - Canon pairings - Set either immediately after the battle of Hogwarts or at least within the first couple of years following the battle. - Must be complete

Preferences: - Well written and with a reasonably similar tone to the actual novels, I want to feel as much like I'm reading the 8th Harry Potter novel as I can. - Told from Harry's perspective, although I don't mind stories told from multiple perspectives as long as Harry's is still prominent. - Long form, it doesn't have to be enormous but still a decent length. - A distinct lack of Americanisations, I don't need it to be written by a british author, but I at least need it to sound like it could have been. (It can really ruin my immersion in the story when there's an abundance of american terms and tropes but I can deal with it if everything else is good) - Preferably something that's a mix of Mystery, Drama, Romance, Angst and Humour but I don't mind any of those being more prevalent than the others. - Mature themes are fine and smut is totally acceptable as long as there's more to the story than that. - Preferably no OC characters in major roles (other than as antagonists) - A focus on Harry and Ginny's relationship, it doesn't have to be the major focus of the plot but I'd like it to be reasonably prevalent.

I feel like I might be asking a little much with those lists but I've read plenty of stories like that before (and would be happy to read them again if I get recommended them - I don't really remember what any of them were called so can't look them up myself) but I'm really struggling to find any like that digging through the sheer abundance of fics out there.

If you know of any that meet those requirements and all or most of my preferences, please let me know.

Thank you in advance to anyone who is able to help out :)


** Look for Northumbrian on fan fiction.net. It's a whole set of fics that are a continuation of canon. Start with Grave Days.

** FloreatCastellum is the only canon compliant author I unreservedly recommend.

Northumbrian's pretty good but I feel like they didn't get the main characters. Their Luna, Lavender, and OCs are great and the stories are great but I just couldn't jibe with their HHrR and found myself skimming when they were given focus.

** Northumbrian has a lot of stories, like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1623053/chapters/3460562][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] that fit all your requirements and most of your preferences. The POV character is an OC, but she's observing canon-compliant Harry and Ginny.

** Floreatcastellum (note: she has more stuff posted on AO3 than on ff.net, and a huge amount of extra stuff on her Tumblr).

Northumbrian.
