So I am currently planning out a fanfic that will feature goblins quite heavily in the first couple of chapters. I keep seeing people refer to overused goblin tropes or ‚Äúgoblin-wank‚Äù in comments and posts on here, but I don't actually know what everyone refers to, as I haven't really come across any goblin centric fics that I've read. My fic will stay take the canon as law, and whatever I decide to embellish on will be based on the books.

So my question is - what should I avoid? What is it that everyone dislikes? What is overused? How would you prefer goblins being portrayed?


** It mostly all comes to "We could easily solve all of your problems if you had just thought to ask (and gave us a bunch of money)." Usually that manifests as the goblins being able to easily detect and remove the horcrux from Harry's scar, but immediately running off to destroy the cup horcrux and take away all the money from all the Death Eaters is pretty common too.

The entire concept of "goblin friends" is awful, especially when all you have to do to become one is behave like a decent person and remember Griphook's name.

And while it's only tangentially related, Gringotts handing out inheritance tests to anyone who wants a huge pile of money and some cool new superpowers is also a terrible cliche that needs to die in an incredibly painful fire.

**** I don't believe you really have to adhere to canon. In general I believe it's better for things overall to make sense. A bit further down in the comments somebody points out that there should be a reason for things to be the way they are and I concur.

A lot of fics make it seem as if everyone but him is an idiot because they dismiss advantages because of some moral or belief. But in reality there will allways be people who will use everything to their advantage. So having Harry be the only one to figure out a way to make money, find a use for something is in itself unbelievabe from the start. More realisticaly would be to have the opposite happening.

*** Remove the Horcrux could be doable because they've got like a whole batch of cursebreaker working in many countries, it's hard to think they never found one and managed to remove the soul shard without damaging the object or in this case person, because not going to joke the goblins love money and if they could remove it while taking money from a wizard seems something they'd do xD

** Read Harry Crow if you have time to burn. It's every goblin trope in one story. Not a bad story per se. Well written, but if you've read fanfics for a while, it's not one people would appreciate as the tropes have been overused/overdone.

Goblin Wank Fics -

1. Goblins do blood tests and are responsible for all the documentation in the Wizarding world, from creating new identities, grade sheets, wills, passports, buying and selling properties, essentially controlling the economy of Wizarding Britain.

( The last one isn't far fetched but I doubt they'd be allowed to manage the monetary policy of the magical side of the country. In fact, I don't think they provide interest rates even? Idk. )

Wish my bank did half that shit.

1. Goblins have the wills of James and Lily - which was sealed by the Wizengamot for some reason, generally Dumbledore bashing Fics - but since Gringotts is a sovereign nation or whatever - those laws don't apply to them and they have a copy which they open. Generally this ends up working towards proving Sirius' innocence and bailing him from Azkaban.

Also the goblins usually mention that the only other human to give respect to them was Harry's mother. Just for brownie points.

1. Goblins remove the horcrux from the scar. This is a very very common trope. Done almost as common as Harry as Harry taking the AK for someone he loves. Cause you know Goblin curse breakers are godly, they have magic wizards can only dream of, but they still lost the war to wizards... And goblin wards and healers are the best are greatest people ever. Unlike normal wizards.

2. It's very simple to remove the cup horcrux. Just ask. Or tell them. It goes against their bank policy to store dark items. They'll remove it for you, cause it breaks some charter? Just let them keep the cup and say something nice, like crush the bones of your enemies or drink blood or something like that. There is no need to break into Gringotts at all.

3. No.4 generally leads to the goblins creating a machine that helps locate and find the other horcruxes which they do for free ( cause Harry is our pal) or for a fee. Either way, no need for a horcrux hunt. That's the horcrux problem taken care of completely.

4. Harry must always remember the names of the Goblins which is something ridiculous. Related to claws or blades. And remember, when he bows and says the words of greetings, everyone in the bank must stop and stare. Then the goblin will blink and return the gesture and he usually gets rushed off to the director's office cause the top guy has got a lot of time on his hands, and Harry gets the first class customer treatment.

5. Also goblins are short tempered and no bull shit. Get to the point. Time is money or whatever. Because that is exactly how banks work. Totally.

6. They send monthly bank statements. Ask Harry why he didn't respond to them - in fics after first year where Indy Harry breaks free from Dumbledore., Generally marriage contract Fics - and then the whole horcrux removal, discovery of extra vaults nonsense starts.

7. Not directly related but goblins give bottomless money pouches or some form cheque book / credit card, that can't be stolen etc etc etc.

Not all of them are necessarily bad. Also it's not that the fic will be unpopular if you use it. There are still loads of new people getting into fanfic that would read it. It's just the people who have been into fanfic for a while might be reluctant to read it or probably won't, if the fic relates to most of what has been said above.

If you're doing a goblin friendly fic, my word of advice is make the first two chapters very very interesting. You're climbing a tough hill, so make sure you get your setting right to have people hitting the follow button after the first chapter.

Again, it depends on your fic, but presentation matters a lot. If you have "Goblin Friendly" or "Not like other goblin Fics" as tags in your summary, you won't be starting off on a great note. If your story starts off with Harry in the bank, again not a great note.

If you're fic is different, as stated, you'll need to start bringing out the uniqueness from the first chapter, if you really want the opeople who have read fanfics for a while to get into it.

*** Regarding point 4. I decided Harry would have an easier time of it, if the goblins had names taken from popculture.

Obviously, the only way to go, is Monkey Island. Griphook has a pair of nephews, twins who are called Guybrush and Threepwood.

The Director of Gringotts is called LeChuck. His guards are called Murray and Wally. Wally's fake beard is glued to his ear hair.

LeChuck's assistant, and Muggle liaison, is a redhead called Elaine Marley. She is NOT related to a certain reggae musician, thank you very much...

** The biggest goblin tropes that often pop up in most "goblin wank" or Indy!Harry fics usually are a combination of:

1. Goblins are suddenly very friendly when Harry greets them and calls them by name, citing that no one wizard or witch has ever memorized or called them by name before.
2. Goblins are able to find Harry's (or those affiliated with him) family line with a simple blood test, listing out one or more of the Founders and/or one or more famous person in history (like Merlin).
3. Goblins are able to remove the Horcrux in Harry because of (a) their history of curse breaking, (b) their goblin magic is different/powerful than human magic, and (c) who knows what else?

As of now, I'm sure I missed a whole lot more tropes but those are the biggest ones I could think of.

**** While goblin wank is far too extreme, some of the practices themselves don't seem all out there. Goblins is basically a storage facility, so it would be plausible for them to have a process handling inheritances for when the original owner of a vault keels over. For similar reasons, it would be plausible for them to be able to do some sort of magical inheritance test.

Obviously, there's no reason for them to offer a Horcrux Removal and Magical Bindings Rejuvenation Service(TM) whatsoever, nor for someone to become a Goblin Friend just for basic common decency. Nor for Harry to be Lord of Everything.

*** I could see #3 being a thing but kept secret purely for financial gain for the goblins. Basically any curse breaking skill is automatically property of Goblins. They don't like Wizards so why give them another reason to go after their kind. The reason it's never used on non Gringotts curse breakers is they find it easier to just destroy or kill the container.

**** The simplest explanation that I came up with is that that Horcruxes are very, very obscure or too dangerous that no one has properly documented it (or at all). Even Hermione's book mentioned that its only mention was to /not/ mention it in the book.

It's like the scenario with the unicorn blood, that only someone who has nothing else left to lose will drink the blood to suffer through a cursed life. Only someone who truly has nothing left to lose was willing to create a Horcrux, such that the only known people who made them would be Herpo the Foul and Voldemort.

*** I could see goblins wanting to keep seriously dangerous artifacts out of their vaults- you can't exactly put a chunk of plutonium in a safety deposit box, after all. That's probably why they use cursebreakers in the first place, to remove dangerous curses on goblin-made objects that they want to reclaim.

I don't know if Hufflepuff's cup would be dangerous enough to bother the goblins- it's main protection was that it was locked in a high security vault. You could probably make a case that the goblins don't let people live inside their vaults, or if they do, that Voldemort didn't pay them rent. In that case, I think Gringotts would tell Lestrange to take the cup and put it somewhere else, or remove the horcrux and keep the cup as collateral if it was goblin-made.

**** That could actually be very interesting. The Goblins allow people to live in their vaults but only with a big rent and paying other necessities like food and shower which /will/ be payed regardless of necessity and some extra taxes on things like not eating (‚Äòcause the food goes bad on the vault making a huge mess) and affecting either actively or passively the guard dragon. In the end the summed up cost of keeping the Horcrux in the vault takes all the money in the Lestrange vault and the cup is kicked out some time after the Lestranges are sent to Azkaban but before Voldemort frees them, the Goblins send the cup to Bellatrix's cell. Bella (after raging for a bit) decides to keep the cup on her. Either the dementors find it and eat the soul (so later the Horcrux hunt is extended permanently since the trio has no way of knowing that), the ministry finds it (coin flip to see what happens them) or she manages to keep the cup and a brand new Voldemort shows up in Azkaban without a wand but surrounded by dementors and his loyal followers.

** Harry goes to Gringotts and you are treated to a single chapter that is longer than most one-shots in which an extraordinarily helpful Goblin talks at you, the reader, in order to set the ground rules for this AU.

This often includes but is not limited to: justifying whatever bashing the author has planned for this fic, explaining how much better goblins are than wizards, providing Harry with his parents' wills, providing Harry with material goods (magic trunks, magic credit cards, nutrient potions, magical lasik, etc.), instating Harry as the lord of multiple ancient houses via a blood test, emancipating Harry, and a whole lot more that I'm not remembering.

An integral part of goblin wank stories that I don't think anyone else has touched on is that right after the Gringotts chapter Harry goes on a long and pointless shopping trip where the author tells you about a bunch of pointless crap he buys, then the story is usually abandoned less then 10k words later.

It sounds like from your other comments here that your plan is to stick to canon as much as you can, where goblins have A) shitty attitudes and B) locking caves that they will rent you to store hard currency in. If you stick to that you won't piss anyone off.

Kind of mimics the IRL stock investments/projections too - rich people can hire stockbrokers to tell them what stocks they think are worthwhile investing in, so Gringotts providing information for profit does kind of mimic that in the Harry Potter world sort of way.

** At it's core, wizards are on top in canon. We hear about Goblin rebellions, and yet they don't have wands, and we rarely see or hear of them outside the bank. This all points to Goblins having inferior means of conflict resolution. This isn't racism any more than saying a gorilla is stronger than a chimpanzee is, they're different creatures. They aren't human, they are different, and it seems in canon they are slightly beneath witches and wizards. That isn't politics, we hear they've fought for things that they don't have, therefore they must have lost. As a result they shouldn't be able to outdo witches and wizards. They can be different, but Goblin wank is when goblin are superior, often finding wizarding issues trivial to deal with. Spinning established canon history to change the winners is often seen as stupid. A Grindelwald wins AU is interesting, a Voldemort wins AU is interesting, however, a third year canon divergence that claims Voldemort has always been winning and everything has gone as he predicted, he's just using the time away from public light to work behind the scene is stupid and that actually his wraith form is just making him stronger. Nobody believes you. It doesn't fit.

** Basically, anything that makes Gringotts more than a freakin' bank.

It's /just a bank/ not a concierge service that does everything you could possibly need. They store money and other stuff in vaults for you and you can go there to get your money or other stuff from your vault or put money or other stuff into the vault.

They also exchange magic money for non magic money and vice versa.

They're very good at keeping stuff in vaults and have pretty elaborate security measures to aid in this.

They also have a sideline in grave robbing ancient magical tombs.

That's it. That's all they do.

They don't send bank statements, they don't invest, they don't check your bloodline, get you a portkey, handle your curses or Horcruxes, arrange healers, get you a Room of Spirit and Time type thing to train in, adopt you into their clan, have teams of assassins ready to be hired out, keep documents, enforce wills, broker real estate, have a rivalry with banking Gnomes in Zurich, or many other insane things I've seen in fanfics.

They store stuff, they change money, and they steal from the dead. That's it.

** Other people have mostly covered the pitfalls of Friendly!Goblins so I'll give some advice on avoiding Tolkeinesque!Goblins.

The goblins of Lord of the Rings are bloodthirsty creatures of evil and literal creations of the Satan figure of the world. Harry Potter Goblins are not. They are an oppressed species that has its own culture. All known Goblin Rebellions and distrust of wizards are perfectly justified.

From canon we know that Goblins have a completely different interpretation of ownership and that humans are aware of this. We also know that humans don't give a fuck, instead forcing their own ideas on ownership onto the goblins and acting surprised when the goblins think of all wizards as thieves.

We also know that craftsmanship and ownership are among the most sanctified of ideas to goblins and that they take them incredibly seriously (they might be violent in defending property and the bank and in deterring thieves, but its due to their opinions on thievery, not a general predisposition to violence)

Also, almost every character we see interact with Goblins in canon succumbs to some level of Goblin prejudice. Even Bill Weasley who works with Goblins, has Goblins he'd consider friends, and knows completely about their beliefs regarding ownership, disregards those beliefs because an ancestor paid money to buy a tiara that their children never gave back.

Lessons to learn from this are that Goblins prioritize craftsmanship in their culture, not violence and that goblin prejudice is so deep in Britain that even good people follow it without really thinking about it deeply. It's not justified prejudice (like you'll see in fics where people say that the reason Goblins can't have wands is that they would use them to wage a war of conquest on wizards) but that in universe most people /think/ its justified.

Also Goblins don't live under Gringotts. Many live above ground and in villages around Britain.
