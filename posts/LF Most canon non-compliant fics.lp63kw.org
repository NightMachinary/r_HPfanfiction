I know it's the opposite of what people usually ask for, but I'd like to see those stories where the original plot is derailed. Stations of Canon lose their holy status. Something new, even if it comes at the cost of disagreeing with JKR. Cliches and overused tropes are acceptable if writing is decent.

Any genre and length, though I'd prefer no explicit shipping fics (especially not M/M) and no pairings with 7y+ age gap.

I think this one has a 7y+ age gap but it is good. Daphne harry and an OC pairing. It's good I'm actually re-reading this one
