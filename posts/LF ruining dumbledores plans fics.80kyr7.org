In specifics im interrested in first year where Harry (and friends?) Steal the philosophers stone prior to quirrel trying to steal it. (Can keep or give to nicolas flamel.) Or where they just ignore the 3rd floor corridor as it is the business of adults and not students and ruin dumbledores plan of a meeting between volde and Harry. And ofcause any other instances where Harry really doesnt want to stick his head out to solve the adults problem as a kid, and really ruins whatever plans Dumbledore has for him.


** There are thousands of such stories written, and most of them get into typical indy!Harry cliches with tons of bashing and turning Dumbledore into a senile old fool. Fortunately, some exceptions exist:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620): Harry stole the PS and mostly kept himself out of adult schemes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5265558/1/What-If-An-Alternative-to-Order-Of-The-Phoenix][What If? ... An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix]], linkffn(5265558): Ignore the stupid title, the story itself is pretty good. Harry, Hermione, the Grangers, and Sirius all fled Britain after the dementor attack. Dumbledore had no choice but to step up his own game, and he did it quite well with Amelia's help. Harry didn't get the PS in this one though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): Harrymort would of course never cooperate with Dumbledore, and his plan was relatively simple:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore was a far greater dark lord than I could ever hope to be. He was fifty steps ahead of everyone else, so far ahead that -- by the time his plans came to fruition -- everyone involved had already died. My only hope was to throw him off balance by planning no steps ahead.

  What if Harry had reacted more strongly to the Ministry's threat to expel him and snap his wand? What if he had fled the country rather than submit to the trial?

** Well, technically, I think in the book Harry ruins Dumbledore's plans already /by/ meeting Voldemort.

*** Did he? Why did Dumbledore then have Hagrid collect the PS? Why did he announce the hiding place to the whole school (instead of, you know: putting int under the fidelius with himself as the secret-keeper or at least make the door disappear (turn it to stone, something most students will be unable to reverse!))?

**** I'm generally under the belief that no theory about the first book is well supported. If you can convince me of Dumbledore's plan and motive and how they fit into the larger picture, then I will probably ask you to marry me. I've been searching for those answers since the first time I re-read the first book after Deathly Hallows came out and decided that the story I thought had happened in that book doesn't make any sense. The only plot that feels the most internally consistent to me is the one where Dumbledore intended Harry to be familiar with the mirror and the stone, but /not/ for the purposes of meeting Voldemort and most definitely not for the purposes of removing the stone from the mirror. Those goals don't seem to align with his actions that year or in the following books.

I'm happy to go into excruciating detail about why, but the downvotes have made me realize this isn't the sub for analyzing the books.
