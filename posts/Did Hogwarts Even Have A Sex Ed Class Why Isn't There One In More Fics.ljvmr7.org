** We do not ever see Harry take a shit, but we can assume that he occasionally drops a deuce.

  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)

** Well, Chelonie's "Sex Ed at Hogwarts" linkao3(18237035) plays it for laughs with Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick giving their houses very, very different lectures.
