Howdy folks! This thread will be sticky'd until the next Weekly Reading thread and will host a few important messages. Please read everything!

* Community Survey
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: community-survey
  :END:
We have seen the interest in a sticky'd "trope" thread to mitigate the amount of repeated request threads. We have 2 questions with this in mind:

1. Does the community want to see this?
2. If so, which of these two options would you like to see?

- Option 1: A monthly post where each trope is a "top level" comment.
- Option 2: A biweekly post that focuses on a single trope each time it's posted.

More details:

Option 1 would be a single post each month that looks like this:

Thread Title: *May 2020 Recommended Fics*

- Top level comment: Share your favorite Time Travel fics as a reply to this comment.
- Top level comment: Share your favorite Marriage Law fics as a reply to this comment.
- Top level comment: Share your favorite Slytherin-centric fics as a reply to this comment.

Users are free to share a fic under each top level comment and discuss; top-level comments outside of the ones listed above will not be allowed.

Option 2 would be a *biweekly* thread that focuses on a single trope:

- Week of: May 25, 2020 - {Time Travel} fics!
- Week of June 8, 2020 - {Marriage Law} fics!
- Week of June 22, 2020 - {Slytherin-centric} fics!

Users are free to share a fic that fits the weekly topic in the thread and discuss. *Note: Option 2 would be rotating with the Weekly Reading Thread.* (May 25 - Fic Recs, June 1 - What are You Reading?, June 8 - Fic Recs, etc.)

Please share which version you would like to see implemented and any comments you might have. The team will take your comments into consideration. Thanks for reading!

* Weekly Reading Thread Info
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: weekly-reading-thread-info
  :END:

1. We will attempt to get a link to old threads included. It /might/ have to be a link to a wiki page where you then navigate to the week you want. Hopefully this will be updated in time for next week's post.

2. Contest mode is enabled so that upvotes can't effect the order you see the stories in. We want all fics to get exposure. A side effect of this is that comment replies are hidden by default. We can't change that. Sorry :(

3. If Option 2 of the Fic Requests is enabled, Weekly Reading will go back to *Biweekly Reading* so that we don't eat up both announcement slots every week. Subreddits can only sticky two announcements, so the team wants to have an extra slot available just in case.

* TL;DR
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: tldr
  :END:

1. AMA next weekend; be there!
2. Do you want to see a "Recommended Fics Fitting /X/ Trope" thread?
3. Weekly reading threads are in contest mode so all replies are hidden by default; I will try to include links to past threads in the new one; it will change to biweekly threads based if the community votes in Trope Thread Option 2.

Thanks for reading and let us know what you think!

Edit: Changed TL;DR wording to make more sense.


** Seeing two identical or very similar request threads posted in quick succession is not uncommon and can be annoying, this is true.

HOWEVER:

The fact that this occurs at all means that the people making these threads are not performing even a cursory browse of the sub before they make their post. Therefore I honestly doubt a stickied megathread would prevent it; these individuals will just ignore the megathread and proceed to post their requests as they currently do.

On top of that, I think there's a risk of the cure being worse than the disease here. Yes, "request spam" can be annoying, but at the same time, I don't think this sub should be taking actions to reduce its own vitality and activity levels. Megathreads can stifle discussion quite effectively. The HP fandom is not what it used to be in terms of numbers; we can't afford to be shutting down swathes of good discussion.

And these threads /do/ generate discussion; sometimes two identical requests posted within an hour of each other can lead to very different fic recommendations and fic discussions. It's like that classic [[https://xkcd.com/1053/][xkcd]]: not everyone sees everything all of the time, so one group of people may come across the one thread, another group comes across the other thread, and because different people have seen them, they generate different discussions. This is part of why we have so many pet peeves threads - for all that the sub regulars have trodden that path many times, for other people it's a new discussion.

Personally, I would be much more interested in something being done about the large number of low-effort "prompt" posts which are more crackish "shower thoughts" than genuine prompts or drabbles.

*** I would agree with all of this! I'm also wondering if there's a way we can encourage folks to say a little more when they link a fic? What they like about it, why they think it fits OP's request, etc. Posts with a bunch of linkffns and no qualifications for the stories they link tend not to contribute much to discussion in a meaningful way, imo.

**** The only real policing of fic request threads we do at this time is to prevent what we call “bashing” comments, or comments that attack the nature of the specific request. This rule was put into place after a user made a request for slash fics, and the comments were full of homophobic comments and not any recommendations that fit the OP's request.

I am leary of policing request threads any more than this as we don't want to become too overbearing. If my explanation doesn't make sense, please let me know!

***** No, this makes sense! I guess I was thinking less of policing and more of encouraging, somehow. Like, changing the community standard for how you respond to those sorts of threads to focus on more substantive answers. Obviously that's a hard thing to do, though, and I don't really have any particular ideas as to how to effect such a change.

**** Now we have the bot-recommendation creator it /does/ matter through- the more we recommend, the better it will become. If we stifle the number of request threads, we limit the ability for the bot to do it's job.

**** I don't disagree, and there are definitely requests where this makes sense, but I also think for some requests, the poster has a number of criteria and we're just throwing out fics that match (because you never know what someone has or hasn't read). I mostly don't want to discourage people from posting linkffns for things that match (I guess personally I'd rather have a bunch of links I can look at and determine what looks good rather than fewer linkffns where people tell me all the reasons they like them - especially as that seems like it may result in mostly seeing widely-known fics being recc'd).

*** The weekly thread is in contest mode to discourage upvotes/downvotes as a means of “controlling” what fics are easily seen. I understand that it changes the order, but I believe that presenting the weekly fics in an objective method is the best.

***** you can, but reddit auto-sorts everyone to view by best as default, so anyone who doesn't know about sorting by new would only see the highest voted comments & allow for downvoting to stifle certain fics or topics.

** I love the request threads that come up- it expands my horizons on what is out there, and have read more new fics than ever since finding this community.

If we make a megathread, I think we will lose people, and hinder our own progress.

** I would prefer option 1. Option 2 would likely be unhelpful in reducing request threads. You'd still likely have daily requests for the topics that aren't covered in the megathread. I would also prefer for the Weekly Reading Thread to stay up all the time; I may not be interested in most of the recommendations but I do still like the option.
