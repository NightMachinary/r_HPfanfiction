Hi, I only recently got into fan fiction this year (I don't know how I only discovered it this year but nevermind!)

I love novel length stories, as I really enjoy getting into the narrative. I've read quite a few now and I'm looking for recommendations of more!

Preferably Hermione centric, though that's not a deal breaker. I prefer a mature rated story with good doses of well written smut! To be honest, the more smut the better, but it has to work within the story. I'm happy for most any pairing, except voldemort, not a fan of that one. Enjoy a bit of slash, but not as the main pairing, more in the form of a threesome.

I've read teaching miss Granger and it's possibly my most favourite fic! Also a big fan of the debt of time, the long way home, pet project and I've just finished the psychic serpent trilogy. I've read many more, I'm just dreadful with names!

80k plus words is preferable (though 250k+ would make me very happy) . And I like them to be complete as I'm a binge reader!

So, can anyone suggest anything, I'll love you forever if you can.

Ahahaha. Haha. Ha. You're serious. Fuck me.

Use slim if you /must/ call the bot.

This is every completed or abandoned HP fic I've read over 100K words. It was problematic to restrict it to Hermione-centric, etc. Excludes in-progress fics for technical reasons. Sorted by descending length.

Individual installments of a series are here if they meet the conditions. Series that only collectively do so are not. A couple of collections of short stories might creep in. My apologies.

A very large majority of these are good fics. Some poor quality ones are in here though.

If you can't read fics on FanFicAuthors try the pdf version or make an account.

Please tell me if I've borked a link.

Thank you for the trip down memory lane! I haven't thought about some of these in years.

*** Are you me???? I swear 90% of what you have posted are fics in my read list too. like more or less identical.

Bungle in the jungle is great, and everyone should read it, Make a Wish is funny, Runemaster was one of the first full length HP fic That I have ever read, And wait, is that "harry potter: Geth", and "Something wicked this way comes"???????? well holy shit. seriously, too all who haven't read it, READ SOMTHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES. its spectacular.

**** I mostly sort by favorites or go through the favorites of an author. That could probably account for most of this list. The rest I'd find rec'd here. I think it's just a consequence of reading fanfiction for so long.

Seconding SWTWC. The only part I didn't like was the horror arc, but I don't like horror at all. This fic also single-handedly convinced me to buy Disgaea.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

#+begin_quote
  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

** Some stuff to read: works by White Squirrel, the Pureblood Pretense and it's sequels by Murkybluematter, Princess of the Blacks (kinda disturbing) by Silently Watches (they also have a married in Las Vegas story that crosses over with Teen Titans), Harry Potter and the Sun Source and other works by that author, Hogwarts Houses Divided (highly recommended), Alexandra Quick and sequels (highly recommended), with both AQ and Hogwarts Houses Divided by the same author, and One Hundred and Sixty Nine, a Hermione-centric time-travel story.

Most of this stuff isn't Hermione-centric, but it is among the best in the fandom. They all are either complete, or have completed books within their series.

** My favorite is [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond]] which is not on any archive sites. 300+K. AU where Sirius raised Harry and he didn't go to Hogwarts until he was 15, which is where it starts. Reasonably split between Hermione- and Harry-centric. Plenty of smut, but not primarily smut. Voldemort is already defeated.
