#+TITLE: Does anyone else have a database full of all the fanfics they’ve ever read? Kind of like a FF bank.

If anyone does, and they're willing, I'd appreciate it if you could link in comments. Cheers


** Yeah, I keep a detailed Excel spreadsheet of the long fics I've completed, with a detailed rating system, reviews for each, and subgenre/tropes, as well as a running ticker of how many I've finished.

I've thought about sharing it online, but it's constantly under construction as I think I only have around 70% of the fics I've finished on there (and missing many more short ones that I've read). And since all my email accounts are at least indirectly linked to my real name and I just don't want to go through the hassle of creating a fifth or sixth email, I don't see myself doing that anytime soon.

If anyone wants the list, PM me and I'll try to make a plaintext version that I can copy/paste into a PM.

*** I have a 4000-entry LibreOffice spreadsheet that's a combination "fics I've read/fics I plan to read/author pages" database. It's not online, and I'm not planning to post it, because:

a) I keep adding fields to it to make it more useful to me, and I haven't caught up many of the entries since the last new field was added, and

b) I've decided I'm not happy with it, but I haven't decided what to do about it. My rating system needs work, and the field that contains comments to help me recognize the story doesn't have enough information in many cases.

It's also not just HP stories - I have a lot of Ranma 1/2 and Naruto stories in it, as well as a smattering of other fandoms.

** Kinda wish I did. Nowadays I write a review from pretty much every story I read, no matter how much of it, so I could create like a ratings sheet if I wasn't lazy. But I wish I started when I first started reading fics, if only so I could see how many of those stories no long exist. Right now the only historical evidence is a mix of my favorites and my reviews.

** I generally skip oneshots, but I mostly read with my kindle and therefore download everything to calibre. (Skip as in I don't download the short ones)

I'm in the middle of reorganizing atm (added a trope category / cleaning up the 'genre' one / plus a decent sized backlog of unlabeled fics) but I can use the catalog function to make a list if you like. It'll just... be messy atm.

Most aren't rated either (except for the few that I stuck in the "just bad" category lol) but at least the in-progress/complete/abandoned labels are up to date. There's nearly 600 fics.

***** I have a directory full of downloads like that, but it doesn't mean I have read them all! They are just on the hard drive. I've downloaded some large collections that I've read only a tiny fraction of. Thanks though.

My own list, with no poor quality fics. Many people in [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]] use it.

** Do you want something like goodreads for fanfic? Are the existing archive sites not already something like that?

I don't have anything like a db or spreadsheet myself, especially for fanfic. I couldn't imagine it having 1000s of entries, given the length of some HP fic. I'd also be reluctant to post detailed comments on some of the stories.

Most fanfic when you get down to it is pretty bad, and I consider it worth reading if it has enough good or interesting parts to keep paying attention anyway. But I know that the authors write the stuff because they love to, it's for their own satisfaction as much as for anyone else's, so I usually won't want to post that someone's story mostly stinks. I'll either not read it, or appreciate it for its non-stinking parts and forgive the rest.
