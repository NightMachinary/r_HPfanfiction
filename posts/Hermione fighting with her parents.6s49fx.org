Hello my friends!

I'm looking for a fanfic where Hermione A) has a fallout with her parents because of the culture clash between the two worlds- which causes her to leave the muggle word or something like that

Or B) immerses herself in wizarding culture, climbing in the hierarchy

Love Nyx


** She does quite a bit of both in canon. :P

In linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk), her evolution as a witch clawing her way to the top of Slytherin's social ladder, and her misadventures along the way, are a constant source of conflict between her and her parents, but in some ways, it makes their family even stronger.

Other than that, I guess linkffn(Darkest Witch of Her Age by darkrose0510) fits the bill, to a rather extreme extent.

  Hermione was known as the brightest witch of her age, but time and circumstances would soon change that. Who will survive a brilliant mind's descent into darkness? A dark Hermione fic'.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

**** There's the linkffn(Mudblood Mistress I & II by JoseHood) series, which is decent, though I don't remember exactly how she relates to her parents.

Honestly, most fics along these lines are pathetic Dramione 'ships, and there is a fandom-wide tendency to portray Hermione as a generally nicer and more moral person than she was in canon, so it's slim pickings.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11580650/1/][Abraxas]], linkffn(11580650): most extreme case of Hermione vs her parents fight I've found so far.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): Her parents didn't like at all what she had become, for good reasons. On the other hand, she had pretty much destroyed traditional Wizarding Britain.

** Hermione does b) in my story "Patron". Muggleborns are 3rd class citizen in that AU, and she immerses herself in Wizarding Culture with Harry to ultimately change that.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
