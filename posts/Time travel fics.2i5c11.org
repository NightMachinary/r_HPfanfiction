Hello. I was wondering if anyone new of any good, long fanfics similar to Timely Errors? This is the story by the way: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4198643/1/Timely-Errors]]


** Do you want time travel or Peggy Sue (travelling to the start of the book, and changing the events thanks to the traveller's past knowledge)?

**** Once more with feeling is alright, but its abandoned unfortunately. Time travel isn't big in this fandom. Temporal Beacon is widely acclaimed, but I dont really like it personally

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards with purpose]]. Has a sequel or two.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry potter and the temporal beacon]]. My favorite time travel, that is played straight. Probably abandoned, alas.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6728900/1/Far-Too-Many-Time-Travelers][Far too many time travelers]]. Updates basically one a year, hilarious though.

** I love [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]]. It's super super super non canon though.
