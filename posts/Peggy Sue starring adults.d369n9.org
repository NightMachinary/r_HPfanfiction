Peggy Sue referring to a character going back to the beginning of the series with all the knowledge they had when they died in series or at the end of the series if they're alive. There are a great many of these with Harry, and a few with Harry and a friend or two. Are there any where, for instance, Snape wakes up on July 31st 1991 with all his memories of the next 7 years up until his death? McGonagall?

I'll take it if I have to but prefer Gen. If there pairings, I prefer HHr and will generally drop a fic if it involves Draco/good guys, professor/student, or Romione.


** Oof. I know there's one out there with Remus, but I haven't read it and can't recall the title.

*** The one I know of is linkffn(The Bureaucratic Error) with Remus.

There are a TON with Snape, but mostly he starts back in his own school years with Lily, so he can fix that friendship, reject the Death Eaters, etc. In some he gets together with her, in some they were always just friends and she still marries James, in others he wants to get together with her at the start but then he realizes he's too much of an adult and it would never work now. In some he even does the whole over-powered Lordship thing, where he becomes the Prince heir through his mom's side.

I think there's one, linkffn(To Shape and Change) where he is very involved with Harry's school years. I forget at what point he comes back in that one.

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. He's going to need his old friend Sirius to help him with this one. In progress; updates most weekends. Happy September 1, and thank you for sticking with this monstrosity for a whole year!

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

***** Oh wow, that's tough. I don't keep track of this stuff as well as I should, I don't know that there's an absolutely outstanding Snape Peggy Sue. Two that have already been mentioned are good- They Didn't Know We Were Seeds, and The Peace Not Promised.

To be honest, once Snape declines to join the DE's and makes friends with Lily again most of them kind of drag on. Writing Snape as a main character is a really difficult balance between keeping too many of his bad traits (which are pretty gross and infuriating in large doses- unless the author attempts to show how everyone else is at fault which is even worse because Snape hates everyone so you have to bash everyone) and reforming him too much and making him too happy and sweet and out-of character enough that he's unrecognizable and just the author's whim.

There are some stories that can do this perfectly but I can't think of any that are also Snape Peggy Sues, so I don't really have a favorite. Peace Not Promised maybe comes closest.

***** This summary?

"After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. Heavy on Remus/Sirius friendship. Some Black family dynamic; Harry/Sirius family dynamic; Sirius PTSD exploration. Tonks is a major player but not til halfway through. No bashing. Harry is present but not primary; these adults prefer not to ask teenagers to save the world."

**** I've only seen a single SS Peggy Sue fic that has him travel back to the Marauder-era that /doesn't/ have a LESS endgame; linkffn(They Didn't Know We Were Seeds).

I also got the impression from ao3 tags that "They Call This Closure?" was meant to be such a fic, but the fic is incomplete and never actually got anywhere in either direction.

***** There's one I just finished reading (it's not complete) that had Snape and Hermione unexpectedly go back to marauder-era time. It might be heading in a Snape/Hermione direction, at least the summary mentioned it, but there's no actual romance whatsoever and it might just be referring to the fact that they pretended to be a couple to explain talking together so often. I can't remember the name, though.

His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody---' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.
