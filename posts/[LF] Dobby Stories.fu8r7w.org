I'm looking for any good stories where Dobby follows Harry around. It never made sense to me that Dobby-the-free-elf would just leave Harry to suffer through another summer with the Dursleys. Dobby saw how Harry was treated the summer before second year and adores Harry. It would make sense that Dobby would check-in on Harry the summer before third year, which would mean Harry would finally not return to school malnourished. I'm looking for any/all of your favorites! Thanks!

  What if Dobby bound himself to Harry without Harry knowing about it? How would that influence the story?
