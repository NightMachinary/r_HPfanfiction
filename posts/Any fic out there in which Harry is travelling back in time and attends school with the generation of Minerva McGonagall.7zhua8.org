***** Is that how is it "dated"? I though it was when the school year itself started not when it ended? So..

1 year: 47-48 2 year: 48-49 3 year: 49-50 4 year: 50-51 5 year: 51-52 6 year: 52-53 7 year: 53-54

So school years from 47 to 53..?

******* That was the truth for a long time. JKR stated in an interview (given when the then-current in-story year was 1995) that McG was 70. That gave her a birth year of 1925 and a starting year at Hogwarts of 1937.

Unfortunately then came Pottermore and a statement of higher canon-level stating there were just two years between her leaving Hogwarts and starting teaching. And we know from her conversation with Umbridge in OP that she started teaching in December 1956. Therefore her birth year had to be adjusted.

  When it comes to odd experiences, Ash Ketchum has seen them all. So when one of Clemont's inventions malfunctions and throws him and some of his companions into another world, he decides to take it in stride and make the most of his time there - causing changes along the way. Rated T because of SAO's premise. Contains SatoSere and Kirisuna, but not main focus. Sequel has begun.

** I don't know about anything like that, but there's one on FanFiction.net called "Disorder of the Phoenix". Basically Harry is 20-something with Teddy Lupin being 7, and they get sent back in time by Fawkes to Harry's 5th year. Harry's older self takes the place of his younger self and he teaches DADA while trying to stop Voldemort. It's a HarryxTonks fic, if that adds any incentive.
