This kind of a thought, a typical of an ‘independent' Harry with Weasley bashing but it turns out he was completely wrong and the Weasleys have complexly innocuous reasons for everything.

Harry also discovers that Dumbeldore was not hiding any secret will or inheritance, Harry is beginning to consider that breaking into Gringotts to look for the super secret will which would have apparently said Sirus is innocent was both overkill and perhaps that the smartest of actions. Especially since no such will exists.

"Stop yelling at Mum for that, it was her turn this year to help the lost muggleborns that were wandering the muggle train station!"

"WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY THAT WAS TAKEN FROM MY VAULT BY DUMBLEDORE EACH YEAR, HUH? WHAT ABOUT IT?"

"Which withdrawal? The one that allowed us to buy more food to feed you whenever we invited you for the whole summer, or the one paying for your Hogwarts tuition?"

"But... But... GINNY! LOVE POTION! WHAT ABOUT THAT?"

"Oh, you mean the sudden crush you got in your sixth year? Do you really believe this is a love potion? How would I even know how to make those?"

**** That could be interesting. Also you know in all these stories how Goblins are super helpful? How about they actually use Harry for their own end, because Harry is being so naive and easily manipulated xD At the end Harry finds out that there never was dozen mansions and hundred vaults. Instead he's been robbed blind, made knutless and saddled with crippling dept, and somehow been roped into slavery contract and now Goblins own him and he has to clean their loos for the rest of his life...

******* I admit, I'd definitely love that. Big dramatic, moronic plot where Harry finds out Dumbledore is hiding his vaults and giving bits out to all his friends as 'payment', so he burns every bridge, grabs every bit of power he can, brings the Wizarding World to its knees and galvanises the people to follow him, with the Goblins behind him every step of the way, preaching a new era of magical prosperity and equality, only to have it all pulled out from underneath him at the last minute.

Indiana Hadrian Harroldius Potter-Black-Merlin-McDuck strides into his vault "Finally. I've taken care of Voldemort, the Weasleys, Dumbledore, and now the Goblins too. There's nothing left in my way. Time to claim my reward and find out what my parents really left for me."

The vast, cavernous space, lit with arcane fire in a rainbow kaleidoscope of ever-changing colour, was magnificent, was regal, was exactly what he deserved, was... utterly empty, aside from a large, smiling portrait of a very familiar, wrinkled old man(ipulator) and a small metal table, upon which stood a single bowl of lemondrops.

"What? That cannot be!" (Indy!Harry is too good for contractions.) "My parents were an ancient and noble family, renowned businesspeople! They must have had money!"

"They did. Then they traded it all for that," A thumb over the shoulder to a sack, sitting in the corner. "bag of magic beans." The portrait shrugged. "Making money isn't that hard in the magical world."

"B-beans? But they cannot be... beans?" Indiana Hadrian Harroldius Potter-etc stuttered. He pulled himself together. "They are highly powerful, I assume? Can they grow me a beanstalk, to a kingdom in the sky that I am destined to rule for eternity? Do they grant me immortality, or power beyond my wildest dreams?"

"No, I'm afraid they can do none of those things."

"Then what /do/ they do, Dumbledore?"

"...they taste good on toast?"

And so, after a long life of politics, powermongering, and arcane mastery, Indiana Hadrian Harroldius Potter-Black-Merlin-McDuck settled down, going by 'Harry Potter' for short now, and opened a bistro, serving breakfast foods that were renowned throughout the magical and muggle worlds.

***** "Yes, all these vaults belong to you. Many have been sitting dormant for hundreds of years, waiting for an appropriate heir to reclaim and reactivate them! Just sign here, and they will all be yours, goblin-friend."

Harry rushed to sign, internally gleeful at the thought of the untold wealth and ancient artifacts about to be his. As the last drop of blood-mixed ink dried, the grins of the goblins in the room turned vicious.

"Thank you, Hadrian Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-Griffindor-Wonka-Merlin. This has been a great help. You see, the vaults being inactive stopped us from collecting maintenance fees. Unfortunately, those maintenance fees, late payment fees, interest fees, and now several thousand individual overdraft fees, you owe the goblin nation 3,472,823 galleons, four sickles, and seven knuts. For a modest fee of ten galleons per vault, we will be willing to decommission those vaults. Would you like to look at repayment plans for those fees, goblin-friend? The interest rates are very reasonable..."
