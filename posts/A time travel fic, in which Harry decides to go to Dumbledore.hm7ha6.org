We all know the usual time travel story in which Harry, with all his knowledge of the future, is back in his 9/10/11 years old body and is like "I cannot possibly go to Dumbledore, because [insert reason I'm apparently not smart enough to understand]".

Is there one in which he actually does decide to go to Dumbledore?

Thank you!

  Harry Potter gets sent back in time in the early spring of his 6th year at Hogwarts. The only way to get back to his time is to live through each year in a linear progression. Harry only has three goals: survive, find his friends, and make it back home. But things don't really go according to plan.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** *BEFORE YOU DOWNVOTE!* This is all taken from Harry's point of view. If this happened immediately after the final battle, the butthurt towards Dumbledore is immeasurable. Not to mention Harry doesn't know all the sides of the story.

- He handed out 47 second chances to everybody, and ignored warnings and facts until they smacked him in the face after things blew up a la end of Order of the Phoenix.
- "You can't mess with time Harry." [Obliviate Bad End] or [Forced Oath not to meddle End]

Obliviation is still in play, remember Marietta Edgecombe?

- Dumbledore will just sit on the information until it is useless. Horcruxes anyone? He didn't start on those until it was too late.
- "You need to have a childhood Harry" and then Harry gets cut off.
- Will most likely make him stay at the Dursleys anyway.

It's because the MC (usually Harry) then loses his only real advantage and the story will be driven more by Dumbledore and his men than Harry. It will also make defeating Voldemort pretty easy, and the authors don't like that.

** How about someone other than Harry?

linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) has Severus offered the chance to return to the year after his breakup with Lily; he can't relive that, but "everything else would be up to you." He works closely with Dumbledore to end the first war without needing a second, hoping above all else to keep Lily safe this time. It's unfinished, but the author is very organised and updates monthly.

(And, of course, with Severus having decades more patience and maturity, and turning his back on the Death Eaters, Lily is willing to give their friendship another chance.)
