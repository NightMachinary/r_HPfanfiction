Fics were Harry is the brother, cousin, son... Of superman. I've been looking for one of this with a considerable amount of chapters but I haven't found one of those yet. Â¿Can you help me?


** ...would one where Harry /is/ Superman count?

If so, I humbly offer [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][The Last Mage of Krypton]] and its sequels [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12357124/1/Rising-From-The-Shadows][Rising From The Shadows]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564837/1/A-Distant-Storm][A Distant Storm]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12831094/1/A-Challenge-Unexpected][A Challenge Unexpected]].

** Sorry, but I only know of one and that may not be what you wanted.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13362783/1/Young-Justice-Rebirth-Volume-One][Young Justice]] by Megamatt09, and as typical of Megamatt it features a lot of smut. But it does feature Harry as Clone of Superman...

Though if I'm honest I haven't read farther than a few chapters as it got too damn ridiculous imo. Sorry I can't help more.
