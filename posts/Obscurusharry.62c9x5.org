**** Well, I disagree (sure it could have been better, no doubt about it and I don't like Newt so much (he kind of feels like a young Dumbledore combined with a young Hagrid (!) - a fascination with creatures and trying to give anybody a second chance while not caring about rules he thinks are dumb, like importing creatures to the US, exposing muggles to magic etc.)...but over all? Yeah, I liked it :) )

Yeah, making Harry an obscurus would make for a great story (with some nice and well deserved Dumbledore "bashing" (is it bashing if it's true? I mean sorry, I for one don't like Dumbledore at all! I think his idea to sacrifice a child is fucked up, even if Voldemort can't die without Harry being dead...I mean can't they toss him into a max-sec-prison, just like Dumbledore did to Grindelwald? Then there's his "give everybody a second chance" thing, when those people given second chances break out of prison and kill again then that's his vault IMHO (Deatheaters need to be put down with lethal force!)), especially if he doesn't die from it (the Horcrux might be keeping him alive or the prophecy (he can't die except if Voldemort kills him)) and people are trying to get into his good graces for the power (or they try desperately to fix him in case he really can die from this!)
