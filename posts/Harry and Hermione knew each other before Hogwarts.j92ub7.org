Harry knew Hermione before Hogwarts but calling them friends would have been a big misconception. Granger family, like everyone in the Little Whinging area buyed into the rumors spread by Petunia.

Hermione, due to views installed on her by her parents, avoided Harry, seeing him as a bad person. Maybe She even participated in the bullying in order to fit well with the crowd and avoid becoming the object of bullying herself.

What effects this would have on Harry and Hermiones relations when they are sorted into the same house in the first year? Would Harry try to save Hermione from the Troll? Will they ever become friends?


** The same as before probably. Despite being his tormentor for most his life, Harry did not hesitate to save Dudley from the Dementors. Hell, he didn't hesitate to save Draco from the Room of Requirements despite being his nemesis. So why would he not save Hermione from the Troll? It's stated in canon that he didn't like her much before that anyways.

** As others have said, I don't think that Hermione would directly bully Harry and Harry would have gone into the bathroom for almost anyone so that wouldn't change anything. The biggest impact would be the summer between 1st and 2nd year when the Grangers would know that the Dursleys were lying about there nephew. Since they couldn't come out and say how they knew it could be interesting with the right writer

** they definetly wouldn't be friends, there is far to much bad blood between them, however i doubt Harry would go out of his way to antagonize her.

He would save her from the troll, but friendship is already a no go due to Harry having far more negative of an opinion on Hermione from childhood to be friends.

** People Harry wouldn't have tried to save from a troll.

Voldemort.

Dumbledore, because he'd know Dumbledore wouldn't need any help.

That's it.

** Likely being a victim of bullying herself due to her bucked teeth and the (admittedly) know-it-all aura she gives off, Hermione wouldn't judge a book by its cover, so to speak. I can see her being wary around him, but I don't think she'd participate in the bullying. If anything, she'd notice that Dudley's the one doing the bullying and avoid /him/.

*** IDK, I think you might be overestimating the innate empathy and kindness of a child under 10, especially one like Hermoine, who perhaps wasn't as emotionally intelligent as she was intellectually.

I'm not saying she definitely would, but it's also unfair to say she definitely wouldn't. She was likely a vulnerable and lonely little girl, who would probably be able to say, what's to her, a few mean things to fit in. (to harry it would obviously be a bit more significant).

Plus, it totally fits in with the themes of the core 7 books, to have Hermoine initially be the type to go along with the crowd and seek security (a ministry of magic type) and then learn over the course of the fic, "Fuck It, I'll do what's right, instead of easy".

**** True. You have a point. I guess it really would depend on how mature she is. Although, Hermione never struck me as the type to believe gossip, nor does she sound like someone who would do something for no purpose other than to "fit in".

***** She is the type to believe /adults/ though, and not only are the Dursleys adults, but from the books it looked like /teachers/ believed it too. Part of her growth in the series is realizing that adults aren't always to be trusted.

****** Yeah, you're right. Still, I think that her parents would have said something like "Don't go near that boy, he seems weird, his relatives told me so and so", so she would've just avoided him. I don't think she would have bullied him.
