are there any good fics in which an SI uses the powers of logic and science to hax and get hax shit through hax. like remember core threads or blindness? yeah, harry basically took a small advantage and made it hax in both. there is even a magical awakening which is AU Self insert hax on spacebattles.

so can we get that but SI. because really badassery hax and cuteness are all that really matter so we read what we must because we can for the good of us all except the ones who are dead.


** other than HPMOR i can't think of any but I hate that story so whatever
