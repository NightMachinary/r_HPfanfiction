** A Second Chance at Life has something like that. Harry with dual thunderbird/basilisk form. First two books of the trilogy are done, something happened to the author before he/she could complete #3. Lots of badass wizards and creatures, though magical britain does get stomped on a bit as being essentially the inbred hillbilly of the magical world.

  Accidental magic is just that, but if a young wizard is pushed too hard, the results can get... messy. watch as Harry adapts to what his magic grants him, and forges a new path, breaking through the plots with have been weaved with azure wings. (Some mentions of abuse in first chapter. Evil!Dumbledore. Ron. Ginny, Molly Bashing. Powerful!Kaiju!Harry)
