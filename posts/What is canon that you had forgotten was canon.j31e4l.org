I had forgotten that it's actually canon that Voldemort using Harry's blood for his rebirth is the reason Harry survived the killing curse in DH. Harry and Dumbledore talk about it at the ghostly King's Cross. I guess since so many fics use the Hallows or another alternative reason, I had forgotten the blood was the reason.

What had you forgotten was canon?


** Voldemort openly talks about his parents (specifically, his father) in the graveyard, in front of the death eaters. This somewhat goes against the common fanon take that he's trying to keep it secret and his followers would abandon him instantly if they knew.

*** That's a cool one! I had forgotten all about it. Pretty wild, considering how so many fics have the Death Eaters freaking out if they find out they've been serving a half-blood.

  Dumbledore was trying to hint about the Room of Requirement to Harry in book four but kept it vague at the table (where their competition was sitting). Perhaps he overestimated Harry's ability to infer from such vague clues.

This seems like a stretch. It's clear that the room of chamber pots he found was in fact the Room of Requirement and Rowling was foreshadowing it for later, but I don't know if Dumbledore actually knew about it in detail and was trying to tell Harry about it. At the very least, if he was trying to point him in the right direction, he might have mentioned /where/ in the castle the room was in the first place, or suggested that it might be anything /other/ than an emergency bathroom.

***** Honestly, if I didn't know the room existed in the first place, I'd have taken that wink to mean that he was bullshitting Karkaroff entirely.
