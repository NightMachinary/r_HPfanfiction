** Did you mean that Thatcher defenestrated Fudge? Because if you did, what you wrote was that Fudge (the former) defenestrated Thatcher (the latter).

**** I remember in my AP European History class how excited the class was to read about the Defenestration of Prague. Not quite the highlight of the year in that class, but close.

** I could swear that Fudge said that

A) The previous Prime Minister /tried/ throwing him out a window

2) I can swear that Fudge specifically used the word "he" in regards to said PM.

He does, but it should be "she". The start of HBP is in Summer 1996, at which point John Major was PM, which makes Thatcher his predecessor. *Edit:* The remark about throwing out the window happened when Major first came into office, which was 1990, but my point still stands.

Just to muck things up more, the PM tried to throw Fudge out because they "thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition". However, according to Pottermore Fudge became Minister in 1990, by which point Thatcher had been PM for eleven years and would have already met not only Fudge's predecessor Millicent Bagnold ('80-'90), but also her predecessor Harold Minchum ('75-'80). As such, Thatcher would already have been familiar with magic by the time she met Fudge and wouldn't have thought it was a hoax.

Possible plot-hole filling theory: Thatcher's predecessor James Callaghan tried to throw Minchum out the window and Fudge appropriated the story for himself, hence the pronoun mix-up.

**** Or the world of HP isn't quite exactly the same as our own, but with magic.

Would explain how Dudley had a PlayStation before they came out.
