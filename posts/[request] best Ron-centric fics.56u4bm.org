I've participated in my share of Ron bashing and yesterday's thread made me feel guilty.

Please give me fics where Ron is awesome!


** My favorite. Adult Ron dealing with adult things. Ron/Padma

#+begin_quote
  Ron Weasley, an aging quidditch player in the middle of possibly the biggest game of his life, looks back at the places where his life changed for the better and the worse. Book 7 compliant but not epilogue compliant.

*** I second this. For some reason Ron and Hermione's relationship in this felt much more realistic (or at least better written) compared to the epilogue.

[[/spoiler][They try, but Ron's jealousy and Hermione's refusal to admit when she's wrong end up putting them at odds with each other.]]

*** Have an internet cookie! I love that fic, but hadn't thought about it in years. It's an excellent murder mystery and almost good enough to stand on its own, beyond fanfiction - although the story does kind of need the magical background. Plus, my favorite incarnation of adult!Hermione ever :')

** linkao3(8158447) AU one-shot, if Ron had been the child identified in the prophecy. Really really beautiful fic.

/They called Ron 'the Boy Who Lived' and he thought that covered it, rather-- he had survived, once. He hadn't done anything but not die. Charlie was taking over Care of Magical Creatures and taming random wild creatures in the Forest. There was Bill--Head Boy, freelance writer, tamer of tantrums, legal guardian of six; and Percy, who followed all the rules; and Fred and George and Ginny, who excelled at breaking them-- and then there was Ron./

/Ron, who hadn't died, once upon a time. Yippee, him. His parents had died in front of him, and he couldn't even remember his mother's voice. He could play a mean game of chess, and reach things on high shelves. Harry got on the school Quidditch team, the youngest Seeker in his century, and Lily bought him a Nimbus 2000./

*** Honestly, almost complete canon rehash despite very different circumstances. Why did they have to face the troll again? Why should Lucius plant the Diary on Ginny if there was no Arthur Weasley's raid on his manor? Couldn't those authors come up with some original plots?

**** Hmmm. This is true. This author has some other "what if's" that make a bit more sense plotwise... however I'm willing to overlook that for the brilliant characterization here. That's the most important part of this fic, for me. And especially since it's a character who rarely gets his due in fanfics.

** I like Choices linkffn(7467796), takes a few chapters to get into the swing of things but I like where it's going.

Linkffn(7523798) Stay Standing is about Ron having a deadly magical disease. It is an interesting look at Ron and the Weasley dynamic as well.

Linkffn(12141684) is relatively new and a Ron gets sent back in time story which I'm enjoying.

  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment. 2nd chapter for fifth year now here! Thanks for reading! Will continue until 7th year.

  Or, Ron Weasley's Year Six Diary: the whole of Half-Blood Prince from Ron's point of view. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to shake him. Winner of "Best Humour Fic" at the 2008 Reviewer's Choice Awards on FFnet.
