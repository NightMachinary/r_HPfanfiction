Looking for good fics that feature a Harry that owns/ rules over hogwarts or has control of the wards. OP is great I love good op fics! Not looking for anything in particular any recommendation is welcome just like this prompt!


** Here's one where Harry goes back in time to his first year after defeating Voldermort and decides to just screw it and take over hogwarts screw Dumbledore, screw the ministry, screw everbody it's Harrys turn to take control.
