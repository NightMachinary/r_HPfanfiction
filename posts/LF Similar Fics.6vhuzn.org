  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

*** Yeah, I saw this thread and couldn't really think of anything that wasn't snarky to say. Like, what does the OP mean by "stories similar to Wind Sheer?" Do they mean stories that are poorly written, badly paced, has shallow characters, and finishes with an unsatisfying ending? Because you can go to FFN, close your eyes and click randomly on the screen and find plenty of those.

**** It's funny, how when it came out, *Everyone* was sucking its dick, calling it a God of all fics. And now? Most of us hate it.
