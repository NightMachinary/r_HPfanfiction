  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings.

Absolutely a recommended read. Author updates often, around twice a month, I think?


** he updated twice in the same day ?

EDIT: Oh, nvm, you're talking about the last one, 14hrs ago. I was hyped but then deflated like a balloon.

** I like this story until chapter 14 and the conversation with Luna. It was such an idiot ball thing to do I couldn't continue. "Oh the girl I know can see the future told me not to let the Dark Lord from WWII know my secret. Oh well, fuck that. I have questions."

I had to drop it after that.

*** If this is really the biggest issue with my story I think I'm doing well.

At any rate I explained ad nauseum why Harry doesn't trust Luna completely. Because, get this, people can lie for their own benefit.

I'm actually slightly offended that you got past my dog shit basilisk scene and then this is what tripped you.

So for that reason Harry should trust Grindelwald instead of Luna. That's your main character holding the Idiot Ball to advance the plot. It's not wrong, it's not bad or evil, I just don't care to read it anymore.

Edit - Also, your main character reads minds. But he's going to trust the guy in prison he's never met face to face over the seer he has because - why? I still don't get that. I know your Harry discovered something that "Dumbledore knew" and didn't tell Harry, but you never explained that and once Harry decided to trust GG instead and carry around his shiny Idiot Ball it didn't matter to me anymore.

***** I'd say it's true that Harry wouldn't normally trust someone like Grindelwald. But this Harry is a pure academic, and Grindelwald has a lot of knowledge to share, so I feel like Harry knows Grindelwald can't be trusted easily, but the knowledge he can give Harry more than makes up for it.

***** I really don't know why you think Harry trusts Grindelwald much, he's using him to learn but he's well aware of who he is speaking to and getting knowledge/advice from. Also the circles Harry ran around in when trying to decide whether to do as Luna said or not were very clear cut, it was a no-win situation. For all he knew Luna was contacting him at his moment of indecision to push him into asking, thus gaining a more favourable outcome, or she was genuine and asking was a wrong move. Since Harry had no way of knowing for sure (because he was unable to read her mind and he has problems trusting people at their word without access to their mind because of how ingrained that is to his own character and due to his shitty upbringing) he just decided to fuck it and do what he wanted to do and let the outcome fall as it will.
