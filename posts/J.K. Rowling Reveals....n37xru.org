** That could be interesting, I think. Would this Remus tell about Sirius being an Animagus? Probably.

And Harry probably would have to hide the Map better if he got to keep it. Would it even be a good idea to keep it? Considering now there are two personalities there that could want to actually harm him (not that we know how or if the real people's personalities were reflected by those representations).

Would he even teach the Patronus charm to Harry?

Would Sirius be blindsided? Would he believe Lupin to be innocent? Because he would have been justified in not telling Remus anything in the first place, but if he believed what Lupin told him in the Shack, then the whole mess would probably be even messier. By the end of the book would they know or by the fifth book there is another Voldemort's spy in the Order?

(And this is not even considering how dumb Voldemort was. How was Snape even able to keep spying? In this scenario at least that could have been made less weird. He wouldn't be a spy, or Voldemort would let himself be thought deceived while having an actual spy.)

Ok. So now the whole thing is too complicated and I don't want it anymore.

*** Anything could happen. Pettigrew could be caught, Sirius exonerated and Remus be the faithful servant who helps in Voldemort's ritual... That would be the best case, with still so much potential for everything going the wrong way...

*** I'm still thinking about this (but that's okay, not a lot of time has passed).

Would the confrontation in the Shack even happen in this scenario? I think I still want to know.

** This is a fanfic group. You don't have to preface your ideas with “Rowling reveals” to get people here to pay attention to them. No one cares about her anymore anyway.
