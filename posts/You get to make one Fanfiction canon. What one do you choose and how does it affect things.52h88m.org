** Unlike A Sister, purely to see the fandom implode with impotent rage.

But for a real answer, or a copout answer depending on how you look at it, probably the Alexandra Quick series because it would be an interesting addition to Potterverse canon without interfering in Harry's own story.

**** Don't get me wrong, I like UaS, it's definitely one of the better H/Hr fics out there and easily the best canon-compliant one. That being said, considering how people reacted to a misquoted JKR interview, canonised adultery would induce a collective fandom stroke. It'd be the best troll since Metal Gear Solid 2. The memes, [[/u/RUN-DMZ]], think of the memes!

*** This was one of the best fics I've read recently. The end of the 7th book and the epilogue can leave you feel pretty empty. 'And nothing changed and they lived happily ever after. Also here are the terrible pairings and their terrible children's names.'

** This is a tricky question because it automatically rules out anything except canon-compliant fics, of which there are only a few. You're essentially limited to "missing moment" fics and post-epilogue continuations (or epilogue-compliant post-Hogwarts continuations).

With that in mind... yeah I've got nothing.

** This is so so hard. My gut instinct was to pick [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][TURN]] because it isn't that divergent from Canon (it's post epilogue) and I love the characters in it SO MUCH.

But I think I gotta go with [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1124404/chapters/2266336][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]] which is a time travel fix-it fic that uses multiverse theory. It is the ultimate fan service to do a good fix-it, and it feels oh so good, but without getting spoilery, this fic doesn't fix everything and is bittersweet and perfectly ended.

*** Can you give me a summary of TURN, doesn't matter if it spoils the ending? I've heard people recommend it but I'm not a fan of certain non-canon pairings so not sure I'd like it. PM if you don't want to spoil it for anyone else. Thanks.

**** Sure! TURN is a good story with wonderful writing but it isn't really a mystery or anything so I'm not too worried about spoiling anyone.

Okay so the general plot is that Harry is living his life with Ginny as described at the end of DH and he loves his family and is not unhappy exactly but he's trudging through his job and marriage and his only joy is really his kids. In a night of drunken hanging out with a weird old man wizard, he is given a "glimpse" into what his life would have been like had he chosen to try to turn Draco to the good side 6th year after cursing him in the bathroom (mild spoiler- he and Draco are married). Once he experiences that life and how good it could have been (although not perfect because his kids were never born) he knows he has to change his present life. Changing his present day life isn't easy but it's a satisfying story with incredibly well written, nuanced characters. No bashing of anyone and some truly hilarious scenes when he tries to date Draco back in his world.

** Exile by Benny Bear or linkffn(6432055). It details the life of Draco Malfoy after the war as he flees into the Muggle World. It provides an introspective look into what the Muggle world seems like, it averts destroying the epilogue completely with the possible change of Draco's wife. It also averts Dramione, Drarry, or Drinny. It also provides a calm outlook after the war instead of trying to ramp the action up. Seriously, this is my favorite fanfiction, if anybody knows of any fiction like it, hit me up.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

Probably wouldn't affect much other than maybe (maybe?) quieting down the James/Snape haters, as I think it generally does a pretty good job of painting both Snape and James' respective strengths and flaws.
