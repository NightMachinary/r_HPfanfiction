When I was a kid I played a lot of dice and chance based baseball and football. I'm working on coming up with a system to simulate either Quodpot (based on rules I made up for a story I wrote) or Quidditch.

My idea is that I will simulate a league and post "Sports Page" style stories with stats and standings. Maybe in the future I could create a podcast of radio broadcasts of games.

I don't have the patience to write full length narratives, but I figured this might be fun.
