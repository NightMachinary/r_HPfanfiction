I am getting in that mood to re-read the series, but I want to hold off for a couple of years. So instead I want to start reading fan fictions. Anyone have any recommendations for some fan fiction that takes place after the war and is canon-compliant? Preferably finished fan fictions.


** linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided)

An excellent story by Inverarity, who also authored the Alexandra Quick Series. I generally don't really like Next gen fics that much, but this one was one of the most engrossing reads in HP fanfiction.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

*** I just finished reading this and it was excellent. Thanks for the recommendation, I found the plot very compelling.

The only thing that bugged me was the use of the word toleration instead of tolerance. I found it to be distracting. I kept saying “What... in... toleration?” in my head every time I saw it.

  You feel like your life could have ended that April, like you weren't just locked in a house with old Aunt Muriel, but locked inside yourself as well. Kept to wither slowly, to age and fade away and to be forgotten. But you can't forget, and you can't move on, and there's no one to help you cross the threshold out of that house, out of this cage of your own body.  Ginny's stuck and Harry's in love. Maybe together they can make something out of this mess.
