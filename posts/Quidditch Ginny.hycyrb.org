:END:
I'm not sure if there are any fics like this, but if anyone knows any, pls let me know!

So, I'm looking for a fic where instead of getting onto the quidditch team part of her 4th year, and an official player her 5th year, she gets onto the Gryffindor team either her 1st or 2nd year.

I love Harry Potter quidditch stories, but I've never seen any like this with Ginny. So if anyone's read any fics where Ginny gets onto the quidditch team early, pls tell me! Thanks!

This fic and its sequels highly focus on Ginnys life and her rise in the quiditch school team and later on when she is professional.

But she is in Slytherin.

*** Thanks! I'll give it a go! And I've been giving this some thought, and I've come to realize that she would need to be in a different house other than Gryffindor, solely on the fact that there would be no spots until her 4th year, and 5th for chaser. So Slytherin will work. Thanks!
