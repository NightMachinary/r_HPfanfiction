Fanon Ran always seems so fickle, what about if Ron stuck by Harry's side during the Goblet of Fire or a different controversial event as he had faith in Harry while Hermione's logic led her to believe that Harry was at fault? Only for her to return later and apologize, forcing her to make things up to repair her friendship.

** Yes, please! Skip the "making up" part, though. Too many fics shoehorn Hermione into a friendship that only happened because of a well-timed troll, with two people with whom she has a personality conflict that flares up at least once a year and no interests in common whatsoever.

In GoF (or, better yet, PoA), it's not too late for Hermione to start making friends with Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. If Harry and Ron need her help with something in the future, they can trade favours or something.

Yeah, but try telling this to her stans. Hermione has to be a prefect princess who might make a mistake or two but it's for a good cause, it's the only way that her admirers can cope, right [[/u/heff17][u/heff17]] and [[/u/Uncommonality][u/Uncommonality]] ?

Honestly though, I have never seen Hermione bashed as hard as Ron or Ginny have been in fanfics. Fics on the level of HP and the Champion's Champion or pstibbons' work. But you can't tell that to Hermione stans because they'd play the 'Hermione is perfect' card, or the 'She was right for the bird attack! Who cares about MoRon?'. If they can show me some fics where she's bashed as hard as I've seen Ron, let me know. Please let me know.

In fact, I feel like [[https://pstibbons.livejournal.com/5917.html#comments][these]] [[https://pstibbons.livejournal.com/7444.html#comments][posts]] can help them take their stannery to the next level. It has everything they like, Badass!Hermione and tortured Ron. And girl power, can't forget that.

***** I'll never understand how people think that any one "fanon" character exists. There are trends, yes, and they're /usually/ built on extant stories, but "fanon hermione" doesn't exist. All you're doing is mesh together all your favourite tropes and say that that's her character, despite that not being the case.

As for your "mary sue" claim, I'm just going to say that the term "mary sue" has become synonymous with the person saying "I don't like powerful/knoweldgeable women as protagonists". I don't see you complain vehemently about the (much more prevalent) 'godlike/super smart/super powerful'-harry genre. In my experience anyone who uses the term "mary sue" nowadays usually harbours sexist tendencies (see rey hate, hermione hate, etc).

** Turn it on its head:

Harry couldn't believe that all of Hogwarts had shunned him. Again. You'd think that after being wrong the last time they had learned, but, well, wizards. He heard his only remaining friend, Hermione talking with someone he couldn't recognize.

"Hermione, how can you stay friends with that liar?!"

"Liar? He's not lying. Honestly the only thing worse than his ability to lie are his marks. He /couldn't/ have entered himself. While he might have the power, he doesn't have the brains. It's a shame, really, all that potential going to waste."

Harry cuts Hermione out of his life. Starts doing better in school--just to spite her. Eventually, after she continually harangues him about ending their friendship "for no reason" and how he shouldn't be dallying in dark magic to do (I dunno) intelligence-enhancing rituals or some such nonsense, he cuts her off and just says that he wants to better himself because, after all, it'd be a shame for all of his potential to go to waste.

Hermione's (fanon) eidetic memory connects the two and she starts crying--not because she's sorry, but because she was found out. And also to emotionally manipulate him into feeling bad for "making her cry" and get him to forgive her.

Yeah, cause that's what those were. Just small fights any of us have with our close friends.

Whether this place wants to hear it or not, abandoning a friend twice in four years that had the threat of death upon him, once in the middle of a goddamn war where you're one of three people in the country properly fighting to end it, is fickle. It's also a whole lot of other worse words. It's especially laughable that he gets such a pass when Hermione is there the entire time, a walking, talking counter-argument to ‘abandoning your friend under the threat of death is totally what loyalty looks like'.

And also, please, Hermione is the queen of passes. She always has logical/understandable/smart reasons for what she does when they are not-nice. Ron doesn't get to do that but what's so believable about Harry and Ron is that misunderstandings/terrible arguments DO happen between best friends through the years and coming out of it each time makes the bond stronger. And like it was stated earlier, the ‘second abandonment' was Horcrux induced.

Fanon has abused Ron. Because people want to identify with Hermione or Harry so badly when really, they are more similar to Ron who...what do you know? He struggled with childish jealousy on his worst days.

****** This is not a debate on whether or not Ron is a realistic or relatable character. He isn't for me, since I didn't abandon friends at their lowest when I was a teenager, but I get that a lot of people here feel that hit close to home apparently.

Regardless, Ron being fickle might be more relatable than the others, but it doesn't make Ron any more loyal. And like it was stated earlier, Hermione is standing right there, horcrux in hand, not abandoning the fight in the middle of a war. There's a word for that, you know. It's called desertion. That Ron has personality faults that made it easier for to do it doesn't make his abandonment excusable.

Yes, fanon turns any fault they can get their hands on and turns it up to 11. But it seems only with Ron do people want to entirely ignore the fact that he has the fault in the first place. Ron is the only main character to look at Harry and say ‘I don't believe you and I think you're not worth supporting', and he does so twice. You can try to dance around that all you like, but at the end of the day that's not loyalty. That's being fickle with your friendship and trust.

***** Ron had more to lose than Harry or Hermione. Harry dies in the war, people will miss him for sure, but someone else can kill Voldemort.

Hermione dies, her friends will miss her, sure, but her parents minds were wiped by herself, to protect them.

Ron, had more people to mourn him, more to lose. He was a blood traitor, his family and friends would have been killed/tortured right in front of him to make a point out of blood traitors.

They're also TEENAGERS! Teenagers. Teenagers fighting in a war that not one of them is ready for. (As much as I love Dumbledore, I also blame him for not sharing more info on what he thought the Horcruxes were/where he thought they were located).

Harry and Hermione are only the only child in their families, Harry never really loved his aunt, uncle and cousin. Hermione loved her parents and that's why she sent them away.

Ron, always had his parents and siblings by his side, of course he'd succumb to his wants and desires of wanting to see his family.

****** I'm not necessarily agreeing with the person you're arguing against, but I do find your argument lacking in its logical throughline. Let's break this down:

Harry:

-Has no living relatives that he truly cares about, does have the Weasleys, Rong, Hermione, and Remus/Tonks along with a few others he cares about

-Overall with the wizarding world he's had a pretty shit experience, being ostracized by the school multiple times, slandered by the Ministry, had the Ministry try to assassinate him, being forced to compete in the TWT, etc

-Has a personal vendetta against Voldemort because he killed Harry's parents and has continued to make Harry's life hell by trying to kill him

Hermione:

-Her parents are safe and sound in Austrailia

-Basically has the same relations that Harry does, but other than Harry and Ron possibly has less of a connection to those people

-Also has had a pretty horrid experience with the wizarding world since she started

Ron:

-Has an entire family at risk if they lose this war

-Seems to have more friends than Harry and Hermione, or at least knows more people

-Was raised in the wizarding world, this is his entire culture at risk

Out of the three, Ron should be the most likely to stay. Maybe Harry, but that's just because Voldemort's targeting him. If he decided (and considering everything that's happened up to that point) to say fuck it and abandon the wizarding world, it'd be pretty justified. Same with Hermione. They're both outsiders who are used to living in the Muggle world and could probably easily get out if there and go abroad in the Muggle World before the war really started breaking out in Muggle Britain. They have the least amount to lose out of the three of them. Ron, on the other hand, has his entire family and culture at stake. He doesn't know much of anything about the Muggle world, and if they lose the war he has a lot more to lose than Harry or Hermione. This shouldn't be pushing him to abandon his task with them, this should be pushing him to carry on. He should be the most motivated one. Sure he might be homesick but he should know that if he doesn't complete the Horcrux hunt then he won't have a home to go back to. Him leaving made no sense unless you consider him a coward or something. Really I think it would have made a lot more sense for him to be the driving force between the three to keep them going, and instead we got a rehash of 4th year but on a much grander scale.

******* People seem to forget or ignore the fact that they're also teenagers. Ron never really had hardships, outside of wanting to be more rich to get more stuff.

As you said yourself, the Wizarding World is Ron's entire culture, he and his family are close, despite whatever Ron complains about with them (complaints are normal and even healthy among family members).

I have a mom, and two sisters. Outside of that, I have a huge immediate family on my mom's side, I'm also close to my mom's side of the family. Yes the Horcrux was largely to blame for Ron's influence, but at the same time, he's never been away from his parents in such an intense situation before, he's worried sick.

Plus the fact that his sister Ginny is the only Weasley left at Hogwarts, where several Death Eaters are, (They don't know Snape is on their side), of course he's beyond worried/scared, et cetra.

There's a lot of stress if they fail at destroying the Horcruxes, but Ron's also incredibly worried about his family as well. He wants to be there for Harry, but at the same time, everyone does have their breaking points. And yes it was largely the Horcruxes influences, I'm not denying that, but I also wouldn't be surprised if some of it was Ron himself, wanting to be with his family.

Voldemort and the DE never made any moves against the Weasleys throughout the war since despite being blood traitors they were still purebloods. They were still allowed to carry on with their lives and jobs. His family wasn't at risk even if they did lose the war considering Voldemort was pretty much in control of Britain and yet nobody bothered to attack the Weasleys.

Him getting caught on the other hand would lead to his entire family being captured due to him actively aiding Harry.

And that took him several months to figure out?

Did he KNOW that? Could he have been ABSOLUTELY AND PERFECTLY CERTAIN about that.

You are playing hindsight games here.

********* They attacked the burrow during the Wedding and left them all alive. The radios never mentioned any of the Weasleys dying. The last time he saw his family they were still alive(his dad) despite them rounding up all muggleborns. His sister(and himself) were still allowed to go to Hogwarts. Everything was pointing towards the Weasleys being left alone unless they started up trouble if not they would have been captured or killed in the last couple of months prior to Ron leaving. If Voldemort wanted them dead they had ample opportunities to do so and yet he never bothered.

The only thing certain at the time was that Harry didn't have a plan and they had just spent the last couple of weeks wasting their time without making any progress and that if Ron was caught his entire family would have been captured.

*** Ron had insecurities all throughout his life, wanting to be seen as different than his brothers and sister, wanting to be acknowledge more than just a Weasley, more than the best friend of The Boy Who Lived, and stuff like that.

Ron is so... normal, so easy to relate to, and yet people think of him as worse than Draco Malfoy, that makes no sense.

Ron was willing to sacrifice himself in first year, not knowing if the giant chess pieces would kill him or not. In third year, he stood on a broken leg, to protect Harry from Sirius, who Ron thought Sirius was a criminal. Ron, afraid of spiders, went to the Forbidden Forest in second year, despite/in spite of his fear of spiders.

Ron got the same grades as Harry, with like one or two differences, and yet people often write Ron as an absolute idiot who drools when he talks.

Canon Ron Is NOT fickle. He wants to be seen more than what he is, but that's very relatable. He has fears and worries, but that's not what I'd call fickle, that's very relatable.

**** THISSSSSSSSS. So much fax, no printer!

The way I relate to Ron - I like money. I'd like to be seen as different from all my fancy doctor and lawyer cousins. I love my family and my friends and I can be super selfish sometimes. I'm saying it rn, if World War 3 happened at this moment and my friends wanted to join the army, I'd bolt to stay with my fam and wave bye to my bestie as we are renewing our passports to go back to West Africa. And I wouldn't need a Horcrux to do it. But all jokes aside, Ron's actions have always seemed reasonable if you keep in mind that he is the teenaged last son of a large family.

***** I only have 2 siblings, but my immediate family is huge on my mom's side. We are a very close family, on my mom's side. I'd be willing to do anything for them. People also often seem to forget that Harry, Hermione and Ron are teenagers. Teenagers fighting in a war that they weren't ready for.

Harry had neglectful and abusive relatives, he's unfortunately used to being shunned by people.

Even Hermione, was bullied before Hogwarts, and not very liked before the troll attack, once she did get to Hogwarts.

Ron? Ron's whole life is the Wizarding World, that is his culture, he cares greatly for his family, despite/in spite of any arguments/complaints he has (hell complaints/arguments are very healthy to have with family members).

It greatly makes sense why he fled, stress getting to him, fearing about what was going on with his family, et cetra. And while the Horcrux did play a huge roll, in his decision, the Horcrux likely fed into his fears for the safety of his family.

Plus, Ginny was the only Weasley left at Hogwarts, a school being run by Death Eaters (They had no way of knowing that Snape was in fact a spy).

His behavior is so relatable, and yet it's like: Oh Ron's bad! Bad bad bad! No, he isn't. He's not bad at all.
