How to get back into writing a story you haven't touched in over a year?

when I write a story I write notes and make a basic plan on how I want the story to go including a basic idea of how I want it to end.The problem I have been having is that by the time I get to the second or third chapter I have already lost interest in the story and trying to write anymore for that story becomes a chore.

So any advice on How to finish the Final Daft of a story before losing interest?


** If a story doesn't interest you enough to write it, how can you expect readers to be interested in reading it? Every writer knows how hard it can be to sit down and write at times, especially with a busy life, but if you lose interest and never want to pick it back up it might be a good idea to let the story go.

However, if you're really determined there are a couple things you can do.

First, change where and when you write. If you used to write in the evenings inside, perhaps try writing outside in the mornings. Sometimes a change of scenery or routine can help break the mind out of a rut. This isn't limited to writing.

Skip ahead in the story. Write your favorite upcoming scene instead of writing the next one. Sometimes when I do this I realize that the scenes that are boring me aren't really necessary at all and would bore the reader too.

Hide your outline and write based on ideas you come up with on the spot. Some of it will be usable, most of it probably not, but you still wrote something and it's possible you'll discover a story direction that interests you more.

Write at least one paragraph per day. The hardest part is getting started and you might be surprised by how many times the brain keeps flowing when you didn't expect it too.

Limit distractions. Turn the phone off, disconnect internet, whatever. Breaking immersion while writing is ten times worse for me than breaking immersion while reading.

Write something else for a bit and come back. Some writers function better with variety. I am more excited about writing when I have a serious project and a relaxed project to choose from, depending on my mood.

And finally, if you aren't getting paid don't make yourself miserable. If you want to write 150 words and stop, that's fine. The only thing you'll accomplish otherwise is the creation of memories that further discourage you from writing again.

*** Its not that I don't want to write the story its that i would much rather be reading it thats the problem.

I only started posting one story before realising thats not for me I like to go back and edit everything every time I finish a chapter(about every 3000 words).and i cant do that if I have started posting it.

You are not shipping printed books, you are uploading stuff to a website and can change it at any time. Otherwise, most stories would be riddled with small inconsistencies, spelling mistakes (spellcheck and betas don't catch everything) and so on. In most cases, people won't even notice minor changes, because let's be honest here, if you change the colour of curtains somewhere, no one will remember how it looked in the first place. 1 out of a thousand readers might go back to look something up, will see that it is not how he/she remembers it (because you edited it) and shrug it off.

I think none of my published chapters hasn't been updated at least 5 times after posting. Sometimes it is just a missing linebreak, sometimes it is an entire scene that get's a mayor revamp.

**** Why not? I've seen authors posting a new chapter in a COMPLETED story explaining that they've made changes in chapter X, Y and Z.

If they can do it and get away with it, then you can do it after posting the first or second chapter.

Or... you feel the need for a beta without knowing that's what you feel.

** Try the in-media-res approach where you jump right in the "action" while supplying what happened before through dialogue and other forms of exposition. That way you get to write the "juicy" bits without having to go through a few chapters of filler. For example, say you want to have someone befriend Harry after OotP but your main plot begins at Slughorn's party, where Harry and the friend show up together. Begin there and drop a couple of lines casually mentioning how they became friends, for example when someone asks this question. Harry became emancipated in Sirius will? Tonks taught Harry Occlumency? Can be explained afterwards, we don't need to see everything in order for it to happen.

You can also use this to write just the part you already figured out. Do you want to write a story where Harry has a nice summer for once? Do just that, limit the fic to the story you want to tell. Writing how that summer would impact Harry's next year lost your interest? Then don't force yourself to write that but limit your plot to the things you already figured out. It's called an open end.

Another approach would be to publish what you have written and use the reviews as motivation, especially if you are planning some surprising twists. That has been a great motivation for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12774582/1/Dawn-of-Darkness][Dawn of Darkness]], because the reviewers all comment on how they already figured out the plot and I am just laughing at them, thinking "Not even close". The desire to see the reactions of people can be a huge motivation, especially if they don't see things coming.

*** I don't much like to encounter the first idea as a /reader/ (though certainly, if it's a dispirirted author, it's better than nothing), but I highly support the third point as a writer. Reviews are definitely a big part of what keeps me going.

** If you haven't even looked at it for a long time, read it from the beginning. It will probably fire you up again. If it doesn't engage you after a break, then you should ask yourself why. But the bigger question of "How to finish the Final Daft of a story before losing interest?" Well, you don't really. You keep plugging away even though you don't feel like it and eventually you get it finished. Writing a story Is hard work and anyone who says it's not isn't doing it properly. If you can't maintain a long fic perhaps you should stick to shorter stories and one-shots.
