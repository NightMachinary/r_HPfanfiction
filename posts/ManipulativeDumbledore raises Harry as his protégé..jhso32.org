Harry learns how to potion, steal from vaults and ruin lives from the great master himself!

EDIT: You can also have Harry inherit Dumbledore's 'legacy' after his death.


** ‘Have you got anything you wanted to tell me?' Dumbledore asked in Harry's second year. The boy looked up at him, and he took the opportunity to scan his mind. From last year, he gathered Harry was cunning but fundamentally good, unlike Draco, another candidate. Hermione, although a good liar and indisputably brilliant, seemed to lack the ability to think on her feet. Weasley, a decent strategist, lacked the drive and, frankly, the cleverness. Harry, though... could become his heir, carry on the battle after he was gone. ‘No sir,' Harry said, proving himself a capable liar to boot. Well, that just settled it. ‘Please come to my office at four next Saturday,' he replied, keeping his face blank.

That Saturday, Harry came in the office to see a rather big and dusty kettle, several ingredients and a hot cup of what he /hoped/ was tea, but looked like someone had warmed up pee. ‘Ah, Harry,' Dumbledore beamed up at him. ‘I heard from professor Snape your grades leave something to be desired, so I have taken the liberty of borrowing some stuff to teach you.' And so it continued. ‘Harry, I think you could learn from history's great, what do you say we discuss Machiavelli Saturday afternoon over a cup of tea?' ‘Harry, I think you should get a bit more money, would you mind picking up the greatest white jewel in vault 116 while you're there?' ‘I think Ron and Hermione fancy each other, wanna encourage them a bit? A love triangle should help them realize their feelings...'

**** I'll put it in my fanfic Who is Moony (On AO3) if you're interested in reading it. New chapter next weekend! Gonna take a bit before Dumbledore meets Harry, but if you want a good but manipulative Dumbledore, that's gonna be in there before that! Watch, as he micromanages his staff. Enjoy his political battles with the pure bloods and reminding them of their schooldays!

I understand, why he's written that way, more, it's harder, to come up with interesting ways, when you don't want him as a good guy, but come on.

***** I personally prefer a good morally grey Dumbledore. People don't realize that he's capturing the death eaters because he has both the skill and it's practical. Dumbledore, were Voldemort mortal, would have definitely made an attempt to kill him during Order of the Phoenix, prophecy be damned.

It's the ministry that's incompetent beyond belief. A Dumbledore that is trying to cut out Voldemort's support without becoming a public outlaw would be great.

I really liked how Dumbledore was written in: My Dark Protector by DebsTheSlytherinSnapefan.

He's not the major character in it, but he has a good sized role in it.

  A Dark Protector rescues Harry from the abyss that he has only ever known. When Severus gets to Harry he isn't what they would have previously hoped. Life hasn't been kind to him, will Harry take to the magical world or will he always fear everything around him? Either way, Harry had a long way to go before they could determine this.

*** Well canonically he isn't really morally grey, he plays his secrets close at the end because a single whisper of the horcrux hunt would destroy the Wizarding world for sure, and because he doesn't trust Harry to hunt them with the knowledge that he is hastening his own end. Apart from those two moments of weakness he has canonically spent his life in atonement for succumbing to Grindelwald's words at a young age and preferred what is right to what is easy.

***** Iidk man, making a mistake isn't the same thing as being on the other side of good. We have a view of times Dumbledore made mistakes and they are mostly well reasoned if a bit naive, like expecting Sirius to just be OK with not going out of his old home for a year. People give him a lot of flack for supposedly knowing from Mrs Figg, but being disliked and living in a cupboard are kinda different, and as we know all the beatings etc are fanon.

And I really dk if we've read the same series, Dumbledore is basically a background for books 1-4 barely talking with Harry except to say good job on saving the world. In the 5th year Harry is ridiculously mad that Dumbledore WONT let him fight, and the 6th year comes with Harry specifically saying he wanted it to be him who took down Voldemort even if he'd die. He never coaxed Harry into anything.
