I was wondering if there are any decent Lily/Sirius fics, preferably without an existing relationship between Lily and James or Snape. I have seen quite a few stories where James or Snape cheat on her and then she chooses Sirius for some "payback" but that is not my cup of tea.


** Theres linkao3(Mischief Managed by Inell). Its a smut filled one shot but theres no preexisting relationships, no revenge hook ups, and its fairly well written.

** linkffn(I'm not the only one by Potato19) has this pairing but it's not a big focus of the plot. She was with James previously, but it was brief and we don't yet know why they broke up. Also she didn't go to Sirius to spite James, their relationship is a slow burn one and I personally find it really endearing.
