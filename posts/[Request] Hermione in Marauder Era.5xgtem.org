Hey y'all,

So glad I found this sub, I don't know how I managed without you untill now. Anyways, I'm looking for good fanfics about Hermione either time travelling or born in the marauders era. Something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/Roundabout-Destiny][Roundabout Destiny]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2255955/1/Bed-of-Roses][Bed of Roses]] (although it doesn't need to be HG/SB).

I know there are plenty of those but I'm having a hard time finding ones that are well written and aren't too OOC.

Would love to hear your suggestions.


** I'm on mobile, so I can't link, but I enjoyed One Hundred and Sixty Nine. It's on ffn, should be easy to find.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** The problem will be in what you consider 'Too out of character'. Often times what will happen is she gets born into a pure blood family and raised that way, while still being Hermione on a fundamental level. This basically creates a new character that's still recognizable, but very different from Canon characterization.

  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius and Regulus Black, and member of the Noble and Most House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.

Haven't read the third one though. Snape/Hermione sounds intriguing.

**** I feel like Snape/Hermione can get really bad really fast, but there are some that really stand out and work well, at least for me. I was very pleasantly surprised by 'One Step Forward,' and didn't realize at first that it was written by an author I was already familiar with (so bonus? lol).
