So I'm looking for pretty much anything SSHG.

After discovering the vast world of Harry Potter fanfiction last year (approximately ten years too late it would seem) I've been completely sucked into the Snape/Hermione ship. I've devoured everything I can find online and am getting bummed at the amount of broken links or missing fics I'm finding‚òπÔ∏è.

I'm hoping there's a fellow fan who has copious amounts of SSHG fics that have since been removed from the web stashed somewhere that they would be willing to share?

Pretty please??

Bonus points if anyone can point me in the direction of a fic I read last year that I haven't been able to find. It was post war, Hermione was staying at Hogwarts and it was Christmas time. She didn't have a lot of money and made everyone scarves. Snape confronted her and upon realizing she genuinely wanted to give him a gift they start spending time together and he realizes she's still suffering after effects from Bellatrixs curse. Happy times ensue.

Thanks!

Edit to add:

This link has loads of great recommendations but it was posted in 2009 and a lot of them aren't available.


** ONE OF US. ONE OF US.

Firstly, you are right. This ship set sail ten to fifteen (!) years ago. So there's a lot out there that was written pre-OOTP even. But it's all good fam.

I suggest starting with linkffn(pet project by caeria). We had our doubts that Caeria would ever finish but she DID and it is AMAZE. Pre-HBP, no horcruxes (that whole plot point really did come out of nowhere...) but really excellently written long fic.

Next I would suggest linkffn(unfinished business by Ramos) which is also pre-HBP/pre-OOTP but a beautiful story with a really great plot.

In broader terms, go to ashwinder.sycophanthex.com for an entire archive of SS/HG. It's an older archive sir, but it checks out. Everything by Shiv5468 is good. An Army of Snapes by ladyofthemasque is some good quality smut (iirc and I hope I do). With bonus plot! [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=9458]]

I had a quick glance through my favourites but it's been a while since I boarded this ship. I'll have a float around AO3 and see if I have other recs for you.

I hate it when people overdo recs, but really you won't regret trying Pet Project. It's just such a lovely read.

*** I have done a pretty thorough search on ashwinder but you gave me a few I either hadn't heard of or hadn't looks into before.

Pet Project was for me, like many I think, one of the ones that sold me on this pairing.

I read Hinge of Fate by Ramos, and I was so hoping she was going to finish Souvenir but she's made it pretty clear she has no intention to. I have bookmarked Unfinished Business as well as Shiv5468's author page. It's like Christmas!

I've read a couple things by ladyofthemasque but never did try out Army of Snapes, it too is on my list. (Smut is nice, not necessary but totally appreciated üòÜüëçüèª)

Thank you so much!

[[http://harmony-bites.livejournal.com/123760.html]] This user posted an awesome list of fics with details and summaries, it seems as if half of them are broken links or have been taken down.

It's depressing to think how many amazing stories were out there that authors took down for whatever reason. Or the links are so old they don't even know they're broken. I understand many authors remove their work if they're looking to establish themselves with a publisher, but some of the stories sound soooo good üò≠

I've read a lot, if I had been smart I would've started a master list, I suppose I should anyway.

I've seen this fic show up before in my journeys but never investigated, I think the idea of Hermione with a "gigolo" just threw me, but I will definitely check it out if you say it's great. I'm always a little leery be starting unfinished fics but it doesn't look like the author is going to be abandoning it.

I think the draw (for me) is the same as the draw is for any fans of Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice. Young, idealistic girl sees past the dark, sarcastic shell to the good man inside.

The beautiful thing about fanfic is you can explain away or change anything you want. Snape is most definitely an ugly, mean bastard in JKs world. But I've been lost in fanfic long enough now that he's just a misunderstood, snarky sometimes bastard in my eyes.

*** Male fan of SS/HG checking in. I have a fondness for romances in general though, and really like Victorian lit. Jane Eyre and David Copperfield are among my favorite novels, and each has characters that I'd consider prototypes of Snape. Of course, Mr. Murdstone in DC isn't the same sort of redeemed character that Rochester ends up being, but they're dark men nonetheless.

I know what Snape is in canon, but if I wanted to read canon I'd pick up the books. I don't think any character is ever really IC in fanfic (though many come very close) and as long as Snape retains a fair amount of darkness, sarcasm, and even his cruelty, I'll probably consider it a fair enough portrayal.

******** /(glances over at 3gb of archived fics)/

So I don't actually know /what/ I have in that file or how much of it is still available online, but if you name a fic (or point me in the direction of a list of names) then I can search what I've got.

I /do/ know I have at least 9 SSHG fics, but I've only read two of those so I can't speak either way as to the quality of the others. One of the ones I've read is "Married Alive" by Azazello, a 3k one-shot that's a grim take on marriage law stories. The other is "The Fire and the Rose", which is a 120k body-swap fic. I can't say how it stands up to the genre because it's the only one I've ever read, but I did enjoy it a lot. I also have the sequel to it, but I've not read that yet because I only discovered it just before witchfics.org went defunct and haven't got around to it yet. /(Looks mournfully at growing To Read list...)/

I did archive all of witchfics before it went down, including "Survivals and Rememberances" and "The Other Side of Darkness", both of which I believe have been mentioned as pretty good SSHG, although I've not read them myself.

********* I can't believe I never saw a reply notification. Sorry.

I'm a big FF reader and could probably prattle off at least five or six sites off the top of my head but I've never heard of witchfics ever. Which makes me feel like I've been out of the loop, or I got old.

Not a single one of those titles ring a bell, but I've never read bodyswaps. I have read almost every marriage law fic I could get my hands on in this pairing between ffn and Ashwinder. I welcome anything new just about because I've exhausted ffn, Ashwinder, and what I found on Ao3 usually ends up being cross posted.

My biggest reads as far as pairings are: HG/VK HG/SS and HG/HP which I'm well aware is going to get me flamed to the highest mountains I bet. However, it's a good couple when the story is done right. Portkey.org has a number of high quality stories in its archive.

** Welcome! I too, also discovered HP fanfiction quite late (3 years ago for me). SS/HG is one of the pairings that I enjoy reading.

As far as recs, it's an older rec page on LiveJournal but many of the classics are there and maybe you'll find something good. There are a TON of links on each page:

[[http://borg-princess.livejournal.com/84073.html][Borg Princess's Recs - Part 1]]

[[http://borg-princess.livejournal.com/84434.html][Borg Princess's Recs - Part 2]]

Sometimes you can find new things to read from the SS/HG Quiz (also on LiveJournal). It's a quiz where you are given quotes within a theme (Snow) and you have to guess the fic the quote is from. Just click on the link for *Answers* to see the links to the fics used for the quotes. I have found some good, obscure Time Travel fics this way (my favorite SS/HG trope). The last Quiz was posted in 2014.

[[http://quiz-sshg.livejournal.com/201741.html][2014 Quiz Master List]] (with links to Quizzes back to 2007)

Lastly, LiveJournal does still have a semi-active SS/HG page. There aren't many posts each day but if someone does post something, people are really good about answering. A few SS/HG fic authors browse/post on that page as well. You will most often find people who are looking for recs there as it is the rec page but people will post other stuff there as well.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
