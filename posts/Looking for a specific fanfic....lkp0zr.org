:END:
Hello folks,

A few years ago, I read a HP fanfiction and would like to find it again. It's the only fanfiction I've ever read though, so I'm not doing well at tracking it back down. I know there are a gazillion out there, so this is likely fruitless, but here goes...

It's a retelling of Deathly Hallows, but with Hermione and Draco at the center. The Death Eaters are in control of the government and mudbloods are being murdered left and right so Hermione is on the run. Somehow, she partners up with Draco, they bone some, and the end battle is awesome. I can't recall if Harry and Ron are dead or if they're off gathering horcruxes.

Again, I know that's probably the base plot to tons of fanfics, but if anyone can even point me in the right direction, I'd be grateful!
