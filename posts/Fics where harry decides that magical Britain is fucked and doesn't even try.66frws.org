You know where he looks at the shit that takes place there and goes fuck it I'm going to Salemor some shit.

Because really, does harry need to be a masochistic phsychopathic schitzophrenic madman with megalomaniacal tendencies.

Saving the bigoted shitheads us not his job nor responsibility and he does not need to come back for a bullshit prophecy by a fucking madwoman.

Also, des he need to be an utter moron?

Ttfn

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

Told in the POV of Lucius but don't let that put you off! It's a really good read about an alternative Britain under the control of Death Eaters.

  What if Harry had reacted more strongly to the Ministry's threat to expel him and snap his wand? What if he had fled the country rather than submit to the trial?

** A while ago I finished such a fic where Harry, eventaully says fuck it all and goes to finish his education in a magical school in the states. There he meets a girl named Sophie and long story short, Harry is now an America-based wizard. I don't recall the name though.

EDIT: The story was called The Final Straw, by Belerephon30 (and also had a an alt take on the story called The Brave New World) but I can't find them anywhere anymore.
