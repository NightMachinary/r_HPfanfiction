What bothers you the most about fanon vs canon?

For me, it's the Weasleys; obviously they have their flaws (Molly's overbearing, Ron's insensitive, Ginny was a fangirl) in canon, but in fanon, it's blown out of proportion until they're just caricatures of their very, very worst traits, (Molly becomes a neurotic, manipulative cow, Ron's a bigoted, dumb, violent git, and Ginny's irrational, obsessive and will sleep with anything that moves).

Some fanon's great - it's logical, and it's interesting - but some of it is just ridiculous, and starts to change the way people view canon events and characters until they're no longer distinguishable... so what frustrates you?

** I think Luna must be hard to write, because I haven't seen many fics where she's actually the right kind of kooky. She isn't all-knowing, she can't see the future, and she isn't really insane. She's just ruthlessly optimistic, doesn't bother with social norms, and is into conspiracy theories. It's annoying when the plot depends on her knowing things she could never possibly know with no explanation.

Someone also mentioned magical cores... In some stories, if you do too much magic at once, you can die. If that were really an issue, don't you think that would have been brought up? I like when authors try to add depth to the canon, but it has to be plausible.

*** The most common complaint among fanfic authors is "Luna is fucking impossible to write". She is the second most complex character in canon (after Snape), but the one with the most foreign mindset to... uhh... anyone? She doesn't think with hate, conformism, ego, anger and pessimism /at all/ - how is someone supposed to channel that personality into writing?

**** I've have trouble writing Luna too, but I keep coming back to her portrayal in Stages of Hope. I think Silverstorm nailed it because she was digging for the underlying damage in Luna's character.

She's not that kid in school who's weeaboo kooky, and I hate when she's portrayed that way. She's the kooky kid who's had a rough life growing up, and so that's how she's adapted, like shutting out the real world (which she's done). But her kooky mask only drives people away, so she retreats further into her shell. It becomes a cycle.

She's been projected upon by readers as being completely insightful, to the point of being cast as a seer, but when you read the stories, the subject she mostly comprehends relate to loss and loneliness, which she is most familiar with. I don't think she really opens up until the Weasley wedding (wearing yellow and dancing with friends and family) which ends in further tragedy and loss. Then she gets kidnapped and, probably, tortured.

She doesn't break then, but I don't think it's because she's wise, but because she's hard.

*TLDR: I think Luna is hard as fuck.*

***** I'm going to go look for that story now. In school, people would make jokes about me saying because I was quiet, I must be a ticking time bomb or something, and the bad depictions of Luna strike me as a similar sort of misjudgement. Her experience with loss makes me think she would be a good match for Harry, though. Whenever they talk, they always understand each other.

***** It's like she takes in the world around her and is very much emotionally present, but she filters it in such a unique way that people think she's living in a different world. She's not the least bit naive, and she feels loss and pain just as deeply as anyone else.

Stages of Hope is the best portrayal of the character of Luna that I think I've ever seen in a fanfic. It's an amazing portrayal of an amazingly complex character that's extremely difficult to write. The moment where she gets halfway through one of her stories and then breaks is absolutely heartwrenching. As a reader, I think that's the moment where I stopped feeling sorry for all of them and started mourning them.

** In canon i really disliked the fact that Harry ended up with Ginny for the sole reason of Ginny not being described very much. We did not know a lot about her other than she is Ron's sister and she plays Quiddich. Other than that i disliked how little Remus was in the story. He was introduced as one of Harry's fathers friends but after third year he is barely heard from. You would think that Harry would have kept up beeter contact with him.

Now for fanon i really dislike when the sole purpose of the plot and all of the conflicts are solved by super politician Harry. He grew up in the muggle world and therefore would have no idea about pureblood tradition. Also i am against slash. Nothing against those who are gay or enjoy slah i just don't think Harry would have become gay. It just isnt my thing.

*** Completely agree. Ginny is never really described enough to explain why harry ends up with her and loves her. It has been a while now since i read the 6th book but i just feel their relationship is never portrayed in a way that you get an idea why they should end up together.

While I do really enjoy the super political Harry stories and when the politics are explained, it does bug me when it is too easy. Harry is always portrayed as suddenly being super politically savvy (often with the help of some key mentors) and going against the manipulative Dumbledore. I really wish fics included Harry making political mistakes or being outsmarted as well. THey always try to portray Dumbledore as the poltical genius who has been 'ruling' the wizarding world for decades, yet he is outsmarted and brought down in a couple months? No. It would so much more intriguing for me if Dumbledore also still had a couple tricks up of his sleeve and also other political actors came into play.

again agree with the not liking slash. for me it almost always causes me to stop reading the story immediately. Only slash pairing I don't completely mind is Sirius/Remus in a more paternal role.

** I hate Weasley bashing. I love all of them and I feel that people turn on them just because they can't think of a creative way to put in an antagonist. If you're going to change their personality, give a plausible reason. In a fic I wrote, I had Ron get hit by a curse that messed up his mind and personality, so he developed this strange split-personality. In the end, he got help and slowly turned back to who he was. But I didn't do it simply because I needed an antagonist; I wanted to add an emotional aspect to his relationship with Harry and Hermione.

I also despise how people always pair students with teachers or incest fics. Fred banging George? Not cool. Hermione suddenly falls in love with Snape? Unbelievably creepy. It makes me feel gross.

In fanon, I hate it when people have Draco instantly become a good guy and best friends with Hermione, Harry, and Ron. I don't ever see him behaving friendly with Ron, civil yes, but not friendly. At least give some explanation, write a prologue, or add some detail as to why he changed sides, how, and explain the struggles he went through to become who he is now.

Last one, I hate in fanon how Hermione always becomes ths gorgeous woman. I always write her as lovely but plain, I give her a softer tummy, smaller/average boobs, etc. I hate how people turn her into a beauty queen that the whole school spontaneously falls in love with. She's not supposed to be gorgeous, she's supposed to be realistic and human. She doesn't suddenly grow DD's or decide to dress like a skank. She's modest, intelligent, and simple.

**** I wholly agree. Although I do imagine Ginny as being a bit more fashion-conscious than Hermione due to her circle of friends, but it's a matter of cost for her. She seems to have been rather popular and liked, so I think she might be more aware of fashion and beauty than Hermione, who is as lost as a Malfoy in an Apple store.

I like to think that as Hermione aged, she became a little more fashion forward, although not without some help from Ginny. But during school, there is no way she would hike up her skirt, sport a Louis Vitton bag, or suddenly know exactly how to wear make-up. The only thing I think of her knowing is how to tame her hair.

***** I slightly disagree with saying Hermione could not develop a sense of fashion or makeup while at school, and that ginny would be essential for her being more fashion forward later. I don't think she could live in dorm with Lavender and Parvati for 7 years and not observer/talk about fashion at all. Also i think it is kind of implied with the Yule Ball scenes that Hermione can dress up (which implies makeup i think). Furthermore you must also remember she goes home during the summers(while we don't have much insight in her home life and her mom being a dentist might not place utmost importance on fashion), you can't rule out that her mom doesn't educate/influence her in this regard.

While I don't think Hermione suddenly being fashionable and gorgeous is realistic in stories. I don't think it is farfetched to portray her as placing importance on fashion and her appearance if she has a crush/love interest or something.

****** I agree with that and I definitely overlooked what you brought up. Silly me. I guess I was just thinking of her as someone who tends to focus more on books and character, rather than looks. I also don't think she interacted much with Parvati and Lavender, I found their relationship to be awkward and a bit strained. She also seemed to spend a lot more time in the library or with the boys than in her dormitory. But it is possible, as you said, that she might have overheard a thing or two.

I can imagine her studiously, but secretly, looking up some fashion tips in magazines and books to prepare for a date or an event. And if Ron or Harry shows up, she frantically puts it away like a boy caught with porn, especially if they are younger.

For all we know, Hermione was this secret fashionista and knew the most about fashion out of the entire school, haha.

Btw, this is a really fun discussion. :) I'm quite enjoying it. Not many of my friends are big Harry Potter fans, so I love it when I find people with the same interests who I can talk to.

****** Boarding schools in general tend to be somewhat isolating in that respect. You can shop over the summer, but "going to the mall with your friends" isn't really a thing when you're in boarding school. And at most schools, there's not as much of an emphasis put on that kind of thing, though of course it still exists. Things like clothes, makeup, and hair products tend to be shared a lot as well. Hogwarts doesn't seem to be a big exception.

I think it's also fair to say that there's a difference between dressing nicely and being fashionable/caring about fashion. I definitely see Hermione's mother as the type to try to buy her daughter clothes and girly things in an attempt to bond and fill the void created by Hermione's lack of female friends. Plus she would want Hermione to present herself well. Mothers like that kind of thing. But Hermione has to want to care about things like makeup, and I don't know if she did.

I know girls who don't really give a crap, but their mothers buy them cute jackets and bottles of concealer, and they just sort of go with it.

*** I think it takes a certain amount of introspection and life experience to see the value of the Weasleys, specifically Ron. If you isolate the plot, it's easy to say that Harry and Hermione could probably get from point A to point B without Ron, therefore he is a useless character. But when you look at the trio as a whole, and the kind of people that Harry and Hermione are without him, you see Ron's value. It's the same thing with Mrs. Weasley. I think fans see her as getting in the way of the plot (i.e., in DH), which is fair, but you have to understand where she's coming from as a parent and really appreciate the support that she and her family provides for Harry.

Hermione takes care of what Harry needs intellectually, but the Weasleys as a whole provide for Harry emotionally and quite literally keep him sane.

And yes, when Hermione becomes a gorgeous woman. It bugs me when any of the characters suddenly decide that they love love hair and makeup and department stores. Somehow, I don't think that Ginny has a weakness for designer shoes, considering she grew up in rural (and magically isolated) southwest England and then went to school in rural (and magically isolated) northern Scotland.

**** It's when authors take canon Hermione and make every attribute ultra-mega, often to the point of ridiculousness:

- She doesn't just have a good memory, she has an eidetic one.

- She's not just pretty, she's exceptionally gorgeous, one of the most beautiful women attending Hogwarts.

- She's not just very smart, she's the most brilliant magical mind of all time.

- She's not just good at magic, she's the most powerful and accomplished witch in history and her magical feats are legendary.

- She's not just a very good student, she's the best that Hogwarts has ever produced.

- She doesn't just know how to play piano, she's a conservatorie musician able to master the most difficult classical pieces with verve and polish.

Any one or two of these might be fine, a bit of authorial license and not too great an extrapolation of canon. It's when an author employs most or all that it turns from being a story to a celebration of the Platonic ideal of Hermioneness.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/12/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][This story]] by [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] is an example of what I'd classify as Hermione-wank, though it's arguably the most readable story of this type. Most of it is /far/ worse.

** What I hate most about fanon is when authors justify house elf slavery by declaring that the elf's will die without a master. Hermione was right; just because the house elves seem to like being slaves, does not mean that it is ok. Compare it to a child that is brought up believing he is superior just because of his pedigree (Draco); belief that something is right does not make it so. I am fine with Harry hiring Dobby, but making Dobby once more a slave is wrong.

There's no genetic compulsion to serve God, but social pressure and very strict laws, combined with very poor living conditions and education, will ensure that faith is practically universal.

** Reverse answer- something I like in fanon, but dislike in canon, is Blaise Zambini. In a lot of fanfic, s/he is often an example of a "good" Slytherin, or at least a Slytherin who isn't automatically an ally of Malfoy and Voldemort. In the books, he's just kind of blah.

In one of my fics, I paired him with Luna and people loved it, which surprised me because it just randomly came to me.

All in all, I love him in fics because he's intelligent but not overly so, balanced, and, if well-written, be seen as a good companion for Draco if one seeks to make Draco a non-douchebaggy-baddie character.

Even if he wasn't described until book six, you would think Harry would have described him as "one of Malfoy's cronies" rather than just as a Slytherin boy that Harry disliked on principle. I got the impression that from his mannerisms that he was a bit snobbish, so I think that's why people characterize him as neutral and wanting to stay out of the fray.

** There is a post from a few days ago that ask what make you stop reading a fanfic, I knew that would be people complaing about the bashing of Ron, Ginny, Molly and Dumbledore. But I was surprise that there was no one trying to defend it (sorry if there is someone that defend it, but I didn't find it). If it is okay with every one I will not try to defend it, but I want to give my point of view.

I find easy to think that Dumbledore was a bad guy and manipulative for 2 reasons (I can give more but just 2 is enough) 1) He put a baby in care of a family that he doesn't know, and doesn't check the baby for 10 years. 2) Knows his parents killer is alive and doesn't prepare Harry to defend himself. (Which is something I don't like about canon Harry, someone try to kill you when you were a baby, find out that he is alive when you are 11 and start a group to pratice defense only when you are 15, why?)

When I read the books Ron wasn't my favorite character but I didn't complain, what I would do? Change the book? But when I start reading FF and see others opinion about Ron I start to really dislike him. He was/is lazy and jealous. Even if he did one or two things important, I believe that if he was a secondary character, Harry and Hermione would still defeat Voldemort.

The only thing that I don't like about Molly is that she seems like a narcissist mother "Ginny has to marry the boy-who-lived because that would make me happy!" "The twins have to stop the jokes because it gives a bad image to the family (i. e. Me)!" "All my children have to have a job in the Ministry because that would give a good image to the family (i. e. Me)!"

I am not gonna say anything about Ginny because I can see good and bad in her.

Again, this is just my opinion, and it is not the only kind of FF that I read. I read 2 or 3 FF that Ron is a good guy. If you say that you know two FFs for me to read, and in one there would have bashing and the other not. I would read both, but I would start reading the one with bashing.

#+begin_quote
  He put a baby in care of a family that he doesn't know, and doesn't check the baby for 10 years.
#+end_quote

The Dursleys ARE Harry's real family, and the only ones he has left. Just because you have advanced knowledge about them and the way they will treat Harry doesn't mean it's weird or wrong for Dumbledore to place an orphan with his family.

And even then, to conclude that this was all a giant conspiracy on his part rather than an honest mistake is really pushing the envelope.

Also, the guy is the headmaster of a school. He doesn't work for child's services, he doesn't work for the ministry, he's not Harry's Godfather, he doesn't actually have any right nor obligation at all to take care of random orphans.

#+begin_quote
  Knows his parents killer is alive and doesn't prepare Harry to defend himself
#+end_quote

By that logic, literally everyone in the entire world is guilty of this. You can't place this one on Dumbledore's shoulders as if it was solely his responsibility to train a kid. Also, like you said, canon Harry isn't exactly asking anyone for help either. He barely gets his normal schoolwork done.

**** Good now we are talking, usually when I try to talk about this, people just say that I am wrong.

I get what you are saying about focusing all the blame on Dumbledore, and I probably am. But he is the one with more power and knowledge about the situation to do something. Remus didn't do anything about either, and even if he tried what could he do? He was a werewolf, no power there :/ and anyone else (can't think of anyone now) that have the power to do something, probably didn't where Harry lived, even less what was his situation.

And if you asked "How can Dumbledore know what happen in the Dursley home?" Well, one person, Arabella Figg. She is their neighbor and a squib, IIRC she was put there by Dumbledore to keep check on Harry. Either she is crappy informant or Dumbledore see nothing wrong with her report.

And after Harry goes to Hogwarts? Why did Dumbledore keep sending Harry to the Dursley? I am not sure if he have to be the because of a ward or this is just something that I read on FFs, let say that it is true, Harry have to be with the Dursley, okay, but have to be there and have protection from the family it is two different thing. He could have done something to protec Harry from his family.

I really can't blame Dumbledore that he doesn't did anything to prepared Harry if Harry himself doesn't want to anything. I guess I will just be disappointed with both of them.

Remember that Petunia is obsessed with appearances. It's not like she advertises for the entire neighborhood that Harry is mistreated and sleeps in a cupboard. Arabella saw Harry several times in the neighborhood and he looked healthy enough to not raise immediate alarms. There's only so much she can do as a squib without being too obvious. I believe she genuinely didn't know.

She was most likely there to keep an eye out for other wizards and to alert Dumbledore if someone like Malfoy was snooping around Privet Drive.

There is indeed a very powerful bloodward around Privet Drive, that is canon.

And like I said before: Dumbledore does not actually have any official authority over the placement of orphans. If he placed Harry with another wizarding family, then someone like Lucius Malfoy could and would very easily snoop in and have Fudge give him custody over Harry. And we all know the ministry is corrupt enough to do just that. Placing him with his family is the only thing that no one can object to.

It's not like Dumbledore likes that Petunia is such a bitch, but what choice does he really have? He can't exactly Imperious them to be nicer to Harry.

I think that the real issue people have when they bash Dumbledore is, very ironically, that they respect him too much! They assume the man is literally an all-powerful super-wizard and that everything that ever happens was a deliberate plot that he planned all along. They think that Dumbledore engineered all the bad things to happen like a great chess-player who knows the entire board. Whereas in actuality, he is just a tired old man trying his best but making mistakes, just like any one of us. I believe that Dumbledore doesn't know about even half the things people blame him for.

They assume that he has a lot of power? Maybe, if you are talking about magic power, but if you are talking abou politic power:

#+begin_quote
  Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, [...] Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Professor Dumbledore also served as Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards (?--1995) and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot (?--1995; 1996-1997) [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore][Source]]
#+end_quote

He had *three* important political positions *at the same time*, he could have done something. I believe if something like this happen it would be enough:

/"What are you doing here? I don't want any of your people here at my house!" said Vernon glowering at Dumbledore./

/"I just came here to say something" said Dumbledore, looking calmly into the eyes of Vernon "Harry is an important person to me, to the wizard world, and we will keep an eye on him, to be sure that he is not in danger."/

/And Vernon, using all his brain, could understand what he is saying. There will be wizards looking for Harry, and he coulnd't know when they will be looking, because they could be using magic./

It wouldn't be necessary to have someone (e.g. an auror) there be sure Vernon wouldn't do anything, the fear of having someone watching it would be enough to make Harry life easy.

And, again IIRC because I am not sure if this happen in canon or just in FFs, he have the Order of the Phoenix keep an eye on Harry.

Now back to Arabella, IIRC (I read the books 7-10 years ago) one of the description of Harry in book one was that he was *malnourished*, for me that is one big red exclamation mark that something wrong is happening, and if she was there to keep Harry safe, not only from Death Eaters and bad wizards, she could look at window of the house to see how he is going (I can go an keep looking at my neighbor for an hour now if I wanted to).

******* It's not a conspiracy and Dumbledore's not really a gigantic jerk. He just comes off as someone who was born in the 1800s (which he technically was). You know, the era when confining someone to a bed for days on end was a thing (seriously, go read The Yellow Wallpaper), mental health was a weird concept better left to Freud and his buddies, locking someone up to keep them safe was a perfectly acceptable solution and child abuse was this secret best kept in the family.

Considering how ass-backwards the Wizarding World can seem at times, it's entirely plausible that Dumbledore was a victim of a social mores of his time. One only has to look at Ariana Dumbledore's treatment and Sirius Black's confinement to see the parallels. Just because a man is /better/ than his society and culture does not mean that he is a better /person/ than everyone else.

So he kept Harry lock up in the Durleys home to keep him safe, okay, I can understand that, but the moment that he left him with the Dursley he isn't keeping him safe anymore.

I guess I am just angry that he didn't go the extra mile, if he want to keep Harry safe from the bad wizards, why not keep him safe from everyone?

Another thing that I don't like about Dumbledore is that is seems he doesn't trust anyone. He always knew, or at least guess, about the Horcrux, but didn't ask anyone help. If you can trust your back in a fight to someone else, why not ask him for help?

********* I don't think Dumbledore truly comprehends how horrible the Dursleys are. It's a combination of that 1800s logic and magic. Magic fixes a lot of things so wizards don't really have the same kind of concern for their children's well-being that we do.

Just look at Neville. His Uncle Algie dangled him out of a window and dropped him when he got distracted by dessert. What if he had actually been a Squib?

But no, wizards don't think about things like that because magic instinctively kicks in and keeps them from dying from accidents like this.

Look at Quidditch. Bludgers are made out of solid iron. And the whole point of a Bludger is to hurt the player. Sure, it's not sporting to swing it into someone's face, but iron balls that slam right into you aren't exactly things that a non-magical person could just shake off.

My point is, I think Dumbledore never gave the Dursleys much thought because well, how much damage could a Muggle do lol. That, and the fact that mental health is a foreign concept to him basically meant that the Dursleys' abuse was never going to be a priority when compared to Voldemort's capacity for muder.

*********** Dumbledore has trust issues because he never actually has an equal. It is a fact that he's the most powerful wizard in the story and quite possibly the most intelligent. Grindelwald was the only man that could stand before him as an equal. Before meeting Grindelwald, there was no one who could interact with him at the same level, so I assume he got used to keeping things to himself. This would also have been true after the disastrous summer romance.

This means that he doesn't completely understand how normal people function, therefore he only gives them as much information as he /thinks/ they can handle. That, coupled with the fact that Voldemort is an excellent mind reader, means that Dumbledore has to be a paranoid bastard regardless of whether he wants to actually be one.

--------------

I don't know what you mean by 'making things better for the Muggleborns' but Hogwarts and Magical Britain has clearly gone through many changes since the rise of Dumbledore. Draco is the only idiot who still throws terms like 'Mudblood' around. Being a Muggleborn doesn't mean that you'll be denied a quality education, or a job at the Ministry of Magic. There's not really much of a problem, unless you want to make some headway into the Conservative end of Pureblood society.

Now Muggles on the other hand...
