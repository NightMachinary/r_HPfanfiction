I don't tend to read much fanfiction anymore because I mostly read through the stuff I thought was worth reading several years ago so it's rare I find something I like. It's been almost exactly one year since the last fanfic I read (Antithesis by [[/u/Dragongal7]], I recommend it if you haven't read it) so I thought I'd look for some recs.

I prefer Harry-centric novel length stories, but I'm open to anything so don't let that inhibit your recs.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11284494/chapters/25241499]]

Of a Linear Circle. A portrait that (Spoilers for most of the series after the first work) Is actually Harry Potter turned into a portrait and the adopted younger brother of Salazar Slytherin. No, I'm not kidding. There's a lot of worldbuilding, and the characters all are very in-character.

** Have to go with linkffn(Victoria Potter) in terms of currently updating fics. Just a great story. That said, there is a trio of fic writers right now writing sorta retro, magically powerful adventure stories and they are just so fun to read. LF74 is one of the most concise and efficient writers around right now and they have two great fics, linkffn(Soul and Body) and linkffn(Blood and Water). linkffn(Subversion by Myricle) singlehandedly demonstrates that powerful Harry can be pulled off with great writing. And linkffn(The Imposter Complex) is just an addictive adventure read.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.
