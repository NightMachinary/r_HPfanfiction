A perfect gift for Ron, a chess set with all the members of his family. And with wizard chess, they all have personalities and takedown moves like their real life counterparts. All pieces will use random spells to eliminate other pieces but will occasionally use special moves.

King - Arthur: 1. Pulls out a rubber duck and tosses it at the enemy, it grows into a giant duck and eats them. 2. Pulls out an electrical plug and yells: EKELTRICITY! and then electrocutes the opponent.

Queen - Molly: 1. Writes a howler and sends it to the target piece where it yells until their ears bleed then explodes burning them up. 2. Bear hugs the other piece till they snap in half

Bishop 1 - Bill: 1. Summons a sarcophagus from the earth and a mummy comes out and drags the piece back in to disappear into the earth

Bishop 2 - Charlie: 1. Calls a dragon burn and eat the other piece

Knight 1 - Ron: 1. Slug belching hex

Knight 2 - Ginny: 1. Bat bogey hex

Rooks - Gred and Forge: Even they don't know which is which 1. Toss a portable swamp that the piece sinks into and an alligator eats them 2. Smack a bludger between each twin until it hits the piece to be taken

Pawns - Percy: All of them 1. Reads a lecture on cauldron bottom thickness until the piece either runs off the board or has an aneurysm.

When a Percy crosses the board it changes into the piece of choice: 1. Queen - Percy in a dress and tiara 2. Bishop - Percy dressed as the Pope 3. Knight - Percy on a fluffy little pony 4. Rook - Percy in a cardboard fort

Anyone else ideas for this chess set or another set?


** Luna: Queen. Just a wonderful little pumpkin protecting her gaggle of eldritch horrors.

King: The truth. The representation of being who you want to be, along with spreading information to help the populous. A mirror with vanity, along with a basket of paper on the side, hovering .5 cm above the board.

Rooks: 2 crumble horned Snorlaks, who have the weird quirk of always going about 1 extra space than you ordered, sue to their inability to stop movie g once it charges.

Bishops: An Dementor and a Patronus, on White and black respectivly. Represents how her fears and sorrows go hand in hand with her best moments, never truly cancelling out, yet facing her does side by side.

Knights: Nargles, Teleporting Lemur sized scorpion-lizard-panda chimeras incapable of listening t9 orders unless working 4 spaces of a pawn.

Pawns: Small, nonmagical animals, which were adapted from the statues her mother carved her when she was a baby.

1: Capybara 2: Pony 3: Bear 4: Owl 5: Dodo 6: Anteater 7: Heron 8: Dolphin

1 & 7 was carved out of butterbeer cork, while the rest were made of a block of wood fused from the remnants of a mistletoe bush.

*** Instead of a dementor, a thestral. Dementors don't really go with Luna's personality.

***** I could imagine Luna reading all the Lovecraft books and talking about the horrors there like they were kittens.

*** Or have half the board Neville and half Luna, because they really should have ended together. Luna's side are. Magical creatures and Neville's side are magical plants.

Could do that kind of thing for all the ships. Just design half the board with your pieces and wait to combine it with your other half.
