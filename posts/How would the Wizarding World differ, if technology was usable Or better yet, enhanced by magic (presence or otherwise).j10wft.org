Especially electronics and technology in the modern day -- imagine, muggleborn students using (the equivalent) of Google for potion ingredients.

Also, what if magic had an ENHANCING effect on technology? For example, magic-dense areas like Hogwarts mean that phone have limitless charge, so long as they draw from magic.


** Don't forget that while some fanfics expand this so that all magical (or /highly/ magical) locations repel electronics, canon is much less definitive. It's specifically /at Hogwarts/ that modern technology doesn't work; as far as we know you could set up a computer shop in the middle of Diagon Alley if you wanted to.

And a certain Flying Ford Anglia stands as a living example that magic /can indeed/ have an enhancing effect on Muggle machines even when not specifically enchanted. (i.e. the car is enchanted to fly and become invisible, but this expands to it gaining sentience after spending some time in the highly magical Forbidden Forest.)

*** Is it actually stated that technology doesn't work at hogwarts? All I recall is I think a note about bugging/listening devices in GoF...

My head cannon is that wizards are so behind muggle times that they saw early primitive lights, radio, and the occasional student consumer eletronic device wig out and just assumed that meant all muggle tech doesn't work And that it could be worked around pretty easily by the determined...

** Unless this happens suddenly, this mean more tech for the wizarding culture as a whole. Remember, the Ministry got a couple of /cars/ that looked "almost ordinary" from Harry's POV, which means even at the governmental level the wizarding society is quite pragmatic about Muggle's technology. The user won't be limited to muggleborns.

Television for one would've been adopted by magical society at large. Notice how Pensieve exists yet no class involves students just dipping their head to experience real training or even an actual historical event. With cheap and safe television units and VCRs, Hogwarts would have a large library for educational and entertainment tapes by the time Golden Trio arrived at Hogwarts, and there will be a wacky conspiracy channel ran by the Lovegoods, the state propaganda by the Ministry, and a public channel containing gems like "Granger Tells It Like It Is" filled with educational tidbits interspersed with house-elf rights or "Wizarding Front" where you can watch the creme de la creme of Purebloods like Walden Macnair eloquently describe how to take a life.

Arithmancy and Runes would've adopted calculators, computers, and printers once they're available for the public. Portable devices that we considered impractical early on due to large battery size and limited runtime will be available earlier on the wizarding world. Luggable computers, for example, can be operated without plugging in, don't suffer from overheat, and can be quickly shrunk into your pocket. Videophone would've easily replaced fireplace-bound Floo calls, even more widely adopted than by muggles since magicals are already used to made themselves presentable (even if it's just a glamour charm) for calls.

Assuming a wizard worth their Arithmancy & Runes NEWT can duplicate, shrink and apply cooling runes to computer parts, every wizarding house in early 1980 can have a home magitek computer with total computing power exceeding universities. Even with a far smaller population, it's conceivable that the computer revolution might start earlier in the wizarding world since the muggle counterpart was also started by the few lucky ones with limited access to building-sized computers. Wizards might insist on using quills and parchment against pen and paper, but they couldn't possibly argue against a full color, fanless, featherweight & pocketable workstation.

Muggle militaries developed cruise missiles and drones once they can stuff those computing powers in small enough package. With protean charm and shrunk mainframe, it's possible a magitek contraption raining death from the sky were used in the first Voldemort's insurrection. If notice-me-not works against radar, some of the Horcruxes will be orbiting the Earth, launched by amateur rocket enhanced with spells.

** The two way mirror Sirius gave to Harry would be replaced with Skype by the 2010s.
