Back when I was in college (07-12) I saw a few drabbles by Lord of Bones that made me want to read more. Most of his work seemed to be hidden behind an invite only website that I can't remember the name of. Does that ring a bell to anyone? Or has his stuff been uploaded elsewhere?

Thanks in advance!
