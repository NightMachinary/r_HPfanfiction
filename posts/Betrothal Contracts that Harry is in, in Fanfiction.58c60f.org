When writing/reading stories, who have you seen/had Harry in within a betrothal contract...

I know I'm kinda guilty in putting Susan, Hannah, Hermione, Daphne, Morag, Megan and even Tracey in them with Harry...hell, I'm working on a fic which has Harry in a betrothal with Susan and the Carrow sisters and I've got one in my notebooks which has a betrothal to Pansy in it! I've even got a fic where Hannah and Hermione are betrothed to Harry (blame it on James Potter getting drunk Wetting The Baby's Head...)

Go on, the more obscure partners/near enough Harem partners the better...


** I once read The Harem War. All seven hundred forty-nine thousand words of it. To this day I don't know why I kept reading past the first chapter.

***** One is a massive orgy with a little bit of plot (Radaslab's), the Other is a decently written story

****** I liked the descriptions of the hidden island in Radaslab's story, however, I got bored with reading the endless description at chapter endings about sister wives and kids.

Do you have a link to the Vance McGill version?

** The most I've seen are Harry/Daphne. Though my favorites are Harry/Susan, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Daphne/Astoria, and Harry/Fleur/Gabrielle. And for one on one, Harry/Susan, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Bella, and Harry/Luna.

And what's your profile name on ff.net? I want to check out your stories.

** Not Normal is maybe the biggest betrothal-fic ever. Everyone is betrothed. Or bonded.

  His life was never normal, then it becomes truly abnormal. He must save a world he never cared for, but with others ... he can care. H/Hr and maybe others. Rated M to be safe.

** I have seen way more Harry/Daphne Betrothal ones then any others which makes sense because of who Daphne is. Apart from that I can literally name almost any other major female character that has had a betrothal contract with Harry in some fan fiction out there that I have come across.

Harry/ Susan, Hermione, Ginny, Tracey, Hannah, Cho, Parvarti twins, Tonks, Fleur, and so on.

Some of the more "interesting" ones I have read have been where Harry travels in time and ends up with one or all of the Black sisters (Bellatrix, Narcissa, Andromeda), or others like Lily (yea i know his mom), or similar.

I have even seen a few FFics where Harry ends up going much older without traveling and "collects" pureblood wives from death eaters by conquest or financial power or some other such thing.

... Or ones where he ends up with "sisters" like Daphne/Astoria or Fleur/Gabrielle, or the Parvati Twins the like.

And then of course there are the ones where a gender is swapped or family added to like a female Longbottom, or female Harry, or female Voldemort, or whatever you want to throw in.

Interestingly the only contract or partner grouping I can not think of ever seeing personally for Harry is a Harry/Male one and that's likely because I am not remotely interested in slash. But I am sure they are out there.

My personal favorite for Harry 1 on 1 is Hermione or Luna, and I do have a thing for time travel fics where Harry ends up with members of the previous generation....

.....but when it comes to groups, my favorite mix ins are Fleur, Tonks, Luna, Daphne, and Tracey.

That said... if an OC or side character is well developed, they can be very cool to read about.

*** Oh yeah, slash ones definitely exist. Most are ones along the lines of 'gender isn't even an issue in the wizarding world', but I hold a special place in my heart for the handful that are 'let's engage our unborn children... Oh carp, they're both dudes!'
