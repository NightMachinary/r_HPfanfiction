I wrote/started a bunch of fanfiction way back in the day . I'm talking like prior to 2005 at the latest. I got drunk with my sister and we read them and some actually now have potential (in my mind at least).. But I no longer have access to my fanfiction.net or fictionalley.org accounts as that email is so long gone by now.

Is there a way for me to access my accounts on either site? It's been probably close to 12 years since I accessed either and they are attached to a an email that is very long gone for me. I'm assuming it is impossible bit hoping maybe someone might have an idea and if so you


** I don't know if there's a way to get back in your account, but if you can still read the fics as a viewer, you might try downloading the fic using ficsaver or something like that, then using calibre to convert it to a pdf or Word doc. You can then open it using Google docs or Microsoft Word or whatever and be able to edit the text, and then repost under a different account.

** You could download the old fics and republish on a new account. If it's a lot of them and if you know a little python you can install the fanfiction-api python package and have a script do the job.
