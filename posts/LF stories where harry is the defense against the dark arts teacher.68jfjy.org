** He did teach during past times in “Harry Potter and the Freak Parade” (linkffn(3022004)), but it's not elaborated on and the story is on crack with some moonshine added for good measure.

He also teaches it in “The Untitled Cheekquel Project” (linkffn(2477165)) and its sequel “You Did What!”, though it is both post-Hogwarts and in itself a sequel to “Where in the World is Harry Potter?” in which it is Nicholas Flamel who teaches Defense Against Dark Arts.

  COMPLETE. [Sequel to Where in the World is Harry Potter?] Now that Harry has been found, he's going to teach DADA at Hogwarts again for the first time. Will he change and grow as a person? Will he find love? Enh... doubtful.

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.

** There's a fic on ficwad called Brother Z that qualifies, but it's more of a angst-and-wank fest than anything about the classes.
