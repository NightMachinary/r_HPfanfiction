:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was pretty slow on the updates, the last time I checked on it was probably in the fourth or fifth book ten years ago. Harry was friends mainly with Draco and Hermione, although Ron and Blaise were both around.

This thing had a huge following, an active subreddit dedicated just to it.

Figured that with the quarantine and having just finished a re-read of the series I'd get back into fanfiction and I just can't find the one I'm looking for

Edit: it's not hpmor, although that's one I remember loving and am going to start tonight

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

  The war has begun. The evil forces of Lord Voldemort have overrun Azkaban prison, and the Ministry of Magic and the Order of the Phoenix struggle to prevent the wizarding world from collapsing.

  Who will be next to perish? Should he support the Ministry? Does Dumbledore have a plan? These questions and more haunt Harry as he and his new Order train for war and vengeance.

  Now that he knows the full contents of the prophecy, Harry begins training in earnest to kill Voldemort, with the help of his dad and two best friends. Dumbledore has voluntarily offered to divulge extra information to Harry, and the Ministry has finally realised what's been staring them in the face for a year - but that doesn't mean that things will start to go smoothly for Harry. He and his loved ones will be tested in ways they haven't seen coming, and some relationships will buckle under the strain.

**** Yes. It's a pretty good story with interesting plot. The characters are understandable, and the writing is witty more often than not (I can recall several memorable lines from memory).

The only downside I've seen are a certain character is cartoonishly dumb (altogether that is a major point of the story), and it gets too technical at times with Dark Lords throughout the ages (that title was created personally by Voldemort - in canon, there's no such thing as Dark Lord Grindelwald) and tier level Occlumency.

It's worth a read at least.
