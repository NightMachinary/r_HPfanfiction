*** Was looking through threads about Muggle vs magical war squibs would still be able to see where the places are on satellites

**** Depends on how the hiding magic works. If it acts on light then cameras and satellites can't see hidden sights, no matter who's using them. If the magic works on the minds of people instead, preventing them from noticing the hidden things, it could work. Perhaps an image recognition AI could also see through. That might actually start a war, if a new muggle AI accidentally discovers magical locations and the military assumes aliens with sufficiently advanced technology instead of magic.
