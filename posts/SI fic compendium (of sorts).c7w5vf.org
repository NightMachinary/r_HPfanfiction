Being a pretty big list of SI fics I have read and thought were fairly good.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11745900][Rose Petal Red]] - The SI is Ginny Weasley's twin sister. Not as much fix-it as some fics have though the Slytherin/Child politics are kind of ridiculous. Alive and fairly long.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4829807][Faith and the Devil]] - One of my favorites despite how short +and dead+ (alive as of June!) it is, the SI is Draco Malfoy's sister and thinks all of the childish sniping is, well, childish and sort of cute.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8906032][Death of a Dark Lord]] - SI is Gilderoy and decides to just flip the table by publishing a true account of Tom Marvolo Riddle's life and death. One shot.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10051634][Triumphant, the Dreamer]] - SI is Harry's twin sister. She's very protective and this fic kind of hits a lot of 'questionable trope' buttons, but to me it never quite crossed the line into cringe territory. Dead.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6442123][Echoes]] - A dead fic I really hope to see come back to life; the SI is incredibly apathetic and depressed at being alive again. She bonds with Cedric during the tournament year and tries to save him, ultimately failing. Pretty dark.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13175009/1/Of-Blacks-and-Boarhounds][Of Blacks and Boarhounds]] - SI is her adult self and accidentally starts dating Snape. A pretty decent Snape!Redemption story, still ongoing as it starts during Harry's second year summer.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10382324/1/The-Estranged-Star][The Estranged Star]] - SI is Bellatrix Black's son. Interesting character interactions, as the SI is torn between helping people and loyalty to the mother he grew to love. Dead.

​

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/umbrus-shade-the-incredibly-annoyed-ravenclaw-harry-potter-si.48980/][Umbrus Shade, The Incredibly Annoyed Ravenclaw]] - SI is lowkey speedrunning the events of each book as they come along and only tangentially interacts with the Golden Trio. Complete!

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me][Magical Me]] - SI is Gilderoy Lockhart; been a long time since I read this one but mostly he tries to become a halfway decent professor. Very dead.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/][A Curse of Truth]] - To be honest this one didn't wow me, and like the last one I can't remember it that well, but its one of the SIs that gets recced a lot. Nothing wrong with it, except that the SI gets way too invested in the GT wat too quickly in my opinion.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff][What's her name in Hufflepuff]] - Amusing both for being a Hufflepuff!SI and because while she is continually lowkey trying to interfere with cannon she is also continually failing.

​

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/][The Perks of Survival]]- SI is Sally Anne Perks. She's mostly concerned with not disappearing from the story like the original did, rather than changing the world.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12738075/1/Why-Time-Travel-Should-Be-Illegal-and-Other-Morals][Why time travel should be illegal and other morals]] - this one kind of lost me after a while. The SI starts out as a teacher and adopts young Harry after sicing child services on the Dursleys. He then marries a Squib from a dark family and has magical children of his own after moving to Hawaii. It gets kind of religousy too often for me, but the core story is okay, even if fix-it heavy.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The Evil Overlord List]] - the SI is a voice in young Tom Riddles head, trying to make sure he doesn't fall prey to any of the pitfalls listed on [[http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html][the Evil Overlord List]] to ensure his reign is a long and untroubled one. Maybe Dead.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4414361/chapters/10027064][She Who Should not Exist]] - SI is Voldemort's twin sister, and sort of suicidal. Not very long.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12026429/1/Chris-Pettigrew-and-the-No-Refund-Policy][Chris Pettigrew and the No-Refund Policy]] - SI is Peter Pettigrew and gets involved with Lily and James to some extent.

​

In Between Reality [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6237794/1/In-Between-Reality]] - Si is Dudley Dursley and rapidly throws canon off the rails by helping Harry. Dead as all get out.

​

Harry Potter and the New Occupant [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12657967/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-New-Occupant]] - SI is placed in Harry immediately after his soul is sucked out by dementors during the summer of OoP. A lot more laid back, he gets drunk and laid.

​

Fics I've had recommended but not read yet:

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13158521/1/][Being Bellatrix Black and Loving It]] - SI is Bellatrix

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511867/1/][A Grindlewald's Tale]] - SI is Gellert Grindlewald's grandson

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10280298/1/A-Witch-s-Guide-To-Dealing-With-The-Dark-Side-And-Also-Dark-Lords][A Witch's Guide To Dealing With The Dark Side (And Also Dark Lords)]] - SI dates TMR

Nobody told me the Rules [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10851278/1/]] - SI is a metamorph, slight AU elements.

Does anyone have any recommendations? Particularly ones where the SI takes routes other than the highway to fix-it ville?


** linkffn(A Wand for Skitter) inserts the protagonist from another fandom into a random muggle born. She has no canon knowledge so technically not an SI but it reads very similarly to a good SI fic.

What's Her Name in Hufflepuff is my favorite SI so far, but you've listed a few that I haven't read yet. Guess I have some work to do :)

*** Uh..... Umbrus Shade? Technically? Because while he hits the stations, he hits them ahrd and fast and gets them out of the way early on so then the rest of each year is him having fun with his OC friends. I can't say for Grindlewald as I haven't read it yet, and Perks of Survival was a long time ago. A handful haven't hit the stations yet because they just haven't progressed far enough. If you have recommendations for SI fics that don't hit the stations I would love to see them.
