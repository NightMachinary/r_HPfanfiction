Have any of you read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23548960][It's A Masquerade, Darling]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ChubbyPanda15/pseuds/ChubbyPanda15][ChubbyPanda15]], because I am loving it.\\
I need more stories like this. I love the whole combination of students, Tom, Sev, both Malfoy's, Harry, Barty, and other all going to school at the same time. And I also love the Slytherins (Riddle mostly) helping ( a reluctant) Harry who his asshole relatives are trying to take advantage of. I have a thing for bossy Slytherins (tom, draco) taking over and helping Harry for his own good even if he doesn't like it. If you guys know any other stories that have any of these themes please please link them.\\
Thanks


** Thanks for the rec! Im now invested in the Potters drama
