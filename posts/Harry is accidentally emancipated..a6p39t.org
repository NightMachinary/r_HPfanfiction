I can't remember if the story was good or not, but it at least mentioned this concept which I thought was interesting.

I'm Harry's 4th year, the Goblet of Fire declares Harry an adult magically, because it's required to be 17 to join the Tournament. Perhaps they ignored or explained away the fact that the Goblet didn't care about age, only Dumbledore's age line.

In Harry's 5th year, the Wizengamot declares Harry an adult legally, by trying him as an adult for underage magic.

IIRC, he got the case thrown out because as soon as they tried him he was emancipated on principle of being legally and magically an adult.

Again, it's just the idea that stuck with me and I can't remember anything else about the fic, good or bad. :/


** The emancipation thing is a pretty common fanfiction cliche. It's gonna be hard to nail down a single fic just from this. Can you recall any other plot points besides this?

*** Nope, just that as far as I know the /method/ of his emancipation was rather unique. Or, at least, I haven't seen it anywhere else.

I know, it's rather a stretch. lol

Absolutely not. I probably have at least 10 stories in my fav list where he's emancipated by the goblet somehow.

But maybe I'm being overly pessimistic and your description rings a bell for someone else. Good luck!

****** I even used that in a family-centric story as a move to get Harry away from his adoptive family because Barty Crouch has a long memory (and may or may not be imperiused). It is definitely a common theme, even outside of the IndyHarry genre.

** I think what you're looking for is linkffn(10766595)

Here's an excerpt

#+begin_quote
  As a result of Mister Harry Potter's (14) name coming out of the Goblet of Fire, and being named a competitor in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, the Boy-Who-Lived applied for emancipation, and it was granted, writes Hieronymus Cartwright.
#+end_quote

The trial in his 5th year was for using magic in the presence of muggles. In this fic, he proves that the dementors were deliberately sent to set him up.

Harry is emancipated due to a soul bond which trumps every law. So, he gets private quarters in Hogwarts etc. This is one of my favorite fanfics. It's really good.

** As the other commenter says: plenty of stories do that.

Wild guess, because it's the focus of that fic: linkffn(Can't have it both ways by robst).

The fic is as good as you'd expect a robst fic to be.

  If you are forced to participate in a competition that's reserved for adults only, doesn't that mean you should be considered an adult? Harry gets some much needed help and advice before having some fun by allowing his marauder heritage out to play. H/Hr

**** It's neither, really. It was the easiest statement to express what I meant:

Some people like robst, and will like the fic - I personally don't. But if you expect robst's fics to be good, this one will work for you, too. I don't judge anyone for liking robst. He writes decent prose, but has his flaws - but so have my favorite authors.

Personally, I can't get over him telling essentially the same plot-point over and over again, his characterizations and world-building but that's just me. If you want some revenge-fics where Dumbledore (and sometimes the Weasleys) are the baddies, robst is certainly one of the best authors around.

** It wouldn't be the one you're looking for, since it takes place after the trial, but linkffn(Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue by White Squirrel) has the same emancipation-by-goblet-and-trial. Mostly just as a lead-in to the rest of the plot, though.
