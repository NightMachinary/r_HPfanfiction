So I exclusively read fan fiction on fanfiction.net. I know that other websites exist, and I've occasionally looked at other sites but found them to be unattractive to read on. I know that some authors don't post their stories on ffnet and I'm wondering just how much I'm missing out on in terms of quality stories? Are there any quality fics you would recommend that I couldn't find on ffnet? Thanks!


** Depends entirely on what you read. A lot of slash and femslash is exclusive to ao3, as well as the refugees of the old livejournal fandom. Next gen and OC centric are popular on HPFF. Pairing exclusive sites have pairing exclusive stuff.

If your reading primarily consists of Indy Harry fare, then very little.

** Definitely depends what you want. AO3 is a different animal to me. I rarely use ffnet, I find that the type of thing I want and the level of quality in the areas I look (not across the board) is better in ao3. I'm a canon snippets/long meta/gen fic sort of person and that's usually where I find that. Honestly, even with my own work, I sort of do ffnet as an afterthought, sometimes forgetting to actually do it because it doesn't seem to fit with the ffnet vibe.

********* You might still get stuff like that but it'll be minimal if you exclude things like slash, incest, rape, noncon, mpreg, etc. My advice is to exclude all the stuff you never want to see then bookmark your search without all of that so that you can take like 20 minutes one time filtering all of your most hated stuff and never have to deal with it again. Also, you can filter specific pairings, I filter harry and hermione paired with snape, draco, ginny, or ron by default because I hate either of them paired with any of them.

Ao3 has a lot of really good and really different shit though.

Aslo Ao3 usually filters alternate spellings and misspelling of things that you exclude, they have an engine for it or some shit so that 99% of the time filtering mpreg also filters shit like male pregnancy and mpregs and shit. Food for thought eh

If you're looking for a story from Professor McGonagall's point of view, for instance, looking through the "Minerva McGonagall" tag gets you 20-50 fics that merely include her for every fic about her.

** You miss out on a lot of smut. Most of it contains absolutely unrealistic pairings (Harry or Hermione with Death Eaters) or is your usual trope heavy harem stuff, but there are some out there that definitely fit as a "guilty pleasure".

As for actual plot, not much to be honest. I remember an interesting Band AU on AO3, but even that one was smutty as well. Most of the non-explicit, plot-focused fics get posted on FFN eventually. The reader base is simply much larger.

There are some older fanfic communities (Portkey for Harry/Hermione and there were two for Harry/Ginny) that have exclusive content, but most of it did not age well and those are usually very difficult to browse due to tagging and search features that make FFN look like the pinnacle of web design.

There is no redemption for murder, terrorism and war crimes. Stealing a car or underage smoking? Sure. But capital offences up to and including (accessory to) genocide? NEVER.

Also, kinda hard to have a relationship with an Azkaban inmate, even without the Dementors around. The fact that Malfoy is not in Azkaban and Snape is not considered anything but scum in the epilogue is a great insult to all those who have died at the hands of the Death Eaters.

The "greatest wizard alive"/only one whom Voldemort feared was a half-blood, Voldemort was blown up by either a muggleborn or a half-blood toddler and a Muggleborn was top of his year. That is not comparable to someone brainwashed by the HJ who has never even seen a Jew before. Also, Malfoy was not defending his country, he was committing treason against it. The Sturmabteilung would be a much better comparison than the Volkssturm. Hell, Malfoy was all for it until he had to get his own hands dirty. He boasted about Voldemort's return.

Kids look up to their parents, they believe them; in the same way, Draco looked up to Lucius and believed him too. Secondly, for Malfoy, it was a war with no escape; his only actions on behalf of Voldemort were, just like that 16-year-old kid with panzerfaust against a T-34, coerced. He had no choice. It was either fight or die -- and his parents die, as well.

I can, however, see how an analogy to the brownshirts works, in part. But, once again, I'd say brainwashing was a large element here.

Overall, my favorite Draco Malfoy parallel isn't WWII related; in him, I actually see a Paul Baumer-type character from Remarque's novel. Lied to by his parents and the older generation, forced to fight a war because he was told it was right, and in the end, he almost became a statistic.

Edit: in my mind, that isn't just worthy of redemption -- should he seek it -- it requires it.

******** 100% agreed. Maybe it's just because I'm the swine that ships TMR with characters who aren't Death Eaters, but it's frustrating to hear how awful slash and these pairings are for "believability" and "it can't be canon." That's not why we write/read these.

** A lot in my opinion. Especially if you like certain characters who are less popular in the ff.net corner of fandom.

I never went on ff.net until I started using this subreddit. It's a totally different feel, the first time I've really spent much time interacting with straight dudes with regards to fanfic. And I've been reading and writing fic since the early nineties.

That's not a bad thing---I've found some undiscovered gems thanks to this sub---but there is a lot of truly fantastic stuff on AO3 and some of the old livejournal haunts. Keep an open mind, go for quality rather than pairing. It gives you a lot of wonderful content.

Funnily enough, I find ff.net visually obnoxious the same way you find AO3 annoying. I guess it's all in what you're used to. FF.net had such a poor reputation for so many years that it took me time to shake off the bias. I still only read recs there because of the dross.

As for my recs, I have hundreds bookmarked on AO3. I'll try to come back later and edit in a link. People on these comments saying most fics are death eater pairings, just smut, or unfinished work---I'm not really sure where they're looking? It's a vast website, but that hasn't been my experience. My hunch is that most in this sub prefer ff.net, so their experience with AO3 is limited.

(Also, though it's really not true that AO3 is all porn, I do like when fic about adults sometimes includes adult sexuality! Sometimes ff.net feels way too neutered to me. Stories about or including sex and sexuality can be rich, interesting, and worthwhile.)

  how much I'm missing out on in terms of quality stories?
#+end_quote

I would say quality is roughly the same. There's good, bad, and mediocre, but I would recommend filtering out pairings if you search by "hits" or "kudos" as smut and slash popularity doesn't equal quality. Smut and slash are so big on AO3, because it's a safe haven where people don't have to worry about having their stories targeted for having explicit or gay content in their fics, which has happened on LJ and FF.

I do find the quality and quantity of crossovers higher and accessible, and once you get a hang of their tagging system it's easier to find more specific stories (time travel, pairings, etc.).

#+begin_quote
  Are there any quality fics you would recommend that I couldn't find on ffnet?
#+end_quote

I don't know what kinds of fics you like, but some gen fics I would definitely recommend:

- anything by esama, like Unsealed linkao3(1115373) and many, /many/ more.
- LullabyKnell's in progress/incomplete stories (FF only has their complete ones), such as into the arena with your head held high: linkao3(4472270)
- dirgewithoutmusic's stories, such as the family evans linkao3(3073562)

I read lots of different genre. The only things I don't read is slash and fics that are in Marauder Era or New Gen if Harry's not here (be it by time travel for Marauder or just adult in New Gen). Except that... time travel, canon, AU, romance, Xover, crack, parody, comedy, OP, ... I'm not picky overall. I just have phases where I'm more into one type of fic more than another but when there is no more of that I change until I come back to it.

[EDIT]: After thought, I do prefer longer fics (but read shorter ones if good enough) and I try to avoid abandoned ones (except if everyone tell me it's a masterpiece) and I even go to not begin a fic if I see the author tends not to finish them but may come back later to it to check. I also sometime hesitate if there is only a few chapters for the same reasons. And yeah obviously well written is better.

Also, everything is gay relationships are grossly overrepresented. In Britain, 2.3% of young men are gay or bi, but over 50% of stories with some sort of romance are slash.

That being said, there are some decent stories around, you just have to narrow your searches down. As a rule of thumb, exclude Malfoy, Snape, m/m, bashing, multi and harems, that weeds out a lot of crap.

If you're into sequel trilogy Star Wars at all definitely try the Children Wake Up series, it's beautifully written even if you don't normally like slash.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

*** I'm in a similar position to you. I've been reading FF for over a decade now. I started exclusively on HP and FFN. I occasionally branched out to LJ/tumblr fics. Over time I branched into other fandoms.

Probably around 3/4 years ago I noticed a lot more FF was being posted on Ao3 (and I remember the inception of Ao3 and when there were about 4 fics on there) and I really liked the format of the website and the ability to download fics easily. But I've noticed I rarely ever search through Ao3 for fics. I tend to be recced stories and end up there. This is more so in other fandoms with the ease of tagging than with HP. I also think a lot of “newer” authors prefer Ao3. In my mind there's been a slow but steady shift to using Ao3.

I think it's really more common for tumblr writers and old LJ authors to post their stuff on Ao3 now. They can link really easily on Ao3. And tumblr was always the worst in my mind for finding drabbles/stories - but I've found some great one-shot writers migrated their stuff to Ao3.

They even have a great tool for series. In my mind Ao3 was created by FF authors looking at FFN and thinking what can we improve? What would make our life easier? There are so many more options to personalise your fic on Ao3 that FFN just lacks. Again my personal favorite is the ability to download FF with one click. I do it so much more often because of how easy it is.

I'll agres with some comments that the majority of Ao3 can be cluttered with smut/slash. And I find an obnoxious amount of PWP. But there are a lot of gems that are definitely not on FFN. I personally think the trend is moving away from FFN, especially with the purges that happened and how political FFN became. I know some amazing authors who lost stories. Ao3 has a lot more freedom for writers.

If I'm honest though, I don't search for FF like I used to. I rely on fic recs/lists. But don't close yourself off to any ff sites. There's so much great content everywhere!

** You are missing out on some of the best stories. I've found most online fan-fiction sites, with regards to their quantity and quality, to be a mile wide and an inch deep.

FF.net is the worst for this, its accessibility is also its curse. However, it has the best interface.

AO3 (Archive of our Own) as steadily gotten better since I started reading on it. It seems to house more pairing-based fics however you can exclude those easily with the content filter settings. There are issues with Authors taking liberties with the tagging system and bloating out their stories with umpteen tags. Annoyingly, sometimes the good stories have this as well, so you can't exactly judge a book by its cover.

One of my favourite stories of all time is the [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/][/Perfect Slytherins/]] series from Jeconais

This story introduced me to the weirdness of the Addams Family. It's honestly pretty great, and told from professor Snape's POV.

** I don't believe that somebody with your preferences will find a lot of success on AO3. There are about 150,000 Harry Potter, non-crossover, English language fics. 25,000 of them are Harry/Draco and 9500 are Harry/Snape. By comparison 5500 are Harry/Ginny andHarry/Hermione comes in at 1700, the latter not even good for the top 10 list of pairings.

I have similar tastes as you and there are some okay fics on the site, but you have to really dig for them.

** There's mostly smut, slash or really creepy pairings on AO3. I occasionally search on AO3 but haven't yet found a serious (as in non wank material) fic that isn't also on ff.net. I really like the site and technically it's much better than ff.net - it just feels a little bit like a containment site sometimes.

There's lots of one shots and early abortions on AO3 though, which I read rarely, so maybe there's some gems there.

** For Harry Potter, relatively little. Mostly smut and the odd author that prefers ao3 (but if you read this sub you'll get recced all the worthwhile stories from there anyway). For other fandoms however, you may need to look elsewhere. Livejournals especially tend to have more material for smaller fandoms.

** Most importantly, imo, you're missing on Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity. Those two are great creative communities and are very active these days.

*** The harry potter presence on both of those sites are completely negligible, and what few exist are primarily crossovers.

****** I am sorry, but you're an idiot. Go re-read OP post. There's been nothing about HP in it and it /can/ be interpreted as a generic question. I am just trying to be helpful and actually answer the question /as it was asked./

And if you think people on this reddit only exclusively read HP, you are delusional.

** IMO, ao3 is basically all smut. Personally I'd rather have no pairings at all, so I tend to avoid it.
