Have any of you ever gotten death threats for seemingly no reason other than the fact that someone didn't like your story? For example, I had some people just basically say "You suck, go die".

I've had hilarious bad reviews as well, but I just thought death threats was taking it a bit far. Anyone else experience this?

I'm fine with constructive criticism, but I just don't get why some people would read every chapter just to write send me rude messages, and even go as far as to send death threats? I mean, they're probably just trolls, but ugh...it's annoying

edit: I've gotten a request to drop the link of a story so powerful it warranted such a reaction, so here goes [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13781176/1/Prongslet-Time]]


** [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]]'s anonymous reviews make people think that there are no consequences to what they saw when in reality, it just makes you look gutless. I've seen people trashing my fics for all kinds of reasons and it hurt at first. But eventually, you get over it by remembering "why should I care what this no-life thinks?" I mean, they're spending their time trashing a fanfiction lol. I shouldn't care what they think.

** It's extremely common on ffn, and has been for years. Never once seen it on ao3, mostly because ao3 actually gives authors moderating options, and people are also just generally nicer.

** I had a nasty troll about a year ago and have since just eliminated the ability to receive comments (ao3 user only) because I don't want to risk going through that again even though positive comments are so nice and I miss reading them. Definitely I'd recommend, if using ao3, to block the ability to leave comments without a registered account. People are much more respectful when they can't hide behind anonymous.

*** Yeah. I mean, when I don't like a story, I stop reading it. Then I make a note in my "stories I've read" spreadsheet that I didn't like it, because obviously something about the blurb drew me in, and I'd prefer not to have it draw me in again.

I'm not confrontational enough to go after the author, though.

** Can't say I've ever gotten death threats. I did get one review that basically said “this is just a shitty copy of Naruto you piece of shit.” It still makes me laugh because I've never watched Naruto. I just know that it has ninjas, and my story doesn't have ninjas.

** Don't worry! It's just a random internet troll who has nothing else to do! I've read most of your story and it's amazing! Plz update soon! I think your idea is really cooooool! Don't listen to that random idiot there. Maybe try Wattpad. People are less likely to harass you there and they have to get an account to comment.

** Never received death threats or anything telling me to die (yet), but I find the best way to shut down trolls (other than ignoring them completely) is to engage them taking their comments at face value.

For example, I posted some photos of my canvas art featuring Mario characters over on [[/r/Mario][r/Mario]]. Most comments were complementary, but there was one that just said "it's trash", no context, no explanation.

I decided to take the high road, and responded "thanks for the feedback! Anything in particular you think I can improve on?" Or words to that effect.

They never bothered to reply, so I think trying to bring them up to your level is a good way to make them uncomfortable and stop.

** Welcome to the internet, where you can't offer an opinion without people saying they're going to hunt you down with their extensive skills of gorilla warfare and beat you to death with your own severed butt. And bang your mother too.

Fortunately, the average keyboard warrior couldn't beat a ham sandwich in a fight unless you cut the crusts off for them so you have little to fear.

** I mean, don't get me wrong, its undeniably a shitty thing to do, but are statements like "go die" death threats? Its not like they are threatening you. When i think of death threats, I expect something a bit more specific like "I'm gonna find you and I'm gonna kill you". Overall, I think reviews have a lot more of the former than the latter.

Broadening the definition like that will lead to lessening the credibility of actual death threats, which are already not taken very seriously by some people, especially in the online context.

That said, I do not personally write fanfiction, but I've seen statements like that in a lot of reviews. Its not even specific to fanfiction, its basically a part of the "online experience". Anonymity lets you release a lot of pent up anger without necessarily feeling guilty about it. Couple that with the younger reader base on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and you get a lot of childish, aggressive and negative reviews,

*** "Go die" is telling someone to kill themselves, i;e death threats. Just read some of the comments by the original poster's story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/r/13781176/]]

Just awful how some people can act, because they're anonymous.

**** Telling someone to kill themselves is not a death threat. You're not threatening to actually do anything yourself, you are are telling someone to commit suicide. An actual threat would imply a risk of the victim being murdered. It's still an shitty thing to do, and anyone doing it is an awful human being.

That said, there are actual death threats in OPs reviews, all seemingly from one person. And yeah, anonymity can lead to lowlifes like that reviewer harrasing people onlins to feel better about themselves

***** Ignore the downvotes, you're right.

Under no definition of the word "threat" could the imperative statement "go die" be considered a threat.
