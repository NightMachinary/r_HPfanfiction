How they affected him is your choice. Maybe they could strip him of his mind and replace it with that of the brain's original owner. Or maybe it could be something good, like giving him all the knowledge of some researcher. As long as they affect him /somehow/.


** There is a fanfic like this, where Ron starts to act really creepy and angry, and it turns out the brains left part of their thoughts in his head and he is having problems. I don't recall the name of the story, will have to look, though.

** I'd probably go full on Cosmic Horror, and have them implant something into Ron that slowly transforms him into something alien. Something terrifying. Something [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/13/Illithid_Sorcerer.png][like this.]]
