Dragons or Giants?

I ask because several fanfictions have a contradicting answer to this question. Any ideas?


** I'd say one-on-one it'd be the dragon, but a tribe of giants motivated somehow to kill the dragon could probably tear one apart.

*** Tribe size necessary to tear a dragon apart like a turkey probably depends on dragon breed and size/age.

**** Hungarian Horntail - 5 Hebridean Black - 4 Welsh Green - 1

Giants also have fire/magic resistant skin, so most damage that a dragon would cause is through sheer force of its blows. Horntail's spikes might do some serious damage.

***** I don't know really, a Horntail is twice as large as a giant. Combine that with flight, spikes and their 50ft range on their firebreath and that ruins any chance a tribe of Giants might have.

Giants don't have any ranged capabilities and while a Welsh Green would be dead if it lands to closely, a ironbelly or horntail would still rip them apart. I also can't find anything about fire resistant skin. Magic sure, but not fire.

So, my opinion is : -Horntail/Ironbelly: Giants have no chance, no matter their tribe size, unless the Dragon can't leave when it gets tired. Their superior range, flight and size rips them apart both when in the air and on the ground.

-Medium sized Dragons (bigger than a Giant but less than 40ft) : 4 or 5 should do it. Once the dragon get too close to the ground 2 Giants can probably overwhelm one quickly enough to keep it grounded and then it's dead.

-Small Dragon ( smaller than a Giant(20-25ft)) : As soon as they get too close they'd be dead so I'd say 2 Giants if the Dragon is Lucky. (Dragon fires/lands on one fo them and the other grounds it)

****** I guess the real question is: do Giants have any form of ranged weaponry? I'd say yes, but rare. Probably as gifts to giants from wizards, like Hagrid during OotP.

** Running into either of the two in the wild would be seriously bad news... though I'd probably say that the dragon is the biggest /immediate/ danger. The giant is incredibly huge, incredibly strong, incredibly tough, and incredibly magic-resistant.... but the dragon is also all those things, /plus/ it can fly and breathe fire. It also can't be reasoned with, but the giant might if he's in a good mood and you don't talk too fast.

The giant might be more dangerous in the long run though. The dragon, for all its superior power, is still an animal, with an animal's brain and reasoning capacities. If you've escaped the dragon, it's not very likely to hold a grudge and hunt you down for revenge afterwards. The giant, however, will remember, and might very well decide to do exactly that. Because while giants aren't very smart, they /are/ smarter than dragons.

** If we're assuming an 1v1 dragon vs giant fight, I'd go with the dragon, given that, you know, they can actually fly and breathe fire.

The giant could maybe win, if he was wielding a GAU-8 Avenger autocannon instead of a club.

** People in this thread aren't seeing the bigger picture. Dragons of Harry Potter are just animals. Giants are capable of organizing into tribes with clear power hierarchies and are intelligent enough to speak human languages. Given suffient motivation and numbers giants could do a massive number on the wizarding community considering their magic resistance and strength. Dragons on the other hand need preserves to stay alive, are harvested for wand ingredients and shipped across international borders for school children to fight.

** Well according to Skyrim rules a normal dragon can be taken down by fucking bears, so a giant will have no trouble. Now if it were a blood/elder dragon, it would have enough health to tank a few hits, so I'd give it a 60/40 in the dragon's favor, more if it does a few flyovers before landing.

tl;dr disregard dragons, acquire bears.

Now that makes for a mental image. But are the bears fucking each other, or are they being fucked by the giant?

I should obviously play more Skyrim.
