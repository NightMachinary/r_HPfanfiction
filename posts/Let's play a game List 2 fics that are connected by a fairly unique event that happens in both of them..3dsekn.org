I'll start. Both [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/][Jamie Evans and Fates Fool]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5721324/1/][Rocking the Boat]] end with a ship bombarding Hogwarts from the lake.

Your two fics can be as dissimilar as you like, only rule is that they can't be by the same author. Go!

** The thing about this challenge is that, often, the similarities are down to plagiarism rather than coincidence. For example, linkffn(Finding Home), linkffn(Pronglet's Den), linkffn(Steve and the Barkeep), linkffn(Sowilo), linkffn(Blackdog) and linkffn(Wanderer) are all Avengers crossovers in which Harry is the Master of Death and owns a coffee shop, pub or garage.

Meanwhile, both linkffn(Balancing Destinies) and linkffn(A Stranger in the Promised Land) are sequels that have a benevolent Tom Riddle in a position of power and a villain who either is or is related to Grindelwald.

  Harry in the Avengers Verse with a cafe! ;) Honestly I can't picture a kid who has gone through so much crap to keep doing it when he doesn't have to and I pictured Harry either becoming a Healer or Chef and since I love to cook I chose chef!

*** I wasn't really aiming to have big overarching themes connecting the fics together, more like just a scene that you'd remember and enjoy occurring in two fics.

"Harry finds out that dragons can understand parseltongue during the first Triwizard task" type stuff, not "Harry realises dragons can speak parseltongue and therefore spends the rest of the fic exploring the possibilities of what this could mean for him" if you get what I mean.

  Disclaimer: All canon referred to within belongs to JK Rowling, Bloomsbury Books, Scholastic Books, Raincoast Books, Warner Bros. Inc., and possibly others. Non-canon bits were created for non-profit, non-infringement entertainment.Archiving: Nowhere except here, and not in translated form either.(Please note that my explicit stories - and this one will get more explicit for the m/m pairing in later chapters - will eventually be locked to registered users only, so do get an account.)Author's Notes: This novel was written several years ago. It was one of my earliest HP ideas, but I knew it needed mulling over for a while. It's always been my most popular story, not to mention my favourite one, and I continue getting requests to please make it available online again, so here it is at last. No good keeping it tucked away like a dirty little secret forever. :)Story Warnings: At the beginning of this story, Harry and Pansy are 16, Tom is 15, and Minerva 17. Explicitness (which is pretty much limited to Harry/Tom) increases with Tom getting closer to 16, but please be aware of this and avoid reading if likely to be disturbed and/or 16 is underage where you are.

So the rare event I chose is that both of these fics are Harry/Charlie, which is already a rare pairing. But also that magical tattoos are a main plot point.

It is a small exchange but what it causes is not, and there is no going back for either of them.Or: Idiots falling in love and not telling each other.

      A note about this before we begin\. I started this 2011/2012 and it's been a slow trudge and slog to the end\. This is mostly due to my terrible habit of dropping it when I don't have any motivation/inspiration/time/ideas or simply don't want to write\.
  #+end_example

  This is the longest thing I've ever written, and its in chapter form simply for ease of reading. It was not supposed to be in chapters; it was supposed to be a mammoth one-shot of pining and smut but it was 'suggested' that I put it up in chapter form, so here it is. So read on, and let me know if you've enjoyed these emotionally constipated idiots fall in love.
