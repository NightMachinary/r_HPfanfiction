I personally dislike the term /dogfather/ for Sirius. It's not funny ( even when Dobby says it), and is so overused in FF.

​

What are some others?


** "When Gred"

"and Forge"

"talk"

"like"

"this."

This might be my new favorite word, although I'm going to choose to interpret it as lamarckian evolution as applied to cryptozoological notions like Big Foot.

Now he might have looked up some muggle terms to make a better impression on Harry (or already knew the terms but never used them except in that situation) but I kind of doubt it.

Actually, it wouldn't surprise me if Harry had about as much of an idea what genes are as an average wizard.

This was a movie addition based on a Molly Weasley line during Molly Weasley's most obnoxious characterization, not something actually cannon to Sirius behavior in the books. Not once in the books does Sirius ever advocate for Harry to step into danger and not once does it actually seem he's conflated the boy with James if you're looking for it in the text. As far as the book is concerned, this was something irrational Molly said at one point trying to say Sirius had no right to inform his Godson about what was happening in the war. Kind of a messed up thing for her to have said too considering the man has been legally barred from seeing the kid for about thirteen years.

*********** English is a name drop language not a pronoun or epithet drop language and it's typically considered redundant in most prose based literature especially that drawing from the prevalent romantic themes popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s which JK Rowling so heavily draws from in writing Harry Potter. The fact that it's a common thing in HP fanfiction is kind of unavoidable when you're dealing with people who are well read in the genre HP pulls from even if it's something that happens rarely in the text. Likely because JK was trying for extra media appeal with greater readability so lowered the necessary level of comprehension all around even in the later books.

I can easily see how this would frustrate a non romantic language speaker to no end because epithets like this are uncommon outside of the language group and most certainly pull from Latin grammatical structures.

************* I legitimately didn't mean this as a dig in anyway. Only meant to be informative because this is kind of a dead genre in literature most people aren't interested in reading anymore which is why it's fallen into fanfic authors hands primarily. There are a lot of great romantic classics still lauded but most of them have a more modern grammatical structure where this is less common because as English evolves this is less and less a rule. i.e. people don't know how to read that language anymore because it's not relevant to them. Therefore it becomes clunky and begins seeming overly pretentious to most modern english speakers.

Level of comprehension has nothing to do with the merit of a story. I'm only trying to talk about a specific dialect that's pretty much outdated currently.

And yeah you're right, experienced authors don't use epithets the same way a lot of fanfiction authors do because, usually being younger, they aren't fluent in the dialect even if they're avid readers of the genre. Hard to be fluent in a dialect you don't hear spoken.

****** No, she did not apologize to Sirius in person, as she never got the change to do so before he died. I haven't caught her speaking ill about him afterwards either however, which I suppose is as close as you can get to apologising to a soul long gone.

I am not aware if she ever apologised to Hermione either, but the hospitality she brought for years afterwards to come I feel should serve as part of a silent apology. Obviously a sorry said out loud to go along with that would've also been a nice add. Hermione doesn't seem to hold a grudge to Molly after the incident however, so I feel like it has been cleared up the best it could with this course of action.

And no, Molly did not warm up to Fleur before her son 'got mauled'. Fleur didn't really make it easy for her to do so either, clearly showing reluctance and doubts that prevented herself to fit in a culture so different then hers. Not that it was Fleur's fault that Molly stayed so bitter towards her, but she was part of the problem. Also, ater the werewolf attack Molly clearly showed signs of realisation she was wrong about Fleur, that she should've trusted her son to choose a partner that he could trust and love and fit along with. We don't know if she ever apologised in words as Harry never described this to have happened, but we do know that after the attack on Hogwarts the two grew a lot more closer, where Fleur would feel more at home at the burrow and Molly putting a lot of effort into their wedding for it to be as perfect as possible.

I'm not going to defend Molly to the very end; she definitely has some flaws and isn't perfect. But I will defend her humanity. She is not as evil as I feel like your words make her out to be when I read them. Molly also did some great things; she was part of the order, she gave Harry a second home, she fought alongside the rest of the order at Hogwarts, and much more. Most of all she was a loving mother, trying her very best to rais seven children together with her husband with minimal income and loving them all equally. Even picking up extra children along the way. I don't think that could be brushed aside easily as well.

Thanks for coming to my TEDtalk everyone.

******* Arthur also saw how Harry was treated at the Dursley's and he saw it first hand at that, unlike Molly. He was also the one in law enforcement, so it was his literal job to do something about it. But I think it's likely that both Molly and Arthur could have gone to Dumbledore about it and been told about the protection. I don't think they are bad people.

Also, it really irks me how everyone only blames Molly for not doing anything about Harry's home life when Arthur was in a much better position to do so and had the first-hand experience with their family dynamics. It's like when someone is a murderer and everyone blames their mothers. Kind of sexist.

#+end_quote

Having been alive and cognisant of child protective services at that time, what do you mean by this? What do you think the UK did or didn't have?

I know, for example, that Harry sleeping in the cupboard was flat out illegal, and even had it been a full actual bedroom, with a window, that would also have been illegal because children weren't allowed to sleep in a downstairs room unless it was a bungalow or flat (and thus all rooms downstairs).

I know social workers existed for children in deprived families, and that, for example, Surrey Social Services would have looked out for Harry, had he been reported for wearing rags and being shut away.

I'll agree that psychological abuse wasn't recognised, but neglect was. Children had to have clothes that fit and were adequate to cover them and for the weather. Whether this happened in practice depended on reporting, but it was an actual thing that could end up with social services visiting your home.

Similarly, had anyone seen Petunia hit Harry with a frying pan, that too would have been very illegal, but, well, behind closed doors things like that happened.

I myself had to answer about bruises discovered during P.E., because the P.E. teachers were bound to notice and report, in the 1980s. People also checked I had adequate eyesight and glasses and that my teeth were looked at, although I wasn't neglected or abused and didn't end up with a social worker, fostered or in a children's home. We were just poor.

The main alarm bells in canon should have been: 1. Harry turning up in cast-off outsized rags when Dudley had new, fitting clothes. 2. Harry failing to turn up to school between 23rd June (Dudley's tenth birthday) and the end of school, typically in mid-July, without a doctor's note. 3. Bars on a child's bedroom window, assuming these weren't hidden. 4. Dudley's anti-social bullying behaviour. It wasn't subtle, and normally authorities would have intervened to work with the family.

This is not because the UK, at the time, was a primitive hellhole where kids were left to sink or swim. It was because there was some sort of failure of care. Existing services and safety nets somehow failed to apply when they should have done.

Personally, I'm inclined to believe that the implied failure in Harry's case was done deliberately, given JKR's later writing in /The Casual Vacancy/, where the systematic shortcomings of the social work department ultimately leads to the death of two children.

Plausible but really /very/ very odd that nobody ever acted. Kids do slip through the cracks, horribly often, but the horror stories are usually after social workers have been involved. Harry shows no cognisance of social care being an actual thing or that any adult would notice or care, when there are multiple triggers for a report or concern.

It's possible that it didn't make it to the books - there isn't much room in the first book for anything but story, since the whole thing is 75k words.

Basically, a kid like Harry in the UK in the 1980s should have expected some attention from social services when he turned up to primary school in outsized rags, and very much so when he just disappeared from school at the end of fourth year primary. And that's assuming that neither child ever mention Harry sleeping in a cupboard.

So... it could happen, but it's very odd indeed.

In England at the time, it was Infants, then One, Two, Three, Four Primary, (basic school) then One, Two, Three, Four, Five Secondary (three years basic school, two years GCSEs and before that, Ordinary or O levels), and then either Six, Seven at 'sixth form' at a school or a sixth form college, or just One, Two at college (two years doing Advanced or A levels).

The thing is, Harry still vanished before the last week of June, and was gone for several weeks, which, even at the end of the last year of school, would still be cause for concern. School breaks up around mid-July usually. So, Harry was at fourth year primary, then on Dudley's birthday, he gets shut in his cupboard and doesn't come out again until school is done.

I assume you thought I meant when he went off to Hogwarts, no that wouldn't be an issue. But a kid just disappearing from school for three weeks with no doctor's note? That's concerning. Especially with all the other red flags mentioned.

Dumbledore was considered the most powerful wizard in the UK, he was the one person Voldemort seemed to fear. He was also known to be working against Voldemort, and had previously defeated the last dark lord, Grindelwald.

Harry was the boy who lived, the only person to survive the killing curse and also defeat Voldemort. The prophecy was sealed with Lilys death. Harry Potter was the one who could defeat Voldemort. Is it shitty to ever let him be within range of them? Yes. But the blood protection also shielded harry and helped keep him from being found (irrc, idk I may be talkin out of my ass).

Everyone trusted Dumbledore. He was a very intelligent and powerful man. If there was any chance of Voldemort being fully defeated, it was harry. If he needed to go back once a year to be safe from a man who previously tried to kill him, the most powerful dark wizard in the world, and wanted to take over the world and kill muggles.

In phonetics, aspiration is the strong burst of breath that accompanies either the release or, in the case of preaspiration, the closure of some obstruents. In English, aspirated consonants are allophones in complementary distribution with their unaspirated counterparts, but in some other languages, notably most Indian and East Asian languages, the difference is contrastive, while in Arabic and Persian, all stops are aspirated.To feel or see the difference between aspirated and unaspirated sounds, one can put a hand or a lit candle in front of one's mouth, and say spin [spɪn] and then pin [pʰɪn]. One should either feel a puff of air or see a flicker of the candle flame with pin that one does not get with spin.

Anachronistic Americanisms are my instant drop, especially if the author moves the timeline forward 20 years, from 1991 to 2011, just so the characters can have iPhones and reference contemporary music and TV shows. (If you don't know who Amy Lee is, then get the fuck outta here!!!)

- Lazy writing by referencing pop culture. "The thing beating its head against Harry's bedframe looked like Yoda", instead of actually describing what a house elf looks like, eg, tennis ball eyes and big floppy ears. It's all over the place in published YA novels, which ages them so bad. JKR made HP timeless and universal by avoiding this kind of lazy writing.

- "Mom", "Semester", "Thanksgiving". Please no. Then there's out-of-place American-style idioms like Draco saying, "My tax dollars are being spent on Hogwarts educations for mudbloods!"

- American-style dialogue and speech patterns. It's immersion-breaking and so weird.

You didn't have to at the time, just to note.

However, to back your point, Uncle Vernon's fetching of a shotgun at no notice in canon is very illegal and bloody unusual. He must have had a mate who didn't care about the law, because you couldn't just hand one over and say have at it. Shotguns were, and are, pretty common in the UK, but you need a licence, a good legal record and a safe place to keep it.

Of course, attitudes tightened massively towards firearms of all sorts after the Dunblane massacre of 1996, but before then pistols were something that, in theory, a person could go out and get, one way or another.

'Guns everywhere' American style, no, definitely not.

This /is/ an anachronism. It wasn't that way in the 90s. Even the infamous handgun ban didn't exist until 1997. Vernon managed to buy a rifle on the spot in Book 1, and he even had a shotgun in the first movie in 2001.

What you can do is use an invisible, flying vehicle to drop a lot of potentially-lethal rocks from above. That's entirely covered by canon, even down to the lethality of the rocks on wizards, assuming that /Quidditch Through the Ages/ is taken as canon.

** This here's a copy of my answer to a similar question on Quora:

Pretentious Harry going around trying to call himself the Lord of House Potter and Black or whatever the hell it is.

Manipulative/Evil!Dumbledore. Look, we all know he made some flaws... BUT HE'S NO GODDAMN VILLAIN FFS!

Whitewashed Malfoys. Ugh, I just can't stand it when the Malfoys are overly good without a VERY GOOD reason as to such a change.

Absurdly abusive Dursleys. Usually goes hand-in-hand with the previous paragraph. I swear, the amount of times I've seen a fic either started with or containing a scene/aftermath of Harry being beaten senseless by Uncle Vernon... INSTANT NOPE OUTTA THERE FOR ME! Perhaps I see a little too much of the funny bloke that was Richard Griffiths (R.I.P) in this character, but I certainly do not view Uncle Vernon as some sadistic, constantly pummeling Harry to a pulp guy.

‘Fix-up of the plot' style stories. Look, Rowling didn't write everything perfectly and that's fine. But when fics go out of their way to show a 'competent' (/cough, Gary Stu/) Harry, then I see it as a blatant attack on this franchise. Added to this is TOO MUCH REALISTIC STYLE THINKING when we know Rowling's world is deliberately quirky and flawed. Stop trying to perfect everything in fanfics, folks! One of the worst offenders, IMHO, is the Methods of Rationality. That fic is one hyped up pretentious mess, no offense. The same goes for fanon Harry going 'Quidditch is a waste of my time, so I now study so hard because magic is so interestingly awesome!' This isn't in Harry's character at all to ditch Quidditch and act like a pretentious Hermione 2.0.

Seer!Luna. I just can't deal with this one.

Evanna!Luna in excess. Now, let me be one of this first folks (or not, if anyone's said this before) to make this a point. Book!Luna is NOT quiet and super surreal all the time, no. Book!Luna does get very angry when, for example, the Quibbler is insulted. Book!Luna also has a loud, uncontrollable laugh at the silliest of jokes at times (Ron in book 5). How is it that so many fanfic writers miss this one? Everyone writes Luna in accordance solely to Evanna Lynch's portrayal (no offense to her, btw.) Also, Tonks, not Luna, saved Harry on the train. Get it right, please.

Ron or Ginny bashing. Even as a Harmony fan, I refuse to blatantly bash these characters. Ginny, especially, can come off as too perfect all the time but doesn't deserve to be outrageously bashed in fiction. The same goes for Ron, which brings me to my next point...

Lavender Brown bashing. This one also irks me quite a bit. Have I ever seen a story with a likable Lavender in it? I'm not completely sure, really. Even in the books, she's written as a villain when she's just a normal teenage girl with a crush on the rising sportsman.

'Brightest witch of her Age' style writing of Hermione. Get it right, people; Lupin meant that Hermione's the brightest witch of her age, not Age. She's not the smartest witch of the 20th century! All he meant was that she's a smart 14 year old.

'I swear on my magic, so mote it be'. Oh yeah? Well, I swear as in a big F### YOU to this horrible, horrible plot device in fanon! Some reviewer even demanded to know why my book 4 era fanfic didn't conclude with Harry forcing Fudge to swear on his magic that he believes Voldemort is not back. This device is far too convenient to create any meaningful plot.

Submissive/scared/damsel in distress/bullied because of Veela heritage Fleur Delacour. No, she's a kick arse girl worthy of competing in a kick arse Tournament. I hate it when fanon reduces her to some crybaby, insecure object for Harry (or whoever the shipping partner is intended to be). Many people view Clemence Poesy's screaming sad scene in the film (when Harry brings Cedric back after the maze) to write Fleur's character. Don't get me wrong, I do love the films but some characterizations are not up to scratch in it. Besides, wasn't Gabrielle the one who screamed here in the book? Also, Fleur in the film always looks scared before or in the tasks. Where's her haughty, confident expression?

Dramione. I hate it; end of story, cheers.

Gringotts and its wide array of all sorts of services, OP Goblins included. Lol, I don't need to go into this trope at all.

Excessive use of movie facts over books. No, Ginny isn't the Reductor Curse pro; that feat is supposed to go to Parvati Patil. No, Snape isn't all suave and quiet-sassy all the time; book!Snape CAN REALLY RAGE AND SCREAM LIKE A LUNATIC AT TIMES, POTTER! GLASS JAR OF DEAD COCKROACHES NEARLY OVER YOUR HEAD, POTTER! SNAPE SCREAMS LIKE A MADMAN AFTER SIRIUS BLACK IS RESCUED, POTTER! No, Voldemort DID NOT own Dumbledore in their Atrium duel. Albus had him all the way while simply trying to lecture the Dark Lord.

Dumbledore wanted Harry to eff off and die. No, it's established in book 4 that Dumbledore has a 'gleam of triumph' in his eyes after Harry tells him of the graveyard. Why? Well, at the time of book 4's release, this confused the heck out of us. But the reason for Dumbledore's happiness is that after Voldemort's ritual he has a very good guess that Harry can and will survive. The films totally skipped this part about Voldemort using Harry's blood which unintentionally stored Lily's protection within him. It's because of this, mainly, that Voldemort's Killing Curse DID NOT kill Harry himself in the forest. Think of Voldemort as an anti-Voldemort 'Horcrux' (not precisely, but you get the idea) which tethered Harry to life for as long as Lily's blood was within Voldemort. So, the whole Pig for Slaughter thing was really done badly in the film, compared to the book.

I could go on and on, but nobody would like to see this answer continuing any further, right?

Some other are due to Fanon, like I swear on my magic, so mote it. It's the same problem that Veritaserum, these kind of "assured truth" plot devise destroy kill the plot.

Also they are stupid because in most case it's easily to bend them. For exemple "I swear on my magic that I did not enter my name in the Goblet of Fire, so mote it". Great, 2 possibles scenarios :

-If you entered your name in the Goblet, then got Obliviated so you truly think you didn't do it, do you loose your magic or not?

-If you give your name to an adult student, and let him put the name in the Goblet (or even worse use the Imperius to force him to do it), then you truly didn't enter your name in the Goblet yet are completely responsible for your participation.

​

That's the same problem than the "No trial Sirius" (another pet peeves of mine. He had a trial, jury saw him laughing in the middle of a war zone with 13 dead Muggles and one finger of Pettigrew alone. Heard the last word of Pettigrew and got the testimony of Dumbledore himself who said he put in place the fidelius charm, and the Potter told him they would have Sirius as their secret keeper. He got a trial and got proclamed guilty, end of the story. He was not present there because nobody was (we saw in Dumbledore pensive that the Lestrange and Croupton Jr were not present for their trial, just to hear the verdict. And we don't know if he wa here or not for the verdict. For what we know he may have been dragged from the courtroom to Azkaban yelling his innocence all the way.

Which brings up the odd point that you can cast the spell without the secret-keeper present, or even knowing who the secret-keeper is. That seems ... odd.

But honnestly canon doesn't expand into the Fidelius for obvious reasons. Like after the death of the secret keeper, everybody who knew the secret become the secret keeper, that's a lot of people and make the spell way weaker.

And what happen when the caster die? We knew Dumbledore was the secret keeper for the Order of Phoenix, but was he the caster? Or was it someone like Moody?

Sure she sometimes spend time with Neville, probably to study with him. And she is friend with Ginny, but they seem to mainly talk about boy, and especially Harry.

The only reason Hermione could have any knowledge about who like who or who hate who would be the time she spends in her dorm. Lavender and Parvati seem to be gossip (can't remember if it's canon or fanon) so she should learn a little just by being there.

Harry saw the group of Slytherin passing him, going to Charm, and then, following behind the group, with red eyes, a lone brown haired girl followed\\
"Why did Davis seem to have cried a lot" he asked to Ron.\\
"She had a big dispute with Parkinson yesterday after Herbology" said Hermione next to him. "She said to Parkinson she was dumb as a troll, and just as ugly. And Parkinson called her a dirty half blood rat and said she would never talk to her again. Apparently she spend the evening crying alone in an empty room".\\
Harry look at Hermione, surprised. "How do you know all of this?"\\

It should be a professional relationship between a banker and customer and I'd rather read about goblins using the war as another excuse to rebel rather than helping him for no reason with nothing in return.

I actually kinda like the idea of mercenary goblins that are more than happy to be "helpful" when it's highly profitable to them. Like if Harry says "oh the Sword of Gryffindor? Yeah I wielded that. I'll get back for you if you XYZ..." and then they're more than happy to do whatever a priceless goblin artifact is worth to them.

Why is an author even writing a dark!harry romance fic if you are afraid to show violence or sex or anything remotely similar? Stick to more tame subject matter if you are afraid of exploring the more mature side of things. Although.... you are writing about teens at a boarding school (or perhaps post school young adults) dealing with very mature subject matter in the middle of a fucking war in a magical world where everyone carries a deadly weapon. So even more tame subject matter shouldn't exactly not have any mature content. Lets be real here lol. Even the original books/movies have some very violent and mature parts.

I mean really? Feel free to be descriptive and even use that sort of dialogue in romantic settings but this was then just setting around the Order table amicably chatting about their war strategy and how Harry plays his role.

This overly romantic sounding mush shit is littered through this story so far in the least likely of places.

Slash (I have nothing against gay rights in anyway, I have a family member who is gay and we are on good terms so please no homophobic accusations, it's just not for me, though I know people like it)

Harry/multi/harem (it's just illogical, it would NEVER happen. I know you could easily say “well they changed his character” but just NO! This is a stupid idea. The only time I can “somewhat” except this for Harry/Fleur/Gabrielle, because at least you can BS your way through it with Veela nonsense, and TBH there is so little Harry/Gabrielle that is decent I'll take what I can get, though these are usually garbage) Sorry for the rant there but that pisses me off.

Harry suddenly makes up with Draco after years of rivalry (I don't hate the idea of them making up, some authors have done it well, but in other stories they are just miraculously friends because Draco saw the light, or Harry went dark, or someone convinced them they should be. That just doesn't make sense. It can be justified but very rarely is. It's usually just “hey I want a Harry/Draco friendship or pairing and am too lazy or not creative enough to come up with proper justification. The same goes for Snape, though he is far easier to justify the turn so it's not as much of an issue for me.)

Harry/Hermione (I don't even really have a good reason beyond the fact that it is overdone and usually unoriginal. I've just never liked this pairing)

Overly manipulative Dumbledore (this can kill a story so fast for me. I am ok with him being manipulative, it's not too far of a stretch to be honest. I don't think he was, but I can see where people would draw that conclusion and overall, I have no issue with it. But when he starts obliviating people, or paying the Weasleys to be friends with Harry, or blackmailing people... that's just way too far)

Addicted to the dark arts (I don't have an issue with the idea of it, it actually makes sense, and I've read stories where it's done well. The only reason I'm putting it here is because it's often introduced and taken way too far, or just executed very poorly, Harry turning evil overnight or the like)

Harry instantly becomes powerful (I have no issue with “Harry trains for months and is suddenly a prodigy” because it actually makes sense. We know he has the talent to do something like that, patronus at thirteen proves that. But this whole, “suddenly I'm powerful thing” is garbage. Even if the author wants to say before the story starts, “Harry is more powerful then in cannon just accept it” I'm fine with it, but the whole “powerup overnight thing” makes no sense. This also goes for magical blocks, don't even get me started, it goes back to overmanipulative Dumbledore all over again.)

There are probably more I'm forgetting and there is probably a lot of typos in this, but it's late, I'm on my phone and can't be asked to proofread I apologize. Sorry if this was just one big rant (I know it was) but that felt really good to just let all out :)
