I would like a fic like this, and feel free to write something like this in the comments. basically where diary riddle is way more competent and sane and threatening than regular voldy. one where he decides he is more fit to rule than voldemort himself and turns on him.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

** An idea I've posted before:

Ginny never survived. The destruction of the Diary merely forced the soul fragment into Ginny. The Ginny we see in the Books is the resulting merger of the Diary Tom and the original Ginny. She (he?) has the memories and powers of both, and this secret might be the reason why canon Ginny suddenly becomes so awesome.

Later, her (his?) skills are very much responsible for their lucky escape from the DoM; her airtight magical contract is the key to DA's safety during Year 7; and her killing of large number of Death Eaters during the Final Battle prevents a collapse of the defenders. During her duel with Bellatrix, she holds back a little too much and is almost hit by a killing curse. But alas, Molly takes over and finishes the job just fine.

After the war, she continues to use (guide) the Trio to advance her cause, while playing the role of a popular athlete herself. From time to time though, she needs to kill and torture some pesky enemies just for stress relief. Twenty years later, the Trio does indeed make it to the top, and she can happily rule behind the scene. Both Tom and Ginny should be proud of her achievements.

*** A Black Comedy is the first thing I thought of when I read OP's title but I'm always hesitant to recommend it for this sort of thing because it's a pretty big plot twist. I'm never sure what the etiquette is about recommending a fic if the reason you're recommending it is a spoiler.

Note that there there should be /no spaces/ between the tags ( >! and !< ) and the text you're spoiling, otherwise it doesn't work. As you can see from that sentence, actually.
