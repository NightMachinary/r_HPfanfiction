*** you can message the admins about people constantly downvoting people like that. We had the same issue over in [[/r/toledo]] and one guy was using ~10-20 accounts to downvote everyone. He was banned. Granted, this is obviously not as extreme given that it's probably multiple users, but the admins might take the time to look into it.

Besides, shipping has always been a matter of personal preference, as opposed to fact. Let's not turn the Great Debate into "just another shipping war".

*** I am going to write them in debate format and the normal question format.

--------------

Confirmed: All things created by JK Rowling, including books, movies, Pottermore, tweets, additional text books, plays, etc., should be considered canon.

Should all things created by JK Rowling considered canon?

--------------

Confirmed: The Hogwarts Houses help split students into their most preferred learning structure providing more emotional and educational support.

Do Hogwarts Houses help or hurt the sorted students?

*** The problems is that many of the really great questions rely on information we are simply not given in the books. So here are some that still work without that background:

The magical world should end international statute of secrecy

Hogwarts should stop sorting the students into houses

Dumbledore was right in his treatment of Harry

The seeker position should be removed from Quidditch

Hufflepuffs are the most dangerous students

Muggleborns and muggle-raised children should be removed from the muggle world as soon as they are found (complete separation of muggle and magical worlds)

Goblins have the true power in magical society

All students should be taught occlumency

The DA was truly an illegal group, and the students should be punished for their involvement

Snape was justified in exposing Remus as a werewolf

Potions are more useful in War then Charms

Muggle studies should be compulsory (even at the cost of other subjects)

The Dursely's were justified in their treatment of Harry

***** Nope. Given that they are both virtually separate nations with completely different tech trees, infrastructure, governments, cultures and security issues/concerns, there would be virtually no overlap between their respective legal frameworks either.

The better question is, if a wizard commits a crime in the muggle world, does the wizarding world acknowledge it as anything other than muggle baiting if they even bother to follow up on it? And would they care about crimes that don't necessarily entail a direct victim, such as smuggling if the magical components of the crime are confined to the wizarding world itself? After all, cocaine may be considered a rather obscure potions ingredient in the magical world. What would they care if an eccentric muggleborn wants to import a ton of the stuff-especially considering that it won't be consumed in the wizarding world at all? Weapons that would, after all, cause goosebumps to break out of any Law Enforcement official in the muggle world (tanks, missiles, helicopters) may very well merely qualify as curios to the local version of the DMLE.
