I always thought Harry's reaction in betrayal stories was odd. What do you think Harry's initial reaction to betrayal would be? And I mean Betrayal from someone he has loved and cared for years.

Would he break down and cry or be furious with rage and hatred? What do you think?


** I see this done so annoyingly in so many fics. "I'll never forgive them, he swore to himself." Three chapters later and they are the best of friends, pulling a Ron Weasley in book 4. I think if it was someone that he loved/cared for, it would be more of a breakdown.

*** Out of curiosity do you know any that do those well? Harry betrayed stories were one of my guilty pleasures growing up, the resolution of their betrayal weren't written well, but I normally enjoyed a lot of different stuff about the story/stories.

** Honestly I think he'd break down and cry. Like this is a kid who didn't have the best home life and had no friends, then he made like a bunch and he cared for them so much. If he found out any of them betrayed him I think that's be more of an extremely sad moment for him and cause him to breakdown then get angry.

**** While I hate that people bring this often as a way to bash on Ron, I'd say Ron leaving while the trio were out looking for the Horcruxes would probably be the closest reaction we have to a betrayal type of ideal.

****** True, I think it'd be a lot of denial at first, and then be angry. Remember the shouting he did when Ron and Hermione didn't write to him? He was furious with them over that.

** I think it depends on the kind and severity of the betrayal. Because his reaction to a friend revealing traumatizing childhood secrets to all and sundry could, would, and should be different to the aforementioned hypothetical friend murdering Harry's wife.

** I guess it would depend of the "level" of betrayal.

If it's just something along the lines of his dispute with Ron in GoF, nothing. Because it's not really a betrayal and because Ron is a better friend to Harry than Harry to Ron (or Harry to anyone really), risking his life several time for him and always there when really needed.

If it's a "true" betrayal, I would think he would react pretty much like when Sirius died. A lot of crying, but also destroying absolutely everything in his reach at the same time.

Now that's just some straight up nonsense, don't get me wrong /no-one/ is a particularly good friend to anyone in the original books (honestly do we even know what anyone does together for fun that makes sense for them to be hanging out? Quidditch and chess is the only thing that comes to mind). But if we're just counting risking lives for each other Harry has a hell of a lead over Ron, even just the willingly committing suicide out of love for his friends certainly wins out over anything else in the series.

***** Harry could have not gone after Ginny, or not given his triwizard winnings to Fred and George, or not forgiven Ron no questions asked when he was being a prick about the cup/the horcrux hunt, or not have saved Arthur's life, or not have /willingly committed suicide for him/.

Don't get me wrong, Ron willingly going with Harry on those adventures is all good, barring some childish jealousy Ron is a loyal stalwart friend through most of the books. He is most certainly not giving more for Harry than Harry has given for him though.

Also I love the idea that Ron is a better friend to Harry than vice versa because Ron goes with Harry into dangerous situations. Never mind they were going after his little sister in book 2, it was Ron's rat and Ron being dragged off by Sirius in book 3, Ron was never in danger in 4 and in book 5 several other people beside him volunteered to save Sirius as well. And after that it's made incredibly clear that even though Harry is the chosen one in book 6 and 7 Ron himself says its nothing to do with Harry and he's on the chopping block for being a blood traitor. So we have what, the stone in book one (seeing as hermione wouldn't have been in the toilet without Ron being a dick the troll bit gets a pass). Then the Sirius rescue in book 5 and that's it. Jeez man it's a shame Ron didn't give up on Harry after the first book. If he had he'd have avoided.... Well Ginny would be dead, he'd probably be dead between Sirius, pettigrew and lupin with no wolfbane and his father would be dead.

****** I'm not saying Harry hasn't done a lot for Ron, but what i'am saying is that any other person would have fucked off after the first year.

But Ron stuck it through, and Harry in turn gave his friendship also which extended to his family. Another reason why I love cannon!
