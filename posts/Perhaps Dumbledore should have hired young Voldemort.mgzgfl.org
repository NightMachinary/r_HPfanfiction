By hiring Voldemort as Defense professor, he would have shut down the death eaters far better than going to war with them. After all, Voldemort would have to give up all fun hobbies because now he's one of 10 teachers for like 400 kids. I already have no idea how normal hogwarts teachers do it, but dark lording and teaching are both full time jobs


** Children's minds are highly malleable and susceptible. No doubt Riddle would've groomed a handful of them into mini death eaters and charmed his way into their parents' social circles for influence. Keeping him far away from students was the best thing to do.

  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)

** Perhaps.

It could go both ways.

He could have truly desired to teach. Maybe it would have done him some good.

Or, maybe it was a nefarious Slug-club collecting people plan to find future followers for his grand plans.

Maybe, he didn't want a job at all, just an opportunity to hide the Diadem horcrux. He must have been at least 90% sure he wouldn't get the job.
