So a little over a week ago I posted the first chapter to a story I'm currently working on and I would like some feedback from people. So I'm asking here if you feel so inclined please give it a read and drop a review either here or on the actual story. The story is, obviously, called Violet's Playlist, it is currently only on FFN. And a few disclaimers here, it does contain a FEM! Harry and it is a crossover with Percy Jackson and the Olymians. Also the first four chapters will not contain much if any reference to HP, however after that the story will take place exclusively in the HP side of things. One last thing I'm not sure how to link the story so if someone can do so for me that would be amazing. Thanks guys
