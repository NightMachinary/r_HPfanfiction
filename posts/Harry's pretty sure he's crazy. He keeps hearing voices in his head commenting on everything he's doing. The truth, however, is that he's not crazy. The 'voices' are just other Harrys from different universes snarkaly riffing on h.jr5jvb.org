****** You are wrong. So, so wrong. You couldn't be more wrong. Why don't you stop thinking in such black, and white views story wise. Changing the gender of a character doesn't mean someone is homophobic. They could be exploring the different dynamics of a relationship(M/M, F/F, or M/F) based on the gender. I've read stories with straight pairings becoming gay pairings just to see how the story, characters, environmental atmosphere, etc... would change based on it.

Frankly I consider you to be homophobic based on how strongly you made this post based on a joke. Maybe you should look at yourself more, and judge others less.

****** fic is mostly what you've asked for- like multiple versions of harry's accross the harryverse, although not necessarily in a metatextual manner

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14488914]]

oop :)

also @ glencoe or something, both are are somewhat distinct identities.

you could have a physically femme pretty drac or femme drac while being male or have a femme fem! drake or more masc/butch drake.

-or like you can have a pretty while male drake or a pretty with fem!drake

-what you choose to manifest as a result of these distinctions is up to you

[[/u/issuesandasexuals][u/issuesandasexuals]], while good you're intentions may be, i don't think [[/u/glencoe2000][u/glencoe2000]]'s actions necessarily reflect the intention what you're suggesting tho it may come off as exclusionary.

--and also while you do you @ issusesand, ya don't have to enforce you're view of transformative works on other. People are allowed to genderbend and while you may dislike the the het conversion of a slash paring people can like what they want w/out it being inherently homophobic or with homophobic intentions,

but yeah the starting thread is anti-gay with their /somewhat/ reasonable interpretation of harry's character :/

- tho like personally i am a bit partial to femslash versions of slash pairings.

  ‚ÄúWelcome to the first Interdimensional Harry Potter Meeting!‚Äù Harry wakes to find himself surrounded by seven other, very different Harry Potters. He's about to learn more about himself than he ever wanted to know.\\
  Premise: I've read many stories in which Harry's life takes a turn at some point along the way and he becomes a completely different kind of person. This story explores several of those while focusing on Harry as he was in canon at the culmination of the 1st book. What if JK's Harry Potter were to discover prior to 2nd year exactly what his own potential could truly be? What if he had found unconditional acceptance and support to guide him on paths he'd never imagined? What if, at the tender age of 12, he had discovered unrestricted access to a deep well of information Dumbledore had never meant for him to have? I give you The Harry Potter Self-Help Group... WARNING: This is a Work In Progress. It is not finished, nor may it ever be finished. It is presently at around 35,000 words. I will post what I have written and add more if/when I write it. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
