Instead of time traveling Harry going back in time into his own body, what if Shepard, after the event at the end of /Mass Effect 3/, finds themselves reincarnated as Harry Potter, but with their Shepard memories intact.

Are there any stories like that?


** The only entertaining ME crossover is Harry Potter: Geth, and that does not follow your premise but has Harry thrown through time on accident.

Linkffn(10784770)

There are a few other fics, but they are either abandoned or feel very forced. Not to mention OOCness.

  During the final battle Harry is hit with a luck spell... but who exactly got lucky? Harry finds himself in the future fighting a new war when all he wants to do is have a nice and easy life. So he decides to have fun instead.

*** I disagree. linkffn(12595819) is very entertaining.

Also linkffn(10006313) is somewhat good.

None of them are what you're looking for, OP, and I doubt there are any.

  Harry Potter finds himself, and his normal bi-polar luck, pulled out of a quiet retirement and into the limelight of the 23rd century. He finds a grand new stage upon which his 'saving-people-thing' can act, and before he can say no, is pulled into the middle of a galaxy-spanning conflict. Rated 'M' for bad words and ideas, re-worked and re-posted. Enjoy.

  The battle at the Department of Mysteries went differently for Harry. Trapped in a new time and being the last wizard alive, Harry must find a way home while evading enemies far darker than he has ever faced before.- Pre-ME1 to Pre-ME2.

**** I'm 2/3 through Ascension right now and while it is interesting in places, I find some of the narrative choices odd and the transition until the events of ME1 feels rushed.
