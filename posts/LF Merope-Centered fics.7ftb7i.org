As long as she's the main character or has a central role in the story, any pairing is fine. And so are AUs.

Thank you in advance :)

  Amortentia, the book calls the potion, and for the first time magic comes easily. Morfin is wrong. Papa is wrong. Merope can do magic and she can do exceptionally good magic.

*** That's a lovely, thoughtfully--and very well--written little piece. And four reviews (Well, five now I suppose). I despair of this fandom. Again.

**** I agree. That's a really lovely character study; I felt for her, despite what she did. Unfortunately reflective, poignant character pieces like that rarely get the attention they deserve.

*** I'm starting to love all your fic recs. Do you have any for Tom Riddle Sr or the Bloody Baron?

**** No really good ones for Riddle Sr. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1302979][The Prince and the Tramp]], which shows Merope/Tom from Tom's PoV, is decent but unexceptional. I've heard good things about about [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=226118][Give Up This Fight]], but I haven't read it yet.

For the Baron, I recommend [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/230835][For All Time]], a Baron/Grey Lady story. It is a well written piece about guilt and forgiveness and the nature of ghosts. There's a bunch of Baron fics written for the [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/hp_beholder/tag/bloody+baron][HP beholder]] fest. I haven't read any of them, but stories from there tend to be of higher quality than most.
