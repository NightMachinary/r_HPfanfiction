Ginny playing hard-to-get or trying to make Harry jealous in retaliation before giving in later for her earlier unrequited love also counts.


** Ginny did both of those in the cannon books. But why would you want to read a story that petty? Would you actually want to be in a relationship with someone that dates other people to literally only make you jealous when they've 'gotten over their crush'?

*** Just my personal taste for now. The title of the topic is the true request, anything in the description is secondary but nice to have on hand.
