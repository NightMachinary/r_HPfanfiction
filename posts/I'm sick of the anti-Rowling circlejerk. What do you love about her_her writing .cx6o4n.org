** Sneaking lots of really profound stuff into a children's book, I guess. I mean, there are a lot of problems, but... a lot of thought went into the original 7, if not into anything else in the franchise. A lot. Foreshadowing, complex characters, social commentary, allusions...

I am the perfect age to have grown up with HP and I did read the books in real time, but I dismissed them because I was a snarky know-it-all who was too good for them. Fast forward to a couple of years ago, a terrible period of insomnia got me reading them again, and... immediately re-read them. Re-read a couple of times since then and I also listen to a podcast called "Harry Potter and the Sacred Text" which I recommend to everyone, it's great. It's like, suddenly all this beauty that was always under my nose revealed itself to me.

*** I was also the right age to have grown up with the books as they were published --- approximately the age of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were in Books 4-7 as they were released --- and I absolutely loved them at the time (and still do now).

That said, I completely took for granted how considerate JKR was to the mindset of the characters at their various ages. OotP is often called out for the elements of “teenage drama” and “angst,” particularly based on outbursts from Harry. I was fairly close in age to book-Harry at the time it was released, so while I understood the scenarios that annoyed other older readers, to me the characters' behaviors weren't so remarkable. To me, the characters' thoughts and actions were mostly within the spectrum of what I'd expect, especially given the intense pressure the characters were under.

I know I didn't fully appreciate the age-authentic tone and relatability of JKR's work until much, much later. One of my siblings recently read the books for the first time, and her adult reactions were so different from my teenage reactions. In my re-readings, I still carried with me my teenaged impressions, but through my sibling's eyes, I finally fully appreciated the significance of an adult being able to effectively capture a pre-teen and teenage experience, to the point that readers of that age don't even think twice about it.

Despite recognizing and relating so strongly to that age-authentic writing then, and appreciating it now, I highly doubt I'd be able to replicate it. I did a re-read recently just to fully experience it, and sure enough those books grow up precisely with the characters --- in terms of tone, plot, insight, and language --- while still carrying enough weight to engage much older readers as well. I think most authors would be hard pressed to do the same.

**** That's really very true. And yet even book 1 has heartbreaking moments for adults.

The most painful part in book 1 to me is Harry telling Hagrid there's no way he is special because if he were, he could handle the Dursleys better. I want to yell at the page, stop blaming yourself, Harry! Then you read book 6 and see Tom Riddle's reaction and he's like hell yeah I am special. This is not only insightful but super subtle character design.

** I love the characters who are not black and white and I love the world JKR created. I love that HP books are fun and engaging mysteries and not an infodump of lore some people think they want. One of my favourite things about the books is JKR's satire; I don't think she gets enough credit for that.

I don't agree with some fans' desire for gritty realism in canon and love that HP books are optimistic about human nature and hopeful about the future. Which is very much not the the case for JKR's other books, btw. And those are worth checking out for people who seriously think she's can't move on from HP universe. She wrote 5 non-HP books since the DH! Good books, too.

******* [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero][Byronic heroes]] are charismatic characters with strong passions and ideals, but who are nonetheless deeply flawed individuals who may act in ways which are socially reprehensible because he's definitely contrary to his mainstream society. A Byronic hero is on his own side and has his own set of beliefs which he will not bow nor change for anyone.

A Byronic hero is a character whose internal conflicts are heavily romanticized and who himself ponders and wrestles with his struggles and beliefs.

--------------

Severus Snape is essentially a Byronic hero, as seen by a protagonist who sees much more of his negative qualities than his positive ones. He's an intelligent loner who's also completely insufferable, with a tragic backstory involving death and unrequited love which caused him to become embittered but also to go over to the side of good.

Sirius is apparently quite clever and used to be very attractive before the strain of being locked up for twelve years for a crime he didn't commit ruined his good looks. Plus, bonus points for being slightly mad, a wee bit homicidal, and the last heir of a noble family from which he inherited a spooky old house. And both he and Snape have a flair for the melodramatic.

I've always found his behaviour with Severus in his adult life to be very illuminating. You can't be that mature in face of a constant barrage of verbal barbs and snark and never have shown any evidence of it in your childhood. Compare this to Sirius, who can never grow out of his childhood grudges.

JKR shows that even the good guys can make mistakes and the bad guys can still do the right thing. Yes there are some character that are pure evil, but there's no one that's purely good.

Dumbledore is right in the end, but did that excuse his treatment of Harry, especially his Horcrux? Did that makes him a bad person? Even Harry did two of the Unforgivables, one of them for a fairly selfish reason. Ron's first reaction about werewolf, half giant, and house-elf shows that even the good guys can have a shitty prejudice, but they can grow themself out of that prejudice.

That make sense? Also we never really hear what his “theory” is. Sure it's likely he had an inkling that Remus is a werewolf, but for all we know, his theory could've been something way off (also possible if one considers that the marauders would've likely done all they could to confuse the heck out of Severus).

And to be honest... even if he did go over there knowing there was a good chance of finding a werewolf on the other side (which is definitely a stupid and bad idea), I don't think that's at all equal or in any way excuses the fact that Sirius actually /told/ him where and how to get there.

Back to my original point though, I think that betrayal of trust probably cut deeper than Harry and we ever imagined. I mean how else is it that Sirius suspected Remus was the real spy if there hadn't remained some tension? It could help explain Remus's own ability to believe Sirius of betraying James and lily?

He shows up at the shack to see 3 students scared, unarmed, and confused. And black and Lupin like bffs again. All in the room where he probably still associates a lot of his trauma. Then he's stunned and doesn't wake up until it's all over. Not to mention, he can't be sure of what else he saw in those moments leading up to him being stunned, because as far as he knows Sirius is a dangerous criminal who likely had an accomplice (that's another point against Lupin I won't get into now. I understand why he didn't say anything about the animagus transformation or the Map for plot reasons) Anyway my /point/ is that Snape probably actually believed his own words when he said Harry, Hermione, and rom were confounded. Because Sirius being capable of that fits neatly with his world-view since he (and the rest of the wizarding world -/including Sirius' own friends/) still thinks he's guilty.

** The way she embraced fanfiction and fandom was so incredibly important for fanworks as a whole, and we should always appreciate her for that. I also like that in terms of world building, she created a very interesting world with enough room for people to explore on their own. She's also excellent at the whole comfy vibe of Hogwarts.

** The realistic characters (even when the narrative is childish we can see the shades of grey there), the amazing word building, oh god the humour, and her excellent pacing and tension building.

Yes, some things fall apart on too close an inspection (especially numbers!) - but there are very few series that don't have flaws like that (that are complete and able to be examined critically in full).

I love Rowling, I just wish she would have left the books as a stand-alone thing and not kept dropping extra backstories etc. It's not the same when it isn't written into a story, and some of it outright contradicts what has been revealed previously.

** I love how she writes characters and character relationships. The fact that everyone can disagree over who's the best and who's the worst, who's their favorite, who's justified and who's not, tells you that she's made these dynamic and very real characters. They're flawed, and they have interesting relationships with each other and that brings life to the whole story.

That, and I like how creative she is. The technical side of her worldbuilding may not always hold up to scrutiny, but /man/, did she make a world that's fun and breathtaking and foreign while also familiar in all the best ways. There's a reason why I always come back eventually, and it's because the world of Harry Potter, for all its flaws, embraces me and then draws me back into that sense of wonder all over again.

** The whole reason there's an anti-rowling circle jerk is she's gone back and gone completely against a lot of what we loved about her.

What I loved is how far out of her way she went to make her story internally consistent. Like, there's a clearly established timeline and she goes to a lot of trouble to make sure everything doesn't just fit, it makes logical sense that it fits there and why. And she's real REAL clever about adding stuff to it, introducing Barty Crouch Jr, arguably horcruxes (unarguably clever, arguable if it's timeline related), the whole bit with the time turners... (and Fantastic beasts 2 fucks a LOT of this...)

I love how consistent her characters are. They felt REAL. You can take specific lines and know exactly what character that's probably from even if they're not familiar. It's why IMO HP Fanfiction has taken off so much, because they still feel like the SAME character instead of just saying lines and putting a name on them (again.....issue with CC and FB).

** JKR knows how to tell a good story with proper character development and foreshadowing. Also as a non-Brit, the series has a complete British vibe to it. She drops plenty of clues and has hints of non-PG humor that make re-reads enjoyable!

She also utilizes common tropes well. OotP was very relatable as a somewhat rebellious teenager. PoA and HBP give me teen drama/movie vibes. She created a magical world that is very relatable

** My favorite part of JK's writing is that there are no "filler" chapters. Fanfiction tends to be guilty of this a lot, where Harry and his girlfriend go down to Hogsmeade for the day and have tea and go shopping and generally have a good time, and that's nice and fluffy, but nothing /important/ happens. No plot, no Chekhov's guns, nothing.

** I will always dislike her more than like her. The only thing I am grateful for his her creation of a wonderful world (even if gleaned from other writets) and excellent character's.

She writes simplistically (probably not intentionally) but the story is easy to immerse yourself in due to the imaginative descriptions. I think her descriptions are what make her writing style as the images pop in your mind without even trying.

That said... I think she cut the legs off from underneath her trying to overcomplicate and overcompensate to prove she's not predictable, that her character's dont fit into norms, and that her writing is profound. This is what makes me so sad.

Thanksfully fanfic has some good writers out there that have turned HP into it's TRUE potential which I dont feel JKR ever did.

She wrote them in such an amazing, wondrous way, and I just absolutely adore every single book in the series. It's truly amazing how she subtly included more serious themes even in the first books, in a manner than made it so that people of any age could read and love them because there are elements for all ages. I don't really know how to put it into words. I'm just really grateful to her for writing them and going through the effort of sharing it with the world despite how difficult it was.
