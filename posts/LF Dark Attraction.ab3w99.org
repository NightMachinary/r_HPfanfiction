Fics that have Harry getting attracted of Bellatrix, despite her Crimes and that she murdered Sirius. It doesn matter, if this happens Canon or in an AU where she survives the War. Fics that have "evil" females seduce him and possibly get a advantage of him (by distracting him or whatever) also is fine.

This Attraction can also happen after the War is over, she died and he is possibly in a marriage with Ginny, Harry is starting to think more and more about the Crazy and evil Witch and might wonder, whats happening to him.

​

A new female Villain shows up after Voldemort is defeated or an Alternate Version of the Dark Lord, as a female, either shows up, or he gets dragged into her World.

​

That being said. Scenarios that have Harry being attracted to "Dark" Women, but he wouldnt choose the "other side" are fine too

​

As examples, i can name "Ouroboros" by Voice of the Nephilim, the Fic is fine minus the Torture scenes. But the seduction scenes i can say, are good.

"After the Dawn" on Adultfanfiction is also good.

"The Master Bedroom of Delacour Manor" fits well, although Harry might give into Fleur a bit fast, but im not complaining. She is not a clean Person here.


** Well, linkffn(Delenda Est) has Bellatrix, but before she actually becomes properly evil. The first half is excellent, the second half is disappointing.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

Got you right here fam. linkffn(The Human Condition by C.K. Talons)

Now I haven't read this in some years, but it definitely features what you requested, plus I believe it's a well written story. Note that as it was completed in 2004, it's only canon up to OotP. The story is a mystery so half the fun is in wondering wtf is going on, but I'll spoil a bit more if you want. I definitely suggest reading it blind though.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2896398/1/Only-Enemies][Only Enemies]], a Harry/Bella story where they both end up in an alternate dimension after the war. It's abandoned, but I think it featured a quite faithful representation (and expansion) of Bella's character.
