HEEEEEELPPPPP Was reading a really interesting new fic (Scorpius Malfoy and the Blood Runes) and was looking forward to reading it during my lunch.

I'm a little out of sorts. This is the first fanfic I've read in a few weeks (stupid responsibilities) and now I can't read it? Is this God's way of punishing me?

Seriously though, I hope it comes back up soon.

***** Thanks. I got super excited when you told me this and immediately downloaded it to start playing with it. I should have known there would be a drawback. Apparently the app uses its own tts engine instead of using the system's engine. In most cases that would be fine, or maybe even better. But I went to great pain to install an engine that sounds a lot less robotic. I may be able to get used to it, but I'm not a fan. And I don't see why they would do that instead of just using the system default engine.

********* The app isn't in the store anymore. It doesn't support versions of android later than either gingerbread or ice cream sandwich. But if you can find the apk on the internet and install it that way, it still works.

Another one that's almost as good is vocalizer TTS. Unfortunately each voice is $3.99 but they do sound nice. If ivona ever breaks that will likely be my first choice.

**** That's just... not true, though.

There are 168,177 works in the Harry Potter fandom on AO3, with only 29,608 being marked as Explicit. If you assume that EVERY work marked as Explicit is smut, which isn't the case at all, then only 17-18% of the content is smut. That's hardly the "Grand Majority".

****** My definition of slash, in this case, is anything marked with a "slash" keyword. It's not the greatest search definition but, hey, it should get /most/ things.

There are now *168,224* works in Harry Potter on AO3, an increase of 47 fics since my post 9 hours ago.

Of those *168,224* fics, there are *13,203* fics with a *slash* tag. Or around *7-8%*.

Of those *168,224* fics there are *29,616* fics marked as *Explicit* (an increase of 8 since my post 9 hours ago). Or about, still, *17-18%*.

Of those *29,616* fics marked as *Explicit* there are *3,928* fics marked as *slash*, or about *13%*.

To summarize, about *7-8%* of all stories on AO3 are marked as *slash* which almost doubles to *13%* if its an *Explicit* fic.

EDIT: I just realized I forgot to answer your question. However, there's no really good way for me to answer you. The search feature on FFN isn't a standard any archival site should strive for.

To theorize on why you may have made that observation, however, AO3 displays all of the Work you're looking for as well as ALL crossovers. Fandoms like Twilight, for instance, bring in a HUGE amount of slash. But on FFN you have to travel to each individual crossover. Additionally FFN used to heavily enforce their sexual content guidelines and MOST slash is explicit, meaning FFN over the years would naturally have less of it.

EDIT2: To clarify my point of "MOST slash is explicit":

Of the *13,203* works marked as *slash*, *3,928* of them are marked as *Explicit*, or about *30%*.

On reflection, you can't really call *30%* "MOST" but it is a fairly large percentage.

******** I would say the vast majority of slash stories include the slash tag. Enough that it's not particularly worth creating some convoluted search filter to improve my statistics above.

Also, I've added an edit to my first response to you that you may find helpful to understanding your observation.

Edit: Also, it's worth noting that the [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Slash][*Slash Keyword*]] on AO3 encompasses more than just the word itself, but many similar keywords. AO3 does this with all their tags.

Then I use moon+ reader pro to access and read the books, sometimes listening to them using the Ivona HQ tts engine with the British Amy voice module. I only use the ff.net app to keep track of incomplete fics that I am following.
