I'm looking for stories of harry either being a protective older sibling or having a protective older sibling. I really like this dynamic every once in awhile. I would prefer if they siblings were not twins and only older by minutes/hours but will gladly accept it either way.

Thank you all so much if you can help.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  Audrey Potter hates the technicalities that constantly drag her into trouble with her twin brother, Harry. But when she finally starts to prove herself by crawling from behind her brother's overbearing shadow during the Triwizard tournament, she begins realizing that it may have been better to just stay hidden...slow-burn Draco/OC. Swearing. Spoilers in Reviews!

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

** Be warned this story contains Incest

Potters Against the World linkffn(12200475): Harry is expelled by the ministry and obliviated, years later his younger twin sister and Gabrielle find him, restore is memories and travel back in time to 4th year to prevent Voldemort from ever rising.

Deals with the consequences of two siblings being raised in a loveless and abusive household, which includes the two latching onto each other in a way that they even admit is unhealthy. Harry and Rose's incest is not just hand waved in this story as "oh well pureblood's do it all the time ha ha lol XD" it has consequences throughout the story among their fellow students, teachers and loved ones. Some people like Tonks and Sirius don't find it to bad, because in their minds something worse probably could have happened to them thanks to the abuse they suffered, while others like Remus and Dumbledore find it abhorrent.

  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).
