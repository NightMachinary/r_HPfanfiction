Hey guys,

so it's me again and this time I am looking for fanfictions with vigilanty justice (like say muggleborns banding together after the war ends to punish the purebloods who they think got off too easy (which I agree with...can't heal a rift in society by letting the guilty walk and continue to make life miserable for people they perceive as kind of lesser beings, like muggleborns, half-bloods and blood traitors! Not to mention creatures like werewolfs, centaurs etc.))

As always:

- No Slash (just not my cup of tea - damned, now I want tea!)
- not Harry/Ginny (unless it's just a stellar piece of fanfiction that blows almost everything else out of the water!)

So, once again: The stage is yours!

greetings LAX


** I think majority of Indy!Harry fics does that, with a fair amount of Dumbledore, Order, and Weasley bashing. Indy!Harry generally lashes out, while Dumbledore and Voldemort behave like bloody idiots.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), is refreshing because this Dumbledore uses Hermione's terrorist group very effectively and eventually forces the Ministry to fully oppose Voldemort. On the other hand, Voldemort is both cunning and terrifying, and has quite a few surprises. Both sides also have their own killer squads and vigilante groups, making the situation chaotic and volatile.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** Hm...I hope it's not Hermione worship (she does have flaws, large glaring ones, too but the fandom too often ignores that IMHO), but I'll give it a try, so thank you (one up-vote coming up!)

*** I'll check that out right now, thank you (one up-vote comming right UP! ;) )...ok, first thing I noticed:

Nice picture (guy stabbing another through the top of the head...seems old, maybe from an old book (centuries old to be precise)), gruesome, but still nice!
