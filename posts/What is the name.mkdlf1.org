:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The fic is basically Harry goes into the forbidden forest and Greyback attacks him. Greyback ends up kidnapping Harry and Remus and Sirius try to search for him. I remember that Remus gets a letter from Greyback about his whereabouts and Remus goes to him alone because Sirius was asleep. I think it might have been on Archive but I'm not sure.
