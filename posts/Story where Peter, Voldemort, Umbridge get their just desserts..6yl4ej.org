I don't mean they just die or get sent to prison, i want to have inflicted onto them what they inflicted onto others. Either Peter, Voldemort, Umbridge, Flint, Greyback, Snape maybe even dumbledore to a lessor degree. It can have one or all of them as long as they truely get what they deserve.


** Isn't it heavily implied in canon that Umbridge gets raped by centaurs?

On the flip side, that's actually pretty offensive to centaurs.

Someone please revert my understanding to a simple beating-up.

*** If she had been raped by Centaurs she wouldn't have headed Muggle Registration, she'd have been campaigning for Centaur genocide.

** Linkffn(Trolling th Toad) Harry orchestrates a harassment campaign against Umbridge, at one point sabotaging the blood quills so they mark her instead of the writer, which reacts badly with the nosebleed nougat potion (blood thinner) that the twins put in her tea.

If you want pure venge-fic, linkffn(The Crow: Phoenix Rising) Harry is the Crow, and he starts with Pettigrew and ends with Voldemort, doling out the kind of justice only a god-powered zombie can dish out.

  What if "the power the Dark Lord knows not" had nothing to do with love? What if it had everything to do with justice? Crossover of Harry Potter and the Crow.
