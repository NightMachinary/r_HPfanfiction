:END:
It doesn't have to be /Harry/ getting augmented, but I want to see fics were the process of becoming more than human (or just /different/) is a major theme. Canon has shades of this - Moody's eye and Pettigrew's silver hand - but I want more. The most common way I've seen this play out in fanfiction is with magic runes tattooed onto the body, and while those stories are great, I want to see what else is out there.

Any suggestions?

*** I liked it. It was a bit silly at times but it was nice.

I didn't like the whole Stargate stuff at the end - I hate crossovers and never saw Stargate. There also wasn't any real conflict in the story which is a shame. If you power up the protagonist you should also power up the enemy to make it more interesting. Adrian was also very puzzling

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is written by transhumanist scientist and thinker Eliezer Yudkowsky, and is all about transhumanist ideas --- though more the "eradicate death" part than the "augment man beyond what a healthy, unaging man would be" thing. That being said, there /is/ some augmentation at the end of the story, though not on Harry... but I can't really tell you more without spoiling anything.

linkffn(Lady Archimedes) has Hermione manage to de-Horcrux the Diadem of Ravenclaw and use it on herself. It's very well-thought-out; the Diadem is shown to work by removing the mental barriers that filter our perception and subconscious and let it all flow into the conscious mind. So if used by someone who's calm and calculating and rational, it gives off a lot of benefit like perfect photographic memory for a time, but if used foolishly you'd go mad from the sheer overload of data (which is implicitly what happened to Helena Ravenclaw).

linkffn(Core Threads), which is blessed with the most OP Harry in existence but without the angst or artificial drama or edginess that usually goes along with it (making it an enjoyable "light" read), sees Harry rebuilding his body from scratch with Transfiguration some time in the later chapters, carefully picking what strengths (both physical and mental) he wants for himself. He's also immortal and stuff.

And for now it pales in comparison to the very straight examples above, but I'll go ahead and mention my own linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor). As of recent chapters, Hermione went through a variation of Voldemort's Resurrection Ritual and ends up no longer quite human --- which has benefits, but also weird side-effects like glowing purple, and spontaneous visions of harpsichords (don't worry, it makes sense in context... or it will once the other shoe drops).
