Another prompt that occurred in my mind, although I am surprised that I couldn't find a crossover anywhere (Unless I'm not looking in the right place, then I suck at searching).

Images I saw in my mind: "" Somehow, Lily's Sacrifice managed to not only protect Harry but somehow transported him to the same time and place as Aloy. Upon hearing the cries of babes, the High Matriarchs discovered the two children.

As for making them outcast, that was quickly established but they did debate on splitting them up; if they were a gift by the All-Mother, surely the "siblings" should remain together. Outcast perhaps, but a family. On the other hand, if they were placed there by the Metal Devils, who knows what both of them could unleash upon the Nora.

Suddenly, they felt something within, almost screaming at them to ensure they remained together, "This must be the Will of The All-Mother. Outcast, but family they must be."

Rost raises them, having named them and grows to love them as his own. He soon seen why the High Matriarchs saw fit to outcast them, Harry made strange things happen and yet never once harmed himself or Aloy. Once, the boy's strangeness saved him from a Watcher that strayed from it's usual path.

As for Aloy, he's yet to seen any strangeness from the girl. Perhaps she is "gifted" in other ways, although he would like it if she asked less questions about the Old World.

Never would he felt this icy fear within his heart when both the children tumbled down into an old Ruin... ""

They could be the same age or Harry could be the older "brother". Although I find it hard to imagine Aloy being a complete new-born as opposed to being slightly more developed, so she could start eating some soft solids (I would imagine the smart people would at least consider all possibilities, one being a lack of wet-nurses or the equivalent of).

As for Aloy having magic or being "gifted" would be up to the writer, although how everything can slow down when she aims could be due to magic, right? Right?

I do like the idea that they both complete the trial at the same time, causing a new legend or the like. Both almost worn out, and yet determined to win together.

Then again, since Harry is there; who knows how different the time-line will turn out? I think I'll leave it to greater writers than I!

(Edit: Thank you fellow Snoo for my first gold award! I can't tell you how much that means to me, but thank you.)


** Dude I've been waiting for a good one. I'm totally on board
