The only ones I've found are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769][dead things]].

If you're looking for something similar to this, but where Harry quits the Aurors or does something else, I've got plenty of recs on this thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ka9m09/can_someone_rec_me_posthogwarts_fics_where_harry/]]

I'd prefer the fics to be:

- complete
- actively updating and at least 30k words
- or on hiatus/abandoned and at least 50k words
- gen fics, canon pairings, or other pairings are fine
- Harry/Ron/Hermione and Harry/Fred/George are the only multi-pairings I'll accept
- cliche is fine
- canon divergence or canon up to the Epilogue is fine
- Master of Death or not is fine

Things I *don't* want:

- multi-shipping/harems
- Harry/female Slytherins or Hermione
- time travel
- dimensional travel
- Harry/Lucius or Snape or anyone that's in his parents' generation or older
- Wrong Boy Who Lived

Fics that people have already recommended me in the past:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/][Ruthless]]

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.
#+end_quote

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19889305][Outrages So Hideous]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry knows that everyone would be disappointed in him. Hell, he's disappointed in himself. But he just doesn't see any other way to change the rotten structure of wizarding society.
#+end_quote

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/552828/chapters/985108][Stunning Shifts]]

#+begin_quote
  During a publicity stunt, Harry and five others are sent to another world where a well timed Stupefy made all the difference. As Harry looks for his peers and a way home, another Harry investigates the odd arrival of his doppelganger.
#+end_quote

*Thanks for any recommendations!*


** The Charming series by lomonaaeren features Harry declaring himself a Dark Lord and taking over Hogwarts to protect it from the Ministry for Magic. Some interesting magical theory, new magical creations (a dark phoenix), and a rather poorly developed relationship based on the premise that strong magic users are extremely attractive to those around them (Harry/Draco).

  Harry doesn't really like the way things are going in the wizarding world. But who's going to do something about it?...Him, that's who! (Or, how Harry became a Benevolently Snarky Dark Lord).

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A_Second_Chance_at_Life][A second Chance at Life]] by Miranda Flairgold. When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic. Complete but has an unfinished sequel. FFNet. No Harry declaring himself a dark lord per say but pretty close.
