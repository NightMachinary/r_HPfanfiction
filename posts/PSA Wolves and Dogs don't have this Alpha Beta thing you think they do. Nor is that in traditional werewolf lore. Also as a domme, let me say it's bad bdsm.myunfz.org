If your magically compelled to engage in a pseudo bdsm relationship due to becoming a Werewolf that's plain bad. Remember folks SSC- Safe. Sane. Consensual. If you wanna write bdsm write bdsm. You wanna write a werewolf fic, write that. But if you want some bdsm werewolf fic, take your speech about being an alpha/beta and turn it into a dialog about wanting a bdsm relationship and the boundaries, safe words, aftercare and such that is needed. Seriously. And again, none of this is rooted in canine science as we know it.

Edit: There seems to be some confusion about what I'm saying, so let me clear things up. Was this me expressing frustration at a bad trope or me issuing a law saying those who do it should be tortured and executed? Clearly the latter. I definitely was not making fun of the bevy of writers in and outside of fanfiction making bad bdsm stories involving werewolves or our society misconceptions about animals. No, this post was serous business ™ and my army of soldiers will be arriving at your doors to burn all your alpha beta stories. Resisting will involve 6 hours of someone reading My Immortal to you.


** My take on this is that this kind of thing is where tagging and authors notes are important. People write and read fan fic for a whole bunch of reasons and in different ways and there are times when some people want to read really filthy and animalistic sex with lots of semen and biting and that's valid, but it's also best if that shit is labelled as such. Most people who write quality ABO know it's a stupid trope and understand that actual animal packs aren't structured that way, but they want certain things out of fic and gleefully go forth and create it. These people put labels on their shit such as ‘dubious consent' and ‘non consent' and even ‘dead dove:do not eat' when it's necessary.

But then there are other writers who write really toxic shit, like literal rape and abuse and then pretend like it's the height of passion and romance and that they're a font of wisdom about real life sex and or bdsm dynamics and frankly that /is/ a problem.

I know that a younger me who hadn't even watched porn by the time I was well into my twenties (Christian upbringing lmao) was exposed to bdsm through fic first and I was really lucky that the authors in that case were really responsible in how they talked about stuff and were like ‘don't learn this shit from fanfic lmao, do proper research' which is the general attitude that makes sense.

Because it has to be said that what we like in fiction/entertainment often has very little bearing on what we like in the real world. And AO3 is the way it is because of a history of extreme pressure on fan fic writers to not write about two male characters banging or whatever else. But we also need to remember that there are young or uneducated peeps reading your shit, no matter how nicely you ask them not to, and a little note saying ‘this is very fictional fiction and is not/should not be an example for how /anyone/ does anything in the real world' hurts exactly no one

In short I'm pro labelling/tagging and not naive enough to think people won't write or read the trash and that people who write it know it's trashy af but sometimes it needs to actually be said

and wow, that was way more words than I set out to write

** I wouldn't mind a fic with werewolf 'packs' and 'alphas', but from an outsider perspective it is clear that the leaders like Greyback know it is b.s. but still use it as a way to effectively groom new werewolves into being loyal followers. Sort of a study on how vulnerable societal outcasts, especially young and newly rejected, can be to cult like organisations.

** People know all of this, it's just imaginary stuff for fun

Edit because I'm still thinking about this: no one is saying “do these things irl”. If someone was like “this is how you should practice bdsm!” then I would agree it is harmful, but with ABO stuff the expectation going in is that it is exaggerated and unrealistic. I've seen plenty of bdsm fics that are meant to be more realistic and handle the subject properly, because people who are trying to depict it realistically usually do some research. ABO is just a fantasy, which people have plenty of outside of fan fiction as well.

*** I disagree. While it isn't illegal or anything, it is still highly irresponsible. By putting out writing for public consumption which condone (even if only by omission of explicit disapproval) harmful behaviour, you contribute to the narrative that they are fine to do. This is especially true in this community as there there is basically no policing of content so it is up to the authors, and I think there is still a sizable part of the HP fanfic community who are young and impressionable, because ultimately canon was written for children. While hopefully they will have other, better influences in their life than fanfic, what they read still may contribute to their growing understanding of sex and relationships. Reading many stories glorifying unhealthy relationships could make them for more vulnerable in real life. Even if you didn't mean it as this, not everyone will understand your subtle subtext. As the damage this can do far outweighs the satisfaction of airing your fetish in public, you shouldn't do it.

If you have a community of fellow enthusiasts who you trust to treat the topic responsibly the by all means share it with them, just keep it unaccessible to the general public.

** The alpha/beta thing /is/ rooted in science, but it's rooted in *bad* science, the sort that only occurs when things are taken totally out of context and analyzed by someone who knows in advance what they want to see. In this case, it was a set of wolves taken out of the wild, placed in what was effectively a cage far too small for them to range properly and then the "scientist" watched their stressed reactions and proclaimed it to be the natural state of all things wolfish.

And, as with many Bad Science proclamations, it caught on with those not knowledgeable enough to understand that it was the psychological equivalent of Snake Oil. Other Bad Science includes using lead bottles for baby milk to help them grow stronger (yes, this was once a thing) and arsenic in makeup (dying to be beautiful was certainly a thing for a while).

Whenever I see someone using the whole Alpha/Beta/Whatever thing in fanfics, it instantly puts me off. Fortunately, there are other writers who haven't been sucked into that particular path of bovine droppings.

***** Good grief, you're acting like it's unusual for scientists to make mistakes - for our knowledge of a subject to evolve as time goes on. It happens, and it's common. Are you going to blame all the paleontologists that claimed that dinosaurs were scaly lizards, when many of them had feathers? We didn't always know that they're the ancestors of birds. How about the dude that first said that bats are blind, because for ages that's what we were taught. (They can see in black and white). There's also camel's humps, which store calories and not water, and... well...

Remember science class, where you learned that an electron was the smallest bit there was? We now know that isn't true. Are you going to get pissed off at the folks that identified and named parts of an atom as protons, neutrons and electrons now that we know that quarks etc are a thing?

Science changes and evolves, and trying to crucify somebody for being wrong about something /FIFTY YEARS AGO/ is a bit of a douche move. I mean, what else was /known/ to be true in 1970 that isn't true now - and do you consider them fuck ups too?

As for the Electron bit you mentioned, that falls under Education aka "Lies to Children". It gives students the level of information that they can fit into their worldview and prepares them for later when they're told "What we told you before wasn't quite accurate, but you're ready now to move on a level and understand more."
