Anyone have a fic where Harry Potter is overpowered and everyone hates him because of It?

Thanks Redditors!

** Well most Harry in Azkaban fics have Ministry throwing him in jail because hes too powerful, although that's more out of fear than hate. Usually hes hated for other reasons if at all.

Hating someone for being ridiculously powerful might be harmful to your health after all.

I read a pretty good fanfic once, where Dumbledore gave Harry a book he wrote that explained how the Ministry basically decieves powerful wizards(like Dumbledore himself) to sign lots of magical contracts that pretty much stop them from doing anything noteworthy. Can't remember the name though.

** In a sense, public perception of Harry during OotP and thereafter is already a bit like that.
