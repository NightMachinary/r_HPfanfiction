**** Ok, I will go by completed fics in 2017 so far, sorted by date:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407), has a great manipulative!Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]], linkffn(6432055), has a great postwar, in character Draco Malfoy.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there), is one of the best non-magic AU stories and a great Harry/Ginny romance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/A-Dramatic-Reading][A Dramatic Reading]], linkffn(12324284), is the best 'read the Books' fic by far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]], linkffn(6919395), has great Ginny characterization and a very credible mentor!Snape.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), is a great war epic and polit thriller.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363), is 'Muggles fighting back' done right. Greengrass sisters are portrayed very sympathetically here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), is still a great HP/SG crossover despite several very edgy moments. Darth Marrs definitely stays true to himself by ruffling quite a few feathers.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?

It's pretty much the standard back in time kind of story. Couple of new characters and some development but nothing that I'd say was mind blowing, which is probably what the previous user's gripe with the story was. Anyways that just my two-cents, I think that the story is fine, had some interesting and engaging characters and dynamics but the plot itself was not something that I'd say a lot of thought was put into.

Basically, it's a "what-if" variant on a scene from OotP where Harry ends up alone on the train with Luna (whom he's never met before) and they have a long conversation with each other about their lives and Harry starts to realize that he's attracted to her. If you're wondering how the "owl" comes into play, it's because Hedwig turns out to be really fond of Luna as well. It's a pretty straightforward and simple concept, but IMHO it works really well.
