Also, in the first chapter, while Harry is born, a mysterious being looks on and implies(to herself/the reader) that Harry is her son somehow.

The Potters have no idea this being is watching them.

I've only read the first chapter, and forgot to fav it.

The being and Harry had brown/hazel eyes.


** sounds like a percy crossover I've read, don't remember exactly which one.

  After being bitten by a werewolf on that fateful Halloween, Harry is abandoned by the Potters. But within Harry flows power and an ancient bloodline, a bloodline that hasn't been seen in two hundred years. For Harry isn't just a werewolf, he is Crimson Blood-ruler of all were-animals. The Crimson Blood has finally awakened and he will destroy anyone who gets in his way.

** I vaguely recall the fic you're talking about.\\
Something by Rorschach's Blot, perhaps?
