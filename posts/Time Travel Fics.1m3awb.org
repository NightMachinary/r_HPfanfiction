I'm sure it's been asked before, but any good time travel fics out there? I especially like anything to do with the Marauders. Any rating is fine. Thanks.


** I don't know what you've read (and this is a well traveled road), so I'll start with the three classics:

Viridian/S'TarKan's [[http://viridian.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past/The_End_of_Days/][Nightmares of Futures Past]] 360k words, WIP (slow updates, about a chapter a year). This story was very popular in its day, establishing many of the tropes of the fandom.

#+begin_quote
  Thirteen years after leaving Hogwarts, Harry Potter finally destroys the last Horcrux and obliterates Voldemort, ending his reign of terror. Too bad everyone Harry cares about is dead now. A chance discovery sends... part of... Harry back into the past. No matter that Voldemort will be alive again - Harry is determined that this time, things will be different!
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose]] and sequels by Ella/Deadwoodpecker. Some brilliant writing, particularly in the second book in the series. 375k words in the first two (complete) books. The third is two chapters in and abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love.
#+end_quote

Sarah1281's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] 167k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
#+end_quote

For Marauders' Era:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4391403/1/Ruin][Ruin]] by Master Slytherin. 42k words, +complete+. Complete, but (as yet unposted) sequel needed for closure.

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. Tricked into falling through the veil, Harry finds himself in an alternate dimension where the first war continues to rage and people he thought he had lost are alive and well. You've read it all before, right? Wrong.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] by Lord Silvere, 390k words, WIP.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black.
#+end_quote

Some others from my C2:

Joe6991's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] (282k words, complete) and sequel (60k words, WIP).

#+begin_quote
  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8082923/1/Give-It-Your-Best-Shot][Give It Your Best Shot]] by Zenathea, 113k words, WIP.

#+begin_quote
  Some men were born average and went on to live an average life. He was not, had never been, and would never be one of those men. With his ancestry, it was hardly a surprise. Facing off against enemies old and new, very few things could come more naturally to him. No Slash. AU. Dimension Travel with a dash of Time Travel. Darker themes: war, politics, questionable morality, and etc.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6671596/1/A-Necessary-Gift-A-Harry-Potter-Story][A Necessary Gift]] by cosette-aimee, 155k words, WIP.

#+begin_quote
  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6248964/1/Dobby-s-Return][Dobby's Return]] by Hahukum Konn, 47k words, WIP.

#+begin_quote
  Dobby the house-elf has been granted his chance to help Harry Potter after dying at the hands of Bellatrix Lestrange, by going back to the summer of 1992.
#+end_quote

Lens of Sanity's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/1/The-Dark-Lord-s-Equal][The Dark Lord's Equal]], a bit crackish, 60k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4915978/1/Skipping-Stones][Skipping Stones]] by MujakiX, 20k words, abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  The Deathly Hallows are only the beginning... Harry Potter is 14 again in a world both alike and very different than his own. Hogwarts stands proud and whole, and Harry gets the shock of his young life at the Sorting Feast. Pairings TBD...
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6631603/1/Sanctuary][Sanctuary]] by Digifruit, 22k words, complete. (Note: the author also wrote one of the best Naruto time travel pieces extant.)

#+begin_quote
  After Harry nicks a Time-Turner in order to save Sirius, reality starts shifting around him. One day, he's not the Boy Who Lived, and the next, magic doesn't even exist. So Harry, being the only one aware of it, sets out to find out what went wrong
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die][Griffindors Never Die]] by ChipmonkOnSpeed, 80k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Cannon to Epilogue, then not so much...
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3248583/1/Ground-Hog-Day][Groundhog Day]] by Rorschach's Blot, 8k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Harry lives the same day over and over again.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3022004/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freak-Parade][Harry Potter and the Freak Parade]] by The-Caitiff, crackfic, 23k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.
#+end_quote

I've done this time travel thing several times myself. Here are a couple tales:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6581693/1/Yule-Time][Yule Time]] by Perspicacity; 7k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Augustus Rookwood, former Unspeakable, escapes capture at the Battle of Hogwarts. He develops a new form of time travel, which falls into the wrong hands and seals the fate of trillions of souls. Then, something remarkable happens.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother In Law's Love]] by Perspicacity. 44k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Distraught over Ginny's death in the final battle, Harry gambles desperately and travels back in time to set things right. Unfortunately,not everything goes as planned. A twist on the classic Soul Bond tale.

*** Okay, so I just read "Ruin" and it is not actually complete. The author indicates it will have a sequel, maybe a long time from now, but this first part does not actually have a proper ending or closure -just so everyone knows (and as you've guessed I'm not a fan of WIPs myself, but if you don't mind, go ahead, it's well written)

****** Hmmm. Well. I mostly know about slash, so that's what my recommendations are going to be.

There's the classic [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/][Shoebox Project]] which sadly seems as if it will never be finished -- but there was a time when I waited for this one to be updated every Tuesday, constantly refreshing the page :)

[[http://rosemaryandrue.livejournal.com/31882.html#cutid1][Pilgrimage]], a great fic about Remus

I love all of [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/rageprufrock/pseuds/rageprufrock/works?fandom_id=136512][this author's work]] and also [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/veeagainst/works][this one]] who used to post under a different username on lj.

I've just spent a good hour trying to find a fic where Remus took over the Order of the Phoenix after Dumbledore's death that I believe was by an lj user named irisbleu but I cannot for the life of me find it. If I do I'll add it here, because it was one of my absolute favourites.

Any recommendations for me?
