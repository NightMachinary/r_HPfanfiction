Are there any 4th, 5th or 6th year H/G stories where Ginny has some teenage rebellion (her being overall assertive, underage drinking, piercings, overall disregard for rules, conflicts with her parents and similar stuff actual teenagers do) going on and can actually be considered a bad influence on Harry? I find her usual Hogwarts-time characterisation rather boring (first blushing fangirl, then angst-filled pining while Ginny is not sure what to do with her practice boyfriend) and am looking for something different. Stories where she curses and considers (some) of the Hogwarts rules optional or actually curses people with something besides the bloody Bat-Boogey hex.

There were a few post-Hogwarts stories where she was an interesting character, but most of the "pre-war" ones are not my cup of tea. There she simply comes across as the "ideal girl" of your average romance movie, which is not an entertaining read for me.

Please no "Happy Weasley family", background Ron/Hermione or background Hermione/anyone from Slytherin.


** I think you will like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382): Ginny openly rebelled against her control freak mother, but the story plays out most in the first 4 years.

--------------

Brennus is a dedicated H/G shipper who likes to bash other Weasleys, such as:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): I've recommended this one quite often, almost everyone, including Arthur, Tonks, and Sprouts(!) got mercilessly bashed. Weasleys and Hermione really stink in this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11367427/1/In-the-Heat-of-the-Night][In the Heat of the Night]], linkffn(11367427): Forced marriage trope, but still an entertaining one shot in which the Weasleys are depicted as hopeless Dumbledore minions.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9065880/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Butterfly-Effect][Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect]], linkffn(9065880): Again, more Weasley bashing, but they came around and redeemed themselves later.

--------------

Finally, the fic that suits your criteria the most is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345), in which the Weasleys tried very hard to keep Harry and Ginny apart, but still failed.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

  Minor events can have repercussions far beyond their size and importance. When one of these minor events occurs to a ten year-old Harry Potter he finds his world turned upside-down and it starts him down a very different path than the one he expected to follow.

*** Thanks, I've read Hail Odysseus and didn't find it very good, but I'll give the others a shot.
