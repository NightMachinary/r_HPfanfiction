I have a sudden desire to read fanfiction involving House Hufflepuff. I'll take anything, from OCs living life in Hufflepuff, to Hufflepuff Harry, to stories about Cedric Diggory/Susan Bones/any other Hufflepuffs.

Here's a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][link]] to BajaB's glorious Harry the Hufflepuff fanfic to begin.


** Finding himself by minisinoo. (On Fnet; not around a computer so I can't link). It's a Cedric/Hermione AU of OOTP that focuses quite a bit on Cedric and Hufflepuff House. It's also really good! :)

*** There's an unfinished sequel to it too! Can't think of the name but she mentions it in the notes of Finding Himself.

** /Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness/ (year 7 canon-complementing Neville POV) featured plenty of Earnie, Susan, and Hannah, as secondary protagonists next to Neville.

#+begin_quote
  The cards have been redealt but the game is the same, and the only thing on the line is the future of the world. A Shade stalks the corridors of learning, shadows gather on the horizon. A prelude to approaching war. Hufflepuff Harry, Year 1, post-Downfall

  Harry gets sorted into something other than Gryffindor. This could take place during his original sorting, or he could be placed into a different house in later years.

*** Is "The Alchemists' Quest" complete - is V-mort defeated? It says "Year 1", but I don't see any sequels for it.

**** Can't remember reading it, but it seems to be an abandoned rewrite of /all/ the books, with just minor differences. Which is supremely annoying, really. Major changes in premises, but all the little details happen just as in canon.

- Hedwig again.
- Harry's in Hufflepuff, but ends up as first-year seeker anyway.

Last line of last chapter hints at non-existing sequels.

  "Good luck, Harry," she said, lifting her trunk as Kami lept lightly to her shoulder. "Take care. And I'll see you in the fall, even if I'm unable to write."

** Hey, check out this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5846518/1/insurgere][Insurgere]] by Silver Pard. It features Hufflepuff-sorted Tom Riddle! I actually posted a link to this story months ago because it was so rad.
