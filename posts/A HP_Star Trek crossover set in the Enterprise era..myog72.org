Harry Potter/Star Trek crossovers in general are critically underrated and poorly represented in both fandoms, but as it is, I've never seen a crossover set in the Enterprise era (2150s through to the early 2200s, or thereabouts). I believe that such a crossover could be fun for a number of reasons;

1. The mid-22nd century isn't as far removed as, say, the 24th century. Harry would be a man out of time, yes, but social standards and cultural mores wouldn't be as hard for him to acclimate to; accepting that Earth has united wouldn't be as difficult as accepting fully sentient holograms, I feel.

2. Technology and science, with the exception of warp technology, hasn't advanced nearly as far as it would have by the 24th century. Again, there'll be a learning curve for Harry, but it wouldn't be nearly as difficult. Also, this segues nicely to my next point...

3. Magic can still do things that Earth technology can't, and can do it better than some other species which can. Take shields, for example. Archer's NX-01 Enterprise is often caught off guard by other species with shields. Basic forcefields that later Starfleet ships take for granted are extremely experimental, temperamental, and relatively weak, especially when compared to what even a moderately accomplished 4th year Hogwarts student can do with Protego. Also, plasma weapons and phase pistols are a step up from most things, but a phase pistol doesn't stack up to a Bombarda Maxima.

4. The Enterprise era is one of excitement and extreme danger, usually both. Going into deep space for a survey isn't a routine, boring mission when the next fastest vessel is months or YEARS away at maximum warp, and even less well armed, in the event of an emergency.

These are the main reasons I would love to read an HP/Enterprise-era crossover. I'm sure a sufficiently clever author could find even more interesting ideas and things to explore than I've listed here (and indeed, there are several more that come to mind, but which are too provincial to waste time listing).
