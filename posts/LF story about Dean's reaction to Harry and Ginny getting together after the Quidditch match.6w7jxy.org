I've never really come across a story where Dean reacts to "the kiss" in the common room. In canon, he is clearly taken aback by it as he shatters the glass in his hand. But it's got to be an awkward situation as he shares a dorm with Harry (and Ron).

Anyway, it would make an interesting story or one-shot, if anyone can find it.


** He would react perfectly bc DEAMUS

** I always felt bad about this! Such a shitty thing to do to a roommate imo.

*** I agree its a shitty situation for Dean to be in but I dont really think its a shitty thing for Harry to do. What is he supposed to do not be with the girl he has feelings for because she broke up with Dean before? Its not like they were close or even friends really, more just like classmates that happened go sleep in the same room than the traditonal idea of "roommates."

I know the situation is different since Ron and Ginny are siblings, but if Harry had just gotten together with some girl that had broken up with Ron, id think differently. That would be a shitty thing to do to your best friend.

If the post was relating to Harry and Ginny's kiss specifically in the common room and not their relationship then I guess I can somewhat agree with what you are saying but even then I don't condem Harry that much. It was a spur of the moment. He didnt mean to rub it in Dean's face. If Harry tried to do that going forward than I'd agree he was being an ass.
