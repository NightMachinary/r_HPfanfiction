I use 4 text files and separate it by: Complete, Incomplete, Complete Shorts, and Ongoing.

I also have a brief description because I've read so many that they start to blend together. (Wtf is canon anymore)

â€‹

Do you guys have any cool way of recording the fics? (Besides following/favoriting them on FFN/AO3)

This is the kind of shit that keeps me up at night, I'm weird lol.

**** I don't have any folders that are too general, such as 'Romance', but there are cases where more than one trope would apply, such as 'Young Tom Riddle' and 'Time Travel'. In cases like that, I broke it up so any time travel to Tom Riddle's younger days goes in "Young Tom Riddle" and all other time travel fics are just in a folder named "Misc. Time Travel". I have subfolders as well, such as "Harry relives his childhood" and "Harry the Determinator" in the "Misc. Time Travel" folder.

Of course this is just the system that works for me. Your folders (if you use this method) should depend on the distinguishing common plot elements in fics you like.

- Name
- Category (my own definition)
- Short Description
- Word Count
- Status (complete/dead/ongoing)
- House (Which house Harry is sorted into)
- Rating (favorites on FF.net & rating-rating)
- Short review / comment

Unfortunately, it was easier to comment on negative stuff in a very very short review. So, I feel like I can't use the list for recommendations because the comments are often unfair and rude to the authors.
