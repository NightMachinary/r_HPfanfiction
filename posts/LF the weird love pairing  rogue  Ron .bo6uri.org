Ron learns how to fight in real war with Harry from Moody and Dumbledore and sneaks out of the castle to date the leader of the guerilla resistance that frequently blows up death eater's homes with homemade napalm and semtex plastic explosives (courtesy of the IRA).

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
