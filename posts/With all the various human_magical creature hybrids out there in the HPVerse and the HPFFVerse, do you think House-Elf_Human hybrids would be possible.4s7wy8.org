I don't plan to write one--or at least not a relationship causing one but a hybrid could be an interesting character, just musing on it.


** Obviously. Didn't you know that Dobby is actually Draco's father?

I am an AVPS fan, yes. Why do you ask?

** I'd think so. If half-giants and wizard's with Goblin blood (Filius Flitwick) can be a thing, why would procreating with house-elves be impossible?

** Well, Hagrid got a fire farting tortoise to breed with a human-headed lion-scorpion to create headless scorpion-crabs with explosive asses.

House-Elf/Human hybrids would probably be far easier to breed.

** Wizard/House-elf relations have been an unspoken part of wizarding culture for as long as the house-elves have been around. However, the result of such unions is a Jarvey- a foul-mouthed ferret-like creature that eats garden gnomes.

I assume he included centaurs, as well.
