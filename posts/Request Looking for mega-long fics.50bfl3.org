So I'm going to be embarking on an 18-hour long car ride tomorrow and I am desperately looking for some super long fics to delve into while I am passenger riding. I'm open to really any genre and most pairings. Please no bashing or MPreg or overpowered!Harry. Thanks in advance!

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

*** Great fic if you are looking for LONG. But even with 18 hours, you will probably not finish this monster. So if you're looking for something you can finish on the trip, you should probably look a little shorter.
