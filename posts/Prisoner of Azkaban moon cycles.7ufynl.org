I've been thinking a while about doing a fanfiction related to Prisoner of Azkaban, so I started doing some research. One thing that I wanted to look into was the moon cycles for Professor Lupin and I found something odd. According to the [[https://legacy.hp-lexicon.org/timelines/calendars/calendar_pa.html][Harry Potter Lexicon]], there was a full moon on November 5th of 1993. But according to [[http://www.moongiant.com/calendar/November/1993/][MoonGiant.com]] the November full moon wasn't until the 29th. Furthermore, the first full moon of the term would have been on September 1st - the train ride to Hogwarts!

All of this put together seems to indicate that Rowling totally ignored the real world lunar calendar when constructing events for PoA.

So the question is what to do you guys make of it?


** I feel like I should note that the world of Harry Potter isn't Our World plus Magic. It is a similar world that, as part of it's own nature, both magical and mundane aspects.

Muggles don't see the Knight Bus, and not because of any spells or enchantments on it but rather because they don't see it properly (disregard due to the obviousness of its impossibilities). The Playstation came out earlier. While the Prime Minister during the books may have been John Major, the previous PM was not Margaret Thatcher as Fudge explicitly said it was a male who tried to defenestrate him. Futhermore, this Prime Minister would have entered office after Halloween 1981 because Fudge was still a member of the Department of Magical Accidents and Catatrophes at the time. Additionally, Fudge had briefed two Prime Ministers on the existence of magic. In OotP we learn that Fudge became Minister in 1990. In the first chapter of HBP, we learn that Fudge spoke to the current Minister and the previous one. This means that the previous PM entered office after Fudge took office, so 1990 at the earliest. But we know that the current PM took office some time before Sirius escaped Azkaban (I'm assuming ~1 year beforehand). Which would mean someone was PM for only 1-3 years (part of 1990, 1991, part of 1992 at most). And in the real world, Margaret Thatcher was PM from 1979 to 1990. Which, supposing Thatcher was PM for the same stretch in the HP world, there is a brief window of time where there would be another PM between Thatcher and Major.

From this evidence it is clear that HP isn't taking place in our world but with magic, but in a similar world that has magic. So it shouldn't be too hard to imagine that a chunk of rock is in a different place in space.

This is a longer and less well constructed comment than I would prefer to make, but oh well.

** JK is bad at mundane research, and writes for the plot more than anything else.

In my own fic, I shifted the first full moon to August 31, but that is my only change there.

** According to [[http://www.fullmoon.info/en/fullmoon-calendar/1993.html][this site]], it was:

  Wednesday, 1 September 1993, 04:32:54 am
#+end_quote

That's six and a half hours /before/ the train departed. No wonder the bloke was knackered.

In my opinion, it doesn't hurt to change the story accordingly. For instance, if you don't want your Weasleys and Hermione to have their third, fourth and sixth year exams on a Saturday (24 June 1995), you might have them accompany Mrs Weasley, Harry and Bill on that walk.

** It's essentially a mistake because Rowling can't do math (much like, /somehow/, the first day of term is always simultaneously a Mondy and September 1st, in seven consecutive years). linkffn(The Arithmancer) had an interesting idea about it, though --- that Hogwarts is infused with some relativity-style time magic that makes the length of days (and possibly other things like moon cycle) seem different and nonsensical from the inside of the Hogwarts Grounds, so that no one can just use the Sun's position to triangulate Hogwarts's location and things like that.

*** Or they only have 364 days in their year.

Every 1st September is a Monday. Every Halloween is a Friday. Every Christmas is a Thursday. And, if the lost day was March or May 31st (since the other 31sts have come up in the story), every Valentine's Day is a Saturday.

**** That's it! May the 31st was cursed out of existence within the realm of Hogwarts by a previous student who was given a time-turner to take their electives, and was not as dutifully obedient of the rules than Hermione...

**** An excellent theory, but I think /Chamber of Secrets/ has Valentine's Day on a school day, seeing as it's mentioned those little Valentine's Day dwarves kept interrupting classes, if memory serves.
