** Oh wow. That Logan idea is pretty interesting. A world where perhaps Voldemort caused a lot more damage to, affecting not just magical Britain but all of the magical world. And somehow because of some reason the birth rate of magical has been decreased to almost nothing.

Harry who after finally defeating Voldemort and who's life is prolonged because of the deathly hallows lives to the time when most of the magical population has died off, until he finds a child showing signs of accidental magic.

  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.

  Harry Potter finds himself, and his normal bi-polar luck, pulled out of a quiet retirement and into the limelight of the 23rd century. He finds a grand new stage upon which his 'saving-people-thing' can act, and before he can say no, is pulled into the middle of a galaxy-spanning conflict. Rated 'M' for bad words and ideas, re-worked and re-posted. Enjoy.

** Ehhhhhhhh I can only think of one.

*Greater Than, Lesser Beb -* linkffn(6389009)\\
Warning: Weasleys and Dumbledore are of the manipulative persuasion.

ANYWHO~ Post-war Harry discovers the manipulations and Ginny tosses some time spell at him. Some interactions occur and Harry ends up in the past in his current body. He's not an old man, but his world was crushed with how everything turned out and recent revelations.

He treats it as the last ride, where he tries to fix EVERYTHING on his own. Society's problems, death eater problems, Voldemort problems, etc.

He treats it as a crusade and throws himself into it. The final battle was pretty neat too.

And this isn't one of those "harry goes into the past and rasies himself". Yeah, he removes Harry from the Dursleys, but he stays his distance.

  Harry and his friends ingested love potions; great - he could deal with that. But knowing that he found this out before and the people he trusted sent him back in time without his memory, to relive his past, again and again? Not this time if he had anything to say!
