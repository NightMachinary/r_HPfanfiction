I recently read "Strangers at Drakeshaugh" by Northumbrian and a large part of the plot revolves around a family of muggles that lives near the Potters; of course, they can't help but notice some strange, almost magical, things going on.

Are there any more fics like that, where some muggles close to the trio or to some other major characters start getting suspicous and eventually unravel the secret of magic's existence? So, I guess a mystery-oriented fic from mostly or partially a muggles' perspective.


** linkffn(8096183) has a plot line with a female police officer finding out about magic

*** This has been one of the most enjoyable 'Muggles discover Magical' that I've read. No people would not just be ok with this, but anything kept a secret so long would not be easily undone. I really hope the officer's plotline gets finished :)
