Were Harry and Ron the only people to receive EE in potions in their year?

Remember them not knowing that the requirement for NEWT level potions class was reduced from O to EE. Mcgonagall told them after the school had already started so they did not have their books or anything and were told to take the old books. Why were they not told before coming to school so that they could purchase books and other supplies?

The class also had quite a few people when they reached. Did every single one of them receive O in potions as no one else had to take old books from Slughorn?

Did everyone else in their entire year really receive either O or A and lower?

Or was this another half baked plan of Rowling to hand the prince's book to Harry so that plot could progress.


** Another question, why didn't Dumbledore tell Harry that he could take potions? Dumbledore needed Harry to be closer to Slughorn, so it doesn't make any sense that he wouldn't tell him when they went looking for Slughorn

*** Dumbledore was so used to keep Harry in the dark about important things, he just started doing it for stupid things.

**** Or he may have thought it was obvious, given that Slughorn was the former Potions Master.

***** Or Dumbledore didn't know (yes, shocking, isn't it, that he may not know something) that Harry knew about Snape's requirements. So there was no obvious need to correct that misconception.

** I think that a lot of people had jobs in mind that didnt require such high grades in potions. Like a job surrounding Transfiguration might have only needed EE or lower in potions so they continued to the next class.

** NEWT scheduling doesn't seem to make much sense in that regard. McGonagall had a short meeting with everyone before okaying their schedule. Seems pretty after last minute if you want your students to be prepared.

Remember Neville was planning on taking advanced transfiguration like his dad, but barred because MacGonagall didn't think he could handle it. She did however talk him into advanced charms. So does Neville now have a transfiguration book he doesn't need, and needs a charms book he wasn't planning on?

I get that OWLs aren't graded in house and results would be sent out later, but at least some of those conversations could have been held at the end of the previous year. I imagine the heads of house have a pretty good idea what to expect.

On a related subject, some form of career counseling should really be done in 2nd year when selecting electives, not halfway through 5th.

** They might have been the only ones to not have been updated on the requirements - or, baring that, had the desire to keep going despite having the chance. After 5 years of Snape teaching it, Potions can't have seemed very appealing for most people.

I know that classes that were taught by a poor teacher had a tendency to spoil them moving onwards for me, at least in terms of my interest in them.

That never affected my interest in a subject. I liked a subject for its own merits or not, regardless of who was teaching it. If I didn't like the teacher, or thought the class was moving too slowly for my taste in a subject I liked, I studied further on my own.

While Harry and Ron are morons, I can't see why some ambitious Slytherins or Ravenclaws wouldn't want to take the class if "E" was suddenly accepted. And especially if they knew the teacher was no longer Snape, then I would expect some Ravenclaws/Hufflepuffs/etc might want to jump on board.

It's interesting that Slytherins can't take the class either if they didn't get an "O" in Potions. As much as we want to whine about Snape's strict requirements, they applied to the Slytherins as well. No "dunderheads" in the upper levels for Snape.

** I'm not sure when exactly that requirement from Snape was mentioned in the books, but I don't think it was any kind of official announcement. Most likely Harry was the only one being told and he told his two best friends. Hermione had an O, so she got the book. The other two didn't.

Everyone else never knew about Snape's requirement. They had good grades in Potions and therefore expected to be able to continue that class. If they didn't want to continue Potions into NEWT level, they would have owled Hogwarts. Everyone who got good grades and didn't tell Hogwarts otherwise would have expected to continue Potions and been able to be prepared.

Everyone who only had an A or less would have been informed in their Hogwarts letter - the letter that always included an official book list.

If Harry and Ron had taken their book lists seriously, instead of presuming, they probably would have found a Potions book listed there, indicating that they would be continueing that class.

That theory does, however, not explain that McGonagall was the one to ask Harry about not choosing to continue Potions. That implies that at some point they had to inform Hogwarts which classes they would be taking. But since it was never mentioned when exactly they would have done that, I could only make some wildly uninformed guesses here.

Most likely, the Hogwarts letter contained the official book list for all classes they could take with the OWL scores they had achieved and also a form to fill out and send back to inform Hogwarts which classes you wanted to take. Harry and his friends were the only ones who had heard of Snape's requirement and therefore Harry and Ron were the only ones not being prepared, giving precedence to their "insider knowledge" over the fact that the book was on the official and probably personalized list.

*** Mcgonagall was the one that told him and probably every single one of them that was aiming for a career that involved getting a potions NEWT.
