** Hm, I can't think of any with that particular element, but there are plenty of (edgy) writers trying to write asshole protagonists, because the idea sounds so very badass, but it never works. Even "evil" protagonists rarely work, unless its a redemption story or a straight up tragedy (fall to darkness and comeuppance).

I mean, where do you see that plot-point going? Will Harry eventually realize that it is kinda a dick move to hate his parents for being murdered by a terrorist? Or do you just want Harry to be angry? There are plenty of independent!Harry stories that achieve that well enough without going to such lengths...

*** I was hoping for some dark!harry stories like that, that could go in any direction. For example that his hatred for his parents would turn into hatred of Dumbledore for leaving him at the Dursleys but I don't actually know. It could be whatever the author would make it. I just thought that it would be interesting character development for Harry and I wanted to see where other people thought this might take him.
