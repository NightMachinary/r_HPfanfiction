The recent post about megamatt09 had me thinking, what imprpves you fan fiction writing ability? What does the graph of progression/x look like? I feel that everyone improves drastically with beginner's gains, but what else is there? Reading good fan fiction, say Meaning of One, or certain A Second Chance chapters would help, but what about getting good critical reviews from readers? On that note, I feel someone who shares fan fiction they write with their friends, and have close personal friends they discuss writing with would do better than someone who never gets feedback from people they care about. In addition, other factors could help, like good scenery, so they have places to mold into settings in their story. Does anyone think there are other factors? If so, what?


** Ultimately? I'd say caring.

I mean, sure, reading stuff broadens your horizons and can teach you what is possible in the medium, and writing loads lets you at least experiment, even if it's not the golden bullet some people make it out to be. Receiving and being open to criticism helps too, obviously, but even that doesn't magic the suck away. It points out the dirty patches on the floor of your writing (and, usually, a few misidentified patterns on the carpet), but you still have to care enough to go in and clean the issues up.

Criticism is usually the practice of identifying what doesn't work, and rarely makes forays into suggesting improvements. Sometimes it's implicit and fairly obvious (grammatical mistakes) but other times it's not at all clear how to actually fix the issue that's being raised (the characters feel wooden, the dialogue feels samey, etc).

So how do you go from here to there? Care. It's about wanting to be better. It's about being able to take a step back from your work and consider it critically. It's about being willing to screw up a few times in order to find the right path forward for you. Experiment, try new things, set yourself goals that are more than just 'words written per day', 'favourites per view', or 'number of people recommending my story'. Write a story with the express purpose of improving that which you feel is your weakest facet, whether it be dialogue, constrained point of view, economy of prose, or whatever.

The only way to do that, really, is to care about it. If you write purely for self-indulgent enjoyment, then you're probably not going to explore the areas of your writing that are hard, and the surest way to stifle growth is to stay solidly within the bounds of what is comfortable. I'm not saying it's not possible to both grow as a writer and enjoy yourself, not at all, enjoying writing is a vitally important prerequisite to caring about it, but you need to care about more than just your enjoyment in the moment.

Care, and never accept your limits. Once you have that, I think the rest just sort of comes.

** Read proper books that have been edited by a professional editor. I see so many fics that could really do with an editing process, having lots of unnecessary facts in them. Only stay to the facts that are relevant.

If you're describing a character's appearance, describe their interesting features that make them distinct. I don't care what boring hair and eye colour the character has.

Also, look up 'show vs tell'.

** -Read. A lot. And all sorts of things.

-Write. Continuously. Even if you know you're writing crap. Still write.

-Be open to criticism. But have confidence in yourself.

*** Addition to the first point: look at what the writing is doing, how it transitions into another scene or moment and try to understand/predict where it's going

Addition to second point: try to improve that writing

** Lots of writing and reading. And when you read, don't just focus on what's happening. Think about how what you read introduces characters, describes scenery, etc. Think about what the text you're reading does well and what you like about it and why. You can also read texts about writing. Eg [[https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/most-common-writing-mistakes/]]

You also have to be open to criticism. If you have a beta or get feedback from your readers, don't get offended but reflect on it.

** Personally I feel that my writing improves not only from writing, but trying to write better. To improve you need to desire to improve. If you don't desire to improve then you are not. Now I am just speaking from experience and I am in no way an expert.

Something else I find that helps me improve my own writing is reading a large variety of well-written stories. The variety is important because you can see the different ways people can portray the same object. One shouldn't simply just read the chapter quickly for enjoyment but also take the time to think why does this story sticks with me and what elements of this story make it, it.

Most of my best critic was from reviewers and I thank them the most for their words that made me desire to improve myself. I rarely shared any of this with friends and they barely gave any constructive criticism. But I know the few friends that gave me feedback certainly helped me improve.

I think the scenery is very important, after all, how are you going to share what you're imagining with someone else if you can't picture it yourself? But I also believe it shouldn't be an exposition dump, it should be gradual paced throughout the story but still vivid enough for readers to imagine going throughout. I myself struggle with such balance.

Well here are my thoughts on improving as a writer. As rambling as it is.

** Reading and practice! And being able to draw out a good plan.

Personally I use lots of tables and flow diagrams to be able to 1) map out all the actions that will be taking place 2) isolate points where particular foreshadows, twists or key character moments can be dropped in and 3) make sure everything tallies up and I know where various characters are at that point if they are doing things 'offscreen'
