Been looking for a Harry Potter/Doctor Who crossover story for quite some time since my old hard drive died and took a big chunk of my archive with it. It had Harry being best friends with the daughter of the Master. Her mother was a Black so the daughter ended up being raised by Andromeda even though she kept the name Saxon. She ended up dying and regenerating as a magical Time Lord. Harry freaked out when he thought she was dead and his magic started attacking him, forcing him to the care ward of St. Mungo's. Any help finding it is appreciated.
