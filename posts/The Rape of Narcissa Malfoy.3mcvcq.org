*** Her affinity to the Dark side. Doesn't that and loose morals go hand in hand?

**** Ahh. Her "affinity". Where is it stated she has an affinity?

***** Though she is not a Death Eater herself, her husband Lucius is, and so is Draco. By supporting them, she too is in league.

****** In league, you say? Then I suppose Remus has always been an arrogant bully who tries to kill people. You can't help who you love.

I'd say she is more gray. But still, nobody deserves to be raped. Not even someone who is "dark". What has she ever done to the world? She supported the pureblood agenda, and supported her husband, but by how much? How much was she truly a pureblood supremacist, and not a loving mother and wife? Did Dumbledore ever truly stoploving Grindelwald? Is Dumbledore dark? You can't say somebody deserves to be raped because of her husband. If a woman you knew in real life was raped because her husband was against... Gay marriage, would you say she deserved it?

******* Chill! First of all, this ain't real life, just fiction. Secondly, this is just some fun Erotica read, and she is not even raped in the story (read it), perhaps the title is a bit misleading.

******** So, because she changes her mind halfway in, it's okay? Sounds a little too like Stockholm syndrome for me.

********* Well, by definition, rape involves a lack of consent, but here she did give her consent.

*** Fics like this are why I have told nobody I read fanfiction like a 40 year old housewife reads 50 shades of grey.

Edit: I realised some people might misunderstand me. So I should say I read a lot.

** I didn't read. What do loose morals have to do with getting raped?

Why should I read this?

*** No, you misunderstand. Because at the literal last second she consents, so that makes this completely okay. Never mind the fact that Snivellus would have done it with or without her sudden change of mind.
