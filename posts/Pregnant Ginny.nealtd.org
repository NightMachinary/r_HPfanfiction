It was on either ao3 or ffn. Ginny was pregnant, definitely Harry's child but she was sorta insecure because Harry wasn't happy when she told him the news. He was all quiet and he wouldn't touch her after that so she felt alone. I remember this scene where she goes to this pub alone and the bar tender is sympathetic because he believes that she's a single mom. In the end, Harry does admit that he got scared but he wouldn't reject her and the reason why he didn't touch her was because he didn't wanna add more trouble to her pregnancy.

EDIT : FOUND
