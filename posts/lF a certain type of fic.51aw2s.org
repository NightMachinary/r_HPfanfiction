*** The sidebar's explanation of how to format spoilers is confusing/misleading. Here's the correct method:

#+begin_example
  [visibletext](/s "hiddentext")
#+end_example

So

#+begin_example
  [spoiler](/s "Harry mergesâ€¦")
#+end_example

becomes

[[/s][spoiler]]

**** But my spoiler is properly formatted?

EDIT: Also, the sidebar's description isn't confusing or misleading at all. It is set up the way it is so the stuff is just under a classified bar, not buried in a text link. It's for ease of reading.

  When Voldemort gave Harry that scar he gave him two other things; a part of his soul and a friend. The last remnant of Tom Riddle's humanity mentors Harry. (1st year complete, now on hiatus until inspiration for second year strikes)
