** 1.Because People dislike Ron/Hermione

2.Because there was good chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson

3.Because of some of the scenes added in the movies

4.Because Harry and Hermione are the main two protagonists

5.Because People like the idea and humans are not rational creatures

6.Because it seemed like Rowling was hinting at it,

  "Bye, Harry!" said Hermione, and she did something she had never done before, and kissed him on the cheek.

  “Oh, come on, Harry,” said Hermione, suddenly impatient. “It's not Quidditch that's popular, it's you! You've never been more interesting, and frankly, you've never been more fanciable.”

On the fact that most H/Hr fics are bad, Remember Sturgeon's Law.

Patron (VERY AU) linkffn(11080542)

Background:

A Little Child Shall Lead Them: linkffn(10871795)

Stages of Hope linkffn(6892925)

And an honorable mention to Grains of Sand, which looks like it might involve some H/Hr/Tonks should the author ever get to writing it :( linkffn(12188150)

​

There are a couple other H/Hr's on my watch list (Sympathetic Properites, What We're Fighting For, The Wise One, The Cupboard Series), but it has been so long since I read them I can't recall if the H/Hr part was any good.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

**** My favorite fics with harmony in it are linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar) and it's sequel linkffn(Echoes in the Fog). The former depicts an alternate version of HBP where Harry can't get the bezoar in time to save Ron. The latter is the sequel where LackofBezoar!Harry, Canon!Harry (and their friends!) end up in a dimension where Voldemort rules with Evil!Harry as his second in command.

linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) is pretty fun too. Live. Die. Repeat.

Granted, the ships aren't the focus on any of these fics, but they are there.

I don't believe it's because of Emma Watson (although she probably helped). Looking at most fandoms there's an overall tendency to pair up prominent characters who weren't in a romantic relationship already.

**** Harry/Ginny was woefully underdeveloped, but makes a lot of sense in principle. We know that Harry loves the Weasleys and their attitude to life - loud, funny, heckling but devoted to each other, and stepping up when the chips are down. Ginny is all of that. We don't know quite so much about Ginny's circle of friends, but we know that she has always admired Harry, including after getting to know him. We know they have shared hobbies and interests. We know that they find each other physically attractive. We know that she can get him to open up and talk. We know that they respect each other's skills.

We just didn't get to see very much of them actually interacting. I can suggest a few fics that develop Ginny more as a character.

Unavoidable. It's babby's first pairing, the main character and the main female character who are in constant contact throughout the series. It's bound to bear the brunt of fics, and consequently the brunt of shit fics.

***** Having been a fangirl at any point pretty much requires the author to throw a sane amount of development her way to show that she isn't anymore, and that Harry noticed it. Instead all we had was Ginny straight up admitting to playing with other boys to distract herself from Harry and then throwing herself at him as soon as his dick pointed her way. It's really hard not to see it negatively.

*** Two points here regarding missing Ron more than Hermione.

1: GOF was a much longer period of time allowing Harry to cool down. The broom investigation was comparitively short letting the anger to still be there.

2: Harry thought Ron's jealousy was stupid, allowing him to brush it off easier. Hermione fucked with Quidditch and his broom. You don't fuck with a man's broom.

In POA, Harry did the leaving and felt like Hermione deserved it for getting his dream broom confiscated. They really aren't analogous situations, regardless of how the trio's romantic entanglements eventually shook out.

Thus, people tend to way the Audience Surrogate to get together with the characters they like. Also, being an audience surrogate, you get less pushback when messing with Harry's character (OOC) than you do with others, since he is so much of a blank slate to begin with.

** There are many good fics with Harmony that are not soul bonds. The many deaths of Harry Potter is one of them. In this Harry is a slytherin for good reason. Slytherins have self preservation and Harry is full of it.

Ron may be a little bit of a jerk in this one, but it is understandable. Remember when he said stuff to upset Hermione. That was when he was a prat. Except, since Harry and Ron were not freinds, they didn't get rid of the troll together. Harry did it. That means Ron and Hermione never became freinds, sadly. Ron to be honest is a little immature, but that is because he grew up with Molly. Hermione was always bullied, and Harry was bullied and abused. So they are more mature than usual. *But Ron being a jerk is not the reason of hermione loving harry.*

** Because of the Hollywood stereotype that in every movie there is one main male hero and one female heroine and they end up together. Viewers briskly decided that Harry/Ginny pairing doesn't work according to this stereotype and so they rejected it. Some of us love JKR's books exactly BECAUSE they don't follow this stereotype, but we are (I am afraid) in minority. And yes, Ginny is the worst written character from all main characters in the books (and even worse in films), so that doesn't help Hinny pairing either.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/pseuds/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] (and another Hinny writers) had to basically finish majority of the Ginny characters to make her palatable.
