What is your favorite HP story written before Deathly Hallows was published in 2007?

Mine will be Happy Days in Hell trilogy by Enahma [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1252201/1/Happy-Days-in-Hell]] Coming of the Ropes [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1334485/1/Coming-off-the-Ropes]] Through the Walls [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1485544/1/Through-the-Walls]]

This is the reason I fell into fanfiction world HARD :D It starts with Voldemort capturing Harry Potter and someone is not happy because he need to do something about that...

Notes by crockywock [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1427191/1/Notes]] Brilliant conversation between Minerva and Severus via post-it notes. Cute and funny.


** Harry Potter R-Series by Regulus starting with 'The Philosophers Stone Retransmuted' and 'The Refiners Fire' and 'The Time of Destiny' by Abraxan

** It always trips me up to see how old some fanfiction is, when I first started reading fanfic (I looked up what i wanted on google lmao) I found alot of fics from 2001-2008. One time I found a fic first published on the actual day I was born (not disclosing the day, but just know that I'm 16)

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/887404/1/]] - Pledges by Amireal. This was my first long Snarry and it was just good to read at the time. Fair waring this was from 2002. So, before OotP.

** The Refiners Fire linkffn(2163835) and it's sequel were the first stories I read, and would probably still hold up if they didn't seem so cliche these days.

** Definitely Alaunatar's 'Stronger than Hope'. It's an amazing fic where Harry becomes intent on killing Voldemort after Sirius' death, and develops deadly skills in legilimency in the process. The relationship between Snape and Harry in this fic is a productive antagonism that turns into an unlikely camaraderie as they both try to outwit the other. Really lovely for Smart!Characters and developing legilimancy/occlumancy, both of which I never got to hear enough about in canon:
