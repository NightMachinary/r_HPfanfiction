A lot of you probably realized it already, but when Ollivander found Harry's wand he said that it's brother wand gave Harry his scar. And because Ollivander remembers every wand he ever sold he only knows he sold the brotherwand to a Tom Marvolo Riddle. But that means he has to know that Voldemort is Tom Marvolo Riddle.


** To be fair, a lot of people know the true identity of Voldemort. Dumbledore knows, Slughorn knows, all the "old guard" Death Eater like Abraxas Malfoy, Lestrange Sr or the father of Theodore Nott.

Sadly, this information is pretty much useless. The only potential use of this information could be to "prove" Voldemort's hypocrisy (he declared himself as the Champion of Pure Blood, but he is only a lowly Half Blood), but I doubt it would change anything:

- His follower would ever refuse to admit it (like Bellatrix), or would accept the information but still follow Voldemort because "power is power". I doubt there would be any massive change in his power base.
- For his opponents, knowing his true name or the fact that he is hypocritical would not change anything when trying to survive the war.

Also, Dumbledore (and later Harry) are probably the only 2 people who could call Voldemort "Tom" and live to tell the Tale. For anyone else, it would just be long and painful death.

So Ollivander, and a lot of other people probably know his true identity, to the point of making it an open secret, but this is an information that is totally useless to know (unless you are Dumbledore studying his past to learn the location of his Horcrux), and knowing it probably put your life in danger. This is the reason why even Dumbledore ask people to call him by his chosen name (Voldemort) when they say "You-Know-Who".

*** You're totally right, but it would probably stump recruiting for the Death Eaters if it would be widely known that Voldemort is just an Half Blood.

**** Most of Voldemort followers are either bigots or opportunists.

- The bigots belive in Blood Purity, that a Pure Blood makes a stronger wizard. They will either refuse to aknowledge Voldemort Blood Status (just like they do with Dumbledore) or cook up an explanation about how his noble blood from Slytherin is enough to clear his muggle stain. In both case, talking about his blood status would not change their opinion, and anyone being too vocale about it will probably suffer to the end of his (admitelly short) life).
- The opportunist won't care about his blood status, only about his power. Voldemort is the strongest wizard in Brittain (in their opinion, realistically probably 2nd best) and want to push their agenda. He is litterally their best shot at power so they would follow him as long as he stay strong. Of course, these opportunist would also probably abandon him if he loose his power (like in 1981) but he would be vanquished at that point and his blood status would become irrevelant.

***** TBF it's covered in canon. He literally talks about his "useless Muggle father" at his resurrection party.

None of the wizards give a fuck. He could kill them without saying a word and he hates Muggles more than they do so who are they to argue?

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** I once heard the fictional argument given by Dumbledore that portraying Voldemort as a Half-Blood would stymie the effort for blood equality on the lawful side by increasing prejudice against Half-Bloods and Muggle-Raised.

*** It's how these things go -- after 9/11 hate crime on people of middle eastern descent increased dramatically. The guy running the convenience store didn't have anything to do with 9/11 but he's a convenient soft target for abuse.
