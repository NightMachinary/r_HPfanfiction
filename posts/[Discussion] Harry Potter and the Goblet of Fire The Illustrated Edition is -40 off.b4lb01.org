** Cover looks nice but I don't know- something about it... it's almost too colorful, too complex- I liked the simpler style better.

Edit: The body position of the dragon is weird too, it's like it's trying to decide whether it's a snake or not and can't make up it's mind.

** Is this published yet? I thought I'd heard it wasn't coming out until October or so.

*** Yeah it's not coming out until 8 October. This just seems to be a spam post.
