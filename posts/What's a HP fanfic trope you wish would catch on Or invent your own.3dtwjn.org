  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

** More speculations of wizarding culture. There are some odds and ends I really love;

- in one fic I read, a girl and her father go to a wizarding dinner theater type thing, and see a show where a woman sings a manticore to sleep. Some dangerous entertainment that seems to fit into the culture.

- another, Draco, Crabbe & Goyle go camping out in a "Muggle-hunting" tent and for the evening's entertainment, make crop circles with their brooms. I found this especially clever, because there's been reports of crop circles IRL in Wiltshire, and that's where Malfoy manor is. That fic had a lot of neat little details like that.

- In another, it touched on briefly that Pureblood boys thought Mudblood and Halfblood girls are loose, because they wore more provocative clothing in comparison to Pureblood girls. It was set in the late 70s, though.

Expansions on Pureblood culture, I guess, is what's really neat to me. Most of these fics were Slytherin-centric, too.

*** Yes! I absolutely love world/culture building fics. It's part of why the inheritance trope is a guilty pleasure of mine. While those tend to go more toward government/marriage and such, I've read one where pureblood influence, money, and connections were used by women to help fight from the background in the first war. It was little things like what the wives were expected to be doing or putting their energies toward (which /wasn't/ that).

I've read another (could actually have been the same fic now that I think about it) where a pureblood has no idea how she actually looks while she's walking when wearing Muggle clothes. It wasn't thought about, the idea was grace and poise, walking 'properly' just draws attention to the hips when wearing tight jeans apparently. [Part of me wants to say it was Roundabout Destiny]

One that I know was a different story (I think it featured Draco, I'd have to hunt it down) held the idea that pureblood boys in marriage contracts were sometimes expected to have multiple partners before marriage as 'practice' so to speak so they could properly please their wives. I /think/ their partners would end up being half-bloods since the pureblood girls weren't having any action.

I just love elaborations on both wizarding culture in general but the more isolated 'traditional' culture people assume purebloods have. The entire worldview I guess. It's fascinating because it's fantasy within fantasy.

** Personally I'm all for fics that explore the wizarding world's lore. But I'm not a fan of how some people write about how the British Wizarding World is a decaying pit of human depravity and the pure definition of backwardness... This is usually coupled with how great and progressive the American system of doing things is. I feel that whenever the author's do that there's just a sense of how America is better than Britain coming from the author that is expressed in fiction.

Just as a disclaimer: I don't care if you believe that the US is better than the UK (in HP world or IRL) or not IRL. However I do find it irritating to see people legitimately bashing the hell out of literally everything over here in the UK (fictional and real) whilst continually praising the US' way of doing things and locations (fictional or real). The fics tend to go on to have Harry either moving to the USA or going on and on about how great it is over there. Despite him never having been there previously and whatnot... Yeah. No continuity. I have other things to say about the differences between the US and UK Magical worlds, but now isn't the right forum for it.

Anyway, back on track: I like when people go into HP fics and just expand upon what is canon and effectively make more believable headcanon which attaches onto what was previously established. I also like when people explore things like the pureblood/halfblood/muggleborn/squib relationships and heritages. I find that fascinating and honestly believe it's an area which has loads of potential development.

***** I don't mind alternate magic, as long as it's neat. I was reading a Fate/Stay Night Harry Potter crossover where Matou Shinji goes to Hogwarts. Now, the writing isn't always the best, and in recent chapters it's starting to be kind of annoying how many references/crossovers the author is adding, but I really liked that when he added magic from Japan it was Ofuda, something that has roots in history and lore.

As for hand signs, I would totally be ok with them as long as they were more in style with proper Mudra. Including the bodily movements, and dances that tend to go along with it. Also, Mudra tends to be spiritual, so interaction wtih ghosts, divination, and healing would be cool. Also I imagine it taking a little longer. What I don't want to see are people using hand-signs faster then a person can flick a wand, doing everything better through hand-signs, or god forbid, just straight up using jutsus.

*** I really can't agree more. If magical civilization(s) existed alongside mundane civilizations since the first cultures arose then they have had thousands of years to develop their own society with all the beliefs/morals/traditions that entails. These would likely vary greatly with their mundane counterparts. Particularly given how insular magicals have been shown to be in canon, and the gap between them would almost certainly have widened after they withdrew behind secrecy. Magical and mundane countries would most definitely not line up.

During the 1600s pretty much all of central Europe and northern Italy were part of the Holy Roman Empire (a loose confederation of princedoms, petty kingdoms, free cities, and archbishoprics) under the elected dynasty of the Habsburgs. The Low Countries and southern Italy were controlled by Spain, as was huge swaths of the Americas. Those are just the most blatant examples.

And the magical world being backwards and archaic in laws and equality sort of make sense if you consider their society to be frozen in time in the 1600s. That was *two centuries* before slavery was first outlawed. Think about that. Women didn't have suffrage. Heck, anyone who wasn't a landowner typically couldn't vote! A society stagnated in such times would be a truly ugly thing.

I've written a few ongoing HP fanfics where I try to be fair to the rest of the world but bring realism to the setting. The history of the magical side of humanity would not be something an egalitarian could endure.

You have to take into account the size difference in population, more people leads to more social interactions, which leads to more conflict, which leads to more resolutions, which leads to changes in the base social structure.

That being said, there would be a constant intake of muggleborns into the society which would help speed up the progression some, but the issue there is that muggleborns are viewed as outsiders.

I'd say it really gives context to why Muggleborns are hated in the Wizarding World. The families of said Muggleborns burned a lot of pureblood/halfblood/muggleborns at the stake in the past... The ones who started the hate would have valid reasons to mistrust them and view them as outsiders. But their descendants would misinterpret the reasons why they did such things or mix the messages of the past, with it eventually becoming this notion of pureblood supremacy over anything less than what came before.

Hell that probably is what happened.

**** I'm all for AUs where magical and non-magical territories don't exactly match up (British MoM governs Ireland in canon IIRC), but overall canon seems to paint another picture. A few centuries back, Bulgaria was under Ottoman rule, most of the Indian subcontinent was governed by the Mughal Empire and what is now Burkina Faso was a collection of Mossi city-states. Despite geo-political change not really meaning much to wizards (as far as we know), all of those countries now have their own Ministries of Magic. I'm not too fond of that to be honest, but it's canon.

As for suffrage, Elfrida Clagg was Chieftainess of the Wizards' Council in the seventeenth century, with Artemisia Lufkin following in her footsteps as Minister a century later. Throw in the Chocolate Frog Card of a black Mungo Bonham and I think we can safely assume that the Eurocentric kyriarchy was a mostly Muggle phenomenon.

***** It makes a certain sense if you assume that there is a Ministry for Magic in /every/ muggle government purely to keep their eye on magical interference in muggle affairs. Any time a new government forms, a rep from the ICW who is familiar with the area is sent to infiltrate, investigate and sign off on the government's purity of muggle purpose. There is probably a collected Ministries of Magic office for all of Central Africa, another for Asia Minor, and the Carribbean one is designated only by which of the 15 local government reps is most sober when the 'Ministry' is approached with a concern. The Polynesian Minister is effectively the Minister for Magic in 30 separate but generally cooperative governments spanning the South Pacific. She goes by many names, but everyone knows that her appearing in your office is not a good sign.

This comment leads into the thing that I wish was expanded upon, non roman based societies of magic.

It makes entirely too much sense think that the animagus transformation was derived from the Native American wizarding culture. If there is one thing that the general population thinks about when they hear Native Americans, it's spirit animals and guides.

I can see occlumency and legilimency having been born in India, or from another culture where self discipline came in the form of meditation.

I imagine the prevalence of the Abrahamic religion in the middle east would have prevented any magical society from rising up and differentiating itself there.

Also what kind of magic would china have wielded, especially during the warring states era? The immediate thought is definitely Chinese martial arts, probably not DBZ style energy blasts, but definitely some sort of hit that would disrupt the energy flow enough to cause anything from pain all the way up to death.

Since Voldemort had decided to target the Potters, and the child there doesn't fulfill the prophecy, the entire family would perish, and Voldemort would be fine. But if he chose to then target the Longbottoms just in case, it would turn Nevile into the Boy Who Lived. Possibly.

Or, say Voldemort becomes top dog because neither child vanquished him. By targeting the Potters, he marked Harry as an equal. Mark doesn't have to mean physical mark. So plot!Harry being in the right place at the right time, having been born to two powerful people and powerful in his own right (corporeal patronus at 13?!), saves the world. Or something.

Voldemort is enough of a psycho to decide to kill Neville's family as a precautionary measure. Because by him deciding to target /any/ child, he's giving power to the prophecy, and thus triggering it.

It would be interesting to see what Lily's sacrificial magic may have done while protecting a child that doesn't belong to the prophecy, but I do think the prophecy comes down to Harry or Neville. There'd have to be some fanfic magic worked in where the baby's Muggle parents survived three different attacks (bombings? fires? something?) that were ordered by or done by Voldemort, which would then fulfil that qualifier.

******* I don't think Lily's sacrificial magic depended on the prophecy. It's still a mother dying in place of her child either way. So she sacrifices herself, baby lives, curse rebounds on Voldemort and the world calls this the BWL. A bit like a false prophecy, where everyone believes this is the saviour, while really it's Harry and he's later marked in a different way.

I think it's the blood protection that gets iffy because Harry was protected through his mother's blood, but a wrong!child wouldn't be a blood relative of Lily or Petunia so it might not last.

So maybe the wrong child grew up with the Dursleys because Dumbledore thought the blood protection would keep him safe. It never comes into play the next ten years because the free DEs either don't care for finding their Lord or don't know how to navigate the muggle world. The wrong child shows up at Hogwarts, and the Philosopher's Stone happens and the kid dies at the end because Lily's protection never lasted or was renewed or whatever the reasoning behind the Dursleys were.

If Harry received a letter while living in a Muggle household, with no knowledge of magic, he'd probably be one very confused child. I say confused instead of excited because it's likely he had a normal childhood and doesn't need an escape. Without a proper response, a staff member would probably be sent to the Dursleys for Muggle!Harry, at which point they'll probably realize the problem. Maybe.

There's gotta be some kind of magical blood test to make sure someone is who they think they are, test relations and such. Then they have to find out where the real "Harry Potter" is, if he's even still in the country.

Stick him in arithmancy! It's something we don't see often without it going the super!Harry route (or at least I haven't seen it much). We rarely even see it mentioned in canon. So then you've got muggle science, herbology, and wizard math.

************ Let's look up what Arithmancy does in cannon..... From the Wikia:

Arithmancy is a magical discipline that studies the magical properties of numbers, including predicting the future with numbers and numerology

So, the three would be:

Neville who will be useful for survival, potion ingredient gathering, poisons, and herbal first aid.

Boy who lived (Name: Harry Potter, Real Name: Harold Patter(Kinda going for something close, but honestly we just need something to call him)- Electronics, Muggle Weapons, a vast muggle world to gain skills and resources.

Harry Potter(The real one)- Power of using numbers to gain probability of success of plans? Slight foresight, and the ability help plan the most mathematically significant means of using magic.

I think this would be fun.

Or it could be a time travel/cross over with Indiana Jones. She ends up as his teaching assistant at the university and ends up tagging along on his trips. With Indy interacting with the Nazis so much it dig deeper into the reasons why the Ark was being hunted (Grindewald pushing the search along).

** More stories that aren't set in Hogwarts that aren't automatically some post-war romance where the main characters are just trying to live normal lives.

Why not make a story that hardly ever sets foot in Hogwarts, because you're putting the characters in a more interesting and unique place? It just opens up so many possiblities.

** Maturities. The power of a witch or wizard growing in a big way (doesn't have to be with magical cores) when they reach a certain age. I really like that concept in stories about Fey where it's generally called a majority (with the first majority often being at 16, and the second at a 100), and have only read a few HP stories with a similar aspect.

** Magical portraits always interested me. While I might not want it to be quite so pervasive, I'd like to see more talk about the limitations and status of them, whether they can learn and remember things, whether you can connect one up to a golem body, whether such a golem could perform magic...

I can imagine British magical society determining that such a thing was possible, but the person in such a situation can't perform magic, so it's useless as a means of staying alive. After all, you can hardly be said to be living if you can't get a spark from your wand.

I'd also like to see more surgical removal of Harry's horcrux scar.

*** I would read that. Just for the sneers and smirks of victory he'd give throughout the book as he solved cases as if he was the HP version of inspector Clouseau... It'd be great as a humour fic.

Bonus points if Lockhart makes an appearance, either as a victim, a fanboy or a villain. Snape vs Lockhart with this character setup would be amazing.

**** I think nearly any subject can be great as long as it's well-written. But to me Snape already kind of serves that function in the story anyway. He's always snooping around, whether it's after bad guys like Quirrell or kids in the halls after curfew, and he always seems to know what's going on. I just think it would be fun to see it in a more formal format, probably humorously, with, like, Sherlock Holmes or film noir stylistic devices. Like a grouchy Harry Dresden.

*** Mmm, I remember one (that was likely smutty) where Tonks is telling Harry that metamorphs officially have to put "other" as their gender on ministry forms, which have a specific box for that, because even they they usually have a gender identity they also can change their physical sex so easily (and do often enough as really young children) so as to muddle the issue beyond easy answers. Can't seem to find it, though.

**** I wouldn't say so. "Bashing" is writing characters negatively or in a poor light without reason to. Harry (strongly) disliking / hating Ginny and Molly isn't bashing, if there is an in-story reason for it, and not just the author disliking those characters.

***** I agree. To me bashing is when the author invents slights against a character to turn the reader against them. Like making the H/G from cannon the result of a love potion, or making it so Dumbledore knew Sirius was innocent but sent him to Azkaban anyway.

However making characters in a story dislike each other contrary to cannon isn't bashing.
