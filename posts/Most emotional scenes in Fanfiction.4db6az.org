My first choice would by Cauterize. there are many really great scenes in that beautiful peice, but my favorite has to be where Andromeda takes care of Teddy. It says something like "Andromeda's face shows both despair, love and hope all at once as she takes care of the child."

My second would definitely by in Stages of Hope, where Luna tells her story and ends with "And so they died together, the boy who lived and the monster who wanted to live forever."

Final scene would be in Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, after the Battle of hogwarts. Seriously one of the best scenes I've reaed until now.

What do you guys think? Which are yours?

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** I like the scene where Dumbledore explains about Sally-Anne Perks in “The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks”. I feel it is a great reminder that, regardless of his role as a plot device in the original series, Albus has his own motivations and a lot of them tie to the fate of his sister and that /for her/, he would do many things.

/“And then the most miraculous thing happened”/

They're not as much scenes as single sentences in a quick chain that is the story, but I think there's a lot of it in “the family evans” (also known as “What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy...”), and it is a great story with which to see Petunia as also not a mere plot device but as an actual character.

/“I have one.”/

It's a short story, part of a bigger series, and a crossover that might or might not qualify because of this fact, but I found “The Rain Is Softly Falling” to be quite touching in that regard too, even if just briefly.

/“No one ever said life was fair.”/

I'll finish it with a mention of a story that might not be for everyone because it deals with Severus as Harry's father and because it's quite a realistic take (for the most part) on how it could have gone meaning that not everything is suddenly happy. Still, I find it, titled “Digging for the Bones”, to be quite enjoyable, and it does have its moments.

/“Yes, of course I will. As many as you like.”/

** In my opinion, the most emotional scene in any fic I've read is the climax of linkffn(Seeking Ginny) hands down. It's honestly not even close. The buildup is so drawn out and the catharsis is utterly moving. Plus, to top it off, it features a pre-HBP characterization of Ginny.

** I don't know about /most/ emotional, but I think the first scene of the last chapter of enembee's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][/Conlaodh's Song/]] conveys a degree of emotional complexity you don't see much in fanfiction. [[/spoiler][I'm speaking of course of Harry and Luna's adieu---I think fanfiction has primed us towards the notion of shared trauma and violence as the ties that bind, and this is a beautiful subversion of that trope.
