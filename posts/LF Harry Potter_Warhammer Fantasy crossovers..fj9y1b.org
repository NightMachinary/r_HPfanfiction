I've been thinking about this crossover for a while and I can't get it out of my head. I love the idea of Harry fighting some green skins or going up against the Von Carsteins.


** Now this is something I'd love to read. Hell one day I may even try writing one. Warhammer Fantasy doesn't get enough lovin'.

Just, please, if someone out there wants to write something in this category, make it something more interesting than 'Harry bumps uglies with this person who I think is hot'.

  When Sirius falls through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries Harry attempts to nose-dive after him. A strange encounter for Harry radically changes his world view;why worry about a Dark Lord when there's a good book to explore?
