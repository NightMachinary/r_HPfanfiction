We all know that stories become distorted over time so I'm curious, what do you think the story was based on and what do you think the origin of the deathly hallows is.


** My favorite headcanon about the Deathly Hallows is that they are the only type of magic (so far) that can fully bring a dead person back to life.

1. The Resurrection Stone, to summon the dead spirit.
2. The Invisibility Cloack, to hide it from Death's sight.
3. The Elder Wand, the only wand powerful enough to rebind the spirit into a living being.

It also fit with the runes etched on the wand, /'cheat death once'/. I leave it up in the air if this is done via putting the spirit in a dead body, or somehow conjuring a physical body for it during the ritual. I'd also argue that this can be only done once, as to not turn these artifacts too OP.

This is why the owner of all three is truly The Master of Death.

*** Great concept, in the past I've read a story where the Resurrection stone and the Elder Wand were used in conjunction with Voldemort's Rejuvenation Potion/Ritual to resurrect someone, although that led to the person going insane and killing anything they touched.

But yeah, using the Three Hallows to perform a permanent resurrection is such a cool idea

** I do have a fondness for the idea that it's all completely real, but virtually nobody believes in it. It's an amusing parallel for the whole magic thing, in-world.

Narratively speaking though, I think the general consensus is that it was basically three brothers inventing some doodads and either it was a PR thing (the brothers trying to advertise, or their enemies trying to blackball them as being gifted the things instead of inventing them) or just the usual urban-legend-esque mythologising that happens around impressive, but one-off events.

** I think the tale is true except the three brothers crafted the hallows themselves instead of death giving them as gifts.

** I think the tale was true at some point, but it is far, far older than we are lead to believe, like most folk tales. Think 1st Century AD or older. Here there were three brothers who met with Death and were gifted the Hallows. These three Hallows were exponentially more powerful than the Hallows we see now, but being gifts from Death they returned to Death at the end or each brother's life. This story was passed by oral tradition until in the 13th century, the descendants of the Three Brothers, inspired by the tale of their ancestors, attempted to replicate the Hallows and somewhat succeeded. The Three Brothers Peverell created three extraordinary artefacts but they paled in comparison to the true Hallows, and suffered consequences thereof.

Beedle the Bard, likely writing a few hundred years later, mixed up his source material, as he heard both the original tale and the tale of the Brothers Peverell and codified them into one, when they were separate tales. The first part of the tale up to the meeting with Death is from the older tale but the Deaths of the Three Brothers are from the Peverell Tale.

** I believe that the Three Brothers either created the Hallows themselves, this seems the most likely except for the fact that they have been unable to be successfully recreated.

Or that they received them as gifts, not from Death but from Magic itself, we know that Magic can be used to imbue sentience into an object like the sorting hat, this suggests that there is a certain level of sentience to magic itself, because after all magic can not create perfect recreations of life, and so I believe that they somehow summoned/encountered the 'Spirit of Magic' rather than Death and were gifted with the Hallows for being the only ones to ever encounter magic itself.
