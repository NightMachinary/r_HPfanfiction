In this hypothetical the original will be replaced by this version. So the changes you make aren't going to be an alternative this is just going to be the Harry Potter books everyone knows.

Edit: this is specifically changes to the original 7 books and the story in those pages. Stuff included specifically through pottermore or any other movies or books outside that doesn't count. Movie specific changes of those books also doesn't count. So things like making the 4th movie follow the book plot better doesn't count. You only get to alter the books and hope that people adapt it well .

****** I think Lucius was stated to be 43 in like CoS yet in DH we see him welcoming Snape to Slytherin with a prefects badge on his chest. That would put him between 43-45 in DH.

Bella is said to be born in 1950, which is 10 yrs before Snape, Sirius, etc. are born and 3 yrs before they get to Hogwarts, but in GOF Sirius says Snape was hanging around the Lestranges. "They're a married couple" he says. Now that puts Andromeda, Narcissa, and Tonks' ages in limbo.

In PS, someone says Gryffindor hadn't won since Charlie Weasley left and Slytherin had won what 7 straight? Bill was born in 1970. Percy 1974/75. That puts Charlie around '72 aka 8 years before Harry, which means Charlie should've left Hogwarts the year before Harry got there.

But it also means that if Charlie is three years older than Percy (and Percy's classmate Oliver), Oliver/Charlie were teammates and Gryffindor "not winning since the legendary Charlie Weasley" is a ridiculous statement.

I wish JKR had gone with a seven-year gap between Charlie/Percy. Then the Quidditch math would work, and it would also shed some light on Percy's personality as the oldest of the second group of kids, whose only older siblings were much older.

** *Make Harry better at magic*

Sustain and progress the arc started for Harry in PoA (Patronus lessons) which in canon just kinda petered out. Basically: a more consistently magically powerful Harry.

1. The obvious next step in this arc is the Triwizard, only you have Harry actually do well in the tasks by mastering useful magic rather than flying/eating a plant (third task did that well enough).

2. In OotP, do the DA similarly but stress that Harry is learning new things to keep ahead of the DA rather than just teaching them his old tricks. And then, in HBP, don't undermine the things Harry taught by minimising their importance (e.g. in OotP it was impressive that older years came to Harry for instruction; in HBP the introduction of non-verbal magic implies they were just humouring Harry).

3. In HBP, make Harry take to non-verbal magic naturally rather than mentioning him struggling with it every other chapter. It's based on strength of mind, something Harry demonstrated in resisting the Imperius. Similarly, show Harry in HBP being more proactive in preparing for the war: depict him learning the spells we see him use in DH (which we never saw him learn), and have him keep the DA going.

4. In DH, make a bigger deal out of Harry mastering occlumency, as in the current form most readers don't even realise it happened.

The purpose of this arc is not to make Harry beat Voldemort via beating him in a fair fight (that should remain beyond Harry's abilities). Rather the purpose is to make Harry a more serious threat to Death Eaters, and to enable the reader to respect Harry more as a proactive, competent character with agency.

*Rationalise the worldbuilding*

By "rationalise" I don't mean pull an MOR. I mean make things more internally consistent and explore magical society in more detail.

E.g.

1. Pick a population number and depict it consistently.

2. Depict the wizarding economy in more detail (i.e. what ordinary wizards do to earn a living, other than working for the Ministry). Show the differences in what is considered scarce/valuable from the Muggle world.

3. Build up the Ministry. Most particularly, identify reasons why Voldemort isn't able to just take over the Ministry immediately (e.g. with Imperius spam) and think about how Voldemort is going to get around them. In canon, Voldemort seems to go from sitting around not doing much to taking the Ministry in a very short amount of time. The question arises: why didn't he do it earlier? The obvious answer is Dumbledore was alive to stop him, but it's not clear what exactly Dumbledore was doing to stop him (just as it's not clear what Voldemort was doing to try).

4. Put thought into how Voldemort is viewed internationally, and to what extent he operates in other countries. Either depict international elements in the conflict, or come up with good reasons why the international wizarding community isn't getting involved.

*Make the conflict more multi-polar*

JKR built up a nice four corner opposition in Harry, Fudge/The Ministry, Voldemort and Dumbledore. But this is under-explored. Harry's various disagreements with Dumbledore are never really fleshed out (Order policy of killing vs. Harry's desire not to kill, for example). Similarly, the conflict with the Ministry was set up but goes nowhere. After OotP, the Ministry kinda just falls away - it's a trophy to be won, not an institution that does things.

*Relationships*

Have the tone of the books evolve with the characters rather than keeping it children's fiction throughout. It doesn't have to reach full tits-and-blowjobs level of YA fiction detail, but it /is/ a coming of age story. The absence of sex is glaring.

So show the teenage characters actually being a bit more like teenagers and have Harry date multiple people.

  In DH, make a bigger deal out of Harry mastering occlumency, as in the current form most readers don't even realise it happened.
#+end_quote

You've mentioned this before, but I'm not convinced. The relevant passage from DH:

#+begin_quote
  His scar burned, but he was master of the pain; he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now, while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out . . . though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love. . .
#+end_quote

This doesn't match what we know of Occlumency. From Snape's lessons, the most basic technique seems to be to "control your anger, discipline your mind" and "let go of all emotion" (OoTP). Harry clearly isn't doing this. The passage is explicit: Voldemort can't enter his mind, because Voldemort can't comprehend grief (or love). Harry would still be unable to keep out Snape, who does know these emotions.

JKR elaborated a bit more on Occlumency in one of her interviews:

#+begin_quote
  But I think Draco would be very gifted in Occlumency, unlike Harry. Harry's problem with it was always that his emotions were too near the surface and that he is in some ways too damaged. But he's also very in touch with his feelings about what's happened to him. He's not repressed, he's quite honest about facing them, and he couldn't suppress them, he couldn't suppress these memories. But I thought of Draco as someone who is very capable of compartmentalizing his life and his emotions, and always has done. So he's shut down his pity, enabling him to bully effectively. He's shut down compassion --- how else would you become a Death Eater?
#+end_quote

So occlumency is about suppression. So when it says "he was master of the pain; he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned control at last", maybe that's evidence he's got it figured out? But then it goes on to say he's "consumed by grief", so clearly he's /not/ compartmentalising.

Overall it's hard to form firm conclusions. But the passage is specifically referring to Harry's connection to Voldemort. We can't say this technique would work on a Legilimens who understood grief, since it sounds quite different to Occlumency as described by Snape and JKR.

**** I don't think it's that ambiguous.

*Firstly*, because it explicitly tells us that Harry has learnt control, "the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape". And of course, we know that occlumency works via control, and we know that occlumency was the thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape.

So I think this explicit statement would override any incongruity between what Harry is doing and what we previously knew about occlumency. The passage says he's learnt it, so he has, and any discrepancy just means he's practising it in a different way to that we previously knew.

However, *secondly*, I don't think there's any contradiction with what we previously knew about occlumency. We frequently see Snape and Dumbledore display emotion, even during combat. The compartmentalisation of occlumency clearly isn't about not /feeling/ emotions, but rather not allowing your emotions to rule you. So Harry feeling grief but being apart from it is precisely in line with what we know about occlumency. This is reinforced by the numbness Harry feels when digging the grave.

Yes, the passage elaborates on an additional, Voldemort-specific factor in comparing the grief to the possession incident in OotP. But that does not contradict or undermine the fact that we are told that Harry has a) learnt control and b) is apart from his emotions. Those are the key elements of occlumency mastery as explained by Snape and /not/ Voldemort-specific.

***** I think you miss the forest for the trees. The point of the paragraph isn't "Harry figures out Occlumency", it's that Voldemort can't touch Harry because he doesn't comprehend grief --- that's a recurring theme of the last few books. That conclusion would imply that Harry still couldn't keep, say, Snape out with that technique.

To individual points now. The first part says what Dumbledore wanted him to learn was to "learn to shut his mind /to Voldemort/". 'Learning control' could easily refer his specific connection to Voldemort. I admit those first two sentences could be interpreted in the general sense, but I more naturally read it in the specific. It's both explicit and ambiguous. :)

Regarding Occlumency itself, I think the evidence is clear that Occlumency is about suppression, not just control. In addition to JKR's comments above, Snape frequently tells Harry to 'clear his mind'. Occlumency in combat is never discussed in canon.

#+end_quote

I disagree. The fundamental problem with your interpretation is that it renders the majority of the paragraph nonsensical. If Voldemort was merely being repelled by Harry's love/grief, as occurred in OotP when Harry thought of Sirius, then:

1. Harry hasn't learnt anything. The protective effect is a coincidence of his current feelings.

2. Control is irrelevant. The protective effect is a result of feeling what he is feeling, and control plays no role in that.

And yet the paragraph takes pains to say that Harry /has/ learnt something (specifically, how to keep Voldemort from his mind as Snape tried to teach him to) and that control plays a role in that. Control is referenced twice: in the general ("he had learnt control") and in the specific (he felt the pain but was apart from it).

My reading gives meaning to the /whole/ paragraph on it natural and literal interpretation. Your interpretation takes one sentence from the paragraph, says that's the sentence that matters, and ignores the rest.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

You are remembering the fanon caricature of Snape's lessons, not the actual lessons. Snape expands on the nature of occlumency to a reasonable degree, and we know that control is the major aspect of it.

#+begin_quote
  ‘The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him. Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and so can utter falsehoods in his presence without detection.'
#+end_quote

An occlumens does not shut down all thought and emotions, but rather specifically controls their mind to avoid thinking of that which they wish to hide.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Clear your mind, Potter,' said Snape's cold voice. ‘Let go of all emotion ...'

  But Harry's anger at Snape continued to pound through his veins like venom. Let go of his anger? He could as easily detach his legs ...

  ‘You're not doing it, Potter ... you will need more discipline than this ... focus, now ...'

  ...

  ‘Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord!' said Snape savagely. ‘Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked so easily -- weak people, in other words -- they stand no chance against his powers! He will penetrate your mind with absurd ease, Potter!'

  ‘I am not weak,' said Harry in a low voice, fury now pumping through him so that he thought he might attack Snape in a moment.

  ‘Then prove it! Master yourself!' spat Snape. ‘Control your anger, discipline your mind! We shall try again! Get ready, now! Legilimens!'
#+end_quote

Snape's practice is not just about clearing your mind, it is also about detaching your thoughts from your emotions. It is the art of mental self-discipline and objectivity, of which clearing your mind is just one aspect.

#+begin_quote
  Occlumency in combat is never discussed in canon.
#+end_quote

It is; Snape in HBP states that unless you are occluding against a legilimens, the legilimens will be able to block your spells easily.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Incarc---' Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm.

  ‘Fight back!' Harry screamed at him. ‘Fight back, you cowardly --'

  ‘Coward, did you call me, Potter?' shouted Snape. ‘Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?'

  ‘Stupe---'

  ‘Blocked again, and again, and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!' sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more.

*** Ok so starting with relationships. I don't think sex is absolutely necessary but sexual interest coming up could be a thing. Dating multiple people I have mixed feelings on. The age I think he'd be most interested in that sort of thing is after Voldemort is back and hes depressed about people dying. Not sure if dating like a normal teen could happen. But I would say it would make sense to show that others are dating around while he isnt.

And most treat it pretty casually. Dating as a teen feels intense but people are aware thats not like they are getting married any time soon. In my experience while a intense romance may be what you wany treating it that way and being super intense about it is awkward uncomfortable and people will side eye you. Dating in general also feels way more awkward. Because you are new at it and you are young

You want to be with your partner because you are close but you arent ready for any huge commitments because you are still a kid.

I definetly agree about the ministry. Voldemort taking over the ministry made little sense his influence wasnt as strong as it had been before. And once upon a time Tom Riddle had been very suave and minipulative enough to easily weasel his way into confidence and power. But you dont see that from him.when he comes back. Ministry take over makes more sense if he came back earlier or had access to his supporters earlier. And has more impact if you know how it works so you can see what he did and that can have an impact.

But for that to happen in a way that makes sense more of the plot has to deal with undetstanding the ministry and not just the school experience. Personally i think the best way to put this in could be by having Pettigrew caught in book 3 and having Sirius go through a extended trial. Then findingna different way for Voldemort to organize the triwizard tournament.

As for things like international politics id love to see it explored but to justify going out of the way to do that I think it might make sense if Voldemort took over a larger area or ruled for a longer period of time maybe even add in one or 2 more books.

It would end up being very different but I'd be very happy to read this alternate take

All of this, plus going into the corruption at the ministry. Fudge is very heavily implied to have been bribed. Summary execution seems to be a thing. Umbridge being planted as a teacher when she has another role. Prisoners being denied due process.

I'd probably change Hermione's character to be a bit better with people. Ron should be better at magic as well. Malfoy as well. If doing a redemption arc for him, then he should definitely be shown to have some sort of compassion in the series, rather than being a happy member of the ~~Hitler Youth~~ Death Eaters: Hogwarts Chapter.

Perhaps some more functional adults. Snape shouldn't actively sabotage children if keeping him good.

** Epilogue is replaced with something much closer to the final chapter timeline wise, maybe the first day of Hogwarts after the fall of Voldemort. It's bittersweet for Harry because he won't be going back, but he's proud that he has helped rebuild it and is in the process of finding some peace after the war. All isn't well, but all is progressing in the right direction and there's plenty of hope. (Or for the love of everything holy, at least no Albus Severus. There's a name that proves that all was NOT well, because Harry never coped with his stolen childhood.)

Ginny's personality shows up more often in the earlier books, and as a result Harry spends a little bit of time being her friend before the dragon shows up in his chest. As the books stand now, Cho/Harry had a more natural progression over multiple books than Ginny/Harry.

Kreacher doesn't play a role in Sirius' death (with the overtones of "it was his own fault, who cares how tragic his life was") and Sirius' death is not an ambiguous falls-through-drapery thing. I understand needing to kill all the father figures. I don't understand adding insult to injury.

Tonks kills Bellatrix. Or Neville does it. Or Augusta. Or Andromeda. Or almost anyone other than Molly.

I remember being very confused when I read it, was kinda disappointed by how it was written (though I'm still torn about whether or not JK Rowling made it sudden and confusing on purpose so that we and Harry would have a harder time accepting that he actually did die). However, what comes after that, when Harry tries to find ways to communicate with Sirius is one of my favorite parts of the entire series. Just heartbreaking.

*** I think Molly was the perfect person to take out Bella

The dumpy housewife taking on the feared Dark witch and kicking her arse

To me, it's very symbolic of the power of a mothers love. Molly was obviously very powerful but it was the loss of one child and the immediate threat of losing others that really got her going

One of the main themes in HP (to me) is maternal love. We have Lily (obviously) who died for Harry, Molly and her protective and nuturing persona and even Narcissa who made an Unbreakable Oath and lied to Voldemort

On the other hand, we've got Eileen Snape who exposes her son to neglect and violence, Petunia Dursley who ruins her son through overindulgence, Merope Gaunt who literally gave up (although she was so abused herself) and then we have Bellatrix who would have sacrificed her son to feed her obsession with the Dark Lord.

To me, Molly taking out Bella is a nice way of tying this idea together.

**** I understand the symbolism of the story as it is, but it doesn't work for me.

I think that a story that centers around the power of love is cheapened when one sort of love is semi-explicitly held up as the most important. The love of a friend, a romantic partner, a sibling, a father is somehow less than the love of a mother? That's icky to me. It's simultaneously an unkind message to send to someone who doesn't have a mother (or a loving mother) and an unkind message to send to mothers, since all the pressure is now on them. I always HATED JKR's comment that James' sacrifice meant less than Lily's because he hadn't thought about it. WTF? Guy is in the middle of a war, has defied the chief bad guy three times, and has never thought about whether he'd throw himself in front of Voldemort to save Lily and Harry?

I also don't like the idea that maternal love trumps all the education and training in the world. Bellatrix had no trouble taking out Sirius and Tonks, both of whom were actively focused on subduing dark magic while Molly was (nobly enough) focused on raising her family. Molly's love for her family, and the power of that love, was perfectly clear without disparaging the other kinds of work people can put into making a positive impact on the world as useless in comparison.

***** Give Molly Weasley a more supporting role. She isn't a front line combatant- she may have been trained for it during the first war, but by the time of the books she's nearly two decades out of practice.

Instead of having her kill Bellatrix, give that role to somebody else and make Molly's a more emotionally supportive role. Perhaps she reassures Ron when he breaks down after being powerless to protect the woman he loves from Bellatrix. Let her have one on one interactions with Harry that flesh out the mother-son dynamic. Where she excels is maintaining the hearth and home so her family (and the Order) always have somewhere to return to.

There's plenty of other badass women who are competent and skilled frontline fighters, but it doesn't make sense for Molly to be one of them.

Portkeys are also overly powerful. To get rid of enemies you simply throw them a portkey to an active volcano.

The sum of Dumbledore's actions and inactions make him either outright evil or utterly incompetent.

Harry is a non-entity in the early books. Spineless and reactive, he has no will of his own. He names his son after the 2 persons he had the most problems with. And after being harassed and persecuted by a corrupt Ministry he then starts taking orders from them in a job recommended by a Death Eater.

Ron and Hermione are too dissimilar to be a believable couple. They are polar opposites and the only thing they have in common is Harry as a friend.

I think if the fandom ceases to overestimate what an average wizard can do, these things stop being "too powerful." The average wizard can't adequately perform a shield charm or a patronus. They certainly can't do any of this.

Liquid luck is toxic and from the description given very much acts like an addictive drug. Time turners were all destroyed and there seemed to be a small number in existence to begin with. Polyjuice has to be continuously drunk and the only difference between it and wand human transfiguration is the voice change. Truth serum can be beaten with occlumency and isn't even used in court because of that fact. Legilimency isn't widely known.

Hermione really needed an arc she had one in the first book understanding being a good student is less important and valuable than doing the right thing even if it means being disobedient but after that she doesnt really get one. Since she struggles with empathy and is accidentally insensitive alot Id love it if her becoming friends with Ron and Harry were a longer arc that starts with the troll incident. But they dont become automatic bffs since they dont yet have much in common. Also would give a chance for other students to help in Harry and Ron's schemes so you get to know them better too.

Andromeda killing Bella would be great especially if she got introduced before and you got to know her decently well before she has the confrontation.

** I wouldn't really change much of the plot, since I doubt I could do much better. I also happen to like Canon(there are still a couple things that annoy me).

Mostly I would just add a little more foreshadowing for future plot points, like the Hallows or the significance of wand allegiances.

Id also specify a couple things that were mentioned in the books, but were apparently not clear enough, like Time Turners being able to change the past, or the purpose of Occlumency being to magically protect the mind instead of just protecting against Legilimency. And most importantly that Snape never cared for Harry.

Remove things that didn't make sense with later introduced Plot points, like Dumbledore flying to the ministry instead of using apparition. And use terms that weren't even invented until later books like Squib.

Another thing would be to to get numbers a little bit better sorted out, like passing mentions of a few additional dorms, students and teacher. And try to keep check on how old certain characters are at certain moments.

One bigger change I would make is having Harry and Ron show a more talent at magic and use it more often, since Deathly Hallows shows them as very competent compared to other wizards when, they only looked a little above average before with Harry even seeming to struggle quite a bit in sixth year.

Id like to say that I would change the romance in the books, but I actually like that there wasn't a very big focus of it, and dont really mind the pairings.

And by far the biggest change I would make is to the Epilogue, where I change the name of Albus Severus to Albus Rubeus or something like that. Also remove the mention of the Malfoys because it didn't make any sense that Draco(and his father) didn't end up in prison after the war.

At this point Sirius being actually innocent has been spread which would call for super strict and harsh punishments to be side eyed more especially I assume for younger people.

Neither of Malfoy father or son are able to avail themselves of the defense of duress, since it's absolutely not available for charges of murder and is generally not (ie exceptions are possible, but highly unlikely) available for members of criminal gangs.

- Drastic Changes to Quidditch: Training for first years that are interested, backup players (especially seekers), Standardized team brooms (Traditionally donated by parents and former house alumni). Ron joins the reserves as a Keeper/Catcher.
- The Griffindor seeker gets sick/injured. Slytherin is suspected but it's Quirrlmort missing target and sabotaging the current seeker's broom, not the up-and-coming seeker.
- James would not have played Quidditch.
- Fix every currently existing character's ages.
- Each of the core four are given a thing they are good at from the start. Hermione is good at research (this is different than being good at studying or teaching), Nevile is a natural with plants (a trait he would share with his mother), Harry is good at flying, Ron is good at Transfigurations.
- A full hight painting of the four founders is behind the staff in the great hall.
- Over the winter holidays, McGonagall tells Harry a story about each of his parents when they were in their first year. This becomes a tradition.

Book 2:

- Neville invites Harry over for his birthday when he gets no response his gran goes to the Dursleys' to ask him in person. Harry spends the remainder of the summer with them and we get some insight into wizarding culture. Ron and Hermione are invited over for both Harry and Neville's birthdays. Harry learns that Alice was his godmother, and Lily was Neville's. The two would have been raised as brothers, if not for the Lastranges.
- The intelligence of the paintings at Hogwarts is proven to be superior to other paintings. Other paintings capture the thoughts and feelings at the time they're made and don't know anything outside of what the subject knew at the time. They can react to things happening in front of them but they forget about it in ten minutes (really good paintings can remember things for days). Hogwarts paintings can learn new things, hence why they speak modern English.
- Dumbledore still sends Harry's vault key to Molly, but she turns it over to Harry at the party. Hermione's parents agree to do their school shopping with Augusta, Molly says Ron can go with them and they can all meet at the book store, promptly at 1:00.
- No flying car. Bring back the Centaurs to rescue Harry from the spiders.
- Flitwick co-coaches the dueling club instead of Snape. They have a mini-tournament after the students learn to do the disarming charm, where Harry eventually get paired with Draco. Draco summons the snake on his own. Flitwick vanishes it after Harry talks to it.
- Harry and Hermione research parselmouthes. Examples are found that are good, evil, and neutral, all of them are good with healing magic.
- The Basilisk isn't killed but retreats after being stabbed. The slide turns to stairs if you say stairs. Harry visits him before leaving (with a cow he got from Hagrid) and learns that the purpose Chamber of Secrets was to leave a tutor for Slytherin's descendants and many of them have found the Chamber over the last thousand years. The Basilisk promises to teach Harry is he comes back.
- Each of the core four are given a thing they have to work at to be good at but they really enjoy. Hermione's is dueling, Nevile's is Transfigurations (Ron helps him with it), Harry's is knitting (he takes it up when Ginny abandons it do to her Diary induced depression), Ron's is teaching.

Book 3:

- Harry and Ginny knit together. Ginny introduces him to Luna.
- Each of the core four are given a thing they hated before but learn to love because they share it with another member of the core four. Hermione's is Flying with Harry, Nevile's is Potions with Hermione, Harry's is cooking with Ron, Ron's is gardening with Neville.
- Harry takes Arithmancy and Ancient Ruins as well as Care and Divinations which He drops at the end of the year.
- The Dueling club continues.
- Harry starts learning from the Basilisk, he teaches some of it to the others. He starts trying to teach them to speak Parsel.

Book 4:

- Make the Triwizard Tournament an actual tournament. A broom race tournament happens before the first task, a three on three quidditch tournament takes place before the second one and a dueling tournament before the third one.
- No brother wand ex Machina. Harry uses a spell learned from the Basilisk (and dodging) to survive the duel in the graveyard. Harry is resistant to the Cruciatus because of the Basilisk venom in the second year.
- The Hogwarts champion is Cassius Warrington (his hostage is his younger cousin). Cedric Diggory does very well in the various tournament.
- Harry takes Luna to the Yule ball after he hears that Neville asked Ginny.
- Each of the core four are given a thing they learn from a foreign student. Hermione's is Bulgarian from Viktor, Nevile's is a dueling technique from a Drumsrtang girl, Harry's is basic alchemy from a Beauxbatons boy, Ron's is French from Flur.
- The foreign students attend classes with the Hogwarts students.

- Neville and Hermione are made Prefects. Draco is not.
- Warrington's cousin talks to Harry about Warrington at the start of the year.

- Each of the core four teaches a side character a valuable skill.
- Firenze still replaces Trelawny but as a favor to Dumbledore not because he was kicked out for saving Harry.
- The Basilisk helps the core four plan lessons for the DA. Harry talks to the Basilisk about using its venom to cure Neville's parents.

Book 6:

- Each of the core four learns something from Sirius.
- Narcissa brings them Hufflepuff's cup.
- The "Power he knows not" is trust.
- No BS wand lore ex Machina. Harry has to beat Voldemort with the full-powered Elder Wand. No BS walked to his death by his parents. Harry duels Voldemort and dies. the Horcrux is gone. Voldie starts monologuing and Harry hits him from behind with either an AK or Sectumsempra.

- Flesh out the idea of Harry and Hermione having a sibling-like dynamic. Seriously, if they think of each other like brother and sister, then I'd like to see some of the gentle teasing that tends to come with those sorts of relationships.

- Just scrap all of the endgame pairings. So no Ron/Hermione, No Remus/Tonks, and no Bill/Fleur. Harry/Ginny is the only somewhat reasonable endgame pairing, and even it's not great and it would probably be better if they were paired with other people.

- Flesh out the antagonists and give them better motivations. For that matter, get rid of all of the implications that Tom Riddle was "born evil", which is kind of disturbing concept to have in a book that so heavily emphasizes forgiveness. Give him better reasons for supporting blood purity that him having daddy issues.

*** Personally my headcanon for Voldemort is horcruxes scrambled his brain. Sure he didnt know he wasn't pureblood for sure thought he was half blood at best. But that meant that he had to suffer for the blood purity stuff too. So he'd dislike the purebloods for being hostile just like he disliked the muggles. His obsession with immortality makes a bit more sense considering he made his first horcrux during ww2 when London was being firebombed and he knew that he would have to go back in the summer to London and risk dying in the orphanage he hated since his request to stay im hogwarts was denied. Not that bigotry is the most rational thing but in this case id say it wasnt exactly advantageous for him to pride blood purity before knowing his ancestor was Salazar especially since he'd already come to the conclusion at least one parent wasn't magical. And i do expect Voldemort to believe in a worldview thats convenient to him. Anti muggle is but blood purity is not.

I dont mind Dumbledore keeping secrets but there were way too many ways for his plan to fail and it didnt have to be like thay.

And ya in the movies they get along better but in the books? They are so awkward when they are alone together. They act like friends who only hang out because they are part of the same group when they spend extended periods of time together without Ron or others there. But they are suposed to be best friends its really weird.

And im of the mind set if you aren't going to put effort into doing a romance dont do a romance. And most of these werent fleshed out enough to justify their existence beyond like most stories like this have romance. So ya id be happier if it had no confirmed ships

***** There is a theory i know of that suggests that understanding of magic is increased by being able to play with it and being able to do accidental magic and being uncouraged to have" accidents" which muggleborns and those who live around muggles dont have the luxury of doing. Because of this magic is taught in a limited way that stifles innovation which is halting the progess of the wizarding world. Rather than find a way to reach out to muggleborns at a earlier age blood purists instead want to kick them out of the magical world all together blaming the muggleborns rather than trying to reform a inadequate system because of pre existing biases they have of outsiders.

** 1. Flesh out the characters in the other houses.

2. Alter the first four books so as to have slightly less cartoonish characterizations of people.

(Case and point, the Dursleys. In the first few books it describes how Harry is starved by them on multiple occasions, and how Harry once had to dodge a swing to his head from a soapy frying pan. There is nothing inherently wrong with portraying them as doing these things since they are meant to be a few steps shy of evil, but there is a significant lack of reasoning and overreaction on their part in the first few books.)

1.  Expand the magical population. Add more people to each year at Hogwarts, reference a larger population out of the school, talk about the various elements of wizarding society being a fully developed culture outside of just having a school, sports, a shopping district, and a government.

2.  Have Harry learn more. When He realizes Voldemort is after him, have Harry take the threat a little more seriously and invest in his knowledge of how to defend himself and others. He shows the apptitude for this in Goblet of fire, where apparently a maze full of obstacles is apparently a better motivator than an insane dark lord after your blood.

3.  Have Hogwarts teach more subjects. Expand the range of electives, considering Dumbledore's work with Flamel maybe include Alchemy, also add electives on Enchanting, Spell theory, Law, etc.

4.  Have witches and wizards come of age later than muggles unstead of sooner, consudering how much longer they live. Have them come of age at nineteen instead of seventeen. Make Hogwarts last nine years instead of seven, giving more time for a second set of electives after the OWL's allowing for more complicated topics to be introduced, such as political studies or somthing similar.

5.  Increase the magical world's emphasis on purely academic pursuits. Make mention of historians and philosohers and other such purely scholarly fields of work to go along with potioneers and experimental spell crafters.

6.  Make mention of a larger economy, having larger businesses and companies to go along with all the small family/single owned shops and pubs.

7.  Make Ginny more present in the story, aside from her involvement in book two, she isn't really present until book five, and then she doesn't actually do anything till book six. Make her presence begin to come into play during book four, be expanded on and fully realized during book five and then have a much more firm foundation for their relationship in book six.

8.  Make the war last longer, to go along with having people come of age at nineteen instead of seventeen, have the war last longer. Have Harry Ron and Hermione be more involved during the hunt, dodging snatchers and the like, and then have the seventh book end with them retaking Hogwarts and securing it against Voldemort's forces as the end of book seven, leading into guerrilla warfare launching from Hogwarts in book eight, with Harry and Co. becoming fully fledged warriors fighting for what they belive in.

9.  Increase the guilt of the previous generation. Voldemort is a problem of the Maruader generation at the latest, the fact that the society allowed themselves to be so beaten down as to be almost destroyed, and then passed that chaos onto their children, that would realistically be major source of guilt.

10. On the matter of deaths.

Percy makes his first joke and dies right after, Fred and George go on to build a solemn legacy in his name, including a line of high quality (standardised thickness) cauldrons.

Remus, redeeming himself fully from having abandoned Tonks during the war, sacrifices himself to save Tonks life. Tonks lives and becomes a part of Harry's life as the two support each other in raising Teddy and remembering the last Marauder.

1. The epilouge. Increase the amount of stuff written after the war but before the time jump, maybe setting up the events to come. And then increase the length of the epilouge to be the entire morning September 1st starting with Harry waking up and ending with the train leaving, allowing more time for introspection and reflection.

** More or less what was written here, but really make Dursleys more believable. The abuse doesn't have to be more harsh (keep it PG-13, if you want), but Dursleys by JKR are just a weird parody on humans through the eyes of abused child. Yes, I know, the books are written through Harry's eyes, but I would really love some more humanization of Dursleys. There are many good reasons why Petunia may be suspicious of magic (I love “Magic destroys everything it touches.” in linkffn(Lion Unity by Fruitality)), and it would be lovely if they could have one real talk about it. I know about this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhS9Z13Gyac][deleted scene]] from the DH1 movie, but I would rather hope for some more extended talk (over the breakfast?).

** So basically, for the purpose of this exercise, I'm taking JKR's role as the author of the books.

I've actually been thinking about this. Of course, MY Harry Potter probably wouldn't have been one-tenth as imaginative and wouldn't have got one-tenth as much fame and recognition... but let's say that I had the series, I had the broad-strokes setting, plot and characters, and that I was free to do whatever I wanted with them. Wellll....

- Less blatant "Muggles are inferior and if you don't have magic you're scum!" attitude. The wizarding world can be bigots, that's fine, but at least have SOME people there who start questioning whether it's actually ethical to mind-wipe Muggles at the drop of a hat. Don't wait until the seventh book to have someone mention that maybe Muggles are people too. REALLY don't wait until the spin-off to have a Muggle who's actually kind of positively portrayed.

- Either reduce the Dursleys' role, or develop them more. Usually in these types of story, the "nasty relatives who raise the hero" vanish from the narrative after the hero's discovered his real heritage. The Dursleys have really played out their role after the first book, and since they steadfastly refuse any development (maybe except Dudley) they feel increasingly out of place. Just have Harry leave them after he goes to Hogwarts; have him stay with Hagrid or something, and leave the Dursleys from the narrative. And then they can appear again in the sixth book or something, when Harry's sixteen and can face that part of his past.

- More girls. Seriously. The HP books are a total boys' club. Yes, I know, people will always point out how many awesome female characters there are in the books, but apart from Hermione they're all secondary characters who MAYBE get large roles in one or two books. Give the other girls more to do, break out of the stereotypical "men do the important things" here and reduce the "not like other girls" role of Hermione. Give Ginny and Luna more to do, and not just off-screen. Develop Lavender and Parvati instead of just having them as (inferior) "girly" contrast to Hermione. Maybe even swap a few genders; make one of the Weasley twins female and hang the entire "Ginny's the only daughter" thing.

- Develop the four Houses more. As the books tell it, Gryffindor is the only house that's any good at all. Slytherin is evil, Hufflepuff is a bunch of losers, and Ravenclaw is so anonymous they might as well not have been in the books at all. It might actually have helped to break up the main trio, but Ron in Hufflepuff and Hermione in Ravenclaw. And then just make it more acceptable to visit other house common rooms and such. Harry, Ron and Hermione could still hang out all the time, they'd just have three common rooms to do it in instead of just the one. As for Slytherin, you can use Slughorn as a perfect catalyst to introduce some sympathetic Slytherins. I don't know, have a Slytherin girl in Ginny's year or something. Gryffindor can still be the "main" house since that's Harry's house (and Neville would be an important supporting player in Gryffindor), but this way the other houses get a little more agency and nuance.

- Get out of Harry's head more. He's the main character, but he doesn't have to be the center of EVERY scene. Have more chapters where he isn't present, and we actually get to see the lives of other people in the world. In particular, both Ron and Hermione should get at LEAST one chapter per book each.

- On that note, more development for Ron and Hermione. I've mentioned before how their character development kind of halts mid-series when the entire "Ron is never right and Hernione is never wrong" thing really takes off. Have Ron actually get to to succeed without immediately undermining him, have Hermione actually be wrong without immediately making excuses for her or twist it so that she was REALLY right anyway.

- Give Hermione's family some attention. I know, JKR made a choice not to include them much because Ron's family was more interesting AND more plot-relevant, but I think at least one chapter with Hermione in the Muggle world would be nice. Give her parents a little more attention... and you know what? Go with the original plan of giving her a younger sister who's a Muggle. If Hermione stays in touch with her sister, who maybe occasionally goes to find out things in the Muggle world and sends letters to Hermione, that would even make a nice contrast to Harry's relationship with Dudley. If the "Hermione mindwipes her family" thing still happens, it'll hit a LOT harder if the reader KNOWS that family, the sister who wrote all those funny letters and was a big help in Book Three; all of a sudden she doesn't know who she is and has been sent to Australia. This again would tie into the questions of ethical treatment of Muggles.

- In fact, give one book to Ron and Hermione where they, not Harry, save the day. I know, Harry's the main character, but part of the POINT is that Harry is a contrast to Voldemort... where Voldemort only trusts himself, Harry accepts friendship. It sort of underminds the point if Harry has to defeat Voldemort alone ANYWAY. How about, say, Harry actually vanishes in the Triwizard Tournament, and then Ron and Hermione have to find and rescue him? Put their skills a little more on display, give them a few chapters where they have to manage without Harry, and step up to the task.

- Foreshadow the Horcruxes and Hallows a little more... particularly the Hallows, so that they don't come completely out of left field in the last book. Have Ron tell The Tale of the Three Brothers or something in the first book, and maybe they figure out a minor plot point thanks to it... THEN, several books later, introduce the concept of the actual Hallows, and Harry can remember "the story Ron had told him years ago" or something.

- ETA: Oh, and I almost forgot: NO prophecy and NO time-travel. The Time-Turners were a bad idea to begin with, and while the HP prophecy isn't the WORST example of a prophecy I've heard, prophecies in general are just terrible. So, no prophecy. Instead, Voldemort goes after Lily and James because he wants to unite the Deathly Hallows and has found out about the Invisibility Cloak. As in canon, he agrees to spare Lily because Snape pleads for her life... as in canon he breaks the promise when she annoys him, unwittingly agreeing to trade harry's life for hers, and gets vanquished in the same way. OOTP is not about Voldemort trying to learn the Prophecy, but trying to get the Invisibility Cloak off Harry..

** I would make Harry more realistic. He had just suffered 10 years of abuse. He would be too thin to eat properly, due to not eating regularly for a while. He probably would've remembered Draco from Madame Malkin's and wanted to be his friend because he was the first person to not bully or abuse Harry. I doubt he would've been so self assertive due to being made to feel worthless his entire life. So, all in all, I would give Rowling a psychology book. And a maths one.

I would also make it so Tom riddle survives year 2. That would be interesting to have a sixteen year old boy (immortality, remember) show up in 6th year.
