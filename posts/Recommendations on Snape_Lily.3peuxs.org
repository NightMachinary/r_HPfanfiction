Hello everyone. Having just read The Road Not Taken, which was fantastic, and sadly, not finished. I was wondering if anybody had some recs on something similar. After reading that fic, I am quite the Snape/Lily shipper now, especially reading what Rowling said that if Snape had changed, Lily might have come to love him.


** I like linkffn(The Apprentice by Deborah Peters). Too bad it's abandoned.

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

** I just finished and LOVED linkffn(Ananke by Eunike)

The characterization is fantastic, lots of focus on inner monologues and emotions, angst ridden. It's 39 chapters and woefully unfinished /BUT/ I feel like the unofficial Part I was finished, and there is some satisfaction there. It's Part II where we just start to see the new story forming, it comes to a bit of a climax and then - last updated 2012.
