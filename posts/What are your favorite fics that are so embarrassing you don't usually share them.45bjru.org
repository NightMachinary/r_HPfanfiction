I really like this one [[http://malfoymanor.grangerenchanted.com/themanor/viewuser.php?uid=434]]

It has it all, Draco in leather pants (literally), weird veela mating habits, unicorn animagus, Good Malfoys, excessive titles, Pureblood culture, time travel, Sirius comes back from the veil, and more. This one is even complete.

What is your favorite oddball has everything cliche fic?


** HPMOR I guess. I've read dozen much worse fics so I was surprised that so many people here hate it.

*** I think it's the same reason some people, myself included, hate Twilight. It's not because it's shit (though it is), but because it's intensely wasted potential, a /brilliant/ story helmed by an, at best, amateur author. Most of the "science" is bollocks at best, just to begin with, let's not even get into the absolutely /horrid/ characterisation. It's Harry Potter in name only, as though someone got their manuscript declined too many times, so just cut and pasted Potter names and locations over an original fiction.

That said, it had some /amazing/ ideas that I would have /loved/ to see explored further. Just by someone else. Who might also try to avoid setting it entirely in Harry's first goddamn school year.

**** Funny, I have almost an opposite opinion of Stephanie Meyer. I think the idea behind the Twilight series is awful, derivative, badly plotted, and nothing really happens.

However, I have a fairly high opinion of Meyer's command of style. Twilight's full of nonsensical plot and horrible characters, but damn if it isn't a page turner that's hard to stop reading.

I would gladly have read a historical political/power play story about the Volturi (they're like vampire aristocracy but not really), or a more urban fantasy sort of thing following Alice (she can see the future), or one about Carlisle (their dad) as he chooses to save his patients by biting them and evades vampire hunters in a steampunk late 19th century setting (and throw Van Helsing in there because why the hell not).

***** [[/u/chaosattractor]] shows a few of my regrets with their post, but I also feel like Edward and Bella could have been memorable in their own right, a vampire romance that stays in pop culture's memory for the /right/ reasons, like Buffy and Angel.

Dump the sparkles for one, they add nothing. The incident with Jasper where he nearly eats Bella due to a paper cut? Fucking brilliant, but should have been explored more (you're telling me /no-one/ has injured themselves at school before now?).

Basically, I just wanted some proper polish. The story needed to be tightened up, the reasons for all this made clear (I cannot imagine that people would be /content/ to redo school again and again and again for eternity), the characters fleshed out some more. There was so much room for great interactions and most of it was wasted space.

I was like "okay but where's the danger?"

Just setting the whole thing in college would solve so many issues. There'd be no need for contrived family situations. The forever-and-ever romance would've been a bit more plausible. And while you couldn't drag even my dead body back to redo high school, I'd gladly do college over and over again if I were immortal. There are so many fields to explore, and college students are a /bit/ more mature and relatable than high schoolers (plus they're way more fun)

***** Even the fact that vampires are, from what i've read described, as closer to a kind of living statue that runs on blood means that I could actually take a twilight vampire, call it a blood golem, play up the shinyness being that they're made of a substance like colored diamond.

As I read in luminosity, (HPMOR offshoot warning, but it did make the setting interesting), there's all kinds of mental manipulation potential to explore with the werewolves, and there's half-vampires somehow and it's a all around tolerable setting that could easily be explored in an interesting way, but...

Twilight itself stinks.

*** People keep saying that people here hate it or "you're so brave to mention HPMOR here!". I've been on here about a year and I honestly haven't seen that much hate. I sometimes wonder if those kinds of comments are actually a subtle form of bullying to suppress HPMOR (constantly reinforcing the idea that lots of people hate it, contrary to the fact that it's one of the most favorited/reviewed stories on ffn) or to appear "above" the fans of HPMOR. Apologies if that sounds like I'm accusing you directly, I'm just pondering (or rather, maybe I'm saying if you like HPMOR don't let the naysayers make you embarrassed about it -- own it!).

And yet I still find myself reluctant to mention it sometimes. People ask for a story that fits certain criteria and I think "Well, HPMOR technically fits." but then I don't mention it because I don't want to be seen as (just) an HPMOR cheerleader, or because surely they've read it already, or whatever. Or because it's just so much /more/ than the criteria that was given that it probably isn't what they wanted?

Then again, I'm probably biased since I went on to read about the rest of the author's views, and find myself agreeing with a lot of them - it's mostly about AI and Bayes, though.

Barty was definitely a case of Fudge being stupid, but I have issues with the entire basis of wizarding law. They have a fucking /truth potion/ and it's not fucking used in court.

Hagrid was the worst case, I agree, but with the "evidence" against him from before and the complete cock up of justice that is the wizarding world, I'm actually kind of inclined to side with Fudge on his reasoning. If he did nothing, not only would his job likely be in danger, but that would almost certainly lead to a Hogwarts that would be far worse off (I imagine Lucius was pulling strings to get elected himself).

** I absolutely LOVE [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9081608/1/Fire-Born][Fire Born]] linkffn(9081608).

It has a great characterization of a sociopathic Tom Riddle. He's not a cartoony evil character, he just doesn't view people the same way most other people do. That's primarily the reason why I love this story: Tom and his interactions with other people and Harry is really fascinating for me to read.

Now the reason why I don't usually recommend this fic to everyone is because it features a Fem!Harry/Tom pairing. I really like the way it showed the relationship because it felt rather in character with how I thought Tom Riddle would be, but trying to explain everything is hard because of the stigma behind the pairing.

Anyways, I'm probably not doing a great job explaining why I like it, but that's why I'm a reader and not a writer. It's rather short at 40k words, but I liked it a lot and I wish it finished :(

** I've got some that I wouldn't recommend without a request for something that fit it very well. Obviously, there's redeeming qualities, but they often have elements that make it awkward to recommend.

Like, linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1546436/chapters/3275699]]) has some really brilliant bits. Draco time travels back from mid 6th year to the summer before 4th, and that's really interesting timing, because he's quite unhappy with Voldemort but still doesn't see a way out. And he has some future knowledge, but not enough to prevent Voldemort's resurrection. Draco is pretty well characterized too: superficial, cowardly, and skilled at self-delusion, but also fairly clever and oddly charming. But it's got alpha/beta/omega dynamics, which is always kind of awkward. And the eventual romance is probably going to be the type that's fun to read about but would be a terrible idea in real life.

More often, I don't share something because it's unrepentant fluff. Or because it's just weird (like the Albus Dumbledore/Draco Malfoy fic. Surprisingly touching, but reading about Dumbledore's wrinkles during a smutty bit...)

***** I always thought it was pretty well-received, and for good reason. What was your take on the Firebird trilogy, out of curiosity? Besides all of the grimdark, I mean. I barely managed to skim it because of that.

EDIT: Upon reading further, I may have been too hasty on that one. The writing does need quite a bit of polish in places.

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][Meaning of One]]. I was in a depression, and something about this appealed to me at the time. Its not a /bad/ fic, but I'm pretty sure it is the trope codifier of soul bond fics. If you want to check it out, skip the prologue. Its weird and adds nothing imo. There is a second part which is almost done, certainly in the denouement, is pretty much abandoned. Ends in CoS.

*** I think you're a bit hard with this fic, considering it's pretty well written and the origin of the Bond is original. I really enjoyed reading it, I think among all the Soul Bond fics it's definitely in the top 10%.

**** Oh among soul bond fics I rate it at number two or three from the ones I've read.

Its not a bad fic, and a lot of it is really good. However a lot of it is just weird, like the whole thing about the pajamas. I do enjoy its exploration of magic, and the three classifications of power behind spells.

The best part of it is definitely the little moments, where they build up the characters and general world building.

** In the "so bad it's good" vein I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771/1/Partially-Kissed-Hero][Partially Kissed Hero]]. It gets so ridiculous by the time it was abandoned but I love how unapologeticly ridiculous it is. The scene where they fix Harry's mental issues by weeding his mind in Wonderland will make you question your own sanity.

I would also love to see people try to resolve the story from it's current insanity, but who would want to bother?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2064124/1/Parenting-Class][My guilty pleasure is this fic]] This fic is well written, has some funny moments, but overall the concept is very weird. Basically the story is that 6th year Dumbledore has groups of 3 6th students live together in a small house, and work as a family. The catch here is that every 2-3 weeks one of the members are turned into a 5 year old child. Weird concept, but its such a feel good story, that I just love to read.
