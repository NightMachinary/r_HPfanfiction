I've been thinking about the concept and all that entails with it. Forgive me cause I've been influenced by the Sandman series, but if I recall correctly, there was a line in it that after all is said and done only death will remain at world's end, a closing up shop if you will.

So if Potter is the MoD, does that mean he holds dominion over anything that dies, from fulfilled prophecies, passing seconds, abandoned ideas and concepts, moments, etc?

If so, that'll place a new spin on being the MoD because if he is adamant on something not dying, that would mean that he can request or even rebirth/resurge that something/idea. Like for example: if he has it in mind that his prophecy isn't complete yet (even if he killed Riddle) and that the 'marks him his equal' means that even his cronies should be wiped out; does that mean Riddle can't pass on without his cronies?


** I'm assuming that the Deathly Hallows are just man-made artefacts created by the Peverells, as Dumbledore and Grindelwald clearly thought.

I think the master of all three Hallows can be referred as Master of Death, because the wand gives the power to kill, the stone gives the power to resurrect, and the cloak the power to hide yourself. So a wizard holding all three Hallows wields a lot of power over life and death, but I think there's no more to the title than ownership of all three Hallows.

*** So you're in the mind that the title is metaphorical? But what of the final battle between Potter and Riddle? I know it is plot armor by JKR, but in-universe, as long as one bested another, does that mean the winner could use the loser's wand? Since the current lore dictates as such?

**** The title Master of Death is metaphorical in my opinion. Being the Elder Wand's master isn't, as the Elder Wand is a magical object that is won by conquering it's previous master.

***** The title is metaphorical, but the sentience/enchantment of wand chosing the master is not. There lies the difference in our opinion. I'm more on the side of the mystical/supernatural.

Wand sentience is already exhibited, but when the Elder Wand is concerned it is at a different level. It calls for something more than that. Thus, my speculation about the title being more.

Sometimes I curse JKR and not writing more lore.

** It was metaphorical, not actual.

*** However metaphorical, it's still subject to discussion/speculation, yes? Isn't that why there are many MoD fics out there? People shifting it to Potter being the actual MoD?

** I always liked the idea that the Master of Death is not something solely happening by the Hallows. I was thinking about a whole bunch of Masters and even more items making them so. They're agents of Death. Harry becomes one during his first delivery of Deaths Justice and is then drafted into the Masters. They're the Ferrymen, the Valkyries. They take those postponing their final judgement by unnatural means and smite them from the earth.

I also enjoyed the stories in which Death is quite literally quitting his job as soon as Harry combines the pieces.

In the end, the Master of Death can be so much, from a simple agent to the actual Grim Reaper.

*** Exactly my point! The title could be so much more; thus the fics wherein Potter attains additional powers with the mantle of MoD.

I've always liked fics where the concept of Potter being the MoD and exploring that concept is a subplot/main plot. Like the fic Coming Back Late. The story revolves around Potter being the MoD.

The Hollows are such a Deus Ex that stories have revolved around it. I'm kind of sad that there are limited fics revolvig around that concept.

** No. The full title is School Master Of Death. He's the one who teaches the little dunderheads the trade, for all eternity, with no breaks, no weekend off and monitor duty after lights out.

Edit: corrected autocorrect.
