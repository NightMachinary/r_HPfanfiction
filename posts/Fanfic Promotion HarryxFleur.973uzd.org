Harry is left with a lasting legacy. He is given a most curious object in the form of a dragon egg, the last of its kind in the hopes that it will hatch for him. Two will become one, bonded for eternity. Matched only by the bond of love. The power of that bond will give him strength to stand against his enemies. Good Dumbledore, no bashing. FleurxHarry romance, slow burn.

****** Sorry about that I got confused between Story: Harry Potter and The Veela [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6864381/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Veela]] and Story: His Angel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8135514/1/His-Angel]]

Both are very enjoyable fics that I like
