Some time ago, I read a summary of a story, marked it as a "will read soon," and then completely forgot about it. Now, I can't find it anywhere and it's driving me nuts.

This is what I can remember: Harry gets convicted (most likely from his 5th year trial) and is sent to Azkaban. In order to save Harry, Dumbledore seeks help from Grindelwald.

Sorry if that's not much info. Any of you guys recognize it?


** I'm pretty sure this isn't it since it's in DH instead of 5th year, but linkffn(Imprisoned Realm) starts with Dumbledore fetching Grindelwald out of Nurmengard to have him help, and Harry spends some time in Azkaban.
