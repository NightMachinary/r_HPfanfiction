As so often, once one walks off the paths of Harry or Hermione centered fics, one gets merely a fraction of stuff.

In this case, absolutely none.

By now, I don't even care about the premise. I just want to read a fic for once with Bellatrix Black/LeStrange as the main protagonist. Can you help me out here?


** linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty) is /fantastic./ You should read it.

** An amazing one-shot consisting of a lifetime of correspondence between Bellatrix and Sirius. It's fantastic.

  [HIATUS!]Deliciously Dark. Evil too. Bellatrix finds baby Harry left with the muggles & discovers his unusual accidental magical trait, one that she finds... Very Appealing. She decides to keep and groom him to be their next Dark Lord, and enlists the aid of Narcissa. Harry/Bellatrix, quasi-harem for a reason but H/B/N overall. M for a reason. THESE CHARACTERS ARE EVIL

** Bellatrix is such a crazy psychopathic psycophant that it is difficult to have a story based around her without completely changing her character.

*** Canon doesn't have much on her. The moment you go beyond surface on her character she is basically a blank slate. Not like a Daphne Greengrass, for example, who is completely free to design, but she's somewhere in the middle.
