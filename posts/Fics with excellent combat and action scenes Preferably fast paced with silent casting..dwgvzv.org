*** I really want to like this story, so I've been overlooking the grammar and spelling errors and the incorrect use of some words, but I just finished with the Yule Ball chapter, and I just can't keep going with it. I feel like it went completely off the remaining rail it was on here, and the characters who had all been a little out of character went full-on 'author-insert world breaking mode.'

Maybe if I had read it back when there would be some nostalgia, but I put quality at the top of the list these days, and this story doesn't have it, in my opinion.

You hear this a lot, but this is really a fic where the writing and story improve dramatically over time. The best I can say for you is to read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/27/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][this chapter]]. If this doesn't convince you to make it to at least chapters 12-18 (the best parts in my opinion) nothing will.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

I've got you covered on this. Big action and battles are my thing:

- linkffn(The One He Feared): some of the best depicted action scenes in the fandom, particularly in Chapter 4. Some of the best out there.
- linkffn(The Mind Arts): this fic has some problems, but there are a few entertaining action/battle scenes later on (Dumbledore vs Grindelwald, Harry vs Crouch, etc.).
- linkffn(Skitterleap): more or less just a straight out action scene for the majority of the fic. Fairly entertaining, if incomplete.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): lots of Harry training and learning to duel as a 6th year, with an interesting take on the Horcrux.
- linkffn(The Resistance of Azkaban): this one is full of action packed battles, as its one of Shezza's hallmarks. It ends fairly succinctly, if a little clumsily, but is definitely worth a read.
- linkffn(Delenda Est): again some issues with this fic, but there are some admittedly entertaining fights and action sequences here.
- linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): a bit of a mystery that revolves around an AU Harry, but there are 2-3 action sequences here that are truly stellar and captivating (and heartbreaking).

There is more, but that should keep you covered I think.
