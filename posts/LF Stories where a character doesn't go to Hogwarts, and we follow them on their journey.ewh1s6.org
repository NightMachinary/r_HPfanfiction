Would rather them be characters in the UK, but them going to an outside school other than Hogwarts is fine. Or they can move away from the UK, but they have to originally be from there at least.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

I don't want them going to Hogwarts as a student at all. Them showing up to be a teacher is fine, but yeah, I don't want them to be a student at Hogwarts.

Can be on ANY site.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.

Would rather not have character bashing. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash a character, is normally a no go.

Harry doesn't have to be the character that we follow.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.

** This only partially qualifies, but if you haven't read it, Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived has Harry going to Hogwarts for only half a year before he transfers out. By chapter 4 he's at Durmstrang and most of the fic takes place there. Incomplete but really fun. No bashing, which is pretty nifty considering it's a WBWL fic.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/3/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]])

The entirety of Apprentice Potter takes place without Harry being at Hogwarts as a student (although it does accept books 1-5 as its canon). Harry decides to leave Hogwarts and take up an apprenticeship. The fic itself is complete, while it is technically a part of an incomplete series, if you disregard HBP and DH lore (Apprentice Potter was finished before HBP) it is completely self contained. There is some teenage angst and anger which mostly goes away as soon as Harry's apprenticeship begins.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
