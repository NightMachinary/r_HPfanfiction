I'm a sucker for "character has to deal with new environment". And I'd like it if a wizard or witch would be the one in the new world not the other way around because I'm interested in how someone with HP magic would change things up.

I am mainly interested in Avengers, X-Men, Dystopian worlds (Maze Runner, The Hunger Games) and completely different worlds like Lotr, GoT or Star Wars. So basically a place where a wizard/witch could seriously change things up.

I can overlook bashing if it is the equivalent of a side note and if there is a ship, please no unorganic romance.


** Kneazle has two crossovers with GoT. One where [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12689889/1/The-Winter-Witch][Hermione goes to help Robb]], and another where [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12963901/1/Cursed-Be-this-Soul-that-Ties-Us-Together][she AND Teddy Lupin help Ned]].

Personally, Winter Witch is my favourite of the two, and includes a neat little extra twist where someone also goes the other way to Hogwarts, causing all sorts of head scratching from adult HP characters looking for Hermione.

Other notable crossovers that do this:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11120132/1/][Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous]]: by the same author as shadow of angmar suggested elsewhere in this thread - easily the best HP/LOTR story - for when they need a break from their very serious fic. Laugh out loud hilarious.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12653732/1/][River Lily]]: Lily potter ends up in Harry Potter world. Your mileage may vary but it's very popular. I got tired of it eventually.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12588838/1/][Poisoned Apple]]: Hermione never went to Hogwarts. Instead, she was trained alongside Black Widow and others... however this doesn't fit as well because wizards, in fact, DO feature in this somewhat. I like it though and wizards do not feature for ages.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13569941/1/][What's a Gungan?]]: funny crossover of Harry falling into Episode one. Luckily he has a soft landing ;)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13315728/1/][Daughter of Oak]]: Hermione arrives in the world of the hobbit and becomes Green. What does that mean? Read on!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12092681/1/][the harbinger's song]]: Harry is an elfling in the lotr world.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12775152/1/][The length and breadth of Skyrim: a witch's tale]]: Hermione lands in Skyrim. I enjoyed the start of this but IMO it goes off the rails a bit.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13201562/1/][Winter's Tale]]: Hermione and Captain America crossover. I remember enjoying this and it has the important distinction of actually being finished!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12005496/1/][The Elvenqueen]] a great fic where Hermione ends up in the Lotr universe

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12819887/1/][a witch in the family]]: Hermione helps Watson and Sherlock. Nice story but doesn't really fit your post. Still, I know I liked it.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12809171/1/][crooked stars]]: Kneazle again, this time plopping Hermione into Star Wars though.

You should also check [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/429239/][lil drop of magic's profile]], they have a vast collection of crossovers and their sequels. Their Hermione in avengers fics are great and should keep you busy. While the wizarding world does exist as well, it's barely relevant and there's still culture shock etc. They write good action scenes and this will keep you busy for a long time!

** That's quite a broad request as there are many that fit your criteria .. you can just check HP crossovers on ffn and select your entry fandom .. some of the ones I like are:

linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make)

linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal)

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar)

linkffn(The Havoc side of the Force)

linkffn(Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe)

Beware that HP is OP in almost all of them above.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** This one does not exactly fit, as it's technically a Fusion... but the Wizarding world is secretive and unknown to the Mafia, and the Mafia have 'omerta' which means the same thing is true-ish.

now the reason I feel like inserting the recommendation here is that after the story goes through the HarryPotter-story, the cast of HP become something unknown and strange for the Mafia people to deal with.

I also feel just about everything in the fic is about fits very loosely into the same feeling.

edit: oh also, do note: =Chapters 1-41, Hogwarts Arc= and then it starts transitioning the the crossover...and it's =334= chapters long.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.
