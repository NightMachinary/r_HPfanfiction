Because Dolohov's curse it described as purple and AK is green. Both are deadly while Expelliarmus is red and Stupefy, I guess, is blue (same with Reducto for the latter color). Do the colors mean anything or is it just random?


** I'm fairly certain Stupefy is red as well... Unless that's just a fanon thing and not actually in the books.

** IIRC, it doesn't mean anything in canon. I've seen fanfics that explore the idea though (like magical frequency/wavelength nonsense)

*** Which leads to the !logical! conclusion that Stupify counters the killing curse! Genius!

**** I've read a fic once in which it was Lily who found out about the base function of it and therefore could counteract the Killing Curse, using a spell based on sacrifice to redirect and trandform the curse. Harry finds her journals and embarks on an intellectual journey to become literally a god.

It wasn't very good in terms of writing and went off the deep end when it became a harem, so I doubt I still have it in my bookmarks.

***** I remember one where all it took was a lumos, and in old parments the AK was found as a joke for that.

****** If I remember it right, that's from Harry Tano. It'd go into periods of not being used because of that.

**** stupify does counter the kililng curse. in the battle of the seven potters harry shoots stunners at death eaters and some of them collided and blocked the curses.

#+begin_quote
  More Killing Curses flew past Harry's head from the two remaining Death Eaters' wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was happening

**** When I wrote using this idea (8 years ago) it was mostly used to determine if something was a curse as opposed to a hex or jinx

**** To be fair, if you were in a duel and they tried to stun you, killing them would definitely stop that
