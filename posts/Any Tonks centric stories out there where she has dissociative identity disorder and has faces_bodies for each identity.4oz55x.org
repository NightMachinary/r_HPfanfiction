** I'm not touching on the medical debate down there... but there's a slash HP/DM that does this. Sorry if slash isn't to your taste... but rec'ing it for others who might be interested. (:

Edit - also gets super into the politics and policies of an anti-homosexual society, so be warned.

*** Really? You think you know exactly how DID would affect someone who has magic and has a malleable body due to being a metamorphmagus?

You don't think she might not subconsciously create new faces that match a more feminine personality versus a male body or just a butch appearance for a personality that presents as masculine?

So then how exactly would DID affect a metamorphmagus?

**** Having different dissociated self-states is not the same thing as feeling masculine one day or feeling feminine the next. What sort of pop-psych bullshit is this? BTW there's a word for that that /isn't/ a mental disorder. It's called being genderfluid.

  Dissociative identity disorder is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct or split identities or personality states that continually have power over the person's behavior. With dissociative identity disorder, there's also an inability to recall key personal information that is too far-reaching to be explained as mere forgetfulness. With dissociative identity disorder, there are also highly distinct memory variations, which fluctuate with the person's split personality.

  The "alters" or different identities have their own age, sex, or race.

  Dissociative identity disorder. Formerly known as multiple personality disorder, this disorder is characterized by alternating between multiple identities. A person may feel like one or more voices are trying to take control in their head. Often these identities may have unique names, characteristics, mannerisms and voices. People with DID will experience gaps in memory of every day events, personal information and trauma. Onset for the full disorder at can happen at any age, but it is more likely to occur in people who have experienced severe, ongoing trauma before the age of 5. Women are more likely to be diagnosed, as they more frequently present with acute dissociative symptoms. Men are more likely to deny symptoms and trauma histories, and commonly exhibit more violent behavior, rather than amnesia or fugue states. This can lead to elevated false negative diagnosis. - See more at: [[https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions/Dissociative-Disorders#sthash.wElbhoD3.dpuf]]

********** And I hope you know the difference between an identity/self-state and being an entire other person, and the way body dysphoria would play into the scenario you're envisioning

Still waiting on you and that BPD/DID readup though. Maybe spend a bit of time on dissociation itself while you're at it

I also wonder what the realistic severe infancy trauma Tonks is going to undergo in this fic is going to be

Honestly this is why I don't touch fics that claim to deal with mental illnesses or psychology with a ten-foot pole

*********** She's a Black that's been disowned by Bellatrix's family. She was still out of prison when Tonks was that age. Bella is insane torturer who was molested as a child herself(at least I believe that was canon). Who's to say she wouldn't do the same if given the chance.

************ Molested as a child? While that's a plausible headcanon where on earth is that canon?

And speaking of canon non-canon things, I'm preeetty sure Ted and Andromeda took measures to hide themselves. If Bellatrix could have found them (as per canon) she would. Then there's the psychology of a Bellatrix, who eats her food when she's done playing with it if she's not trying to get it to tell her where her +crush+ master is.
