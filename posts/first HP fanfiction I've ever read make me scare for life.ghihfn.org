** I now have this hilarious mental image of a very serious 10 year old sitting his mother down to give her "the talk" about internet safety and parental controls.

** I had a similar experience, luckily I got into HP at the age of 16, so damage was controllable. It did ruin my opinion on fanfiction for the time, but I eventually learned that there are novel-length beautiful ffs out there...

** Oh, stars. Brings back the memory of my first. Oneshot AU, Voldemort had won. I distinctly remember Harry being marched to his death, distended eyeball dangling against his face.

Couldn't hit back fast enough!

** I had a similar one when i was like 11. Kept thinking that it was sick and stuff and cuz of my insecurities couldn't even ask my parents. Surprisingly got the talk by watching ‚ÄúHow I Met Your Mother‚Äù instead of parents. üëå i still don't like though fics which are mainly about pairings and smut. Probably a everlasting trauma.

** Yep. My friend thought fanfic was a little off. Come to find out, the first (and therefore only) one she'd read had been some Harry/Voldemort BDSM non-con. I finally convinced her not all fanfics are like a horror movie meets 50 Shades.
