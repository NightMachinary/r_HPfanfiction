*Fate's Favourite*

By: The Fictionist

You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back

*Diablerie*

By: Oceanbreeze7

Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- /'Please God, let me live./

The Fox and The Stag (series)

By: KaedeRavensdale

The war against Voldemort is not going well and Dumbledore has concocted a desperate plan to better locate and destroy the Dark Lord's Horcruxes: traveling into an alternate timeline in order to gain the assistance of none other than Tom Riddle himself. Wanting to give him the chance to become something other than a Dark Lord, Harry agrees. He never could have expected the changes this decision would bring about in both of them.

*** Thanks I actually shared the prompt cause I hadn't read many fics like it and thought it would be a good idea I'll definitely read them!
