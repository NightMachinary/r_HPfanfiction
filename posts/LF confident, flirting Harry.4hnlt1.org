  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway, yet miraculously he lives. Even so, the question of how remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

*** I read that one. One of my favorite Harry/Fleur fics. I especially liked that James and Lily Potter were portrayed as real people with real problems instead of the saints that they usually are in HP fanfiction.

I guess it makes sense since people don't like talking ill about the dead but even in fics were they are alive they're portrayed to be this amazing one in a million couple and getting a different perspective on the relationship was nice.

I'm also not ashamed to admit that i liked the Lupin bashing. I really don't like that guy.

I really liked that fic. One of the few Veela bond stories that i actually enjoyed because it had believable reactions all around and even though the whole Merlin thing was a bit over the top it really only played a minor role, so i could live with it.

**** Yeah. Hope is his and is one of the best fanfics I've read partly because of the realistic reactions and partly because of the fact that he had the characters down to a tee. This one is a bit non realistic at the beginning, but the story as well as the writing improves considerably a couple of chapters in.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.

***** Hmm i'll give it a try after i finish with For Love of Magic, which i really like so far. It's the kind of fic that ruins everything similar simply by the way it plays with common tropes.

It's one of the best "Harry grows up slightly different" canon rehash fics i've read so far. The characters make sense and there's only a little bashing. I especially liked the way it deals with the Molly and Ginny. Mentioning the love potion and potter fortune thing that fanfic authors love to use and still keeping Molly in character as a loving mother above all else.
