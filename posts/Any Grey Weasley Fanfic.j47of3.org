Looking for fanfic where the Wesley's are a grey family, not all about pureblood but still not all light either. Not in the pocket of Dumbloredore but also still have issues with Malfoy family. Where Ron isn't prejudice against dark families. Just kinda of doing his own thing. Still friends with Harry and Hermione.

NO BASHING of any kind.

** So many tropes!

Can I recommend to you ^{A Big Happy Weasley Family} instead?
