There was never an explanation on how Fred and George came to figure out to say 'mischief managed' and 'I solemnly swear I am up to no good'. TBH I have no idea so I want to hear your theories.


** Rowling has stated that the map recognized them as fellow pranksters and "guided" them toward guessing the right passwords.

** I'm writing a story that includes the map helping them figure it out. (Sorry I haven't updated it for a while.)

  Fred and George Weasley are used to pulling pranks with a hairpin and pocketknife, but in their first year at Hogwarts, they find some extra help locked in a drawer in Filch's office. These characters are the property of J.K. Rowling.First Place Winner in the Honorary Marauder category in the Shrieking Shack Society's 2018 Marauder Medals. Thanks to everyone who voted!
