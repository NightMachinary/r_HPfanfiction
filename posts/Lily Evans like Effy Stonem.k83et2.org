A mauraders era fix where Lily has similar characterisation to Effy Stone, from skins.

For those of you who have never seen skins: manipulative, a bit of a mess, not in a good mental place, badass, sexy, rulebreaker but not obvious (she would rarely get detention, never pick on anyone, but commonly sneak out after curfew to wander the halls or go out in hogsmede, drinks and smokes underage, etc), likes having boyfriends, actually quite quiet but can argue when necessary, ruthless, befriends the weird person (snape), a riot, popular. Bit of a slytherin, tbh.

please someone have/write a fic with this characterisatio.
