While enjoying Christmas dinner in the third book, Professor Trelawney freaked out because she believed that, should she join the table, it would mean 13 people would be seated and so the first person to stand would be the first to die. What she didn't realize was that there were already 13 witches and wizards sat at the table, if you included Peter Pettigrew in Ron's pocket...

Dumbledore stood up to greet Trelawney, therefore making him the first of the 13 to get up from dinner. Sure, it could be a coincidence, or it could have been a nod about Dumbledore's fate from J.K. Rowling. Clever!

__

Due to the attention to detail we know JKR put into planning her stories (to certain extents) I wholly believe this is legit.

** There are a few cases where non-prophecy predictions that Trelawney makes turn out to be right after a fashion. It's definitely foreshadowing; as to whether it means Trelawney is less of a fraud than she seems, or if it's just a coincidence in-universe, that remaisn up to the reader.

*** She's not a fraud, she's just incredibly ill suited for teaching. Maybe being unstable and being prone to addiction comes with the territory of being a seer, but then maybe it would be better to not have actual seers as full time teachers (maybe they should be available as mentors for students showing some proficiency).

**** Well, Firenze does imply she's terrible at regular Divination. She also has the Sight, of course; her actual, "faints and then doesn't remember anything" Prophecies are the real thing; but that has nothing to do with her skill at the more mundane sort of prediction, which, if it exists at /all/, she clearly has no idea how to make.

**** What are you talking about? Maybe you misunderstood the post? Clearly Dumbledore died before Peter and Snape (and everyone else), therefore her prediction came true

** As far as I remember all predictions that were made came true but not in the way it was expected.

** Truth be told, all of Trelawney's predictions came true, but nobody believed her! After all, Harry did die (just not for good) and Umbridge really was in grave danger (the centaurs). Those are just the ones that come to mind.

** There's also some evidence that Ron had a bit of seer in him as well. He "knew" that Tom Riddle killed Myrtle (even though it was in jest, it was still foreshadowing by a character directly), Harry would inherit a large sum of gold (triwizard tourney and Sirius' death), and Harry is stabbed in the back by a friend (Ron himself during first part of book 4 and 7).
