  Fred and George end up back in time, break up the fight that would've killed Ariana Dumbledore, then watch Albus and Grindelwald leave without realizing just how much they've changed until they return to a twisted future. More detailed summary inside.

  Hermione is unexpectedly swept into a dystopian world of opposites where Dumbledore reigns as Dark Lord and Muggle technology and the Dark Arts have revolutionized Britain. A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM

*** What [[/u/YOB1997]] said, though I wouldn't call Hagrid "biased" as such: as far as we see, he never went after Slytherin students the way Snape went after Gryffindors; but it is true that it was Hagrid who badmouthed Slytherin to Harry early on. (Of course, he was mostly correct in his characterisation, but still...)

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
