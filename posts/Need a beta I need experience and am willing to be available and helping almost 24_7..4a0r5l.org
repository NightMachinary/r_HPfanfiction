There are some reasons why i want to do this.

One is that i fu**ing love HP fics, kinda addicted really, i've probably skimmed some hundreds(thousands?), read dozens and dozens and dozens and did a healthy amount of rereads since 2013.

But that's not the main reason, theres a few like improving my already waay above average english( for a foreigner) and learn other languages, also i want to start writing my own fics to learn about the writing process so i can start working online( like translation and transcription, i'll be doing other types of freelance work too). I believe this will also help me make contacts, always a plus.

Now, i must give some warnings if anyone is interested: I have few things i need to do during the week, every other weekend i may only be available for some hours. I am not a native english speaker, i'm Brazilian, BUT, i considered myself almost fluent some 5 years ago and plan on getting to that level again and better. So if you just need someone to spellcheck, fine by me, maybe later you will trust me to bounce ideas around. One slight problem is that my pc killed herself and i can only start doing real work monday at best and maybe 4 to 7 days at worst (i'm on mobile so please overlook the spelling mistakes, i'm better than that :). Until then anyone interested can just pm me or comment and later we can exchange contact information. Oh yeah, altough i have preferences on my readings i'm pretty much indiferent to any weird stuff you create, change, improve or borrow so that's not a problem.

Guess thats it, any questions just comment or pm me.


** I would love a beta, but two things:

- 1) The one I am writing is a Sherlock/Harry Potter murder mystery crossover. Is that alright? I know Sherlock fanfiction isn't everyone's cup of tea.

- 2) I don't need much help with spelling. Verb tenses and cutting back my run-on sentences are my issues. I also need a beta that is willing to tell me if something just plain sucks. I love bouncing ideas back and forth, though!

*** Sure, i think we can work together. My Sherlock lore and memories are kinda hazy, but since i can't start helping you for some days at least i can take this weekend to do some reading. Any suggestions on what i should focus that is more relevant to your story?

As soon as the new pc is ready i'll send you my e-mail, fanfic sites accounts and anything else you need.

**** That's awesome! Thank you! As long as you've seen the first season of the BBC Sherlock show, you should have a fine knowledge base for my story. My fic isn't set at any particular time in the Sherlock storyline, but it is several years after the seventh HP book. I'll be using Luna Lovegood, Hermione Granger, and Percy Weasley as my three main HP characters, but others will show up here and there.

PM me when you are ready, I'm in no rush! Thank you again! :)
