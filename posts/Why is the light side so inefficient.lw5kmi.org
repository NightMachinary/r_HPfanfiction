** You've read too much fanon

Lupin and Dumbledore are both cool with killing Death Eaters and it's established that also applies to the rest of the Order

*** That was all fanon? Honestly, that fooled me, because in canon it seemed like Death Eaters are never ending. For people that are fighting to kill, it really confuses me. If they really were trying to kill then why do the death eaters never seem to die?

** I understand your problem. Personally, so far, I haven't found any fic in which they use a variety of spells and eliminate the enemy very quickly, but I'm sure most of the people who are here have seen it longer.

In my opinion, this is mainly because a lot of people forget about various minor plots in the books, such as when Lupine gets mad at Harry that he literally waved a flag with his name in the face of the Death Eaters during the chase in the seventh part, maybe Harry didn't realize at the time. matters, but Expelliarmus was his trademark. Besides, it may not be mentioned in the words, but Dumbledore and the rest of the Order were ready to do whatever it takes to win, including killing. Now that I think about it in the fourth part, I think Sirius briefly mentions it when he describes the First Wizarding War.

I would like to read such fanfiction myself, so if someone gives a link and a well-constructed story, I will enjoy it.

** Because you read too many gray!Harry Dumbledore-bashing fics.

And in canon, the "light side" we see in fights is almost always composed entirely of teenagers who probably don't have it in them to take a life. They get hardened by the end of the war, but before then, they would have to be incredibly desperate to intentionally kill someone. And maiming someone isn't much easier to do.

In the DoM battle, we don't actually see what spells the Order members use, except for one instance of Tonks using a Stupify. And that one was entirely justified because it occurred right when they burst into the room, when there would be a higher chance of hitting one of the kids by accident. And she's an auror, so she would likely be trained to always incapacitate when possible, because law enforcement generally doesn't like immediately killing suspects.

And finally, even if the Order did only stun the Death Eaters, you have to remember that they are a vigilante group that still tries to mostly follow the law. Actual law enforcement might be willing to let their actions slide when the actual criminals are all incapacitated, but if they start killing people, they're going to have a bad time. It's the same reason Batman doesn't kill people.

Now if you want to argue that the captured Death Eaters should have been legally executed after they were captured, both after the first war and the DoM battle, then you might have a point. But remember that that would mean that Sirius would have been right there with them, and that Voldemort would have broken them out after the DoM before they had a chance to be executed anyway.

*** Yeah, true, but those teenagers you were referring to were at the start of the first wizarding war. I was more referring to Harry and his friends, where in canon all they were throwing around was stupefy. It takes around 5 seconds to point a wand and say Rennervate. Maybe I confused that with the Order, but still. If the Order was aiming to kill, then why are there still so many death eaters by book 7? It seemed like they were all there. Lestrange, Malfoy, Dolohov, and honestly, I couldn't remember any missing death eater names.

Yeah, but in a fight to the death, it makes no sense to shoot stunners when reviving is fast as fuck. For every death eater that's taken down, at least 2 is revived before that, so it's a pointless job.

Well, those death eaters broke into the ministry and people saw that. Trials aside, it still doesn't make any sense. I think Voldy didn't attack until June-July. That's one whole month for those trials and maybe tossing into the veil of death.

It's been a while since I've read canon though, so I'm not sure.

**** I was actually referring to Harry and his friends, who were teenagers at the start of the second war. They were stunning people in the DoM, but I already covered that in my previous comment.

Rabastan Lestrange, Crabbe, Mulciber, Jugson, and Avery were all in the DoM, and were never seen or mentioned afterwards, except in flashbacks. Nott was also there and was not seen again, but was later said to have "been caught at the Ministry," which is a bit ambiguous. And Voldemort had plenty of Death Eaters and other followers, especially by the end of the war. Harry didn't know who most of them were, so of course their deaths would go unnoticed.

One month is nowhere near enough time to execute someone, especially when the entire government was thrown into chaos from Voldemort's appearance, Fudge's resignation, Madame Bones's murder, and everything else that was happening. Especially since they could afford expensive lawyers to draw out the legal proceedings for as long as they needed. And even if everything else was pushed aside to convict them as soon as possible, that would just lead to Voldemort showing up sooner to free them. Because there's no way the entire thing could happen without Voldemort finding out.

** The light side were losing the first war because Voldemort at the time was extremely dangerous, cunning and charismatic.

It is true that the ministry allowed using of the Unforgivables at the time, but I guess it was too late by then, he just got too powerful.

If there wasn't that unexpected incident where he was vanquished, he would have caused the same trouble as Grindelwald. If he left the Potters alive, he would have won the war. I believe Harry becoming the horcrux was the very thing that was his doom. His arrogance and obsession with him were his own suicide. Even after his return during Triwizard Tournament, if Voldemort left Harry Potter alone, he would have won the war. Harry was 50,60 years his junior and there was no chance he could best him in a duel. Their duel cannot be compared to the duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald which, in my opinion, was fueled with emotions of love, rage and betrayal. I would not have been surprised if Grindelwald actually let him win.

It was a smart move during the second war to deny his return, he took over the ministry quickly with the help of his spies and imperioused people. At that time nobody knew what to do. Dumbledore was already dying and probably losing his mind, the Daily Prophet wrote how Harry was insane, an attention seeking liar which lost the Saviors' credibility. People simply had nobody to turn to. People flock to charismatic, well-spoken and intelligent leaders for a reason. Voldemort started losing his mind, especially towards the end, he was absolutely insane and his followers probably sensed it as well. They did not have a cause, a common goal, there was just chaos. Voldemort didn't listen to anyone. He killed himself.

** I think you could defend the Order's conduct in the Ministry battle in OotP from a strategic point of view. At that point they're still in conflict with the government as much as with Voldemort. Using violent spells could put Order members in a position where the Ministry puts them on trial, as they did with Harry at the start of the book. Even if they have a self-defence argument, it would still consume lots of time and they might be imprisoned pre-trial.

** Because, as I explained to my nephew when he was saying we should just kill all the people who hate our countrymen, as the so-called "good guys" there are things we don't do. To be more like them, we become them.

It would also have made the war even more horrific. Somebody who knows they face the Kiss and/or life in Azkaban has nothing to lose: they will fight even more viciously because victory is the ONLY acceptable outcome. They will not surrender even when outnumbered, even if ultimately they face certain defeat, and at that point will concentrate on taking as many with them as they can and go down fighting.

And, even though you said you don't want a discussion of the Unforgiveables, I'm going to mention them. In the previous war, the so-called Light lost all moral high ground when they approved the use of Unforgiveables for aurors: either a spell is acceptable or it is not. Something that is considered so bad that it's immediate life in Azkaban, no mitigation or parole considered, is not justifiable. The basis of the Unforgiveables is that you have to mean them: for the killing curse, /you intend for the person to die,/ for the Cruciatus, you want them to suffer. That's never going to be a defensive move because it takes away all due process. After all, it was said that the Imperius curse was widely used: there's no way to tell if the person attacking others was acting under their own free will.
