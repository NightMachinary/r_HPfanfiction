Why does this class take 5-7 years? They don't have to learn the physics or math involved, they just look through telescopes and make star charts. This class should only take 1, maybe 2 years tops to teach.

Also, the only relevance astronomy has to the magical world is astrology, a subject taught during 5th year divination. Does it really it really make sense to put all students through 5 years of useless class just for the benefit of the few who want to pursue divination?


** Educational institutions keeping up the teaching of horribly outmoded disciplines out of a sense of tradition is, and has long been a thing. My university insisted on teaching /ius civile/ along with its law degrees. To this day I have no idea what that was in aid of, other than ensuring that as well as being qualified to practise in England and Wales I was sorted if I should by some mischance find myself before the courts of 4th Century Byzantium.

***** It was an English law advice, but it was one of those rare occasions where there was literally no case law.

There were two problems with the Romalpa line of cases.

Firstly, all the relevant retention of title case law concerned goods provided for use in manufacturing, to be mixed with other goods to produce a new chattel. But the factual scenario I was dealing with was simply affixing one chattel to another.

Secondly, all the relevant retention of title case law either dealt with situations where the mixed goods could either be easily separated out, or it was utterly impossible to separate them. My factual scenario, however, was that it was possible but expensive to remove the chattel so affixed.

The best I could come up with in the cases was a single obiter comment about chattels joined together.

Traditional secondary sources were not much help either - Halsbury's gave the answer in terms of analogy with land law, where fixing a chattel on land accedes the chattel to the land, but it seemed to me that land law was not the appropriate place to look for an answer concerning only chattels. Tolley's gave an accurate summary of the ambiguities in the law but no solution to them. PLC played its favourite trick of giving an answer but providing no authority for it.

So in the end I was forced to resort to academic commentary on retention of title, which framed the clauses in terms of Roman law concepts of accession/confusion. There was also some Australian and Singaporean case law of limited assistance.

Ultimately, in practical terms, the Roman law concepts came to a similar result to the case law on mixed goods, but a different result to that of land law.

Needless to say, the final advice to the client was full of caveats.

****** The scholarship underlying the training of most of the lawyers that wrote it, yes. That's a long, long, way from the laws of the late Roman Republic being any kind of useful guide to interpretation of an EU Regulation from 2003. The thing is, English law of the present day is almost completely unrecognisable to a lawyer from its roots in the time of Henry II, and that's only a gap of just over 800 years. Learning about /ius civile/ from 50BC to 589 CE helps with EU law just about as much as learning about manorial copyholds of the late medieval period does with section 70 (1)(g) of the Land Registration Act 1925.

And if that last bit is giving law students the piss shivers, tough. I had to suffer, so do you.

** Many fanfics incorporate the idea that Astronomy is useful for knowing when to harvest certain potion ingredients ("picked on a new moon while Mars is in Scorpio" or somesuch) and/or when to perform certain rituals for maximum effect.

I agree that teaching students how to interpret a star chart shouldn't take more than a year or two at most. Realistically speaking, most wizards don't even need to know that much. They should just be able to consult the equivalent of the farmers almanac published by more knowledgeable wizards who do that sort of thing for a living. Thus, Astronomy would make more sense as an elective rather than a core class.

** Hogwarts was founded 1000 years before the time of the books. The Statute of Secrecy was implemented 300 years before the time of the books. For the other 700 years, MOST PHYSICISTS WERE WIZARDS. The same people trying to figure out gravity were the ones trying to transform lead into gold. For thousands of years, the most learned of humanity was trying to figure out the rules that governed our reality (science), and what it took to break them (magic). What I find remarkable is that muggle chemistry isn't its own subject, taught in partnership with Potions, Transfiguration, and Alchemy. Same applies to Biology/Biochem/Medicine to be taught with Potions and Herbology.

*** Even the people who want to help muggles seem to look down on muggles somewhat I think so why would they feel the need to incorporate these? Especially considering that I feel like the universal laws of muggles and magicals is different because of magic. From smaller things to whole branches of learning.

** ¨shrugs¨ No, it doesn't (though as uses go, on top of Divination, there is also the potential use of interplanetary material in Potions; I could imagine Moon dust, or this or that Venusian mineral, being useful in the more exotic and expensive potions). Hogwarts is just /a bit weird,/ if you haven't noticed.

My headcanon answer for this is that back in the day, wizards developed advanced telescopes much more quickly than Muggles, and so stargazing was an ostentatious way of flaunting your magic and became the "in"-est hobby among purebloods. It found its way on the Hogwarts curriculum by way of Professor Salazar Slytherin, who taught it back in the day. And it is against the Hogwarts charter to remove a course decided by one of the Founders, whether or not it's of any use anymore.

** I think it is house of potter rebuilt by disobediencewriter that claims one minister really liked astronomy and was saddened that there weren't more people pursuing it. So to fix this he passes a law mandating it become a core course before that it was just an elective. That's been my favorite explanation I've come across

** I feel like it's a case similar to muggle schools that kept teaching Latin and Greek long after there was any practical value to it. This isn't really canon magic, but in earlier eras, astronomy was plausibly more valuable for timekeeping, potionmaking, and for things like rituals performed at stone circles, which are often astronomical calendars.

One especially JKR-esque application would be the witches' potion in /Macbeth/, one of the ingredients of which is, "slips of yew sliver'd in the moon's eclipse." If you have to perform one of the steps during an eclipse, you have to be able to predict eclipses, which requires very complex astronomy (and arithmancy).

What I want to know is how and why the course includes material that was only discovered by 20th-century science, like the fact that Io has volcanoes, or that Europa is covered in ice ("not mice!").

*** To be honest, I would not be surprised if in the HP universe the moon is made of cheese. Keeping that a secret from the Muggles was becoming rather tiresome with all their moon landings, having to obliviate the astronauts and switch out their moon cheese with fake "moon rocks". That's why the wizards arranged for funding for the space program to be cut.

** The only idea I have about this is that maybe astronomy class doesn't meet very often/regularly/for a long class period, since it takes place in the middle of the night and students need their sleep. So whatever curriculum there is would be stretched out.

I vaguely remember them meeting once a week on Wednesdays or something in SS. *shrugs*

Personally I don't understand how people can take a whole semester of typing class. I learned in like two weeks of sporadic practice one summer when I was in middle school.

** In my headcanon Astronomy also teaches the basics of magical theory, the course being guided by Claudius Ptolemy's writings. I also tend to combine him with Ptolemy the Gnostic and have Gnosticism heavily influence magical theory/theology, which provides a bit more historical background for the decision to keep the courses combined.

** You can assume it's useless but that doesn't mean it is. We saw very little class time in the series, we don't know for sure what's going on where. We do know that at the beginning of 6th year every class began nonverbal magic, to me this speaks to a greater unified curriculum divided amongst the subjects.

It's always frustrating when people assumed incompetency in the answer to anything they don't understand. You said the only relevancy is in astrology but that's definitely not true. Werewolves turn at the moon, why? I don't know but I'd bet Hogwart's students do. Even if they never explicitly learned that lesson they'd think back to when they studied the effects the lunar calendar has on curses. Or perhaps on transformations since the fluxseed in the Polyjuice potion has to be picked at the full moon. Veritaserum requires a full lunar cycle to brew.

There are probably thousands of little things like that continually taking place. "No, no, no! You don't want to plant cabbages while Mars is in retrograde, you'll attract Gnomes."

** Very little. Even if you go with the Fanfiction reading Lunar Cycles for ingredients that can only be harvested at that point, and minor Divination, there's no reason it has to be done at Midnight given that Enchanted Ceilings weren't exactly a stretch for the Founders, and there's no reason it should take 5 Years for the OWL. It could be done in a year to OWL Level, or could be an elective.

*** Some modern societies are based on the prospect of protecting the members from invaders, ensuring domestic tranquility and/or fulfilling the will of the official God. Magical society is based on the requirement that 'magic must be kept secret'. To that end, its citizens are taught how to manage magical beasts that may not care about abiding by that secret, and how to deal with the effects of magic on non-magicals that would need to be removed from non-magical attention.

Defence Against the Dark Arts isn't a fighting class. It's civil service training.

** My headcanon says it used to teach you all about the Olde Magic of the Earth Druids of the North, from back in the days before wands existed. But the magic was based more in myth and the Olde Gods then it was in modern incantations; it used blood sacrifice and borrowed power to get things done, so it was banned by the ministry a few centuries ago to prevent abuse. However, Astronomy was in the Hogwarts Charter, so it couldn't be discontinued, and now kids stay up into the night to look at the stars.
