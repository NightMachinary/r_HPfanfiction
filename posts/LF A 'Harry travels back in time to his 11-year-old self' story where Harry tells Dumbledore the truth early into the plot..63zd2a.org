Most every time travel plot I've seen where Harry goes back to his younger-self's body has him avoiding telling Dumbledore that he's from the future, despite how useful his help in getting the Horcruxes, apprehending Pettigrew and freeing Sirius, et-cetera, would be.

Usually there's a justification, either 'Dumbledore is a manipulative evil bastard who likes to wipe memories' or 'the Unspeakables would have a field day if they found out', but I'm getting a bit bored with it.

So, does anyone know any Peggy Sue stories where Harry /does/ tell Dumbledore about himself when it becomes reasonably possible for him to do so?

Side note; White Squirrel's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]] is a good fic with a similar concept, though it's got a baby Hermione instead of an 11-year-old Harry, and the plot is resolved quickly rather than having twists and turns, it's basically a one-shot.

And the last chapter of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11136995/5/Potter-Ever-After][Potter Ever After]] has fun completely destroying the time travel plot by letting Harry tell Dumbledore everything.


** linkffn(6452481)

It's a pretty cracky fic, but it does fit that one requirement.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

- Them deciding to leave Sirius in Azkaban for some poorly stated reason and consoling each other for having to do that without doing anything at all to alleviate his condition. Given that OP mentions freeing Sirius, I'm not sure they'd much appreciate a fic that doesn't free Sirius.

****** I totally agree. I ABSOLUTELY HATED that Year 2.

On the other hand, the author admitted that was a STUPID move by her characters, and they started moving away from the timeline afterwards.

Once Voldemort took Harry's blood, things went completely AU.

Year 5 and Year 6 were the most enjoyable parts of that story.

So despite my severe misgivings about its early plot, this story remains one of my favorites and I keep recommending it.

[[/spoiler][Additionally, although I'm not entirely certain as to how snake biology works, I'm pretty sure a snake's venom would be in venom glands and not the fangs, so a basilisk would be the same. If that's the case, I'm not sure if a basilisk's fang would have venom for very long after it's taken from the basilisk. Plus, I think the basilisk would only have two fangs, although I'm not entirely sure if that would matter at all.]]

** If you like Snarry (Severus/Harry slash) I recommend Shaping the Future by Charmed Artist on fanfiction. Harry is hit by a spell from Voldermort that should kill him, but it sends him back in time I think 5 years maybe to 1996, but he remains an adult. There are now 2 Harry's in the world. He totally takes charge of the Order and everything. Develops a relationship with Snape. Takes power from Dumbledore. Very awesome.

Another one I loved is another Snarry called Crumbling Pedestal by Shivani on fanifiction's website. Harry goes WAAAYYY back in time and spends years with the founders of Hogwarts, then goes back to present time as an adult under an assumed name. (Young Harry is in the timeline older Harry returns to, but not really in the story.) Snape eventually figures out he's Harry. I don't remember exactly what happens with Dumbledore or Voldermort, but I do remember it was a very cool story.

In To Shape and Change by Blueowl on fanfiction, Harry at age 19 sends Snape back in time to a month before Harry starts his first year at Hogwarts. The goal is for Snape to mentor Harry (no slash) and help Harry defeat Voldermort. Another very good one. Snape doesn't tell anyone he's from the future, but he does his best to influence events.

I know these don't all meet the "tell Dumbledore" component, but I think all 3 are very good.
