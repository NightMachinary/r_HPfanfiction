One where Harry takes off from the Dursleys and starts hanging out at some inn on Knocturn Alley. He slowly discovers there is a whole subculture surrounding Purebloods and 'Dark Magic', and he is shocked about how different it is than what he thought the whole thing was about. He really gets into it, and takes a fake identity. His name was something Peverell. Ares, maybe? I don't recall. That fic was amazing, and it became abandoned just as the story was picking up steam.

The second one I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I remember loving it. I think Harry inherited Voldemort's memories? Or the horcrux in his scar became friendly and somehow merged with him? In any case, Harry was like a mini-Tom Riddle, but the... you know... the non-evil sociopath version. Eventually, Dumbledore starts thinking Harry is possessed by Voldemort, or something of that sort. He summons him into his office and stuns him. That's the last scene in the fic. It was never updated after that, at least the last time I checked.
