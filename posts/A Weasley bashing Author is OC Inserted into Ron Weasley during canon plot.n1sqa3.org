Someone who really hates the Weasleys, is a massive Weasley basher and writes all horrible "Ron the Death Eater" "Molly the Love Potion Mistress" and "Slag Ginny" fics wakes up one morning... as a child Ron Weasley. Outside of the Traumatic moments from the Twins (The Weasleys that ironically deserve the most bashing but get the least. They caused Ron to have a crippling fear of Spiders "JUST A PRANK BRO" and nearly forced him into actually dying by trying to trick him into making an unbreakable vow) and Percy being a bit stuck up, he finds out just how wrong he was.


** at first he acts like a massive prick to his family.

then he gets into a massive problem and feels so much guilt when the entire family rallies behind him no questions ask.

he then gets sent back to our world into his old body and writes fanfics where ron is the main charcter

** Ron bashers are truly the fucking worst... Even though I don't really care about the character at all... In fact, all bashers are really bad and makes me stop reading the fic any further.

** One thing to note about the twins: the spider thing happened when they were five via accidental magic, and the vow event happened when they were seven. Bashing them for events that occurred when they were in single-digits is a bit ridiculous.

*** You're right, the spider incident was an accident, however their attempt to make an Unbreakable Vow wasn't. The twins went out of their way to learn such advanced and dangerous magic and most likely stole the wands needed to make the spell work. Not only did they put in a lot of effort into what they were doing, they also manipulated Ron to go along with it.

They also beat Ron's pet puffskein to death when they wanted to use it as a bludger. This information was included in the /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/ book Rowling wrote in 2001. It doesn't mention any ages but I'm guessing the twins were in the single digits. Just because they're children doesn't mean they shouldn't be held accountable for their actions.

**** I... rather think that is the point of being children, actually. Certainly not to the extent that adults would be held to.

***** I'm not saying that Fred and George should be put on trial, what I'm saying is that these events shouldn't be dismissed as bashing material since it exemplifies how mean, cruel and sadistic the twins were, which is the point of character bashing- to magnify and exaggerate a character's bad traits. Other example of their mean, cruel and sadistic behavior include shoving Montague into the vanishing cabinet and threatening to sodomize Zacharias Smith, both occurring in Book 5.

****** There's a bit of justification for the vanishing cabinet, seeing as how book 5 marks the transition from "random bigot" to "enemy combatant" at some point, but I'll give you that one, it's still a bit muddied. The Zacharias smith thing isn't really a good example though, "Shove it up your ass" is a fairly common insult IRL and it hardly ever means anything.

I understand the concept of bashing, I'm not directly opposed to the concept (although I'm not very likely to read a fic that purports it as one of its main features), my point is that you're changing the character more than you think you are by doing so.
