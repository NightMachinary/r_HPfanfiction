** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/Incorruptible-The-Dementor-s-Stigma][Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma]] by Matt Silver. Easily the best story I've ever read.

It's au pre epilogue. It has all the elements of a great horror story, a mystery thriller, and some of the best politics I've seen. The quality is top notch and it's 264k words and doesn't waste a single one. The St. Mungos scene (a noodle incident that actually gets screen time) is my single favorite scene in fanfiction. The imagery throughout, the story, especially the tree memorial, is perfectly detailed. Harry isn't a super hero, and the author doesn't baby him. It is just awesome.

Edit: If you have read this story, or are going to now, tell me how you like it please!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade Cause by Silens Cursur]]

everyone is human, even the bad guys, some fairly interesting ideas, written pretty well, and it's honks as an added bonus

also has some of the best written OC's I've ever read. kemester is one of my favorite characters of all time

edit: warning for /lots/ of pretty graphic violence, and other squeamish stuff (implications of rape at the end of ch 18) but there are warnings at the beginning of every chapter for this sort of stuff. since i didn't mention it: this story is pretty gritty and dark, and i wouldn't recommend it for the faint of heart.

**** ..I don't /think/ so. It's been a good 8-10 months, and I read it over the course of three days, so things are a bit fuzzy. I'm pretty sure the tragedy just refers to the general tone of the story - it's pretty dark. It's a sort of story where the good guys win at the end, but you kinda question if it was really worth it after all.

edit: actually, chapter 18 has implications of rape, and its pretty lurid. i'd forgotten how uncomfortable the writing could make me feel at times :x chapters have warnings at the top, telling you when there's scenes of graphic violence and sexual stuff etc so you can avoid it if you so choose

#+begin_quote
  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
#+end_quote

I, personally, think this is the best fem!Harry there is. Its also the most entertaining fanfiction I think I've ever read. Intriguing plot, nice characters and I have no god damn clue where the story is going - something really rare and *really* satisfying in a pretty stale fandom.

Read it. You won't regret it.

** Definitely [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] by Taure. Perfect spelling, grammar and punctuation. Very well flowing prose. Good exploration of magical theory and very realistic characters. It's one of my 5 favourite fics, and I hope that the author will start posting the sequel soon.

  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.

**** That's the one! It's the perfect mix of emotional baggage, just the right amount of humor and happiness for a post-war setting, and romance that doesn't go overboard and take over the entire plot, without letting the realistic completely drown out the magical aspect. Far too many post-war fanfic authors put too much emphasis on romance that they complete forget the world in which they write.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9322278/1/Black-Bond][Black Bond]] by CentaurPrincess is my favourite story to date.

#+begin_quote
  An eight year-old Harry Potter comes across Acquila Black, a girl at his school, only to realise that he shares a strange connection with her. And when Sirius Blacks escapes Azkaban, how will he help his godson and daughter in defeating the darkest wizard of all times? (Year three in progress) (Chapters 12-20 under revision)
#+end_quote

It's the best-written "Sirius's Daughter" story that I know of as well, also a non-romanticized and realistic soul bond fic.

Acquila and her mother are OCs.

It's about Harry and Acquila(Sirius Black and Athena McKinnon's daughter), Acquila is sent to live in an orphanage in Surrey, she's treated well, it's not a sob-story. The two of them meet at muggle school and... well, I'd better not spoil it.

There isn't any OoC and there's fantastic character development. The first year of Hogwarts is a bit similar to canon but it diverts.

The story went on hiatus in April due to the authors' (there's two of them) exams but they said

#+begin_quote
  it won't come before June, I'm afraid

So I'm excited.

*** I've read about 10 chapters now,and I don't know how I feel. The grammar and writing is fine, but certain plot elements just tick me off/don't make sense.

Why does Acquilia care so much about Draco? Her reasoning makes absolutely no sense. In every single conversation with Draco, he has been a complete bigot, with no redeemable qualities....

Further, she just assumes that Draco is okay, deep down, when there has been no evidence to support that. "Oh, he's my cousin, he wants me to be a part of his family. No one ever wanted me to be a part of their family...." Except for, you know, Harry, and The Tonkses... who , ya know, actively fought to get guardianship of you....

I'll keep reading, but these scenes are really starting to hurt the overall value..

Edit: Literally after posting this, I read the next section, and it too hurt my head. Acquillia is literally OP. It's like the 4th week of first term, and she's performing third year spells, and is now getting training for wandless magic. As a first year..... Who grew up in a muggle orphanage..... WTF?

**** It explains things later. I'll admit, I gave up on it around that point too, and then I came back a couple months later and got hooked.

I believe what CentaurPrincess said was that because Acquila had never known any family, she was clinging to Draco, despite how rude he is.

It gets better further along.

AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

I cannot even begin to describe how good this is, probably my all time favourite fic and it's only getting started.
