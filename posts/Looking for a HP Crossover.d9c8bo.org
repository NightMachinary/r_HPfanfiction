It was one of those "magicals leave the Earth" types. There was some kind of intense radiation and flooding that was hitting the Earth, so they started living and building spaceships underground to limit the damage. They later found a potion that resisted the effects but it got worse. They eventually left. I think there was something that said they couldn't return for at least 150 years.

That's all I remember, any ideas?


** Found it!

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.
