*** I'm not sure why "song fics" aren't allowed, but i'm grateful. Seeing that flashed me back to fanfic of 1998 where it was in every story. Other than the lyrics, the story was alright. I didn't see any spelling errors and it was coherent, but there wasn't really anything pulling me in to make me really crave a second chapter. Keep working at it.

**** I'm sorry that you didn't find what you expected. I personally have an aversion to lyrics in the middle of a story, it is just jarring to me. It takes me out of the story, sort of like the POV issues that have been discussed in other threads. Maybe we should have bypassed your thread, but then you would have wondered why it had no responses. Can't take it back now. All I can add is that writing is a muscle and if you keep writing you will find out what works and what doesn't. Every story isn't going to appeal to everyone, and that's ok.

****** As far as the collaborative part you were looking for, maybe check out one of the writing subreddits? They can help you identify specifically what bits are and aren't working so you grow as a writer. You have to keep in mind that people on this subreddit have been reading fanfic forever and have seen it all done before.

** A pretty good read, well written, but not my thing. Still, keep up the good work
