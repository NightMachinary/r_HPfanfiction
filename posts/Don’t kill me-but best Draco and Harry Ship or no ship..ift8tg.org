It doesn't have to be a romantic pairing! I'm all for drarry (I know, I know, how dare I?) -but I'm also into them just being friends, comrades, grudgingly helping each other out, or anything else. Everything I find just seems a little to fluffy. I definitely don't mind a bit of fluff here and there-but I'm trying to find something a little more “realistic”. I've probably read most of the classics but you never know! If there are any gritty, political, or even war time stories that anyone could suggest that would be awesome! The longer the better. Thank you for any recommendations!!!


** Non-ship Harry and Draco ... "friendship" isn't quite the right word. They are colleagues and partners in a job that must be kept secret from almost everybody.

  Why did Harry Potter nod in greeting to Draco Malfoy when he saw the man on the platform 19 years later? Ron and Hermione were clearly not on such terms with the man. What secret did the two men share from even their own families?

** Is Drarry unpopular here? It's been a while since I read a couple of these, but my absolute favorite is Forgive Those Who Tresspass. Definitely recommend if you like dark, gritty fics (it's pretty heavy though, so heed the tags!)

** Draco grows into a different person (for compelling, if somewhat disturbing, in-story reasons) in the linkffn(Innocent) series and ends up in Harry's circle of friends, but it's only a small thread in book 1, which is half a million words, and becomes more significant in later books, so if you're just after Harry/Draco it may not be the best choice. Great series though.

Astra Inclinant by eleventy7

This story is mainly about James Sirius and Scorpius but it also has Draco and Harry being friends. It covers second-gen's all 7 years of Hogwarts and J.S and S's evolving relationship. I cried so much reading this. It doesn't just wave away Draco's death eater past, so Scorpius has to deal with his dad's history and bullies and it's not sunshine and rainbows. Plus Draco tries to be a good dad but the only example he has is Lucius Malfoy so...

  Set during the Christmas break of Harry's fifth year.Harry can't sleep, so he takes a walk and ends up bumping into Draco Malfoy. Verbal jabs are exchanged but then things start to get deep, and they both find out more than they intended about the other.

** There are some really wonderful Drarry fics out there. My favorite fic ever - het/slash/gen/whatever - is The Man Who Lived. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621]]. Not sure it counts as “gritty” but it's long, moving, sometimes very funny, and sometimes emotionally brutal.

Evitative [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461]] is a well-written Harry is resorted into Slytherin fic. Has some Drarry hinted at but really focuses more on their growing friendship.

The Blood Magic series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1068473]]. Very angsty, endgame Drarry, with Harry a drug addict and Draco fighting PTSD after the war.

I have others but not sure this is the type of thing you're looking for.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/390301][astolat]] definitely has the most realistic Drarry I've read. The characterization is amazing.

My favourites are linkao3(Timeshare by astolat; Reparatio by astolat; House Proud by astolat; Unseen by astolat; Slithering by astolat).

  “It's not for long,” Hermione said. “By the time we get back to Hogwarts, the Unfettering Brew will be ready.”“Listen to you!” Ron said. “He's got to get through a month with the Dursleys and a month at Malfoy Manor. With Draco Malfoy.”“Yeah, thanks,” Harry said, because he hadn't just spent the last week contemplating just how much more horrible his summer holidays were about to be than they'd ever been before.

  Draco snorted. “I'm not reduced to penury. I want something considerably beyond money, and I rather think you're the only one can give it to me.” “You want the Invisibility Cloak,” Harry said, flatly. He'd half expected as much; it was the only thing he had that Draco could want---“Don't be stupid, Potter,” Draco said. “I want my reputation back.”

Some other fave Draco fics of mine, but you've probably read most of them or they're more on the fluffy side: linkao3(Tea and No Sympathy; Running on Air; All Our Secrets Laid Bare; The Bucket List by GallaPlacidia; A Hag, a Hex, a Tale of Redemption; Nearly Lost Things, Carefully Tended)
