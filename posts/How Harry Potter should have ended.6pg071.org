Voldemort and Harry are having their duel, they both have one last go, their spells hit each other at the same time, they both collapse and slowly die, truly marking each other as their equal. Ron and Hermione surround Harry. He grants Ron the resurrection stone that in this version he doesn't use it, and allows him to bring back Fred. And he gives Hermione the Elder Wand so she can perform even better spells with that brain of hers. As he dies he tells them to look into his memories by taking his tears. As this happens Voldemort tells Bellatrix to kill the two of them but before she can, Ginny Weasley stands her ground and kills her once and for all. Ron and Hermione run to Dumbledores office and look into Harrys memories to see that after all Snape was his Father and had shared a passionate 2 minutes together alone at the boathouse after Ron and Hermione had left. After this the two of them run to the courtyard where Hagrid is carrying Harry to be buried but before he is placed in his grave, they get Snapes body and bury them together and mark the tombstone as Father and Son. Many years later it shows the Weasley family sitting together having a Christmas dinner with Fred and Hermione laughing along with the rest of the family with a portrait of Harry in the background in which the camera zooms into before it fades to black and ends.

** It's not an unreasonable ending, but not really more interesting than canon.

One ending that would have been interesting to see would be Voldemort being on the brink of taking over the world to begin his eternal reign of terror, while the protagonists are scrambling to find Atlantis, which is their last hope for something, anything to defeat him. When they find Atlantis, they do find something: a capacity to simply turn off magic, everywhere in the world, forever, irreversibly.

Do they do it, stopping Voldemort once and for all at the cost of losing something so precious and taking it from everyone else? Or, do they keep the magic, hoping against hope that Voldemort can be defeated in some other way?

*** Do I detect a HPMOR reader here? Having a "Source of Magic" located in Atlantis is certainly reminescent of that.

**** That particular fanon/headcanon long predates HPMOR.

****** Can't think of one off the top of my head; but I do recall reading fics with Atlantis before HPMOR.

FFnet search seems to offer at least some, but that's only those that offer it in title or description: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/search/?ready=1&keywords=Atlantis&categoryid=224&genreid1=0&genreid2=0&languageid=0&censorid=0&statusid=0&type=story&match=&sort=&ppage=1&characterid1=0&characterid2=0&characterid3=0&characterid4=0&words=0&formatid=0]] .

For that matter, I suspect that LessWrong was at the very least inspired by the /Vision of Escaflowne/ anime in that respect.
