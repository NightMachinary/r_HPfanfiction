Yeah, I just want some action. (And perhaps I want to see Lockhart make a fool of himself - honestly, he should've really gone in with Harry...)


** It's not a really a fight but I liked the Perfectly Normal series linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6027559/chapters/15754498):]]

  Harry's been learning about pure-blood culture, with Pansy's help, and trying to blend in as an ordinary wizard. But will all his attempts at seeming normal be ruined when they find out he can speak to snakes? His Slytherin friends take the news differently than the Gryffindors.

Probably not what you're asking for, but it /is/ an alternative CoS encounter and it /is/ great. Well-known, of course, but just in case someone wants an alt encounter and hasn't read it; it's a Ginny-dies fic with my favorite characterizations of the three friends together (especially Ron), although sadly incomplete.

  Hermione Granger is special. She has always known it, really, even before she received her letter. It was too bad that she had never met anyone as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to Hogwarts. And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed. Obsessive!Hr, Slytherin!HHr
