this is with assumption that she is the GWL otherwise fem!harry is fine

The whole starts with thing with the prophecy :

born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark *him* as his equal, but *he* will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will ...

the fact that the pronoun is masculine is a pretty big detail that i dont think voldemort would overlook then there is the part where i dont see him as seeing her as equal or posing a threat to him by virtue of him being born before ww2 when modern sexism was the societal norm

like i can see fem!harry working if she is not the GWL but otherwise it just doesnt fit


** I mean, if the author is already writing an AU where Harry is born female, there is no reason they can't rewrite the prophecy to have she/her/hers pronouns. Seems silly to me to go "damn the canon prophecy says 'mark /him/ as his equal', guess I can't make fem!harry the chosen one."

As for Voldemort not seeing a girl as a threat, the only reason he thinks of Harry as a threat is because he thinks the prophecy refers to Harry.

*** It would be like saying you can't have femharry AU because Hagrid tells harry that he's a wizard and not a witch

** Eh, masculine pronouns were once considered to be the default pronoun and, while I cannot recall an instance, I feel like JKR did that with wizard, but I could be wrong.

He didn't see anyone but Albus Dumbledore as an equal, which had nothing to do with his gender. And, if talented enough, he would definitely see women as a threat. He killed Amelia Bones and Dorcas Meadows personally. Furthermore, Bella was his most prized lieutenant.

*** bones and meadows becasuse they were politically powerful and bella because she was basically harley quinn to his joker and again dumblerdore said that ot could have been either harry or neville but harry was chosen because voldemort could relate to him more as a halfblood i would think that he would relate more to neville in the case of fem!harry

**** He might well relate more to Neville, except that (as mentioned above) most writers who go with fem!Harry (or, at least, the "always-a-girl" ones) also adapt the prophecy to have she/her pronouns, and it therefore does not apply to Neville.

** I mean it is fanon, you can easily change the prophecy around to use female pronouns.

Plus, the only reason he went after Harry, and not Neville, who was a Pureblood, was because he thought Harry would be the bigger threat.

Seems kind of silly to me, thinking you can't make Harry a female and Girl Who Lived, just because of the pronouns.

I also don't see why he'd assume someone wasn't threatening just because they were the opposite gender, I don't see Voldemort worrying about something like that.

** Until recently male pronoun was commonly used when the gender of the object was not known. Certainly it was still true in 1990s' UK. End of the story.

Otherwise, most fem!Harry stories have the prophecy suitably modified (or they claim to Voldemort that Harriet is out of the hook, because of being female suddenly ... linkao3(4876630)).

** Couple things about that:

1. Snape, and thus Voldemort, only heard up to "born as the seventh month dies," and he therefore doesn't know that the prophecy refers to a male.

2. The prophecy is self-fulfilling. It doesn't, in itself, have any power, but the fact that Voldemort believes it means that he'll never stop seeing the subject, or the person he believes to be the subject, as a threat, and thus will never stop hunting them until they're dead.
