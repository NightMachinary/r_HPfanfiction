:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I wanna read this fic again. It's basically MoD!Harry travelling to an alternate dimension stuck in the body of a cat and getting picked up by Peter Parker. It's an avengers crossover. Also, he gets turned back after a while by Loki in the battle of New York. Can anyone help?


** Im not sure if this is it but its the closest I could find to what you're looking for

  Being a cat is easy. Eat, Sleep and be better than everyone because you're a cat. But what happens when the cat happens to be a witch stuck in a feline body, and runs into the one man on the planet with major anger management issues that cause wide-scale destruction? Meet Bruja, the Hulk's pet kitty...and a bigger troll than Loki could hope to be.
