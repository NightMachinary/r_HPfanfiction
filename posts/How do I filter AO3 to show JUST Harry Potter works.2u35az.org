** Are you excluding the fandoms with the Search within results bar? Here's an example. [[http://i.imgur.com/rVdULQ3.jpg][Example image.]]

The blue highlighted part has a space in between the first and second words so a quotation is used to count it as one phrase. The minus will exclude whatever follows it, which can be used for whatever fandoms you want.

**** Yeah, I've had around 60 for a few weeks now.

I opened a community on ff.net and am the only staff so finding and personally checking quality falls on me.

***** You need to delegate. But I have been in the same position. I was making a masterlist of recs and I had like 90 tabs open and sorted into different groups on Firefox. If you are a chrome heavy user, TooManyTabs is really helpful instead of having all those tabs open.

******* No problem. I used to use it when I would go through TV tropes or tumblr. Now I just use Firefox for my tab heavy endeavours. :)
