Like, the question always seems to come up “why doesn't harry get his eyesight fixed with magic?” To the point were a scene with Madame Pomfrey addressing this has become a common trope. But i think the reasonable answer from what we've seen in canon is that the sort of magic needed to fix his eyes doesn't exist.

I've always had the impression that medical knowledge in the wizarding world was super archaic compared to our own. That they don't have the sort of medical science to make advanced procedures possible.

Magic is amazing at solving straightforward problems. For example when you have a situation akin to harry getting his bones vanished by Lockhart in his second year it's pretty straightforward. “hmm, ah yes i see, bones gone. Make bones grow back.” But when you can't understand what exactly the problem is it would be hard to apply it. Like, how much knowledge would the wizarding world actually have of anatomy? Due to the existence of magic surgery is likely seen as barbaric, but without surgeries and autopsies muggles would have never gained the knowledge we have today.

Allot of fan fiction authors seem to add “diagnosis spells” as if wands could be used like a tricorder from Star Trek (a huge pet peeve of mine) but don't give any explanation of how such information would actually be communicated. Diagnosis is a very difficult thing, and i think it would be a serious hurdle in MediMagic. It's fitting i think that wizard seems to be most adept at healing bone injuries. Bones are easily observed after decomposition, easily felt through skin, and serve a pretty simple purpose as the support structure in the body. Simple soft tissues like skin and muscle are slightly more complicated but still, again, easily observed and mended by “mmmm, ah, skin broke. Put skin back together” but when it comes to complex organ functions they probably have no clue. In the case of complex medical problems like say, a burst appendix. the go to approach would probably be to brute force it with blood replenishing and poison antidote potions. Anyone else have any thoughts on this?

TL;DR: I suspect magical healing would only excel in dealing with straightforward medical issues and I don't think wizards would have the needed anatomical knowledge to tackle more complicated problems.


** They seem to be capable of regrowing lost fingers as well. If no Muggle notices, then we're probably talking about things like nerves and blood vessels, and that's hardly brute force.

*** You could be right about that. Though i don't want to split hairs but it's interesting they needed “emergency bone regrowth” instead of “finger regrowth”? I read that as if they recovered the fingers. And they need the bone regrowth to reattach them? I could be 100% wrong. And i still think my original point is valid at the end of the day. Missing fingers are easy to diagnose without any other medical knowledge.

** I don't see how fixing something like a burst appendix would be all that much more complicated than healing broken bones or soft tissue injuries. They're all very complicated, if you need to know the actual biology of everything happening when you do a healing spell. I don't think you need that detailed knowledge though, magic usually 'just works'. Why would a muggle understanding of science and medicine matter, when everything you do with magic is impossible according to that knowledge? Wizard's bodies don't even seem to work according to our understanding of human anatomy--if your bones somehow suddenly vanished in real life, it would be a very painful and debilitating injury, not just make your arm floppy.

THIS. You arm basically /is/ your bones. The (not too surprising) conclusion here is that magic can create biologically impossible changes, and in reverse, that you can fix it doing impossible changes.

For OP's organ problem, I wouldn't be at all surprised if they simply vanished and regrew them. You don't need to know how they work, just that they do. And if diagnosis spells are too lame, just cut the body open and have a look. It won't hurt, it won't scar, it's not dangerous ...

But that said, I do think diagnosis spells exist.

** Here's my thread on healing: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i2n8vm/healing_in_harry_potter/]]. Anatomical knowledge doesn't seem to matter as much because spells don't require more than passing conceptual knowledge. Knowledge of physiology and anatomy only really comes in when it comes to diagnosis, something I'm sure healers learn. You don't need to know the circulatory system of a turtle to literally create a turtle, why would you need to know to fix your own?

And we see that broken bones can be fixed instantly, a cracked skull compounded by a significant from height fall requires only an overnight stay for observation because it's fixed quickly, the common cold can be cured with a single potion instantly, and magical injuries and illnesses are the only threat to a wizard. The quotes and evidence for my above statements can be found in the linked thread. And yeah surgery is barbaric when you can just charm or drink a disorder away.

I think those 6 stunners, at the very least, messed with McGonagall's heart. Dolohov's spell, while we don't know all it entailed, was clearly meant to inflict severe internal damage.

** 1. Because every medical capability we see wizards have is far in excess of what Muggles can do. They can regrow limbs, make boils go away instantly, send people to sleep without any problems, and cure the common cold.

2. Because Hagrid told us in PS that Muggles would seek out wizards to fix their problems.

3. Because JKR [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/illness-and-disability][tells us]] that magic can cure basically all non-magical disease.

4. Most fundamentally, because the entire premise of your post is flawed. In a world where matter can be created and destroyed, where instant transport is possible, where a mouse can have half its body turned into a matchbox and still be alive, where the soul exists, and where alchemy (rather than chemistry) is real, the value of Muggle science does not seem very high. If anything, wizarding ignorance of Muggle science is a strength, not a handicap, because it prevents them from being locked into an incorrect description of the universe. Wizarding capabilities flow from their knowledge and understanding of magical theory, not Muggle science.

** Well, look at canon examples: Pepper-up potion - instacure of common cold. Sleeping potions with that work like a charm (hah). Regrowing a vanished bone in just one night, while saying that a simple break could be fixed with a single spell.

My personal take on how magic and healing interact (and magic and physical world in general) is that the more basic and specific action you're trying to perform, the easier it is. I.e. clavicle-mending charm is easier than a general bone mending charm, whereas Leg-problem-go-away charm would be really hard to cast properly in order to heal a broken bone.

Because its magic, you don't have to come up with the whole concept of germ theory and trying to work out what chemical compound works against which disease with double-blind testing and peer revieved studies - you whip up an anti-flu solution, drink up an are as good as new in a jiffy. Sometimes magic is still limited and unable to fix certain issues, but, again, thanks to magic, you have nice workarounds - Pettigrew's silver hand or Moody's Eye being most prominent examples.

Maybe. Or maybe they have and Appenditcis draught, or Tummy-ache salve and it works through. The beauty of fanfic and HP world is that the latter isn't all that fleshed out, so you might try coming up with some ideas to add to it.

Additiionally, one thing i'd like to note - despite some apparent ignorance of muggle things by wizards, they still like to take useful things from muggles - they use a train, Arthur has a flying car, they have radio... no reason why some enterprising med-wizard or some muggleborn interested in healing wouldn't pick up some muggle medicine textbooks to get a bit of in-depth understanding of biology.

And it's not like we're particularily advanced, or have been for long - a lot of approaches to healing on muggle side are rather crude, especially compared to elegant solutions found in other areas of science and engineering.

Agreed on the diagnostic spell part though, it feels like lazy writing. There propably are spells meant for diagnostics, but i doubt it's as simple as casting one and knowing everything - i think they'd come up with something riddiculous, like a bone-showing charm (an x-ray like projection of the bones to skin surface) or blood-glowing charm to check for internal bleeding.

** If we assume that wizarding understanding of anatomy hasn't developed since they split off due the Statute, then wizards ought to have a fairly decent understanding of human anatomy. By 1692 the father of modern anatomy (and thus modern medicine) Andreas Vesalius had been long dead (he was born in 1514), and by this time physicians at least knew the location and probably the general function of all the internal organs, musculature, circulatory system, lymphatic system and the nervous system. Suffice it to say, if wizarding folk were so inclined, they had the necessary knowledge to perform some quite intricate surgical procedures.

As to the capability of magic on top of this, aside from what others have said, it kind of speaks to the fundamental nature of magic itself.

For example. The Skelegrow potion does far more than just grow bones. In Harry's case the regrown bone was also reattached to his skeletal muscles. It would also have to regrow the bone marrow, which is responsible for producing blood cells. (Which means right there wizards can cure leukaemia, and basically any other blood based illness)

The question arises as to how it does that then. Madame Pomphrey almost certainly doesn't know the minutiae of bone growth to the detail necessary to regrow an entire arm, so the potion must have that 'knowledge' embedded within it.

The same goes for any other potion or spell like it. The average magical is unlikely to know how skin repairs itself, yet it's likely most competent magicals are able to heal a cut. Likewise a magical likely doesn't know the anatomy of an animal (even just what is needed to make it look life-like) to be able to transfigure something into that animal.

So either the knowledge of how to do these things is either 'stored' in the spell or potion itself, or within magic as a whole. If it's the former, then the only limit is the knowledge of the spell crafter or potioneer; if it's the latter then there theoretically is no limit. Either way this paves the way for magical medicine to be functionally capable of solving most if not all mundane maladies with little difficulty.

** I have always imagined it as magic replacing machines. So we have an ultrasound, they have a spell. We have disinfectants, they have a potion or whatever. I think imagining them having super advanced medical magic seems illogical. There is no way they can cure cancer and no muggleborn has revealed this to the world.

So yeah, I just replace all machines with magic, it feels like a decent compromise, means you can have a more realistic approach to it all I think.
