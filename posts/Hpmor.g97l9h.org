I've heard a lot about Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality and I'd like to read it myself. I can't find it. On ff net there's nothing but the word test and numbers. On ao3 I find fics based on it, but not it. Could someone lend a hand?


** What do you mean by word test and numbers? Here it is.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** You have several links, but may I suggest a different one? linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR) is a rewrite of the first four chapters, expanding them quite a bit and giving some context to Harry's (rather rude) interactions with his parents. The cupboard under the stairs is a particularly nice touch :).

  Fan edit of the first few chapters of LessWrong's Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality to smooth out tone/characterization, and make it more accessible to those not familiar with Harry Potter canon.
