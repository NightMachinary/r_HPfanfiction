I'm sure I saw this, and I mostly read [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and ao3, so it's probably on one of those. Harry realizes that he isn't being taught any real history of magic in class, so he does independent reading and stumbles on the story of Agnes Nutter (who was a seer and hid a bunch of gunpowder on her when she was burned at the stake). So when Harry goes to fight Voldemort, he steals a bunch of explosives from a military base and rigs them to go off when his heart stops, to ensure Voldemort doesn't survive. Dumbledore reveals the plan of sacrificing the horcrux in Harry's place and letting him go back, but it's too late for that because Harry has been vaporized and Hogwarts is a smoking crater by this point.
