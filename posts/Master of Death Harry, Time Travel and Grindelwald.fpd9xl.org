:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Read this fic awhile back and I recall it quite vividly, I just can't seem to remember the title or where to find it again? I believe it had 2 parts, the first completed and the second part was abandoned. Or maybe I'm confusing several fics together as well.

But essentially the plot:

1. Master of Death Harry goes back in time to the past, adopts Riddle who is an infant at this point
2. I believe he speaks with Dumbledore at some point about the Hallows
3. Harry has the allegiance of the Elder wand, and Grindelwald finds it no longer works for him
4. Harry starts working with seers in a ministry job. I forgot the name of the job, but his job was to record down prophecies as they happened
5. I think the second part had Tom slightly older, like a child pre-Hogwarts age

Anyone know this?


** The plot you have described is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]], but it's not a multipart fic and I haven't seen anything from the author about it being abandoned.

*** Seems like this was the fic I was looking for! Thanks a bunch! I probably conflated it with another fic

** I don't know about the fic you are talking about but this fic has a similar premise and is really good.
