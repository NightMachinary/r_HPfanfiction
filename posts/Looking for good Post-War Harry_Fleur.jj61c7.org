Really getting into this pairing lately. Suggest me good ones. Preferably no multi, but if its really good, then yes. And doesn't absolutely have to be post-war, but that is preferred.


** Linkffn(the stag and the flower) not quite finished yet but it's a good story and I think is winding towards the ending
