*** Linkffn(11669575) (Gotta link the bot)

I'm always conflicted on this story. It's honestly one of my guilty pleasures, but man it completely jumps the shark once they travel to America.

Honestly, it's not too much of a surprise, but I was actually thinking he would start the third act, but now the author is just droning on and on kind of stuck. (In a rut of minor character development and smut)

I'll keep reading it, but I had to remove it from my favorite list. It's just too odd to keep on there.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** you might like this one linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings]])

is not the same, the plot is a lot more convoluted and there is not smut so far, but Harry too delves in dangerous self-mutilation runic magic, and while he is pretty independent he is not as... edgy

** Now that I think it over I think spiffay was write about what you were looking for, but my first thought when I read your title was Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path linkffn(11898648). If you like For Love of Magic (which I do) and haven't read Rune Stone Path I think you'd probably like it

**** I agree. I feel like this is the story that turned me around on the concept of multi pairing fics.

I feel like I owe the author a lot because after I read it I went back through and read all of the recommendations from every chapter, which introduced me to so many of my favorite fics.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
