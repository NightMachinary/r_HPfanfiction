** I respect the ton of effort that went into this, but it just rubs me the wrong way.

It's trope-y and smug. Most character voices blend together into a pompous, self-righteous amalgamation that brings to mind a self-satisfied, stern older person standing over your head shaking their finger disapprovingly.

Its just not fun to read at all.

I mean, even disregarding how ridiculous and precocious the entire idea of sorting is, Harry is not only nearly sorted into Slytherin, he also repeatedly shows off its virtues (like determination, leadership, or resourcefulness)

****** Look, what I'm trying to say is this: eleven-year-olds are so ridiculously easy to manipulate and change, I propose I can change the psychological outfit of about 85% of any year enough with only a few months or weeks, sometimes days, to change their primary alignment in regards to sorting.

The entire 'sorting', or at least the notion that it holds any real meaning, is what's ridiculous.

******* I think what [[/u/Ash_Lestrange]] is trying to say is that the idea of Slytherin!Harry being automatic friends with Hermione is ridiculous.

He's in a house that is reflexively hostile to Muggleborn, Hermione has terrible manners and social skills, and in canon he didn't even like her until he saved her from the troll. It's just the author making his favourite characters come together without a sufficient explanation for why.

** I don't hate it, but the author's take on what it is to be Slytherin is kind of... limited and one dimensional? There's a lot more to ambition and cunning than prancing around with Regency-era manners and attempting to maintain an unemotional facade. Just once I'd like to see a Slytherin house with future activists trying to drum up support for their pet causes, budding artists pushing their craft forward with or without the teacher's permission, a Hogwarts black market run by a cartel of Slytherin students, etc.

It's the best take on the WBWL trope I've read yet, but that's a low bar because that trope is stupid IMHO.

Also, the Weasleys and Longbottoms are part of the Sacred 28 list of Pureblood families. They don't act in the ridiculous fanon pureblood culture way in the books, it's a pretty strong indication that the way the Malfoys act has everything to do with their wealth and class, and not their status as Pureblood wizards. Nobody is ever called "Lord" aside from Voldemort, and there is no canonical indication whatsoever that the "Ancient and Noble House of Black" was anything other than an affectation that Walburga or some other terrible ancestor of Sirius' started.

** Well, considering it started 4 years ago I thought most people already new about PoS. It's pretty good compared to most fics in terms of worldbuilding, writing and character development. One huge downside tho, it's updated very slowly (middle of the 3rd year now in 4 years of real time, so the estimated time of completion via simple calculus gives us around 2023-2024) so you kinda start to forget all the nuances in the in-between of updates.

The only other fic I've read that is kinda similar is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][DP&SW]]

******** At present, the story is in Christmas of third year. So let's say he has completed 2.5 books in 830,000 words. That comes out at 332,000 words per book.

The total 7 year story would therefore come out at 2,324,000 words, of which 1,494,000 are yet to be written.

The 830,000 words written to date were written from April 2015 to present (4 years and 4 months). That's a rate of 15,961 words a month. At that rate of words/month, it would take 93 months to finish the series, or 7 years. That takes us up to 2026.

In reality, however, this is a wildly optimistic figure. This is for two reasons:

1. It is likely that later books will be significantly longer than earlier years due to the number of story threads ongoing.

2. The 15,961 words/month figure is the average across 4 years. But in reality the author's rate of writing has slowed down dramatically.

Assuming that the story is not abandoned, I would not expect it to be completed before around 2035.

** The technical quality of this fic's writing is pretty high (what you might call production value, I guess), and -- as you pointed out -- I like both the attempts at world-building, especially those that subvert a few of the more popular tropes, and the humour for the most part.

On the other hand, I think the author did himself a disservice whith the starting age of the fic. Especially the first year feels like a smug revenge opera at times. My real gripe with the story, however, comes to light around late first, early second year when the author with increasing frequency presents canon rewrites, overly long side character developing chapters, and the like. I believe the author lost himself a bit at some point; just because you can write about something, doesn't mean that you should.
