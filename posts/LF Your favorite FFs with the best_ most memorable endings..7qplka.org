Looking for really good endings to ffs. The last ones I have read were a little lack luster. Can either end with you being super content or yelling at your computer "No! I can't believe it's all over! But it was all so good! Definitively worth putting in the extra hours to read it than to do much needed work! " haha. Looking for a minimum of 20,000 words (but not required). Thanks!


** With all the other praise it gets, I still think linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) ends amazingly.

Also, I loved the tone to how linkffn(Stages of Hope) ends.

*** Oh that seems interesting. I've never read a Lockhart centered fic and it seems like there are so many hilarious and interesting stories that could be made from his character.

Something like this:

Lockhart unintentionally accepts a job when he tells the farmer of a remote village that he knows exactly what's killing his flock of sheep and that 'he, in fact, knows exactly how to get rid of it in a jiff'.\\
After bumbling around through the local forest to "investigating the disturbance", but before accidentally tearing the flamboyant peach robe he was gifted by a fan, Lockhart finds himself face to face with a lone, young, and hungry werewolf. While running for his life in the freaky midnight thunderstorm, Lockhart jumps over a downed tree branch but manages to catch his robe on a knot, catapulting the branch backward and his ravenous werewolf pursuer into the nearby river to be swept away. "Well that turned out better then expected," he thought to himself. Lockhart doesn't get much time to celebrate when he goes back to tell the farmer of his success in thwarting the mangy menace. He finds the cottage window broken into. Within is a partially transformed werewolf with a massive head wound, slung over the farmers gored body. There is a large muggle hunting gun beside the pair. The wolf must have swam to shore down the river in front of the farmhouse and retreated to a location it remembered in its injured state. How was Lockhart to know the wolf could swim so well after being thrown into a river by Lockhart's bare hands (at least that's what he was going to tell people). Lockhart's biggest surprise was that the wolf looked to be the farmers son?! Well, no matter. Lockhart was not one to fret over a situation with such a tidy conclusion and got to work 'editorializing' the situation. He vanished away the evidence with some (fabulous) wand work, packed up some of the occupants belongings for their "vacation to Majorca", and finished with a delicious plate of roasted lamb with potato for a job well done. Onto the next adventure!

Edit: fixed some missing information and grammar.

** The last chapter of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436), is really cool.

The ending of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/63/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), consists of 5 chapters and takes me by surprise how intense it was.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** Seems people hated the ending to that. According to the comments people said it felt rushed and felt 'incomplete' for the effort and time put into the story.

I'm not doubting it's good I just thought it was interesting the comments seemed to be different from your experience.

**** I definitely agree with you about reading the comments on other readers' experiences. I usually skim them to get a feel of a story too.

Oh, and what I the tears were actually for the ending. I was upset that there wasn't more since I really like the fic. It did felt a bit abrupt.
