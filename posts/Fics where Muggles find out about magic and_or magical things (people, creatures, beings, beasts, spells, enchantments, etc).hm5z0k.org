Basically, I'm looking for fics with that revelation moment, be it when the Hogwart's teacher delivers the letter to Muggleborn, a Harmony pairing revealing Magic to Hermione's extended family, that one with the police officer who keeps getting obliviated yet keeps finding out about magic because the Obliviators don't know about recorded messages (before you ask, I can't remember the name of it), or whatever else.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** I really like linkffn(12373273) (it has two of them), and I am writing one myself in linkao3(23267857), but I am horribly struck with the writer's block exactly on this scene.

*** Thanks for the recs!

Also, if you're stuck with one scene, a good trick is to start a new page/document with just that scene. Like, just go and write it on a new page completely separate to the rest of your story or chapter. Might help. :)

** linkffn(The Power of the Press by Bobmin356) has Harry helping explain magic to Hermione's grandmother.

linkffn(Memorium by aesop) is a story about the consequences of obliviation in the muggle world.

linkffn(Nanoha Takamichi and the School of Magic by Ryvaken Lucius Tadrya) is a crossover with Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, and has Dumbledore "recruiting" Nanoha and Fate after they have a run-in with British obliviators.

linkffn(You're My Density by RobSt) has Hermione introducing magic to Harry, who had his magic bound and was obliviated after his trial for underage magic.

linkao3(The Case of the Missing Wizard by IshtarsDream) is a nice, if unfinished, cross with Sherlock and involves Sherlock and John being introduced to magic by Hermione.

For a humorous take on it, try linkffn(Who Needs Obliviators? by Drauchenfyre).

Also, I googled it and that anime sounds utterly ridiculous - 'a nine year old girl gains magical powers from an interdimensional wizard in the form of a ferret' sounds like the greatest crack!fic ever. :D
