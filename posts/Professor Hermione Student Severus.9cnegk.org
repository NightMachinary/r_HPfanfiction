I'm looking for the following: Voldemort Wins/ Time Travel AU/ HGSS

Anything with Hermione time travel back to Marauder's era and becoming a Professor to the following characters: Severus, Lily, James, Sirius...etc. With Voldemort winning the War, Hermione goes back in time and creates an alternative timeline where she can defeat Voldemort, while helping a student Severus Snape. By then, Hermione knows the truth about Severus role and does anything she can to makes sure he doesn't become a death eater. Student/Teacher relationship.

Please let me know if anyone has read anything like this before. Please let me know!

Similar Fiction with this theme is: Damage Control by Seanymphe (Pairing Tomione) If anyone can find a Snamione Fiction, that would be awesome!


** I've read a story much like this, except Hermione isn't a professor, she's still a student in the 70's. (On mobile so forgive my lack of formatting and proper linking) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8751734/1/Thirty-One-Days]]

** I'm currently obsessed with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10734054][Fate Set Right]] which is ongoing.

Edit: I should mention that these don't have Hermione as a professor to the Marauders but still involve time travel.
