Looking for a dark, disturbing fic that shows, in gloriously realistic detail, how Severus Snape might have developed the Occlumency skills to foil Voldemort's Legilimency? This fic, written by Snape apologist terri_testing, will not disappoint. The author leaves no doubt in readers' minds that Snape, with the help of Albus Dumbledore, dedicated himself mind, body, and soul, to achieving success in his endeavor to prevent the Dark Lord from discerning his motives for betrayal. Terri_testing explores the theory that Dumbledore and Snape collaborated to create Snape's essentially impenetrable Occlumency shields, and that the process was filled with angst and violence on the parts of both men. Told through Dumbledore's eyes, she shows readers that Snape's love for Lily was strong enough, obsessive enough, to impel him to physical and mental self-harm, over and over, to protect her. Dumbledore doesn't escape the training unscathed, either, as attempting to break through Snape's shields brings memories of Gellert Grindlewald to the forefront of his mind. As both men struggle with inner demons, and external events, we watch the training process affect them even as it succeeds in achieving their goals. The tone of the fic is as dark as it gets. Violence, torture, self-harm, are both means to an end and motives to succeed. We get an incredibly intimate look at Albus Dumbledore in this piece: His regrets, fears, desires. Snape is portrayed as flawed but noble. It's all quite believable and twisted.

To say that terri_testing writes well is to underrate her skills. She evokes a dark, dramatic mood that doesn't let up, and that captures the reader in her clutches. We can't look away as Snape poisons himself, as Voldemort tortures his followers, as Dumbledore struggles with his dark desires. “Training” is a story that will resonate with readers long after finishing the piece. It's everything we could want and nothing we want to imagine.


** I always preferred the idea that occlumency required pain, stress, and negative emotions to learn which is why so few actually know it. It would require people to face their demons to an extent that most would find distasteful.

Legilimency on the other hand would be more prevalent. A skill that powerful and intensely curious wizards develop somewhat naturally. And that while not meant to be defensive in and of itself there would be a natural defense mechanism of attack. Say for example that if you see someone looking at your inner thoughts, you have the ability to ‘jab them in the eye'. Most people's defense would work this way and the way it's determined who wins is who jabs the hardest. Only a few extremely controlled individuals know occlumency because it's so difficult to learn and master. And this would be why Snape never got caught. Because Voldemort assumes that Snape is only a ligilimiser (spelling?) like him and 95% of other people that know mind magic and is incapable of defense that is misleading and the art of hiding.

*** In the story, practice definitely helps to hone Snape's skill. And who better to practice with, than the most skillful Legilimens in the British WW?!

** Sounds like an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_film][exploitation]] story for angst-hurt-comfort loops that uses the occlumency training as an excuse to have all the

scenes.

I'd /really/ like to find good stories that are focused on mind magic, but mind magic should be about intricate psychology and magical theory, as well as creative fun with and insight into other people's minds, not a full-length story about physical and mental self-mutilation.

Not saying the story'll definitely be bad, only that your description makes me think it will be, and that subjectively it's not what I am currently interested to read.

*** If in your view ‘bad' and ‘dark' are synonymous in fanfic, then this story likely won't interest you; agreed.

**** *shrug*

Hey, props to you for being honest. I've read posts where people will claim that a fic portrays the "Real Snape" and then the fic portrays Snape in such a way that he's basically an OC. I just have no love for the character to the point where if he's a prominent, main fixture in a fic, I won't read it. I just have some... very hard (and, admittedly, perhaps even irrational) feelings about him.

THAT SAID: I did, genuinely, love the review, even if the recommendation itself isn't quite my speed. I'll be sure to keep an eye out for any future recs that you do.

*a toast*

***** Thank you for the lovely compliment! I'll endeavor to recommend a story that might be one you'll enjoy. I like finding little-known gems, and I decided I would like to share some of them here, for others to investigate, and hopefully, enjoy.

I will never recommend a story full of SPaG (spelling, punctuation and grammar) errors, or stories that consist of gratuitous smut. I do have some standards (winks)! My preferences include short- to medium-length (up to 50K words) fics, and one-shots. I adore the impact of a well-written one-shot! I deeply respect writers who are able to sustain the planning and execution of novel-length fics; however, I have difficulty staying with long fanfics.

I appreciate your feedback and look forward to more thoughtful commentary from you, as I hone my reccing abilities!
