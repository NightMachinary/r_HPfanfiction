There used to be a fanfic author by the name of Werewolf_Warrior who had published these two popular fanfics called "Dragon Lily" and "A Big Happy Weasley Family", but for whatever reason he suddenly deleted all his works a couple years ago and was never heard since. I came to know from some old posts that some people on this sub might find those works useful, hence I've uploaded them from the EPUB copies I had for you to read:

** Nope, he's still around:

But yeah, I think he abandoned Dragon Lily.

#+begin_quote
  Entirely Magical AU. In a world with no muggles, supreme, ancient magical beings -- the Archmagi - rule over the mortal realm, locked in an eternal struggle for power and glory... which was all background noise for ickle Harry, until he decided that he'd abandon his uncomfortable life as a common street urchin for a slightly less uncomfortable life on board a merchant vessel. It was supposed to be a few Sickles for a few days of mundane work, but circumstances spiral out of control, and Harry finds himself struggling to choose between mere survival and potential infamy, while demi-gods do battle around him.

** Rumour was that his mother came across his Harry/Lily smut on the family computer and he had to delete it. No idea where that rumour started, but if there's even a kernel of truth to it: LOL.
