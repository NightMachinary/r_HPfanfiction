So I'm writing a story in which combat is a major part of it so I've started thinking what spells would be made for combat realistically wizards would make more than one spell for killing people because humans. So my question would be what spells would be made for this? I'm sure someone's made a spell to break bones or splash acid at someone.

Also what applications of less outright deadly spells could lead to a deadly effect?


** IMO, magical warfare should be (like regular warfare) 99% intelligence gathering, preparation, and sneak attacks. Army of invisible basilisks, etc. There's actually a lot of this in canon, such as Draco Malfoy's various unsuccessful schemes to assassinate Dumbledore, his /successful/ scheme to allow Death Eaters entrance to the castle, and the use of Devil's Snare to assassinate Broderick Bode.

Confronting the enemy in person should be a last resort, and if /you/ are confronted it is because you messed up somehow (poor choice of secret keeper, etc.). But if a wizard or witch /has/ to fight in person, they should do so invisible, silenced, odorless, and riding a broomstick.

There's no reason to use bother with spells that aren't a one-hit KO if they connect, and creatively gruesome and/or painful dark curses are no more useful than any other one-hit KO spell. Given that, it doesn't seem that you actually need much variety in offensive spells:

- Because it is useful to capture opponents and interrogate them later, magical fighters should master at least one non-lethal incapacitating hex, and at least one human-to-small-inanimate-object transfiguration.

- Avada Kedavra is good for making people duck.

- Against multiple opponents, the most effective thing to hit someone with is the Imperius curse, provided they're susceptible to it.

- Silenced (/actually/ silenced) firearms could be useful against unprepared enemies.

*** Agreed. I imagine that scrying spells and devices enchanted to listen in to conversations are invaluable in magical warfare. There's probably a constant arms race going on where either side is desperately trying to develop a new listening device that the other side can't protect against and also trying to figure out what the other side have made so they can develop a spell to shield against it.

*** I wonder how fast you can banish a small stone. A packet of gravel could be an op weapon.

I've tried writing imaginative combat scenes, and if you actually think too creatively you end with a major problem.

In cannon, wizards are incredibly vulnerable. If surprise, Bullets, conjured spears or any fast moving silent weapon ends any fight scene before it even starts. For this reason traps are really hard to write convincingly.

Any pre- enchanted item is incredibly overpowered. Such as exploding snitches, or anything explosive and invisible.

Enchanted clothing should exist that is effectively unbreakable. Not just dragon skin, but if you enchant wool so it's unbreakable then a t-shirt made of it would stop bullets. Which is actually a really good reason to wear a mask in combat. If your clothes are all unbreakable your face would be the weak point.

I think you get the point. With your imagination and a lack of 'real world' limitations the weapons that can be created are so incredibly effective that your fight scenes would be a massacre. Any surprised wizard is effectively dead if their opponent uses an fast item rather than a bright flashy (relatively slow moving) spell.

**** Unbreakable doesn't mean it can't do damage to the body. Body armor specifications have a limit on something called blackface deformation for example. And soft body armor really just spreads out the force over a much larger area.

And I disagree. Apparition makes noise. Disillusion and such only work to an extent and can be circumvented. Surprise shouldn't really happen to a a prepared force. And to an unprepared for in any world well that's usually really really bad.

*** I guess I disagree that combat is 99% intelligence gathering especially in the type of fight that wizards can bring. That might be the case for a navy or air force which has exquisite platforms and low risk tolerance army and marine forces operate across a spectrum of intelligence amounts. It's pretty much an insurgency. They can bring the fight when and where they want. There aren't lines. Some part of the population is sympathetic and supporting them. Not to say there isn't a place especially with properly truth serum and mine reading canonically included but it's not most of the fight.

I think the biggest limitation is power. If you can throw ten low power spells silently and quickly that's akin to suppression or the role the US Army uses machine guns for. Big spells take energy, accuracy and time it seems and these just can't be thrown around because the downside is if you miss you exposed yourself or make yourself vulnerable. If you have only a few tricks it'll be relatively fast before the counters are developed and your ineffective.

I think muggle weapons would be huge boon but they would lead to devastating first encounters and likely could be be mitigated fairly quickly. It seems that the universe has stagnated a hundred years ago and doesn't seem to have a good understanding of firearms or much else. Getting people to properly employ a gun is difficult. And enchanting the weapon is probably also difficult.

Being silenced and invisible isn't a panacea as well. You're just as likely to attack your own folks as the enemy. It only really works when lines and locations don't change or in something like an ambush.

Figuring out who your enemy is is intelligence gathering. And even then... can they? You get one big public action before anyone with any sense holes up in an unplottable location, accessible only by floo or vanishing cabinet. Best make it count.

#+begin_quote

The suppression role is Avada Kedavra. Or saying, "Abara Kedabra," while silently casting a green color-change hex.

They might even be mitigated already, at least for anyone who shops at a reputable magical tailor. Even if muggle criminal encounters are rare, the reputation boost from a single averted stabbing or shooting would completely pay back the effort of charming all of your products bulletproof. And that's assuming the standard charms you apply for durability don't make fabric mostly-bulletproof as a side effect.

This is the sort of, "solved decades ago by people who are paid to think about it, and for the most part no one else remembers it exists," problem that would tend to bite muggleborns in the butt when they think they'll save money by shopping muggle.

#+begin_quote
  It seems that the universe has stagnated a hundred years ago and doesn't seem to have a good understanding of firearms or much else.
#+end_quote

I think any impression of that is an artifact of the entire setting being created and sparsely described by JK Rowling, who is only a single person.

IRL, if it seems that a large number of smart people are overlooking something consequential and incredibly obvious, /you/ are probably overlooking something.

Seeing as this problem is immediately obvious to muggles after 5 minutes of thought, it is safe to assume wizards would have fighting-in-a-team-while-invisible worked out. We know from OOtP (pg 52) that the auror academy has courses on "Concealment and Disguise" and "Stealth and Tracking".

Anyone who wanted to participate in a magical war would do well to put an entire round-the-clock team on researching invisibility, countermeasures to invisibility, counter-countermeasures, and so on.

** There definitely could be a spell that breaks bones or splashes acid. One of the best things about magic is that you could come up with a spell that does literally anything, as long as it doesn't go against any of the rules set in canon, which still leaves a lot of potential.

As for combinations of less deadly spells, a strong freezing charm paired with a blasting spell might have disastrous effects. Think something like freezing an apple in liquid nitrogen and then smashing it with a hammer. You could conjure a bunch of birds (like Hermione does) and make them peck your opponent's eyes out. You can transform something like a goblet to glass and send it flying at your opponent at a very high speed. A spell like ‘Ascendio' paired with ‘Expelliarmus' could be used in an open battlefield to send someone shooting high up in the air without their wand - so that they come crashing back down and are unable to cast a cushioning spell. The possibilities truly are endless.

****** Note that this is from make a wish, within which lavender uses a cosmetic charm that causes breast growth on a guy to fuck with his balance, because you know, those knockers are bpund to wheigh quite a bit.

The rest of these are my own though

There is certainly also other such spells, say you have some to corect eye sight, then you could use it on someone who didn't have bad eyesight to fuck with them.

A spell that heightens someone's senses could cause the person ro be exceptionally week to loud sounds, or just mess with their concentratiob, if it enhanced their senses enough they could even suffer from sensory overload.

For transfiguration then anything impacting your enemies movement would be great, say turning the ground into knee high water.

Banishing a lot of things, especially either pointy or heavy things, towards someone would very much so be a mess.

You could potentially do something similar to dumbles department of mysteries by just sending a massive amount of water towards them

Animating or conjuring things could be a great way to protect oneself from spells and such.

** Honestly, I sometimes wonder why there are no 'harassment-type spells like a swarm of angry wasps or hornets. Even flies would work. Anything to disrupt the concentration of the opponent.

If I were a wizard, I would focus on 1-2 lethal spells, and the rest would be tricks of a more supportive nature.

Stuff like Fumos - to impair vision.

If you fight in a forest, cast an Oppugno on the leaves or branches of a tree, weaponizing them. It won't kill an opponent, but a bunch of leaves trying to fly into your mouth or eyes will make fighting difficult.

Or maybe even animated pebbles - start the fight by throwing them into the air, animate them, and then attack the opponent while he/she is dealing with a ferocious swirl of small stones.

- Use the environment to your advantage.

If you fight close to a river, animate a tentacle of water towards your enemy. If the tentacle connects, freeze it with a Glacius (Freezing Spell) - or you directly influence the water to sneakily gather around the feet of your opponent, and then freeze it to immobilize him/her on the spot, or to create a disadvantageous environment for your opponent to move on.

If you fight in a forest, cast an Oppugno on the leaves or branches of a tree, weaponizing them. It won't kill a opponent, but a bunch of leaves trying to fly into your mouth or eyes will make fighting difficult.

That said, as for lethal spells that are made to solely kill, I would prefer something like a 'Mana Bullet' or something of that nature. Small and quick so that it isn't easy to visually spot. The Killing Curse might be strong, but that sickly-green bolt of lightning is quite flashy, and because of that, easy to dodge.

If you fight in a forest, cast an Oppugno on the leaves or branches of a tree, weaponizing them. It won't kill an opponent, but a bunch of leaves trying to fly into your mouth or eyes will make fighting difficult, etc. attacking their intended target. Protegos flash here and there, defending against quick spells that don't kill but aim to impair.\\
Eventually, one of the fighters sees a chance and gets confident enough to stop his movement and focus his mind to able to cast the first killing spell. It backfires, he/she gets hit by an animated whatever, the second fighter uses that chance and kills his/her foe.

Idk, this is what I expect a 'realistic magic fight to look like. Standing still and shooting spells at each other sounds like the stuff below OWLs students would do.

** Honestly, you'd get far by opening a Dungeons & Dragons / Pathfinder rulebook or online database and looking under "Spells" to find a ton of conceptually viable things.

The canon shield charm Protego is essentially just the Potterverse version of DnD's "Shield" spell; an energy barrier that blocks bad things. The spell "Web" makes magical spider silk. Take that core concept and you could use it to do any of the following in your story;

It could be used for ensnaring people. It could be used to deny access to an area or slow down pursuers. It could catch things or be used to swing around like a grappling line like Spider Man. It could be used to construct obstacles, traps or other useful things. It could even be used for strangulation for capture or straight up murder.

And those are just the options off the top of my head for one spell concept. You've got a lot more options in there.

** I have a fic (currently just in my head) where a muggleborn invents a spell that sprays gasoline, and then it's followed up by either a fire spell or just basic sparks. I also have a character that carried around a belt full of potions (imagine Rambo-style ammo belts) that they chuck like Molotov cocktails.

I'm also a big fan of prank spells being used in combat. Spells to butter the floor, and make opponents lose their footing. Tying shoelaces together. Rapid hair growth spells blocking vision. Spells meant to pants people. Spells that make people speak in rhymes, but it means they can't cast spells.

I also like the idea of healing spells used in battle. I saw one fic where Ferula, the bandage spell, was used to tie people up, because shield weren't designed to block it.

The fic The Second String, has a whole section where Harry finds a book of household spells and tries to figure out ways they could be used in battle.

Edit: Just wanted to add that spell chains are also a fascinating concept

** You know, for as much fun as creative magical combat is, there's something to be said about simplicity and reliability. Imagine two spells, one of which is difficult to learn, difficult to pull off in combat, and potentially thwartable, but is very spectacular. Imagine that the other is simple, easy to cast quickly, and reliably kills most, if not all the time. Which would you pick in a combat scenario?

I'd pick the second, and real-life history supports that with how weaponry evolved over the years. Convenience and reliability outweigh style nearly every time when it comes to war.

Should magic be creative and wonderous? Yes. Should it be so in war? Only if it doesn't come at the expense of practicality.

Mind you, everything I've just said applies to combat in a realistic sense. /Narrative/ combat - that is, combat in the fanfictions we all so enjoy reading - *must* be entertaining. It exists for a different purpose. With that in mind...

Gravity and time magic would be my picks for the most interesting sort of magic you could use in combat.

****** Huh. Well, if you're curious, ice-nine is a fictional substance inspired by but separate from the real substance ice-IX. Ice-nine is frozen water that can freeze at or above room temperature, meaning you could have sold yet warm ice.

The problem is that it acts as a nucleation site for more water freezing (if you've ever seen videos of supercooled water freezing instantly, it's like that). If ordinary water touches it, it instantly freezes into more ice-nine. The book it came from, /Cat's Cradle,/ had an apocalypse come about when a bit of ice nine fell into the ocean, instantly freezing all the water in the ocean and in every river.

It makes for a good "ice" alternative to feindfyre, as it's a pretty vicious substance.

** Human transfiguration is pretty underrated in terms of combat capabilities. It's one of the most difficult branches of magic, sure, but what makes it viable is that you don't actually have to be good at it. Messing up a human transfiguration spell could hinder, disable, or even kill an opponent. Like, imagine a spell to turn someone into a fish, get it just right enough to replace their lungs with gills so they'll asphyxiate.

Different variations or amplified versions of simple spells could be used as well. A variation of /Lumos/ that would make it strobe could disorient an opponent, or overpower a Leviatation Charm to lift and slam an opponent around, maybe smash their head on a ceiling. You could also try to combine spells, like using /Aguamenti/ to cover a floor with water and then using the Lightning Spell to electrocute an opponent or a group of opponents.

Maybe you could incorporate dueling techniques. Dodging instead of blocking would be easier for counterattacks, “chaining” spells based on wand movement to have a constant stream of spells firing out, or using the General-Counter spell to disable shields or spells. These ideas I got from the fic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/11323222/TheTrueSpartan][Fate by TheTrueSpartan]].

ETA: Spells that utilize or change the environment/ battlefield. Throwing a Blasting or Explosive Curse at a ceiling to drop debris and rubble on an opponent(s). Using /Ventus/ to blow dirt, dust, sand, etc. at someone, or using /Oppungo/ for a similar effect. Make the ground or floor harder to navigate or stand on with spells like /Herbivicus/ or /Orbis/, or just destabilize or vanish the floor where an opponent is standing.

Spells that mess with an opponent's mind or senses. The Confundus Charm is a good canon example, though for something more original maybe a spell that causes hallucinations or a spell that delays someone's hearing or speech (try using the Speech Jammer app to see how debilitating it is).

Instead of just focusing on offense maybe more defensive or supportive spells. For example, a spell that augments the caster's strength or speed, or a spell that would give someone night vision or the use of the Disillusionment Charm.

** Honestly, with Magic's ability to utterly screw with perception, warp space, and generally turn your surroundings into a booby-trapped hell I can definitely see magical combat being 99% ambushes and assassinations.

1. You go home from work one day, only it turns out your doormat is a pressure-activated portkey that yanks you away to god knows where and you get killed by a team of terrorists on arrival before you know what's happening.

2. You reach to open your office door. The doorknob bites you, utterly wrecking your wand arm. Almost immediately afterwards, a bunch of dudes walk out of the wall next to where you're at (wizards can f---k with space, so this can be accomplished a number of ways) and kill you.

3. The guy at the back of the bar uses the switching spell to replace your firewhiskey with a duplicate containing a frighteningly lethal magical poison of some sort. You die shortly after taking a sip.

If counterinsurgency in the wizarding world was basically one horrifying ambush after another like this it would explain a lot about why Moody is so paranoid all the time.

Alternatively, assuming a) wizards are reasonably squishy (e.g. baseline human or slightly better because magic) and b) most serious magical combatants are capable of putting out very large amounts of firepower for their size, I can see maneuverability or counter-detection being the big deciding factors---the first person to /get hit/ is basically fucked (try reacting to literally anything if you've been hit by a body bind) so apparition and disillusionment and the like are the real winners here.

** There's probably a way to conjure aluminum powder, as well as powdered rust. Combine both of those with a strong source of heat, and you've got a welding spell that would be useful for maintaining the tracks of the Hogwarts Express. Modify /that/ spell to spray the thermite forward like a flamethrower, and suddenly you have a viable alternative to fiendfyre.

** I'm also writing a story with more creative ways of combat than what Rowling showed in the Harry Potter books. However, I don't want to introduce completely new spells, because someone would complain about things that are overpowered or something. Instead, my main character creates variations of canon spells in ways that make them easy to weaponise.

One spell is the Gravity Amplifying Charm, the Levitating Charm but with reversed effect: it makes things heavier instead of lighter. In one battle scene the main character uses it on a fleeing Death Eater, breaking his knees and thighbones.

Another spells in Invisible Death, the Wand-Lighting Charm that is changed to produce gamma radiation instead of the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that the human eye can see. It damages internal organs, but the effect is slow. Used during a pre-battle dialogue, and the Death Eater never notices anything because gamma radiation can't be sensed in any way (at least before it's far too late).

*** I don't particularly give a shit if people complain about overpowered magic on account of it being magic. The killing curse is the most op thing that could be made so it's not like it matters.

As for creative application of spells and modifications of spells I had the idea of using decendo to fold someone in half like a lawn chair. I also had the idea of summoning bones after breaking them in some way.

Ah, you see, you are ignoring the scale and the aiming.

The killing curse requires aim. If it didn't then it would be more op.

But it only kills one person per cast. That's not really strong. Make it kill /more/ people with 1 cast and you get and even more op spell.

***** That's true though most of the curses I come up with are single target so scale isn't really a factor for me though I'm sure that it will be for some people.

On a side note It's been bugging me though why do wizards have 2 (3 if you count reducto) curses for blowing shit up like what is the difference between confringo and bombarda?

** If you don't want to kill your enemy, I see no point in using anything more than the disarming spell and the shield charm and it should end the fight pretty quickly. If you want to actually intimidate your enemy, but not hurt them much, you can use something like Draco's serpentsotia or the knockback jinx. If you want to harm them a bit but not permanently scar them, then any of the prank hexes and jinxes shown throughout the books should do the trick. If you want to punish them more harshly you should still use something that does permanent damage without necessarily killing the victim but it could, and has an immediate effect such as the blasting curse or the purple curse, but you don't need anything else if you know Sectumsempra which can permanently maim the victim. Typically curses are used for either more practical purposes or preventing someone to use something while you're not actively present. The only curse that seems reasonable to actively use for combat is Avada Kedavra... that cuts the battle short and has instant effect. If you want to incapacitate the enemy, you have Locomotor Mortis, Petrificus Totalus and Stupefy.

Of course we see some cool duels such as Dumbledore vs Voldemort or McGonagall vs Snape where the opponents use transfiguration and manipulation of the environment but they are pointless for a short battle and no different than the anime powers which look differently for the sake of diversity but ultimately have the same effects.

** Transfiguration has the best applications, especially if it's quick.

If you could have stalagmites erupt from the ground under someone, that would be perfect. Even small ones to spear through someone's feet would be great.

Most spells also seem like the are primarily for close quarters combat. If you could extend the range of nearly any spell or modify the color to be nearly invisible, that would be amazing.

** When you get to the actual combat, transfiguration is really underrated. An army of warriors from the environment (or stones in your pocket if not) or changing the field of battle to your whim? Super OP. With preparation its also a force multiplier; set up ahead of time and have a pride of lions in your expanded pocket.

Also, find something that looks */cool/* in your head and run with it! I have my Harry working on a transfiguration spell based off 'Pride' from the Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood series, (Basically animate shadows that can bind or cut, and just sort of swarm around him) just on a whim because I thought it would be super dangerous in close quarters, plus useful for defense.

Anime has a lot of interesting spells that you could use for HP, but anime is like fanfiction, there's a lot of awful ones for every good one you find.

** Every single Hex or Curse in the books would be useful in combat. Jinxes are a bit too innocent for a warzone. *Fiendfire*, *Entrails Expelling Curse* and *Confringo* are canon examples of deadly spells. *Sectumsempra* was literally designed "for enemies" as Snape put it.

For less deadly spells that can kill, anything to do with energy or mobility can be deadly. *Incendio* can burn people alive and *Wingardium Leviosa*, *Accio* and *Locomotor* can be used to hurl enemies to their death or throw large things at them to squash them.

I mean with preparation and a bottomless bag like Hermoine had you could start or go into any conflict with a cloud of invisible, silenced little trinkets ready to swarm your enemies in a flurry of whatever sort of spells you want to inflict on people.
