Can be dark harry, Grey hair, Canon harry, au harry, I don't care that much. I just want a fic that is pretty long that at the end makes your insides feel warm, or make you at least feel content. The fic does not have to be tooth rotting fluff, or unrealistic. I really like fics that have a good story and that focus on the characters in hogwarts, or prehogwarts. Like LinkFFN- Perception is everything by Kendra James LinkFFN- Rescued by MishaySahila LinkFFN- Alea Iacta Est by EllaEleniel LinkFFN- Crochet and Family by Account Paused LinkFFN- Order of the Dragon by mindofemmette LinkFFN- A New Plave To Stay by DebsThsSlytherinSnapeFan Another fic on FFN called Lily's Son, where several rescues and raises a toddler harry and its so cute and wonderfully written. Severus is caring, but not out of character to much. I can't remember the author. Ao3- What the Heck is a Radio Potter by Petey_Pie it got deleted:/ There are others on ao3 I like, but I started reading fanfic on FFN and I had always went back to FFN after times in ao3. I am finally starting to move over more to ao3 without abandoning FFN, so fics on ao3 would be appreciated!


** All the series from Little0bird on. In canon, lovely, very long, a few too many pregnancy chapters but especially the last one ‘questions and answers'.

** I would say that most stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] (start with “Tales of the Battle”) are pretty low on angst and more on the “family-friendly” scale.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
