I'm looking for stories similar to ones written by TheEndless7. Stuff like Letters and The Quidditch World Cup. I feel like the writing is a step above the regular fics, and it keeps making me cry, while still having happy endings. No slash please.


** FloreatCastellum easily maintains a similar standard of writing within their stories. I highly recommend /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]]/ if you enjoyed /The Pureblood Princess/. It follows Ginny and her adventures during the 7th book with her as the protagonist. Various slice of life elements within it, which is what I enjoyed most about TE7's story.
