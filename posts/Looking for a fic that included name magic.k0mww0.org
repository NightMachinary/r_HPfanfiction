:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I don't remember much about the fic and it could be het/slash/gen, etc. The concept was that some wizards/witches see a... name oracle? Or something like that, when their kids are born to choose names that are appropriate for their lives/destiny. This was the case with Remus (in order to explain the Wolfy Wolf name). I think it was Septima Vector who was explaining it to Harry? I think that magical people could also give up their birth name and take on a specific one to strengthen their connection with a certain field of magic.

I know this isn't a lot to go on, but if anyone could point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it! I've been looking everywhere and it's driving me crazy. Thanks all!


** I know that's a thing in Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. linkffn(11191235)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** Thank you! I read Prince of Slytherin a while back so that definitely might be it. I've been waiting to do a reread once it closer to finished but maybe it's time lol
