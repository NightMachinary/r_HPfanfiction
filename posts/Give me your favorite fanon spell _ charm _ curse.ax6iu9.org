Let us know which fic, who casts it (and why and on whom) and why you like it!

My favorite is the /Dire Misfortune Curse/ in linkffn(Faery Heroes by Silently Watches). The curse causes severe but non lethal bad luck for its victim for two weeks. Harry uses it on Ron for his betrayal of their friendship (and more).

It's the opposite of Felix Felicis in curse form. What's not to like? As Harry puts it:

#+begin_quote
  That's what I love most about it; the curse can't kill you, not that you won't pray it will.
#+end_quote

We don't get an incantation though.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

**** The Arithmancer series is all about spellcrafting. Hermione is really good at it and creates a ton of her own spells for various purposes. The laser spell is one of her more versatile creations. She once uses it to play with Crookshanks, Cedric uses a variation to temporarily blind Voldemort during the graveyard, later it's used against Dementors.

******* Not at all. "Wank" and "bashing" are two of those things that always come down to execution, not content. If you do a crap job of it, then it's wank or bashing. Done well, wank is just badassery. Done well, bashing is just having evil and/or stupid characters doing evil and/or stupid things in a realistic way.

Opinions vary on The Arithmancer, but I loved it. Yeah, it's OP super-genius Hermione but it's well-executed and she's a badass.

She doesn't just ROFL-stomp everyone immediately, but she's able to come up with clever solutions to problems, and after years of learning and growing, she's able to do hyper-advanced maths and spellcrafting on the fly, mid-combat. The lake with the false locket and the ministry battle are two particularly well-executed examples that are /immensely/ satisfying to read.

The thing about the Arithmancer that keeps it from being over the top Hermione-wank is that she doesn't just immediately win at everything, Harry Crow style. She's a world class math prodigy, but within the bounds of reason and actual real-life examples of math prodigies. She has to grow and develop, and ultimately Harry is still the "hero" as the Boy-Who-Lived.

It's a slow story and at first it's painfully stations of canon-y, but I still recommend it highly.

******** Yeah, she doubts herself all the time, gets too involved in "senseless" projects because she /has/ to solve one problem before moving on to the next, and despite her spellcrafting talent, is not a particularly talented or powerful with combat. Her flaws are a good counterbalance to her OP-ness, and my only gripe with the story is its length and how many early chapters don't diverge from canon too much.

******** I mean in this case...

What's light, even lasers, gonna do against a dementor? /Fire/, sure. Fire has long-standing association with both danger/death and life/rebirth/enlightenment. Death for the Dementor, life for the caster. Has to be some special fire, but I can dig it if it's set up properly.

Additionally, the only spell noted to be able to ward off a Dementor is the Patronus Charm. Warm, happy feelings made manifest to ward off the living depression analogies that are the Dementors.

The fuck's a laser, even a magical laser, gonna do?

** How about headcanon? Pulmenti Pulmonum and Pulmenti Cor are latin for Soup of the Lungs and Soup of the Heart. They're charms, ‘cus they change the state of what they hit (food preparation charms, to be exact), but all the same I'm sure it'd be Hard to heal yourself (use your magic At All) if your lungs were reduced to steaming cream of lung soup, while still inside your chest.

I'd additionally imagine it'd kill you as surely as any dark curse.
