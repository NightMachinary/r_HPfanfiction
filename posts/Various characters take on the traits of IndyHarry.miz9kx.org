-Percy Weasley's strict politeness and love of tiny fonts wins him the respect and admiration of Gringotts and he is swiftly declared a Friend of the Goblin Nation

​

-Ron's love for chess and hexing Slytherins results in him becoming a powerful Grey wizard unmatched on the battlefield or in the Wizengamot and known for his careful usage of dark spells to turn Malfoy into various types of rodent

​

-Neville is ridiculously powerful and can do anything whatsoever with magic so long as someone convinces him that it's a spell that he can cast (Though his low self esteem limits this heavily)

​

-When Lucius is in Azkaban Draco goes to Gringotts and discovers that he inherited half a dozen ancient vaults by right of conquest after he sent a group of first year muggleborn hufflepuffs to the hospital wing, Manipulative!Voldemort promptly tells Draco that it is for the greater good of pureblood society that Draco buys and immediately shuts down the company that produces lemon drops
