All that I want in a time travel fic is Harry embarrassed and cringing at James' attempts at looking cool by ruffling his hair. It was Harry's canon reaction, plus it would be way funnier than all the other fics with Harry drooling for James' attention.

Just a thought.


** Imagine Lily and Harry bonding over being exasperated at James' attempts to be "charming"
