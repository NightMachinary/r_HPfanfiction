In most FICS that include the Tri Wizard tournament Harry doesn't risk loosing his magic or life by not competing and lets himself be forced into the tournament. I remember one where he doesn't compete in the second task and the fake Moody collapses and looses his magic since he entered Harry's name, but I've never run into a story where Harry just doesn't compete and does actually loose his magic or die from that are there any fics out there like this?


** I've seen a couple where he did, temporarily, but it came back. Not that the Wizarding World knew it until Voldemort rose again.

  Forewarned Harry makes his escape from Britain, leaving the tournament in shambles. Protected by family, Harry sets about to fulfill his destiny free from the bigotry and manipulation of others.

** Hmm. The closest I've ever seen to this was linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist by ZenoNoKyuubi).

He flatly refuses to compete because he doesn't want to. He's utterly unconcerned about losing his magic or anything like that because regardless of what others may think, he knows that he did not enter himself. He can't violate a magical contract because he isn't in one.

He does end up competing because someone asks him to, so it doesn't fit, but I assume that nothing would have happened to him.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on!

Don't fear the Reaper challenge.

Harry was supposed to be a girl, Hermione was a Lesbian... Death sends Harry back and uses the Goblet to remove all magic from Harry removing the transformation.

(s)he does not lose his magic tho.

  Harry has died for the twelfth time and his Reaper is NOT happy about it. Given a chance to go back to fourth year and do things again, Harry jumps at the opportunity. But what's this about being a girl! Don't Fear the Reaper with a twist. Fem!Harry. FemSlash.
