*** What's the main character like? I hate stories where the MC has gone through horrible shit and is /super/ reserved, panic attacky, freaks out whenever someone touches them, calls themselves stupid or a freak for having romantic or sexual feelings, etc etc.

**** Read the first chapter and youll know how she deals with touchy feely. Its a good fic, read a few chaps before deciding.

**** She's batshit insane and practices all sorts of dark magic. Ridiculously OP with stronger opposition. It's not bad but the whole Voodoo thing gets boring rather quickly IMO. I got through the first part and started the second but the way magic works in that universe put me off. I dislike fics with higher beings in like Death playing a large role, or the fates or whatever the author comes up with so this was simply not my cup of tea.

However, despite disliking the story I have to admit that it was well written and there were no obvious mistakes.

***** How's the Luna? Does the author do her good? Is she used and active enough to make the fic interesting if your more looking for Luna stuff than harry stuff?

****** I only read 1 and 1/5 fic of the series but so far I can say that Harry teases her quite mercilessly while shagging other people during the tournament. The last thing dies down over time but IMO there was too little Luna and too much OP Voodoo magic and borderline satanic rituals. The Luna was good but there was simply too little of her that was not part of some Light/Dark side magic plot that made little sense based on canon magic (Harry getting burned by some white magic jewelry).

I only stuck so far because I was hoping for more Luna but that never really came.

Then I found "The silent world of Cassandra Evans" which is absolutely crack and Harry/Cassandra is even more OP (like in I killed 15 Death Eaters because I can without breaking a sweat) but it is really fun to read. It has a lot of tropes like the mysterious sibling but it has more than one unique twist to these tropes. It is Harry/Susan with Luna/Ginny and Hermione/Harry's half sister in the background. Luna is absolutely gold in the story and it is probably one of the funniest stories in the fandom IMO. The sequel is being updated regularly.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

** Now its not Fem Harry/Luna Lovegood. But a kind of/maybe/somewhat if you squint similar but all around pretty good fic is Linkffn(Bound With Silver Threads). Its a Lily Luna Potter/Malfoy's daughter fic that encompasses LLP's 3-7 years at Hogwarts and focuses on her relationships from family, friends, and eventually coming to terms with her sexuality. Malfoy's daughter (Scorpius' little sister) in it is a little withdrawn not quite spacey like Luna but am alright character.

  Lily Luna Potter years 3-7. Why is she stuck with a Little Malfoy tag-along? What do the coming years hold for them and everyone else? How will they change and grow, what will happen as they do, & who will end up with whom? Eventual femslash. Multiple pairings. Lily/OC. Also stars Scorpius Malfoy's OC little sister. Not T until Chap 29, really not until Chap 32 & nothing too major.
