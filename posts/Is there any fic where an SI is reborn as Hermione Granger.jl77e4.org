Unfortunately, there does seem to be a dearth of Hermione SI's.

  Salazar Slytherin is reborn as Hermione Granger. With her new identity as a muggleborn girl and her old reputation in tatters, Hermione sets out to start a new life for herself, a resurrection for House Slytherin, and a renaissance for the whole of the magical society.

  They don't question why Hermione Granger is able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seems to know Hogwarts: A History by heart. They never really notice her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. A Gryffindor meant for Ravenclaw, they call her- and yet...Who would've thought that once upon a time, her name was Salazar?Year 1: Salazar Slytherin is reincarnated as a "booksmart" muggleborn girl, a debutante again in a much changed magical world. The plan for the year should have been perfectly simple: be insignificant, stay uninvolved, and observe instead of jumping right into action like a certain somebody. However, upon arriving at Hogwarts to find Slytherin house overrun by blood-purists, a murderer on the staff, a treasure on the third floor and over-adventurous children all around, even the serpent lord starts to find it difficult to stay out of trouble...

  Albus Dumbledore once said "[...] death is but the next great adventure," but when a premature death causes her to 'wake up' as Cordelia, Hermione Granger's older Muggle sister before the events of HP canon, she calls BS. What's an SI supposed to do if she's not around Hogwarts to help save the day?
