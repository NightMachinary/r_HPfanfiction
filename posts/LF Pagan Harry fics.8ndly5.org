Fics that deal with pagan gods


** linkffn(3766574)

Be warned, its a massive story, and the pagan aspect isn't central to it, though it does pop up often enough once it gets going.

***** And it's freaking amazing.

I am baffled someone would write that much and abandon it so close to the end.

****** I am baffled by the fact that so many fanfic writers just stopped when the series ended, leaving behind so many unfinished fics.

** It doesn't technically appear (on page) until the next chapter, but my current story has the characters's pagan religious beliefs and rituals play a major role (it's only been mentioned so far).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12834801/1/The-Coven-of-Albion]])

Reclamation of Black Magic (which I took inspiration from) also has such rituals, but it hasn't yet shown gods on page or anything like that.
