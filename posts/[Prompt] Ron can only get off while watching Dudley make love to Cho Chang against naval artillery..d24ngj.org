** So far there's no voyeur Ron, but if anyone /did/ want some Chudley content, I'm working on this:

Excellent pun, by the way - it elicited just the right amount of barely restrained rage

#+begin_quote
  JK Rowling once said in an interview that she thought about having Dudley have a magical child on platform 9 3/4s at the end of book seven, but decided that no magical blood could survive contact with Vernon Dursley's DNA. In a long list of ideas she got wrong about what should happen to her characters post-canon, I've always thought that this was pretty near the top.Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he has an encounter that will uproot the course of his life, change his relationship with his cousin and his parents, and introduce him to some really fun new alcoholic beverages.Mostly non-ship focused, but there are plenty of relationships happening in the background. Despite my reservations, this mostly takes the Harry Potter epilogue as written, but makes a few significant changes the plot revolves around.

**** No idea, until I was a few thousand words in I didn't realise that I wasn't the first person to come up with it! Turns out I'm less clever than I think.

Thanks a lot for checking it out! A new chapter should be posted pretty soon.

***** Just finished it. I'm real interested in seeing where this goes! I like all the fluff and look forward to the development of the Cho/Dudley relationship dynamic as well as how Dudley reacts to the rest of the Wizarding World and magic now that he's an adult. One small common error I noticed though...it's 'Parvati' not 'Parvarti.'

Looking forward to seeing your next chapter! :)

** So... if this were actually the case, Ron would never know. Because who would ever willingly subject themselves to that?

Therefore, here's the following scene:

Harry: So... you've never had the hots for anyone.

Ron: Far as I know, yeah. I never really got why people liked snogging so much. I mean, I kinda get it. But it just doesn't appeal to me, y'know.

Hermione: Ron, you're asexual.

Ron: I'm pretty sure we just established that I'm not.

Hermione: Not a sexual, asexual. It means that that you don't like anyone in that way.

Ron: Bit of a confusing name if you ask me.

Harry: If anything, you're Quidditch-sexual.

Ron: Nah, mate. That's you.

Harry: What?

Hermione: Oh, honestly. You've only ever had things with Quidditch players, Harry.

Harry: No I haven't.

Ron: Really? Name one crush you've had who isn't a Quidditch player.

Harry: Well, you don't see me pinning over Victor Krum, do you?

Hermione: That's not answering the question, Harry.

Harry: Uh... Um... Oh. /blushes/ You're right...

Ron: Thought so. And besides, that was different. I only like him for his seeker skills, the last thing I'd want to think about is snogging Krum.

Harry: You probably would if he joined the Chudley Cannons though.

Ron: ... Yeah, probably.

Hermione: /blushes profusely/
