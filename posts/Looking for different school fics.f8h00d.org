** Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi is a story where Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived and Harry ends up transferring to Durmstrang. Incomplete, but really well written. My favorite WBWL fic since Harry and his family actually get along.

BadWolfe reposted the Santi's Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, plus all of the extra chapters that were posted on DLP, onto ao3. (They acknowledged they weren't the original author)

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21393430/chapters/50965216]])

the original link (that doesn't have the extra DLP chapters) is here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]]
