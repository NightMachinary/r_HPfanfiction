Lily cannot be killed as her soul inhabits the closest animal - eventually Snape finds out (i forgot how) and he brings her back to life in the Forbidden Forest. I remember reading this fic, but I forgot what it was called.


** linkffn(Obscura Nox Animae)

I was 80-ish percent through it before I dropped it because nothing ever happens. It's just a slog to work through.

I mean I get it's character- and not plot-focused, but that were a lot of words to say "Lily got eventually turned into a human, fought a bit with Severus, and absolutely did nothing except hide in a room."

*** I always find it hilarious in this fic that Harry finds out his mom's not dead, has had a body for the last few years, yet hasn't contacted him, instead choosing to fuck Snape and have his babies, and his reaction is basically, 'eh'.

Spoilers for those who haven't read it yet and want to discover on their own.

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.
