** 35k word update... Loving these big, juicy updates.

I know people say they get fatigue with chapters over 6k words, but the meatiness is great for commute reading where you can save your place on an app.

*** I am always surprised when Violet apologizes for long chapters, because I personally could read a 100k chapter and still hunger for more, real life commitments be damned:)

*** I personally like my chapters around 10k words or more. Less feels too short.

** I'm excited for a new chapter of this story, I love the world building in this series. It doesn't hurt i like the Lioness series that is mixed in too.

â€‹

That said, Does anyone know the full name of the S.O.W. Party?\\
I know that the full name must have been dropped in full somewhere in the Pureblood Pretense, and then only called the acronym ever since. I can't remember nor find the full name to save my life.

*** Save Our World Party. And additionally, back when it was the C.O.W. Party, it stood for Cure Our World Party. That was too straightforwardly bigoted so they changed it to something more subtle. Archie's full explanation is in ch 12 of Linkffn(The Ambiguous Artifice by murkybluematter)

#+begin_quote
  Harriet Potter is back for a fourth year of quietly masquerading as her pureblooded cousin in order to pursue her dream. There are those in the Wizarding World who refuse to see her fade into the background, however, and when the forces she's been ignoring conspire to bring her to the fore, it will take everything she has to see her artifice through. Alanna the Lioness take on HP4.
