I remember a great start to a story that has been abandoned for about 6 years now where Harry in second year after Lockheart's Dueling club and the threats of the Heir, Harry starts training under Flitwick who teaches him the 4 duelist schools which were established by the 4 Founders, it created a great history.

Linkffn(The Apprentice by Cassiel of Silence)

Any thing else in the same vein where Harry gets tutelage from Flitwick on combat


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7308781/1/][*/The Apprentice/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3140499/Cassiel-of-Silence][/Cassiel of Silence/]]

#+begin_quote
  Having realized that he desperately needs to learn to defend himself, and disillusioned with Lockhart's Duelling Club, Harry finds himself a proper teacher; none other than retired Grandmaster Filius Flitwick. AU. Part 1 of Grandmaster and Apprentice.

** Combat is not equal to dueling. A perfect example is linkffn(circular reasoning) way of fighting. It is extremely different from linkffn(harry potter and the untitled tome). The first fic is viseral and the latter is more disciplined.

On that note: linkffn(harry potter and riders of the apocalypse) is potter-flitwick mentorship. Same with linkffn(i'm still here).
