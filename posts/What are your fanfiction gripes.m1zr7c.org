** 1. Retelling of canon with very minor changes.
2. Too much OOC-ness. I can stand a different personality if their past is different or such but a sudden change without a proper explanation is just off putting
3. I am an avid reader of Harry√óTom but I dislike fics where Harry joins Voldemort and just stands by while he slaughters people, whether there be bashing or not. One of Harry's defining personality feature is that he saves people and I hate that he just stops caring for people just because ron/hermione/Dumbledore/molly/ginny betrayed him. I prefer reading fics where Tom and Harry come to a compromise.
4. Too sweet Draco. This could come under OOC but yeah. Such a turn off.
5. Post-war fics which just show a happy ending. Where's the trauma? I'm not saying it should be overwritten but they were 17 years olds who were tortured and saw war right at their footsteps. That's bound to leave some amount of PTSD.

THIS!!!!! Like I don't understand why it's so hard for people to realize that they've seen friends die, family die, people being tortured, and all that jazz. Suddenly you have Voldemort being beaten and nobody has PTSD/PTSS. That irritates me, because it removes the entire effect of the war, removes the fact that Voldemort was a threat--even if they knew he was dead, and so many other things

**** ikr !! it's so ignorant. when I was young, I didn't go much into the details about it but now, at 19, I loathe the idea of children leading a war with no guidance. I can understand that it was for the sake of the story and plot but man, does it rub me the wrong way. that's partially the reason why I avoid post-war fics in HP. maybe I'm biased but even the MCU fandom has better post-war fics. they deal with PTSD, nightmares, etc and they are adults. thrice the age of the HP people. and are trained for the situation with the exception of Tony and even that's stretching it. Heck, even Naruto fics deal better with trauma than this.

On the other hand, I think you would appreciate this fic.

So you probably don't like the movies, right? I mean, the way Harry appeared at Hogwarts in the last film, expelled Snape and all the students went into battle without any plans to evacuate the younger students, it seemed very childish.

And I know what you meant about post-war, not during the war, but the last few films made it seem so easy that I'm not even sure why they would have PTSD (for example, Sirius died and a week later Harry is causally flirting like a waitress).

And for example, Ron in the books was screaming for Hermione when she was being tortured by Bellatrix and was angry by Fred's death while in the movies ... He doesn't even seem bothered by anything, except when he left camp.

In short, perhaps many people were more accustomed to the movies rather than reading the books and thinking about it.

****** I'm not gonna lie, I have only seen bits and pieces of the movies so as to just put a face to the characters. I have never sat down and watched one completely. But I agree with you. I have seen enough posts to know that the movies weren't even half as good as the books. But then again, very few movie adaptations are up to par with the book version.

  You don't get away with writing an epilogue nineteen years later, giving all these people kids and jobs and telling us they ended up just as their parents were before. These kids fought a war, they didn't leave it unscathed. People died, people were murdered, and they had to go on with this loss in their bones the rest of their lives, with a flinch at every sudden sound and sudden movement, with a cold rattling in their lungs; they had to learn to live again. I want to read about the aftermath. I want to read about everything not being well, but maybe, just maybe, well enough.

  ‚ÄúHarry Potter,‚Äù comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. ‚ÄúIt seems I have finally caught you.‚Äù

  Though it's not a deal-breaker and it works better in some stories, I'm just not into everyone growing up to be super attractive. Not that I'm picturing them as ugly, but I like the idea of them being just kind of normal good-looking or quirky good-looking rather than models.

I can never agree too much with this sentiment. Not all people are super gorgeous and that's fine and I rather like reading about people that are plain or unconventionally attractive because that's /relatable/ and /realistic/.

** My biggest gripe is when authors purposely sacrifice their story for reads. Like, if you're going to create a story with a Romione pairing and in the middle switch from them trying to figure everything out to talking about marrying one another with no explanation as to why, you're hurting your story.

** Hermione Granger is the biggest genius to ever genius and can create anything and do anything. Often with the author ignoring her flaws or downplaying them even more than Rowling did in canon.

Harry immediately trusting Griphook and making him his account manager/etc. I mean, I don't mind helpful goblin tropes, the books (regardless of what some fans say) don't portray them as evil or untrustworthy as a species. But the author deciding to have Harry meta-wise choose the one goblin who DID betray him and trust him? Just silly.

"This fic is totally realistic and artistic and yadda yadda, unlike those OTHER icky fics." Anytime the author feels the need to bash other fanfictions in the description, I close the window.

#+begin_quote
  A month after the Battle of Hogwarts, war-scarred, pre-Auror recruit Harry has a new target: Antonin Dolohov, the man who killed Remus Lupin. When a tip from Malfoy leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione into an ambush, however, Harry's Master of Death power awakens and sends him---and Malfoy---to the time of Dolohov's first murder in 1978. As Harry and Draco struggle to find their way home while (re)doing their seventh year at Hogwarts, Voldemort is at the height of his power in the First Wizarding War. And, despite not being born yet, he's still targeting Harry. Harry and Draco fight for their lives and their future, burdened with the knowledge of what will happen to everyone around them. The Marauders, on the other hand, are more concerned with pranks, love, and N.E.W.T.s than the war outside the castle.
