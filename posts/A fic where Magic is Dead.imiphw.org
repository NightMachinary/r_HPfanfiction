:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hermione remembers her life in Hogwarts, but she can't find anything related to the magical world. She starts traveling to Hogwarts, and meets Snape on the way, who also remembers.

They get to Hogwarts, which is an old ruin. I think that's about where the story ends.

This was the first Harry Potter fanfic I ever read, so I'd really appreciate if you guys could help me.

*** Can I just say how awesome it is that a SSHG fic made it to the top of this sub, even for a day? It's amazing, how those that put it in the title get downvoted immediately, but those that can describe the plot without mentioning the ship can get hundreds of upvotes because of how good that shit really is??? In the "Myth and Magic" fic, we're talking about a post-war adventure/romance with a bittersweet ending -- some of the best SSHG ever written, without even a tiny bit of weasely-bashing, or muggle-wank, or any of the /other/ top haters around here. Seriously, if you're here, about to downvote because SSHG disgusts you, I implore you to actually read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2758970/chapters/6185402][this fic]] and reconsider.

**** Not strange at all! Please click on my username and take a look at the other rec's I've made in the past few days. It's so shitty how we have to avoid actually typing the letters SSHG. This sub has a real problem with our ship, even when it's post-war adult-relationship not that it has to be. I still remember 2002 when we couldn't imagine much beyond a 7th-year special project or apprenticeship, and there is so much more since then that... It's a rich world and a pair of intellectuals is a perfect ship to explore it!!!

It's when Hermione is still underage that it gets weird and unfortunately, I've accidentally read too many of those to escape with my innocence intact.

I havent read that fic yet (only a few paragraphs into the first chapter), but it fits the magic is dead prompt. Not sure about it fitting anything else in your ask though since, I havent read too far into it yet. Looks like its tagged for slash though, so it might not be what you're looking for.
