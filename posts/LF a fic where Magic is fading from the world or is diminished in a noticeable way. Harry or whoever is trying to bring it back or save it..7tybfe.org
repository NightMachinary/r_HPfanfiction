I've read a few where it's mentioned that modern day wizards think that magic was more powerful in the days of the Founders and before with stuff like Atlantis and whatnot, but usually it's just a passing thought and not too relevant to the plot. Sometimes too, there are stories where pureblood inbreeding or some such nonsense has lead to wizards being less powerful, this sort of plot would be acceptable too, so long as part of the story hinges on efforts made to make wizards more powerful again.

I'm thinking something like how in LoTR magic is leaving the world and the Rings of Power were sort of used to prevent it. Well, the Elves used their rings for that purpose. Another example would be Game of Thrones, where Magic is returning to the world after being weak for so long, but that doesn't fit exactly because as far as we know, there is no character that is actively working towards that goal that we know of.

The only fanfic with this theme I've seen is linkffn(11255223) The Wizard of Harrenhal, where a MoD goes to the GoT universe and his main goal is to get home or bring back magic/make magic more powerful.


** There's one by nonjon that might fit the bill. It's a crossover with Firefly set in an alternate future where mankind has left earth (earth became inhospitable but I forgot why) and the Wizards left with them, however they find their future generation losing magic. Harry is searching for the remnants of the magical civilization (?) linkffn(2857962) Edit: I didn't know about Firefly when I read it and yet found it enjoyable.

** In the HP fic I'm writing, magic waxes and wanes, which I use as the basis to build the history of evolution of the world, and the beginning of the current waning period in the last millenium BCE led to a series of events that created the societal traumas and tropes that eventually gave rise to anti-non-human-sentient-ism and anti-mundanism.

I am not yet sure if I will address the issue directly, though.

If I do, it will be towards the end of the Voldie arc, or the long-term aftermath.
