#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter may be the brother of the Boy-Who-Lived and his parents may still be alive, but that doesn't mean everything is perfect. While he may not want anything to do with the upcoming war between Light and Dark, he'll end up walking between them. An AU fanfic involving Harry Potter as a Ravenclaw and based off Neither Light nor Dark: Steelclaws & Gray Coats.

** That's the direction my fic /Cleaved/ is going in, but it's more business than strictly magical healing. Fem!Harry and her Muggle friend work to bring medical potions to the non-magical world. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13382072/1/Cleaved]]); linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20553980/chapters/48790226]]).

My other favourites are /Harry Potter, Healing Hands/ (incomplete, but I messaged the author who's expressed interest in getting back to it) linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6585807/1/Harry-Potter-Healing-Hands]]), where at the end of 3rd year Harry decides to become a Healer, and /The Mapmakers/ linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14447502]]), a Marauders-era fic where Lily Evans is training to become a Healer in her 6th year with Vold War 1 happening in the background.

/Reparations/ linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879599]]) is a Harry/Draco slash healing fic.

/After the End/ linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1/]]) has Ginny become a healer. It's a really old fic though (2001-2003).

  v. split or sever (something). AU. The Muggle world was meant to be a safe location for Holly Potter to live until she began Hogwarts. But with a Squib-born friend, a hidden Muggle education, and a clandestine potion-making business, the Wizarding World will get more than it expected from the Girl-Who-Lived. Subversion on the usual trope. Years 1-4.
