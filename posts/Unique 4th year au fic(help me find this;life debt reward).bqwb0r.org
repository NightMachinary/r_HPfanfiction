** So, you want to flair this post with the “What's that fic?” flair, this is used when you need to find a specific fic like Denarian Renegade. This helps people who sort by flairs see your post and answer it.

Also, we're all nice here, you don't need to reward us, least of all with a life debt. A simple thanks will do fine.

*** "we're all nice here, you don't need to reward us" I completely agree. Your reply is a perfect example of that. You criticized my post and didn't even write anything relevant to what I asked. (Also for future notice to anyone who reads this post,the life debt part was a joke. I honestly thought people would realise this without it being said but I was wrong.) Second of all,I don't know how to flair my post. I'm new here. So forgive my ignorance, oh kind and helpful person. Edit: I actually found out that out of my 4 post,one of them was flaired. I honestly don't know how I did it.

**** yeah, I realize that I was being really quite rude there, and I apologize for that. Anyways, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/meta/flair][Here]] is the guide on using flairs.
