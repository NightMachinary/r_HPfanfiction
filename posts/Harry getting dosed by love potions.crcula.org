Preferably by a fangirl. who forces him to drink it.

I don't mind how long it lasts. thanks.


** I've only read one fic that really goes in-depth into what Harry would feel during and after being love potioned: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14164617/][An Hour of Wolves]]. It's very well written, but definitely not a happy story.

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

Yeah, it's very well written but I had to stop reading because it was making me feel miserable.
