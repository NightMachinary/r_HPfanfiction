  Alchemy is the art of permanently turning one element into another. That's something muggles can do, too. One-shot where Hermione kills Voldemort by nuking Malfoy Manor.

** Fandom - Harry Potter

Rating - T

Title - Cleaved

Genre - Gen

Links - linkffn(13382072) linkao3(20553980)

Summary - v. split or sever (something). AU. Holly Potter was to be raised in the Muggle World for her safety, return to the Wizarding World at eleven, and leave her deplorable family behind. But between a squib-born friend, a secret education, and a suspicious business running, the Wizarding World will get more than it expected from the Girl-Who-Lived. Years 1-4.

A/N: This story is not beta'd. I use Grammarly with the British-English setting on, but as it's not always accurate, I will try to portray the characters accurately. Tips, suggestions, comments, compliments, and critiques are welcomed as long as there are no flames.

I noticed there was a lack of positive Muggle influences in canon (so that Harry and the readers could connect with the Wizarding world) and fanon (to avoid Mugglewank). This story is meant to highlight the positives and negatives of both worlds and show different perspectives. I will attempt to keep canon rehashing to a minimum, but there will be some canon passages here and there.
