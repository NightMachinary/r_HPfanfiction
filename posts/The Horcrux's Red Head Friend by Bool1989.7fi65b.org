The story is based off of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux).

In Accidental Horcrux, Voldemort wakes up in Harry's head, and becomes a teacher for him. Its very good and features a competent Dumbledore.

In linkffn(The Horcrux's Red Head Friend), Ron is a self insert, who befriends Harry, and becomes something of an unknown rival for him, createding internal politics and plans within plans.

Hope you enjoy!


** Sounds interesting, if I haven't read accidental horcrux would I be super lost?

*** I have read both and I don't think you would because the horcruxes red head friend is from self insert!Rons perspective. It also starts at the beginning.

** So I started reading it and one thing confuses me. Ron initially seems to have canon knowledge, seeing as he expected Harry to show up at the train station and comments that Hogwarts doesn't look like the movie depiction and knows about wormtail. However he doesn't seem to recognize Hagrid or McGonagall when he first encounters them. After that he is surprised by Harry's sorting and comments about muggles and realizes he isn't in the canon verse so he doesn't appear to have been obliviated, unless I'm misremembering the order of when that thought happens. But then later he completely forgets about the troll incident, which even given he knows he isn't in canon he should have recognized once Hermione is crying in the bathroom, or when the troll actually shows up. Plus his internal thoughts regarding Hermione don't really seem to match someone who is aware she is a main character.

*** He does recognize Hagrid and Mcgonagall, but they haven't really become real people to him yet, you know what I mean? Like, they don't feel like real people until the later chapters.

About Hermione, Yeah i've been given shit about that before, and I'm planning on editing those chapters soon.

  "So let me get this straight," I said slowly. "for causing a scene, humiliating your housemate, and nearly getting yourself killed, Snape didn't give you a detention, but instead made you seeker of the Quidditch team?" "Basically," replied Harry. Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux recursive fanfiction, Self Insert.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** I just recently finished all you had up. I'm following it on ffn.net now. The fic holds up for someone who hasn't read the original fanfic (if you were wondering). I saw a review bash you for rehashing stuff from the original fic. Personally, I hope you keep letting it stand on its own.

I'm very curious what's going on with Ron's memory. My guess is it has something to do with the vow he made, although I'm not sure how that would affect his thoughts over just spilling Harry's secrets outloud.

Having said that, the self insert Ron is kind of odd. Its weird we don't know anything about the person he once was or that he never mourns his lost life or even just thinks about it. Even if it has been a long time since he was that person, you'd think it would still come up in his internal thoughts sometimes.

He also doesn't seem to take advantage of any future knowledge much (like forgetting the troll incident). Was leaving Sirius in prison (despite knowing he's innocent) ever addressed? I admit I might have missed it.

*** No, Ron was erasing his memory everytime he found out about Harry and voldemort. After the Fourth time he figured that his occlumency was good enough that he didn't have to worry about Harry finding out.

About leaving Sirius in prison. The thing is, Ron doesn't know who to trust in that regard. He doesn't trust Dumbledore, simply because he's read too many fanfics were Dumbledore was a manipulative coot, and Ron is a afraid of memory charms. In this case, All Ron thinks he can do is make sure Peter Pettigrew remains in his cage, and he has also spelled the cage unbreakable. He also regularly casts the confundus charm on him.

Regarding the troll insident: Ron hasn't read the books in years, so he probably would have forgotten about the event, as it was a relatively minor event that took place in first year. As for why he didn't follow Harry, well it was a troll, and Ron wasn't sure that he could survive one. He is a slytherin after all.

I haven't written about his past life because it hasn't come up plot wise. That might change in the future.

**** Thanks for the reply. That makes sense. I hope my criticism didn't make it seem like I'm not enjoying your fic. Its one of the most enjoyable self inserts I've come across.
