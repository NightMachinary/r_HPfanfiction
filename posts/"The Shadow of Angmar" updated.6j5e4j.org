#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

***** As long as you know that there are elves, dragons, and some of the basic lore (Elrond and that) most of it is pretty self explanatory. It's been years since I've consumed any of the actual lotr media, and I still thoroughly enjoyed it

***** It is probably quite enjoyable not knowing much of Tolkein's legendarium, but it also probably is even more enjoyable if you do. Since I do know too much about it I can't entirely judge, but I'd try it out and see were I you.
