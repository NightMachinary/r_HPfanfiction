A lot of people would recommend reading 'Oh God Not Again' linkffn(4536005) and 'Seventh Horcrux' linkffn(10677106), as would I. They are hilarious, generally lighthearted fics with a hyper-competent Harry -- fics where Harry isn't accused of being a Gary-Stu -- which got me thinking: why?

Is it the overall tone of the story: parody? Because I have enjoyed relatively serious fanfics, where Harry (or anyone else) is OP, yet they are still well-rounded characters. Core Threads linkffn(10136172), while not the /best/ fanfic, is still enjoyable to read -- even if this version of Harry would turn Voldemort into red paste with a blink of an eye. What separates Gary-Stu!Harry from a likeable OP!Harry, when everything else is written to a high standard?


** Sues (and thus, Stus) are characterized by 3 things: lack of conflict, lack of failure, and perhaps most important, lack of effort/struggle.

If we see a Harry Potter who has spent all of his free time studying, learning, practicing, and generally improving himself during his years at hogwarts, it wouldn't be too far-fetched if he could match Voldemort in a duel---or at least last for a while against him---without relying on the brother wands nonsense.

If he'd spent six or seven years learning, making mistakes and learning from them, /improving/, then him being a powerful wizard would be /earned/, and he wouldn't be a sue, because defeating Voldemort is the endgame.

On the other hand, if the story was more slice-of-life and about relationships or just schoolkid nonsense (or even about how cool magic is), then Harry being extremely powerful wouldn't make him a sue---it doesn't help him with his conflicts, and he can still struggle with a love life of some sort, or his friendships. It could even be a detriment, ostracizing him from jealous friends or making it difficult to make them in the first place.

However, in that same story, if /everyone/ instantly became his friend, and no one had any issues about him being powerful/wealthy/famous/etc and they never fought or argued and they always listened to him and all that nonsense, he would very much be a sue, because he would never struggle against anything, and never find conflict.

The most important part about making a relatable character is making that character /struggle/. It doesn't have to be extremely difficult or impossible, and it doesn't have to be omnipresent or constant, but it must require some form of growth to overcome. That change, that /growth/, is what makes the characters relatable and solid.

There are some cases where an author writes in conflict for the main character, but it still counts as a Sue. Typically the author wants to have some drama/angst in their story, but all the characters who are critical of the Sue are portrayed as irrational and unlikable. It's a black-and-white portrayal designed to make the Sue look tragically brave rather than actually point out weaknesses that the character needs to overcome.

As you said, growth/change after conflict is a good sign that a character is not a Sue, but I'd argue that it's also important for the opposing characters to not be two-dimensional.

**** Paging [[/u/Murphy540]], because I want to address you both.

When you start considering Anti-Sues and pseudo-Sues, things get a bit more complex.

In the case of Anti-Sues (generally "unlikeable" or "evil" characters /in universe/), despite being "flawed" characters that might "grow," their very presence still strangles the plot. The world still bends to accommodate their main-character status, and rather than smothering a story with sugar, they become an edginess black-hole from which nothing, not even plot, can escape. Picture just about every Evil!Dark!Harry story that has more than the tiniest traces of bashing.

Contrast that to pseudo-Sue. It's not a well-known phenomenon, or even a common one, as I'd imagine that most who try for this end up with a genuine Sue or get labeled as such by the more plebian readers, but it does happen. In essence, a pseudo-Sue is a Sue-like character at first glance, but whose Sue traits are what /enable/ the plot, rather than kill it. The few examples of this I can think of all fall into the "wacky shenanigans" type of story, where the plot is less a struggle against a conflict and more a chronicle of a chain of events, where the goal of the story is the journey, not the destination.

For example, I suggest you look at /Core Threads, Taylor Varga/, and I/t Gets Worse/ - the latter two of which are /Worm/ fanfics rather than /Harry Potter/ ones. Each of these focus on a stupidly overpowered character that strangles any possible conflict.

- Core Threads: Harry Accidently gains the ability to grow infinitely in magical power. As his power grows, so does the scale of his group's antics until he's accidentally subsuming entire universes just by visiting there.
- Taylor Varga: Taylor gains the ability to turn into an invincible demon lizard. The story is her simply living her life (while innocently gaslighting her entire city through her ongoing prank). The entertaining part is how her antics are slowly infecting the city; the story implies she's an apocalypse waiting to happen and that she's malicious enough, when angered, to drive people to near-suicidal insanity. Conflict /can't/ happen, but conflict is also not why the story even exists.
- It Gets Worse: Taylor gets Sue-ness as a /superpower./ The universe literally conspires to humiliate any who would dare hurt her with as much lethality as they intended to inflict upon her. The story is a series of setups and punchlines, in which "rising stakes" are the buildup to the joke; you know, by the story's premise, that she's going to make it out alive, but you're there to read /how/.

The tl;dr of this is that the ultimate definition of what is and what is not a sue is simple: /do I want to keep reading about this plot-hogging protagonist?/ If yes, it's story, not an author's fanwank of their own creation.

** I think it's okay for stories to have a gary-stu, it's just how they're used that makes a difference. In those first two fics they're being used to create humorous situations and because the fics are both comedy it's actually helping the fics instead.

If the main conflict of the fic is defeating Voldemort then making a Gary Stu Harry would make that conflict a non-issue. If it's purely a romance then it's fine because it doesn't matter.

An example I think is linkffn(Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is). In this one Harry is very OP and he actually did curb-stomp Voldie. But for me it's okay because this fic is actually about family, about Harry experiencing being the big brother of Sirius and Regulus. Voldemort was used as a tool to show how far Harry would go for his brothers.

But because the others aren't praising him for it (most of the time) but vary between morbid curiosity and disgust he does not come across as a Stu.

Incredibly powerful characters which normally means Harry is very tough to pull off because you have to think what makes the Harry Potter series special, to me that's Harry being Harry and friendship.... So when you change those, you have to have a real good story... And it's hard to create one when your character needs no help(hence no friends) and they normally end up being Harry turning dark saying F**K everything and every single woman in the Harry Potter world the author likes falling madly in love with harry and him screwing them all ...

** Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus is the best OP!Harry I have come across. And she (Fem!Harry) is REALLY overpowered. (also, i wouldn't consider seventh horcrux as OP!Harry). I think it comes down to the ease at which they solve their problems. As a reader, I want suspense and doubt as to whom will come out victor. Conflicts don't have to against other characters. And particularly with OP! characters, the main conflicts should NOT be duels. Relationships, internal conflicts, politics, and humor, would pose more challenge. Also, there needs to be a plausible reason why the OP! character doesn't use his/her powers to solve problems that can be resolved as such. The more plausible the reason, the better the story.

**** Hope you'll forgive the wall of text, I got on a bit of a roll.

I think I know what you mean. But also within fanfiction, canon isn't strictly adhered to. By making Harry prodigious or powerful, /that/ application of power becomes the thing he will bring to bear against his opposition rather than his canonical good fortune. If you make Harry more skilled, he must use that skill to some degree, otherwise you've wasted your words as an author.

It would be a little tricky for an author to define what involvement "luck" has canonically and either increase or decrease it. Instead I would imagine that having more dangerous enemies would constitute "worse luck" compared to the canon story. For example, it would be unlucky for Hermione to be killed by a more dangerous spell in the Department of Mysteries in book 5, or perhaps have her be incapacitated for a period of months or permanently maimed due to spell damage.

This might be an interesting starting off point for a story, where Hermione's injury at Harry's impulsive actions give him the impetus to become more skilled so his friends no longer get hurt.

In the same line of thinking - perhaps unluckiness doesn't simply elevate the power of the adversary (in the power creep you mentioned) - it simply makes the outcome more impactful in any confrontation. For example, Dobby /had/ to die because he saved Harry. If Dobby hadn't died then Harry wouldn't have "sacrificed" something to get to safety.

It is straightforward from there to analyse canon events and say "if something could go wrong in this situation, what could feasibly go /very/ wrong?" -- if we removed Harry's "luck factor" entirely, what are the lasting consequences or short-term losses sustained? And then because of the losses of resources or allies - what /else/ could happen as a result. Say Dobby doesn't die, but he's unable to get Hermione out of the cellar. Then Hermione is put in front of Voldemort and legilimized, THEN Voldemort knows that they know of the Horcruxes.

I would say that Harry possessed a certain competence, the Patronus Charm learned at age 13 allowed him to survive an attempt on his life two years later at the start of The Order of the Phoenix when the Dementers were sent after him in Little Whinging. Harry wins the little battles through competence, he wins the war through "sheer dumb luck" and the capabilities and resources of his allies.

Here are a few ideas I had that could feasibly happen because Harry's luck "ran out":

*Book One:*

- Kidnapped/assaulted in Diagon Alley.

- Followed home from Diagon alley by a person who means harm

- Immediately mobbed by reporters. Hounded as a celebrity

- Injured by falling off his jinxed Quidditch broom.

- Injured by the wraith/voldemort in the Forbidden Forest

- Injured by Centaurs / Acromantulas in the Forbidden Forest.

- When burning Quirrell's face with his hands, Harry's hands are also burned.

...

*Book Two:*

So many....

- Ginny does way worse under the control of the diary Horcrux.

- The Basilisk is much more dangerous, people die rather than become petrified.

- When pierced by the Basilisk tooth, /even with phoenix tears/ his arm is destroyed by the venom.

...

There's so many ways you can take these canon events and craft interesting dilemmas for the characters to deal with.

***** By "luck" I was mostly meaning Harry's enemies holding the idiot ball when confronting him, so that he never actually faces the full brunt of Voldemort's powers. One example off the top of my head: Harry tells Voldemort he's the master of the Elder Wand. By this point Harry's holly wand is dead. Voldemort could have played it safe and just switched back to his yew wand without any risk of priori incantatem, at which point he would have beaten Harry in short order.

Basically, plot armour situations. Take away the plot armour and Harry would need to be massively more competent to win the war.

** [[/u/Murphy540]] already gave you a very good answer, but I think it needs to be clarified.

OP!Harry isn't as closely related to Mary Sue / Gary Stu Harry as you probably think. Sure, a large subset of Gary Stus are probably also overpowered, but I wouldn't consider it the most defining attribute.

The origin of the term is in relation to female characters: It's applied to 'perfect' women and those women are rarely overly powerful (probably because a too powerful woman would be scary for many men and thus less than perfect). Mary Sues have no characteristics of their own: They are silent when it is right to be silent, they are loud when it is required to be loud. They are rogues when necessary and follow duty when being a rogue would be to their disadvantage. They are beautiful, but never vain, arrogant or conceited. Even out of hindsight they are almost always correct (because of author fiat) and when they give a spirited speech everyone is very impressed by their wisdom, charisma and intelligence.

When it comes to Harry as a Gary Stu being super powerful is more acceptable for men than women, so you'll probably see very powerful Gary Stus more often than Mary Sues, but all those other things are still required to make Harry a Gary Stu. For me the most revealing indicator of it is when they have no consistent characterization and instead always behave in a way that makes them look good and/or succeed.

It depends on the fanfiction you're reading. Prince of Slytherin, for instance, has Harry as rather powerful but he plays the Slytherin politics game while dealing with being distant from his living parents and his twin brother that was sorted into Gryffindor and is believed to be the Chosen One while Harry was thought to be a squib until he got his Hogwarts letter.

******* I find that light novel hilariously entertaining.

As far as a recent portrayal of Gary Stu(s), I would turn my attention towards the Fast and Furious series and the Mission Impossible series.

None of which, IMO, is supposed to be taken super seriously. So, you can indulge in the spectacle in front of your eyes. You know they arent going to lose, but you want to see what death defying stunt they do next, and that in and of itself is entertainment.

** I only read OP!whatever stories when I don't have to take them entirely seriously. This means that a bit of humor or parody will make me much more likely to enjoy the read, but even without those I can decide the time was well spent if the protagonist's personality is alright.

In the case of the Harry Potter fandom, the one thing I dislike most is hypocrisy. There are plenty of OP!Harry fanfics where the kid acts with an entitlement that makes him entirely unsympathetic and where he's unnecessarily rude to +adults+ everyone. Basically if Harry is an unlikable arsehole then I'll quit reading on the spot. Since he can only afford to act this way in situations where he has something on his side (magical/political power, learned knowledge, foreknowledge, etc) too many stories of this kind seem to feature that type of ooc!Harry.

I wonder if that's a reflection on the type of authors that write these kinds of stories. Hmm ...

** Humor helps. If Harry time traveled or is being influenced by a horocrux, that also helps explain his power and especially if he tries to not show off too much (stories where Harry time travels but suddenly starts using spells like he is dumbledore in front of everyone but tries to pretend everything is normal are a bit silly). There's also a line between being powerful, even unrealistically, and being on par with Dumbledore at 17. People often cross that line when writing fics; there are a few interesting Harry Bellatrix stories that have him easily batting away Dumbledore and Voldemort like they are flies, which is tonally weird and just seems off.

Tsume Yuki made her Harry, an overpowered one, a prodigy which helps although I think it verges into Gary Stu-ness in the end.
