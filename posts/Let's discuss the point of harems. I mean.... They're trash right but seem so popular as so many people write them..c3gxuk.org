This may seem like an unpopular opinion but I hate harems. To start with it's not even remotely.... Well relatable as relationships go. I mean sure it's all about magic and child soldiers but the way people interact should at least be relatively normal. Shouldn't it? Then we get to the fact that...well they're a bit demeaning to women and often seem to either make the women out as mindless 'anything for you love' stereotypes or they turn it into a dom/sub relationship which is just a whole new level of wrong.

Argue away!

I would recommend reading that author's fanfiction "Sakura", which "How To Obtain A Reverse Harem In Naruto" is actually a rewrite of, beforehand simply because of spoilery reasons. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8569846/1]]

** First, understand these fics often have several other tropes that go hand in hand with these stories: main character has overwhelming talent/magical ability/skills/etc., is an incredible romantic, sensitive but rutheless when called upon, incredibly intelligent, and has ridiculous sexual prowess. You can find innumerable examples across the spectrum of fanfiction. And thats because these stories are wish fulfillment stories, overwhelmingly written but teenage to college age males.

The reality is that this is not unpopular for more experienced readers. Most people know the idea is ridiculous to comprehend in most modern settings. However, lots of people want things they can never have. Moreover, the draw for many people appears to be how the main characters are constantly extolled and praised for how awesome they are at everything.

This goes beyond harem fics as well, its just that these fics are stuffed to the brim with this phenomenon. And to a degree I think a lot of people enjoy that part of fanfiction in general, as it tends to crop up in every genre except may be comedy or horror.

** Harems usually make stories worse. It's true, I'm not denying that. Back when I first found fanfic, i read a bunch of harem fics but i think that was mostly because it was my first time really seeing anything like it. It was sort of like this forbidden thing to read on a story so it appealed to me. A lot of that appeal has faded over the years and I dont read many harem fics anymore.

I'll admit I'm constantly tempted to write harem fics though but probably not for the reason many would expect. I like a lot of different pairings and because of that want to try my hand at writing those pairings. The problem is that writing stories take a lot of time... time I do not have and thus to save time and write all the pairings that I like, it feels tempting to just cram them all into one story. I havent really given into this temptation yet, but it is the reason I often find myself wanting to do a harem story.

** I'm am a girl and I would like to state that not all girls are offended by harems, its more of the way the women are treated in the fics that bothers me.

What I hate about HP harem fic is that I actually like harem stories. Those harem stories are about romance, betrayal, assassination and plotting and not as an afterthought where ' let's give Harry a lot of girls and not deal with the consequences of keeping a harem' like time splitting with the other wives.

This plot (Harems) is common in Asian historical drama (or at least not rare) where the fights are among the empress(or the first wife), imperial concubine(first concubine) and other concubine. Not to mention the children where the first son hates seventh brother or something.

Nope, Harry just collects girls and forget about them until they are plot relevant or how every girl instantly love Harry for no explicable reason other than "I'm your wife now so I love you" Harry doesn't even try. Or Where a wife is treated as a slave by principle and has to go along with whatever Harry is doing.

I think theres a difference with concubines between eastern and western version. That's not to mention religion where polygamy is acceptable. What HP harem have is a kept woman, I think is the right term.

** It's a fantasy. There are lots of men/boys who fantasize about being with several women at once, regardless of the realism of it. That's all.

I think it's entirely possible to write a good harem fic, it's just that practically none exist. The kind of authors who gravitate towards writing them are less likely to be skilled, there's a huge stigma attached to them so maybe some who would be able to write a good one avoid it, and I think the state of mind that authors are in while writing such a fic is probably not conducive to creating a balanced story. You can easily find non-harem fics that are just as horrible as any harem ones.

I feel like most people here are partially here for a certain level of wish fulfillment fantasy, regardless of whether or not they consciously recognize it. This is a series about a character that gets rescued from their miserable mundane life to go to a secret society magical school, finds out that they're a prophesied wizard, inherits a small fortune of gold, finds out they have an uncanny talent for combat magic, and that they're a prodigy of sports.

All of that is totally fine, but being in a relationship with several girls at once is just way too far? A harem /cannot/ be written well? I don't buy it. It's understandable that people hate them, but I think many people are projecting hatred for the fics they've seen with hatred for the genre itself. It would be a niche genre no matter what, but it's up to the skill of the author to make a good story.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

There's literally millions of (female) fantasies in this fandom where Hermione gets abused, manipulated and sometimes raped by a Death Eater just so that she can then can fall in love and find the soft cuddly center of said Death Eater (usually including some pretty hilarious misconceptions of BDSM lifestyle).

But no, clearly fics where Harry is so awesome and suave that dozens of women swoon and want to boink him is the real big issue in this fandom.

To be clear, I don't have big issues with either of these ridiculous premises, they are mostly harmless, but I'm quite surprised when people get regularly bent out of shape over the latter and rarely the former.

** Harry Potter is a reader insert character: He is passive, he doesn't have strong characterization beyond the plot/theme centric parts. He is designed for the reader to imagine themselves seeing the wizarding world through his eyes.

Polygamy is a pretty standard male sexual fantasy. So is being capible of superior physical feats (and thus "winning" the best mate). Particularly for adolescent males. Both are rather easy to fit into the HP mythos.

And thus you end up with a lot Powerful!Harry and Harem!Harry that seem like they are written by 14 year olds.

It is interesting that these are so overrepresented vs say, something like voyarism.

Some things that come up make sense. There seems to be a lot of 'partner magically can't/ doesn't want to refuse', either soul bond or love potion, which I guess is expected because magic removes a lot of the squick factor involved in the non magical version. I'm always surprised there isn't more of 'using invisibility cloak to peep on girls', as I would guess invisibility, and the consequence free ability to satisfy adolescent curiosity would be a common theme.

Hmm. I wonder if the whole peeping Tom thing has faded with the ease of access to pornographic material on the interwebz. I am sure someone has studied it

Edit: it is also interesting given the male/female ratio of fanfic writers, there isn't more female fantasy furfillment out there. The only one that really comes to mind are the M/M stuff which can certainly be written from that perspective. I suppose also powerful!Harry, particularly if he is paired an OC or a character like Hermione who is also generic enough to act as an insert.

But if years of basically living in the sci-fi fantasy section of the library taught me anything, you would expect more centaur action. And a lot more 'abducted by bad boy who gets reformed into antihero'

Peeping is the action of someone who can't get a date and is looked down on as creepy. But on the other hand, it's hardly creepy enough to be a shock story- we've got hogwarts/giant squid, harry/dead hermione, and ron/hedwig for that mess.

It's just too real, I guess. I've seen one story where it's featured as an accident, and then Harry gets together with her and lets her know it happened right afterwards, and that's it.

*** What type of fic is female wish fulfillment? I would guess almost all fics with Drarry, M/M, Draco/Hermione, Hermione/Tom Riddle, Hermione/Snape are written by women. They are unpopular on this subreddit but tend to lead in favorites and kudos on ffn and ao3.

Also most redemption, ansgt and hurt&comfort heavy plot lines including Snape Mentor fics and Harry being rescued from the Dursleys generally seem written from a female perspective. Not to mention female self inserts and OCs are almost all from a female perspective as well.

#+begin_quote
  And a lot more 'abducted by bad boy who gets reformed into antihero'
#+end_quote

There are plenty of these fics in Draco and Snape fanfiction. The good girl(or boy if it's a slash) reforms bad boy is one of the most popular tropes from what I have seen.

Maybe it's because I am not male, but I rarely come across Harem fics or other male wish furfillment tropes. The summary or even the first few paragraphs are usually enough to make me not give them even a second place. I do come across tons of fics that read like female fantasies though.

It likely depends on what characters you search for. Searching for characters like Snape will likely result in tons of female perspective fics while someone like Daphne or Fleur will result in a lot of male fantasies. This subreddit had a survey a few years ago and the [[https://imgur.com/yuqeZXx][gender breakdowns for favorite character]] were along those lines so it makes sense ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5bbvna/meta_hpfanfiction_survey_2016_results_summary_by][Full survey thread here]]).

Harry is actually quite close to the typical harem anime protanogist: Rather passive, rather bland, very nice, heroic streak, but humble, doesn't want to hurt others, although HP harem stories usually don't play along the anime antics (which is "will they or won't they" x every female - forever") and goes straight to "harem ending" at the start.

I can slightly tolerate some harem fics better than I can poor characterization. Personally, I find much of the "romance" as written in many fics not all that realistic. What's the most unrealistic for me is when a fic has a very loving and in some cases passionate scenes between the characters in the first year setting. I find this a big turn off for me, personally.

There do exist fics with genuine poly-esque relationships, like the Dark Lord's Equal, but the overwhelming majority are just “Harry gets to fuck whoever he wants cause he's just that great”

** Harems encourage propagations of dominant male genes. Some famous top alpha males in history, like Genghis Khan, are said to have tens of millions of descendants today. This guy made a habit of fucking the most attractive women among every people he conquered.

Male lions will fight each other. The winner gets his harem or pride. Cubs from the previous male will be killed and eaten. [[/r/natureisbrutal][r/natureisbrutal]] has all kinds of footages.

Chimps are less brutal than lions, although the right to a harem still involves toppling the alpha male in a vicious fight.

Monogamy has rather been the exception during human history. High population societies such as China, India, Persia, and Arabia had or have been polygamist throughout most of their history. Ever since the needs arose to fight for land, resources, and survival, physical strength remains a key competitive advantage.

However, physical strength pales against the power of magic. Therefore, I don't see witches putting up with a male oriented harem system at all. Their balance of power between genders has to be much more even than Muggle world.

** WARNING: This comment is long AF

I can think of only one application in which a harem is genuinely useful, that being an instance of both extreme emotional complexity, and dysfunctionality, as well as natural chemistry between all characters involved. The two instances of this I can think of are in the stories "Duel" and "The Rune Stone Path". Neither of these stories is perfect, in fact both have major flaws, although in my opinion the pros outweigh the cons in both cases. What I mean when it comes to complexity and dysfunctionality is a series of criteria that must be fulfilled in order to create a valid reason for the existence of a polyamorous relationship.

The first criteria relates not to the individuals in the relationship, but the circumstances of the relationship. There needs to be a certain level.of complexity involved. A simple situation of "boy meets girl, boy meets second girl", while it doesn't make the relationship a bad idea, it doesn't make it a good one either. To put it simply, the polyamorous element of the romance is unnecessary. It adds nothing and takes nothing away, it is extraneous. The author can add it if they want to, but at most it will be filler, at worst it will be shoehorned in. The complexity of circumstances adds a legitimate narrative reason for the relationship to exist. To use a worn out and cliche element, a marriage contract. (Note: as a plot device, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a marriage contract. It has a bad reputation because people use it poorly, not because it is itself a poor device.) As a hypothetical application of the marriage contract, consider the inheritance of houses Potter and Black. As the sole Heir of house Potter, and the designated heir of house Black, a legitimate reason can be created for a total of two wives. One wife for each house, in the interest of preserving the family lines. This can be reasonably done given the precedent set by the source material for a government obsession with the continuation of ancient families. This can be applied on its own, or with the use of a marriage contract. Without the contract, a story can be created where the polyamory is optional. With the contract a story can be created where the polyamory is mandatory. (As part of the house continuation, the contract could [and probably should] be implemented as a part of either the wills of the Potters and Blacks or an established law rather than a nefarious plot. This has the benefit of making the polyamory a non-negotionable element rather than something the characters can fight against.) By making the polyamory mandatory, you can "get past" that particular element of the premise and move on with the plot. Notice that the previous, well, many sentences have all been about how the concept of a harem can be played out in unique and interesting ways rather than a constant justification of the tropes existence. The reason is simple, polyamory is complicated, therefore it takes a somewhat complicated set of circumstances in order to implement it successfully.

The second criteria is dysfunctionality. This is not necessarily a negative thing. Rather, it is a matter of math. A healthy two person relationship involves an equal trade between partners to create a single whole. In a three person relationship, the trade between partners adds up to more than a single whole. This seems like a good thing, but reality is different. When humans have more than they need, they tend to get rid of the excess. This is a terrible thing for a relationship when the elements adding up to more than a whole are people. This is where dysfunctionality comes in. If the problem is that the people in the relationship are bring element s with them that add up to more than a single whole, then the solution is reduce the number of elements each person has. Surprisingly enough, this is extremely easy in the context Harry of Potter. Taking two highly popular characters as an example, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. Harry has a demonstrable capacity for high levels of courage, honor, duty, practicality, love, etc. What He is missing however, is focus, people skills, relating to people, drive (personal drive is very different from doing What "needs to be done" such falls under the category of courage, honor, and duty), forethought, and a natural level of joy. This is a direct result of the upbringing he had with the Dursleys. Hermione Granger has extremely high levels of intelligence, drive, courage, forethought, Compassion, extremism (think absolute abolitionism of houselves, and obliviation of Her own parents) and passion. What she is missing however, is people skills, relating to people, focus, conflict resolution, and confidence. With the two of these people, there is chemistry between the two of them (demonstrable in the source material) but in a relationship between them they don't add up to a single whole. They are missing social skills, focus, a certain level of confidence. This can be a legitimate setup for a polyamorous relationship. They *need* a third person to add up to a single whole. The trick is, that third person needs to add up to a single whole and no more. Ron, for instance, is a poor candidate as his qualities do not add into the relationship to make a single whole. Ginny is a somewhat better candidate, the qualities she possesses fill some of the gaps in the relationship, however she lacks a certain label of natural chemistry with Hermione, and has a certain romantic block with Harry wherein she needs to get over Her starstruck point of view about of Him. In the source material she does get past the block with Harry, and the issue with Hermione could be resolved via the narrative of the story. Dysfunctionality is a key component in a fictional polyamorous relationship if longevity is desired. Because the characters are truly and completely limited to what is on the page, there absolutely must be a believable balance between them, and there aren't enough words in the world to achieve that through merely writing down an account of conventional personal interaction. Unless you want your story to be longer than Harry Potter and A Song of Ice and Fire put together, you'll have to stack the literary deck in your favor.

The third criteria is chemistry, this is the most complicated, and easiest to develop criteria. Chemistry doesn't have to do with either circumstances or character traits. It has to do with people, people talking and laughing, people fighting and making up, people living their life and giving their life to someone else. It is developed over time, and cannot be rushed. It is also not my area of expertise, but fortunately there are plenty of people whose area it is.

In conclusion, Harems are complicated. Unbelievably complicated. It is /extremely/ difficult to do them well, and I have yet to see one that truly lives up to the potential of the premise. But that just means that one of you reading this still has a chance to be the first, have fun.

I mean...not really.

If Harry is allowed to inherit both lordships, why can't his kid? What is the difference between Harry having one wife who has two sons, each of whom get one lordship and having two wives who have one son apiece each of whom get a lordship? They're still closely related enough that it will be two or three generations before it would be safe to intermarry.

**** You are correct, Harry is the sole Heir to both houses in canon. You are also correct that it would be possible to have a single wife with two sons each of whom inherit a single house. Where you are not correct is that what I said still makes room for a legitimate reason for a harem. The reason that this is possible is because of the canon precedent for an obsession with houses and family lines, that is not in debate. The issue lies in the mechanics. There are a variety of ways to solve the problem; One could merge the houses, thereby solving the problem; One could divide the inheritance among the children, thereby solving the problem; One could have two wives to to continue each line desperately, thereby solving the problem.

We seem to have had a miscommunication. My comment is entirely focused on two things: The extremely rare conditions in which a Harem relationship can have a legitimate reason to exist, and how to execute the concept properly. I listed three criteria for a Harem to exist, all three of these could be resolved satisfactorily without the creation of a Harem. This does not mean that those criteria are invalid, just that there is more than one way to solve a problem. Sure you don't need two wives to continue the Black and Potter family lines in your story, but if you want to include a polyamorous relationship, then the issue of seperate family lines could be used as satisfactory plot device to make having two wives believable.

If having a harem relationship is a core part of a story's premise, then there needs to be a sufficient in universe explanation for why that makes sense. That is all this comes down to finding a legitimate reason. That reason can be applied to a variety of different solutions if you want, but just because you could apply it one solution does not mean it cannot be applied to others. The continuation of the family lines is a plot device, a problem to be solved. There is more than one answer and all are valid if properly executed.

The issue of continuing family lines is a starting point for authors to go in whatever direction they want. They could make a harem, they could divide the inheritance, they could have Harry become a catalyst for political reform making continuing the aristocracy null and void. The point is, they can make whatever they want, so long as what they are building is on a firm foundation. Continuing the family lines is that foundation, nothing more, and has little to no bearing on what is made from it so long as it resolves the problem in some way.

I myself am not a fan of harem fics, I find them to be overly tropey and poorly written most of the time. However, my problems are not with the concept, but the execution. And that is the point of my comment, just because it hasn't been done right yet, doesn't mean it can't be.

Also, kudos for your analysis. You did a good job finding an area where what I said didn't make sense and calling it out. Thank you for bringing it to my attention so I could clarify.

** Harems in media, I think, are generally caused by character imbalance. (Male) authors want to write about a bunch of cute girls doing things, but also want to write about what they themselves would want to do in the story. Without any further thought put into this premise, you often end up with a male main character surrounded by a bunch of girls, with few supporting male characters that aren't irrelevant or antagonistic.

Without other male characters to change up the dynamic, this means that all the character interaction and development is going to be within the main cast, and usually involving the main character because why would the author not want to do that?

The end result is a bunch of female characters that have lots of character interactions with a single male character and each other. The natural resolution to this while keeping the character dynamics intact naturally results in harems.

** Where was a time when I liked to read a special type of asian fantasy called Xianxia. It's kind of fantasy heavily influenced by asian mythology (mainly Chinese ) where characters are pursuing immortality (and often getting it in the end ). Since Xianxia is influenced by Chinese mythology, you can often see Harem there. The reasons I dislike Harem there are often the same than in a fanfic : Underdeveloped character : in a Harem, the girls (or at least the "nubile " ones are not character. They are puppet. They may act as character before being seduced, but the moment their character arc end and they join the Harem, they stop to be character and become puppet only good to fuck the hero and agree with him. They also love other members of the Harem. Like the hero promised her eternal love while bringing a new girl every week, but she will always be ok with it and love having new Sisters. Pervert Hero : in a Harem, the hero give way too much importance to the fairer sex. I'm ok with romance, but you have already 5 girls in your bed. Maybe it's time to forget the side quest and go save the world ? Also sometimes the hero can do stupid shits for girls. I remember one book i stopped to read because the MC gave to each members of a girl only sect the équivalent of the H bomb just so he could mollest, hum hum touch each girls while doing so. And it was after he was married 2 times with a third girl pregnant. Predictable story : Harem Xianxia pretty much have the same level of cliche than fanfic. A new girl appear and is beautiful. Harem girl at the end of the arc after the MC did the same quest (save her life / village / family. Protect her to be married against her will ).

These reasons make that, in my opinion, Harem are mostly trashes. Now it's even worse in a HP fanfic because this universe is not supposed to have Harem. In asian Harem, MC is a Pervert but there is other perverts with their own Harem (of lesser quality than MC for obvious reasons ). In a HP fanfic, you end up with a Harry Harem master and the other boys blue balled so much the next generation will need to raid other country to not marry between half siblings. Also Harem fic are often quite mysoginic, presenting a very patriarcal society while the HP universe has some kind of gender equality (woman can achieve power, but often at the price of a family though it's not totally sure ).

** Harems could be a ridiculously interesting plot device. The problem is that A) harem fics obviously live and die based on how the relationship dynamics are handled; B) it's way easier, more relatable, and more manageable to write a normal romance, which means that skilled authors who want to write something interesting will usually just do a normal romance and make the plot more engaging; C) there are a lot of horny guys (and, presumably, girls) out there who are only looking for a way to include the maximum amount of sex and ego-stroking possible into their fic; and D) A and C combined mean that people who haven't been in a relationship will be tempted to write about an incredibly complex and difficult to handle relationship, while B means that the more experienced writers who might be able to handle it are off writing more in-depth romances.

There aren't a lot of harem fics out there that don't consider adding another girl to be the height of plot development.

** Since there just aren't enough Harry Harem Fics in this world, I have prepared to this handy character guide to make it easier on future Harem fic writers:

Please pick one version of each character:

​

Harry #1 - he's too much man/has too much magic for one mere woman to handle so he's got to have bunches of wimmin - any old wimmin will do. He practically picks them up off street corners. (This Harry usually has to 'rescue' a few of his wimmin who all fall in love with him upon first sight- /some of them without even knowing he's Harry Potter!/)

Harry #2 - he's too damaged/too dysfunctional so he needs many pseudo mothers who he just happens to have sex with but he's still in charge of his wimmin cause He's The Man (which is the only reason he needs).

Harry #3 - he's dimwitted but has enough magic to scare folks so fate/magic just keeps throwing smart women at his feet so he doesn't destroy the world by accident. (usually pairs with Hermione #3)

​

Hermione #1 - she's way smarter than everyone else but has major character flaw (too willful! too stubborn!) that makes her unworthy of Lord Harrifficus so other wives have to "mold her to his will" (Harrifficus never does this himself cause he's got man business to do)

Hermione #2 - she's not that super smart, she's just a spoiled brat and can't be right about anything. She's basically cannon fodder.

Hermione #3 - whip smart/power behind the throne and basically a bitch to everyone including Harry and all the other wives. Rumored to be a reincarnation of one of the Elizabeths (Bathory/Borgia/Borden). Might also keep Ron as a side piece but that's gotta be subtext cause HP readers don't believe in polyandry.

​

Ginny #1 - Lily Potter's dumber ghost

Ginny #2 - basically her mom on steroids who never got over her crush on "Harry Potter" and exists only so Harry can get him some babies.

Ginny #3 - spoiled rotten brat who Harry and the other wives have to tame (in stories with Ginny3 and Hermione1 - Hermione always gets Harry first & Ginny just can't deal with it so Hermmy has to "lay down the law" on Ginny which usually involves some kind of physical cat fight which turns into hot sex but only after Harry joins in)

​

Daphne #1 -aristocratic ice queen

Daphne #2 - aristocratic ice queen

Daphne #3 - aristocratic ice queen

​

Fleur #1 - write her with a horrible accent throughout the whole fic and most people will skip all her dialog cause that's god damn annoying so it doesn't matter

Fleur #2 - has sexy Veela porn sex with Harry

Fleur #3 - starts out evil French Bitch who stole Harry but then the rest of the wives love her when she starts sharing cause he's too much man for her to handle.

​

Draco #1 - ooops. How'd he get in here?

​

Original Wife #1 - mary jane/author insert who is practically perfect in every way. If she has magic, she's from another country. If she doesn't have magic, she's "the heart of the marriage" aka - mundane housekeeper/psychologist for the magical wives.

Original Wife #2 - she's a muggle but she's so gosh darn it special that Harry & the other wives can't live with out her (must choose Special Talent A - magical magnifier or Special Talent B - magical nullifer).

​

Random HP Character #1 - any Puff/Claw/Gryff girl at Hogwarts - author must give her a makeover cause JKR didn't bother fleshing out the character but makeover is required to make her practically perfect for whatever crap Harry is dealing with *and* she wants babies.

Random HP Character #2 - any Slytherin girl at Hogwarts - must have redemptive character arc brought on by her love of Harry before he can have sex with her. Bonus points if her parents support Voldemort but turn their backs on him because "family loyalty magic demands it" blah blah.

​

Tonks #1 - it's ok to marry mom's second cousin - in fact it gives you a SPECIAL bond and very special babies.

Tonks #2 - despite being older, having Auror training, she discovers that Harry really does know best.

Tonks #3 - doesn't want to be in a relationship with Harry but magic.

** Honestly any type of relationship is an annoyance to me. The worst offenders of course are / writers who feel that everyone in their fic must in point of fact be homosexual. Harem writers are coming a very close second as almost inevitably the main character will have a veritable herd of young women that are completely devoted to him. Interesting to note that I've yet to read a fan fiction that had a female main character with a harem of men (and no I don't want recommendations for such a thing).

And then of course we have your average normal relationship. This tends to be a massive Mary Sue, possibly on both sides. As I've gotten older high school drama has appealed to me less and less. I'm read fanfiction for the magic the mayhem and the entrail expelling curses described in loving detail.

** At times it feels like the author likes multiple female characters and then makes a harem fic featuring their favourites. I have yet to find a fic where it would not be better if they had chosen one and written their fic with that pairing and then chosen another pairing in their next fic

*** As somebody else mentioned: Some authors write fast and can get a full fic done in a year or less. Others take a lot longer to write, and they also want to get trough all of their favourite ships. Some write harem fics because of that.

** I like harem fics... or rather, I like the IDEA of harem fics. Problem is... well, there are two problems, at least that I have.

1: The HP world is not a world where harems WORK. The wizarding world may be old-fashioned about some things (and progressive about other things), but MOSTLY the wizarding world we see in canon reflects 20th-century British society, not medieval high fantasy. Servile concubinage hasn't been a thing in Britain since the Romans. Harems as an accepted and established thing only works if you go MASSIVE AU from the start.

2: Most harem fics are VERY EXPLICITLY male sex fantasies. There's nothing wrong about this as such, but far too often it just boils down to "self-insert Harry gets to fuck all the hot chicks because he deserves it." The girls themselves hardly ever have any agency, often they don't even have any personality. They're just there so that self-insert Harry can confirm what a stud he is.

I think that harem fics can potentially be an interesting look at a different society, or exploration of character dynamics, but it's never used as that.

You had the Firebird Trilogy, which sort of TRIED to do something original with the harem scenario, and at first was a morbidly fascinating look at a terrible, oppressive society that was both misogynist AND misandrist, and where otherwise good people had to do terrible things just to keep afloat... but then it all fell through and all the characters were terrible and I just wished death on everyone and ESPECIALLY Luna... Luna is usually one of my fave characters, and I tend to like her even in the worst fics, but this version of her I just HATED. (But I note that Darth Marrs tends to write a despicable Luna.)

I'm actually trying to write a fanfic where the magical world is built up around harems... or "covens"; I stole the world from the Firebird Trilogy because while I didn't like the story that word was too good not to use. Essentially it's a story where witches outnumber wizards ten to one, and so the witches hace to either share the wizards or go find themselves a Muggle man... and I tried to look at how magical society would be different. I've used more time on worldbuilding than actually writing, I'll admit that, but... I was hoping I could do a harem-themed fic that might not be AS cringy as most of the ones I read.

(It's called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12861492][Holly Potter and the Witching World]]. Yes, Harry's a girl too. I specifically wanted a fem!Harry because I didn't want to do the classic "boy who lived is such a stud and gets all the girls" thing.)

But enough self-promotion. :) Like I said... I like the IDEA of harem fics... maybe cause I used to fantasize about being a harem girl... but the execution is usually pretty terrible.

** Yup, Every time I see it, It just seems like an really bad author insert, I don't mind harems or reverse harems in anime because they can be funny and they end up actually usually having some sort of plot. (e.g clannad and ouran.)

But in fanfic, they just seem unnecessary and do nothing for the plot and if they do, it's really badly done.

** It is unpopular and popular to hate them. The majority of readers absolutely love them. The small minority that makes up the interactive community has gotten over them.

My own issue is twofold: They're rarely of any quality and I don't like romance.
