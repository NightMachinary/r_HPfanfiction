Hello friends

Today, I am looking for stories about large-scale wars and conflicts (mainly) between wizards, preferably between nations. Most war-time fics there are obviously feature the in-country conflict with Death Eaters, which is mostly an ideological struggle turned violent, still with the main goal of (more or less) subtly seizing control at the end.

Now what I am interested in is whether someone explored how it might look like when â€˜wizarding nations' so-to-speak enter into official war time. How would they organize some sort of army? How does invasion/transportation work in enemy territory and how do you counter that? Do you concentrate on small tactical strike squads or can you still try to overwhelm your enemy with numbers? Are there specific spells only useful on a battlefield or do magical bombs and the like exist? Would the propaganda differ from the ones muggles use? Do you somehow involve/ally with the muggle governments or are both sides still trying to keep everything hushed up, and how? Do you even bother when the other side has someone like Dumbledore and you don't have any other significant advantage? What would they even wage war about?

The above are just examples, obviously, but those are the kinda questions I'd be interested to see approached. I realize my best bet would probably be WW II stories, but the ones I've seen usually feature a time-travelling Harry going solo. Also, even if you don't know fics like that, feel free to simply share your thoughts about how such fics could look like~


** linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) Has some of it. Mostly in the sequel linkffn(Animagus at War) but it hasn't really gotten to any truly decisive battles yet, it's mostly about how the international magical society work. The ICW has a much larger role for instance. And Dumbledore is sent off to fight an new dark lord in Africa in one of the subplots.

The sequel is currently on a break, as the author focuses on his/her more popular story. It left off with the entire wizarding world gearing up for war. But I think I remember him/her saying they will get back to it after they're finished with their other story. And they are normally very reliable in their update schedule.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

It's abandoned but what is there is incredibly well written. Fits a good portion of your criteria.
