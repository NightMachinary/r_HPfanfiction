I never see it discussed or recced here but I love it and it's pretty fantastically reviewed...


** I made it pretty far, and I guess I'll go and finish it now it's complete. It's pretty kooky, but I liked it well enough.

** I really enjoyed it. I discovered it when the author was most of the way finished with the last story, so I got to read it all at once with just a few weeks of waiting on final chapters. I loved the way some concepts were pulled off, though some parts did get repetitive or predictable. Idk, you really have to consider it fully alternate universe I think, to fully immerse into it.

I've got the stories downloaded onto my kindle, it may be time for a reread soon.

** I agree with [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]'s comments in the thread [[/u/Lane_Anasazi]] linked. Except I didn't even make it through the first book. I gave up when they started calling their family a wolf pack or something like that.

*** Eh I can understand his complaints but the issue for me with what he said is twofold.

1) He didn't finish it. Not that that's bad or anything but it really picks up after the first book or so when they hit Hogwarts and things get serious. Umbridge in particular is fantastic because all their OP skills aren't as OP once shit hits the fan which seemed to be one of the main complaints. The only reason they seem OP is because they have no adversaries. It's quite refreshing actually to see Voldemort go, "right these people can do something I can't...I need to fix that/end that..." I mean Sirius ends up as a squib for half the series and iirc Remus ends up in Azkaban.

2) He projects alot of his own...reading habits...onto some of the actions. Like comparing the throat thing to a sexual game never crossed my mind because I don't read porn that involves animal play.

Totally get what you mean about the pack/pride thing, it's cringy as fuck but when I started it years ago it wasn't as big in fanfiction for that whole thing to happen and it read like an extension of the Marauders.

**** The pack thing was cringy, but I kept reminding myself that they were very very young children at the start of the story, and doing something like that with kids seems relatively normal (or at least not too weird). I just kind of ignored that aspect, mentally subbed 'family' in place of it.

Maybe, but even if you're planning a long series it's hard to justify having a whole book with no real conflict. It's just.. boring.

***** It's a character study, I definitely think it's interesting but I can understand why people can't stomach it.

And to be fair the longer fanfiction stories tend to be dull at the start, like i've never made it through that Saving Connor series because it's so dull at the beginning.

****** Fair enough. I didn't find Saving Connor dull, but at first I thought it was going to play the whole "brother of the BWL raised to protect him" thing straight, and I couldn't stomach that. I was encouraged to give it another shot and ended up enjoying the series as a whole.

As the OP of that tread, I will say that I gave it a try, but gave up a few chapters in. Nothing specific that I didnt like, it just didn't work for me.

*** Yeah it's really enjoyable but like others have said the first book is a bit of a slog. It's all worldbuilding and sets up the characters and their various skills which makes them seem OP until the later books when things come crashing down. Definitely not unenjoyable just all pre-hogwarts and not focused on Harry et al like the later ones start too.

** I'm not normally a Harry/Ginny person, but I thoroughly enjoyed the parts of it that I read. However, I dropped the series completely when I [[/got%20to%20the%20part%20where%20Dumbledore%20insisted%20that%20Harry%20return%20to%20the%20Dursleys%20to%20recharge%20the%20blood%20wards][spoilers]].

** I tried to read it once upon a time but I stopped and when I come back and try to finish it, I just cringe and be so embarrassed to be reading something so lame I have to close it.

I don't think I'm the target audience, I feel it's aimed at early teens (12-15).

** I like it. I started reading when Anne published the very first chapter and have been following it ever since. - back then I had just started reading FanFics in English and I think my reading comprehension and the author's skill in writing grew at about the same rate.

I don't think that the first chapters of the first story are well written, to be honest.

--------------

I think I like some of the Dangerverse AUs better than the main story, though.
