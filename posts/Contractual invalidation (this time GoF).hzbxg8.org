  “Harry, did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?” asked Headmaster calmly but sternly.

  “Of course not, Professor, I would have to be an idiot to enter into the conquest designed for seventh-years.”

  “Of course, he is lying, Headmaster, expel him!” snarled Snape at them.

  “What a charming idea, Severus. Harry, you are hereto expelled from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Unless you notify me in writing in two days the name of the school you transfer too, your wand will be snapped and you'll be obliviated of all your memories of magic.”

  “Professor ...!” Harry's voice never could sound more hurt than it was. He always considered Professor Dumbledore to be his some kind of grandparent figure, and he felt very much betrayed at the moment.

  However, at the moment Headmaster expelled Harry from the school the piece of paper with Harry's name Dumbledore still held in his hand, caught fire, briefly smouldered, and ash fell on the ground.

  Professor Dumbledore smiled lightly. “Apparently, Harry, you cannot be the Champion of Hogwarts when you have been expelled, so your magical binding contract is now void and ineffective. Congratulations, you can go.”

  All was well.

**** I was reading this really satisfying short story where Harry realized in the magical world as long as somebody's name was signed on a contract they had to abide by it. So then he made up a bunch of contracts for the death eaters and Voldemort saying that they couldn't perform certain violent behaviors and stuff. And then when they broke the contract they had no idea he signed them up for they lost their magic and died. I wish I could remember the name. Probably have it bookmarked somewhere but good luck finding it I've got a couple thousand bookmarked probably

  ONE-SHOT. After being entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament against his will, Harry does some independent research on what precisely "magically binding" means...and comes up with a very different approach to the competition. As they say, the pen is mightier than the sword...but is the quill mightier than the wand?

One thing I think people miss is that magical contracts don't follow Common Law - the Cup said he's got to participate, so that;s that. You can't appeal the ruling and the contract cannot be voided by a judge. If it did follow common law the fact that Harry didin't personally put his name in the cup would do it.

In other words, it's a geas, not a legal document.

Now, you can play the 'exact wording' game with geases - so the lack of discussion about the meaning of "participate" annoys me a little. Why can't Harry just show up to the challenge and forfeit? Or whatever the minimum is.

Harry's got some pride, but he's not /that/ proud, and he's certainly had enough of the spotlight for one lifetime already.

*** I think the books are missing a definition of "magical contract", at any rate. The penalty of a breach is never stated either.

At the risk of playing semantics: It's possible enough that it's a legal matter, not a magical one, and the "magical" adjective refers to the fact that it's a contract /about/ magic, not one enforced by it. In that case, all that "bound to compete" means is that he'd be breaking the rules of the TriWiz-Tournament.

In this particular case, if we are told "Harry is bound to compete", but have otherwise been told and shown you can break contracts, /and/ assume that neither Dumbledore nor Harry nor the rest of the candidates actually want Harry to compete, then there is a deficit in the motivation: Why is he not just breaking the contract?

The less the consequences, the more it doesn't make sense that he competes. But on the other hand, the bigger the consequences, the bigger the issue for the general world-building if some third party can enter a contract for you without your knowledge.

The easiest way to fix this would be to get rid of the idea that Harry doesn't want to compete, by the way. If he was happy enough to be entered into the tournament, it wouldn't matter how binding "binding" was.

But we know contracts can be broken generally. Marietta does it, for instance. The penalty is the sneak pimples. Even an Unbreakable Vow can be broken -- it's just that the penalty is death.

So if this thing is harmless (or even legal consequences only) in its penalty like the DA contract, the question is why breaking it never comes up, but if on the other hand it's more like the Unbreakable Vow, the question is why it's so easy for a third party to arrange such a binding contract.

Also, my point is not to come up with speculative answers to this question. Filling in plotholes (almost) always works, the point is that this question is there in the first place.

He acceptance or refusal is irrelevant - it's a geas, it's /imposed by magic/.

It's a lot closer to an Unbreakable Vow than a muggle contract, but it's even closer to a curse imposed by a fae than anything else.

So you have to think in terms of fae magic, which means there are exact words that describe what Harry needs to do (somewhere) and the meanings can be twisted as much as you like to munchkin your way around it. (A common law contract can have implied meanings/contextual definitions - ie if I was contracted to cut your lawn I can't just instruct it to stop acting, but that could work with a geas.)

***** But how could such a powerful geas form if Harry was unwilling?

****** Geases never care if the target is willing in classical mythology - some fae just says "you may never eat dog meat, but so long as you don't you get the strength of ten men." And that's now the rules for you.

There is consideration (the legal concept) - the geas has to give you something good (in Harry's case the right to participate) - but there isn't offer and acceptance.

I would love to see a fanfic really explore this, though. I may need to write it myself to make it happen.

** At least one fanfiction explored the idea that it was the /person/ who entered the name who was caught in the contract, not the /name/ of a different person. It ends up with fake Moody losing his magic (and life?) when Harry doesn't compete.

It's a horrible idea ripe for abuse. Why not enter Tom Riddle in the tournament? I recently read a fanfiction that had Voldemort polyjuiced as one of the competitors after he got caught in the contract.

** Canonically, Bartimoody suggested that the perpetrator had Confunded the Goblet into accepting Harry's name under a fourth school (and he would know, wouldn't he?). So expelling Harry from Hogwarts likely wouldn't help.

** Here's the ultimate way to fix it.

I Albus Dumbledore, refuse Harry James Potter entry into the Tri-Wizard Tournament.

Remember, Harry is a minor, so an adult would be signing any contracts for him.

*** I believe the story Can't Have It Both Ways by RobSt tried to explore that. I'm a minor so I couldn't put myself into a magical contract. And then when he was told he had to compete. Well since the competitors have to be "of age" then that means you are declaring me "of age" so i'm now considered an adult/emancipated. Well they then said no you're a minor he went back to point 1.

  If you are forced to participate in a competition that's reserved for adults only, doesn't that mean you should be considered an adult? Harry gets some much needed help and advice before having some fun by allowing his marauder heritage out to play. H/Hr

**** I've hated that trope since I read something pointing out that the age restriction was 100% unrelated to the Goblet. The Goblet picks anyone, it doesn't care; it's just that people under 17 weren't supposed to be entered this time.

I think the analogy that was used was a liquor store. If a 12 year old somehow managed to buy alcohol, would that make them an adult because they did an adults-only thing? No, it just means someone broke the rules.

***** More like, if several political leaders including the head of OSHA/HSE ordered a 14yo to operate an industrial meat grinder even though safety regulations say the operator must be an adult due to the risk of chopping your own fingers off. The meat grinder doesn't have the power to declare the kid an adult; the politicians are the ones requiring adult responsibilities of a child.

Still not a judge in family court ruling emancipation, but there could easily be political and legal fallout, and I should think any halfway competent lawyer would be able to argue that none of those politicians should be allowed to make decisions affecting the child.
