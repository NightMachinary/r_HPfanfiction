Any fics where Harry deals with Weasleys during the summer of fifth Year by ignoring them? By keeping to himself in his room in Grimmauld Place? Where he doesn't share a room with Ron. Maybe a Dark or Evil Harry????


** The "What's that Fic?" flair is more for finding a specific fic. This seems more like a general inquiry, so it should probably be a "Request".
