I've been delving more into HP fanfic lately and one thing I find quite baffling is the fanon version of Sirius. He seems to mostly be portrayed as a (slightly) silly, light hearted prankster who's constantly making little quips and puns.

I haven't read the books recently but from what I remember canon Sirius isn't like this at all. He can be ruthless, he's mentally damaged, and he's quite serious and brooding. He truly did feel like a parent figure to Harry, but in a lot of fanfics he comes across like an older brother or like another Weasley twin.

I'd also be interested in finding out how this portrayal of Sirius became widespread, I guess just because people associate him with the Marauders? Even in the school flashback his personality doesn't match up to his fanon one.


** [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/9106972][Glass of Water]] linkao3(9106972) - Sirius & Lily friendship, with war looming in the background. Mostly gen with a bit of James/Lily at the end.

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/12540852][They're Hiding Inside Me]] linkao3(12540852) - this one's darker, with warnings for a number of things, including child abuse. Mostly focused on the Marauders' friendship, with some Sirius/Remus as well

You've actually answered this in a way already. Basically, I've seen many fics (even from way back in the day) turn Sirius into Fred/George 2.0., irrespective of whether or not he's been exonerated. I'm not sure where, exactly, this portrayal came from, but it goes right back to some of the earliest fics that tried to explore the what-if scenario of Sirius being a free man.

I think part of it stems from the difficulty of getting Sirius spot-on (and finding a purpose for him in the plot once he's been freed). He's a complex, multi-layered character, in that he:

- Can't help but feel the urge to get up to his old antics/adventures again, hence the scolding he gets from Molly at the table in book five (in that he sees Harry as James/a pal at times).

- Is a bit immature, yes, but also surprisingly mature as well.

- Still bears his old grudges, particularly against Snape.

- Hates sitting around doing nothing, and sometimes 'lives through' Harry and the younger generation (which Hermione mentions in book five).

- Cares deeply about Harry, and sulks when being separated from his godson for extended periods of time. (He locked himself up with Buckbeak when Harry was about to return to Hogwarts in book five, which Hermione said was unfair as it was almost guilt-tripping Harry into staying at Grimmauld Place.)

- Resents Crouch Sr for not giving him (Sirius) a trial, even though Sirius, himself, didn't make it easy by laughing and saying that he killed the Potters back then.

- Hates his mother, scoffs at the memory of his 'stupid' brother, and basically hates his whole family except for Uncle Alphard, Andromeda, Nymphadora, etc.

- Hates Bellatrix and isn't proud of being related to her, yes, and yet he fools around and taunts her during their duel. It's almost as if Sirius was enjoying his little skirmish with his evil cousin, rather than going all out and trying to kill her (funnily enough, I don't think either of them actually threw any fatal spells at each other, in the short time that we see them duel). And yet, Sirius was perfectly willing to murder Peter in book three.

That's just some of the layers to Sirius's character. No offence to other writers out there, but it's all too easy for the average fic to struggle with Sirius's characterisation, especially by focusing mainly on his 'Marauder' side (which is often overdone in fanon). Thus we end up with:

- Silly, prankster Sirius.

- Nickname-calling, i.e., 'Pup', as the author tries to show Sirius's caring side.

- That clich√©d moment when the Weasley twins go "We are not worthy!" upon discovering that Sirius is Padfoot, with Sirius then doubling down on his prankster ways even more.

- Sirius trying to set up a new generation of Marauders.

In other words, it's a long-standing trend to simplify things by focusing on Sirius having been part of the Marauders. Too bad that's probably one of the least interesting parts of his personality by the time he breaks free from the Dementors.

*** Very good analysis! I completely agree Sirius is surprisingly complex when you dig a little deeper and he's probably my favourite character in the entire series. I absolutely hate any fic that uses variations of "Pup" or "Pronglet" it just makes me cringe on a deep level. The real shame is the point you made here :

**** You have also got to understand that many of the writers of fanfiction are amateur writers who maybe themselves don't understand human nature all that much other than what they witness from day to day. Writing a proper Sirius is just as difficult as writing a young Dumbledore because I assume most of us have not been or have not met a child prodigy or a young Tom Riddle who is a charming sociopath because even if we came across one, their power lies exactly in the ability to appear normal and likable.

I think even during schooltime he wasn't only the silly prankster everyone pictures. He came from an abusive household (at least verbally abusive if you consider Walburga and Kreacher), he was raised by people who thought that most of the wizarding world are not worthy to live and his only supportsystem were his friends and an estranged uncle (estranged is a guess, but he would have gone to him and not the Potters if they were close)

We also see him very ruthless (in telling Snape to face a nearly grown werewolf), a little bit sadistic (he is bored so James starts bullying Snape to cheer him up) and also very reckless - running with a werewolf at fullmoon and risking other people trough it.

I know that the marauders are often pictured as the forerunners of the Weasley twins, but I don't think that's accurate. The marauders were much darker with Sirius and his disfunctional family, Remus and his "furry little problem" and Peter constantly being overshadowed by his much more talented friends (and being made fun of, even if I think most fanfics blow that part out of proportion).

*** I feel like the immaturity you mentioned can easily be extrapolated from canon by authors. Considering he got out of school, spent 3 years in a war and a further 12 in a prison, I think it's safe to say that he hasn't had the experiences that lead to maturity. Although it could be argued that war brings maturity and I can understand that, I think there's a difference between war/trauma maturity and actual ‚ÄòI can live as an independent healthy adult' maturity.

So considering that, I reckon authors tend to think of him as ‚Äòstuck' in his school personality, in which he was mainly described as a prankster. He didn't have a chance to grow out of it.

When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

** I feel it can very much depend on the circumstances. What little we see of Sirius in canon is a) when he has spent nearly a year on the run after a decade of wrongful existential torture and is nearly revenging himself on his betrayer and b) a year later for a month or so when he is in a house with high implied childhood trauma and faced with the war restarting. These are not kind moments to him.

Often in fanfics, firstly there are many where he never goes to Azkaban, secondly, especially if he is official found innocent, he gets medical and mental treatment for his imprisonment. I feel in both these cases it is legitimate to portray him differently. Also, in many fics he is either taking a more active role in supporting Harry, so actively tries to hide the dark parts of himself, or someone else takes that role (normally the family of ship) and he has decided to be the dedicated clown, at least partly to help himself.

As for the flashback, that is a single, out of context incident from the perspective of Snape, and Incel so bitter that he was happy to let Pettigrew, Lily's true betrayer, go free so that he could get Sirius and possibly Remus murdered.

Sirius escapes from Azkaban five years early and retrieves Harry from the Dursleys, so initially he's at odds with Dumbledore and everyone else just because everyone believes he's insane and kidnapped Harry to hand him over to Voldemort. But there's no special Dumbledore enmity beyond that. I really like how Sirius is flawed but trying his best for James' son.

** This is a bit out of what you're looking for, but it's a pretty unique take on Sirius. He's quite a bit darker than he usually is in fanon, and definintely ruthless (but not grim-dark-unrealistically violent). It takes place directly after third year, but in this universe he doesn't go to the tropics for some recovery time, but plunges head long into searching for Peter/revenge. I thought it was a pretty realistic and nuanced portrayal of how his (lack of) recovery from Azkaban could go, and a darker side of him as a guardian.

Hermione is the main character here btw, in case that's not something you're into.

  Fresh off finishing a hectic third year at Hogwarts, Hermione embarks on a new summertime adventure in Bulgaria with Sirius Black as an unlikely companion, where she begins a new internship as a Healer's apprentice with the Bulgarian National Quidditch team. Although Hermione and Viktor, the team's star Seeker, have a rocky start, they quickly find themselves becoming entangled in each other's lives both inside and out of the Quidditch stadium as they grow ever closer. However, darkness pools in the edges of light, and Hermione's summer may be much much dangerous than she ever imagined...
