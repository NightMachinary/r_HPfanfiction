  How would you save Sirius?
#+end_quote

You don't. As a general rule, if you introduce a big change to canon, you shouldn't be looking for ways to railroad the story back into the stations of canon. Embrace the change and see where it leads you.

The Ministry ordering Sirius kissed at the end of PoA is an excellent divergence point. Harry would be passionately opposed to the Ministry from that point onward - something that didn't happen until OotP in canon, and even then it wasn't nearly as visceral as it would be if they had effectively executed Sirius.

Also he'd probably murder Snape.

All told, it's an excellent starting point for a dark Harry consumed by vengeance.

*** I disagree. While you shouldn't just rehash canon, that doesn't mean you need to go as far as not allow yourself to explore some points in canon in different ways. You just have to find a way to make things that you want to happen in your story happen.

You can also diverge from canon in the opposite direction. For example, if your story has Harry not being friends with Hermione for whatever reason, or Hermione doesn't have the Time-Turner, you can have Harry find Peter with the Map earlier in the year, figure it out, capture him, and turn him in. Or have Remus take his wolfsbane, and not allow Peter to escape at the end of PoA. Then Sirius is free and Harry can go and live with him, shifting the story dramatically.

** - Just have anyone drop the idiot ball long enough with regard to the wolfsbane. Remus remembering to down the potion before he runs off is enough of a nail to avert the whole thing - even if Wormtail escapes while he transforms, they don't suddenly have to deal with a mindless wereworld. As such, they never end up trapped and helpless by the swarm of dementors. At worst Sirius gets away before he can be captured.
- The TT had two purposes - it saved them from being kissed by the Dementors and it gave them an alibi to rescue Sirius. The former can be avoided by any number of means (for example, someone else getting there in time, Sirius using a wand to cast his Patronus, Moony somehow doing so in world form, Harry or Hermione succeeding in casting, etc.). The latter... The Cloak would be useful, as would Fawkes flaming (especially if it can do so while /under/ the Cloak) leaves very little evidence other than the flash of flames. Consider that Dumbledore still holds a lot of power at this point, all he needs is plausible deniability

** The scene would go something like this. Harry stands in front of his godfather trying to stop the executioner and Fudge from taking his godfather away when suddenly...

The sound of a shotgun being pumped.

"Step aside Harry." Harry hears coming from behind.

And then Hermione shoots Fudge in the face with a shotgun. Hermione is now a crazy lady with a shotgun.

The End.

** What I used for "No Longer Alone" was:

- Years 3-7 have one "elective day" per week where each elective is offered four times as a double lesson. Hermione took all 4 and Muggle studies as independent study in her limited free time.

- Harry is fed-up with Ron and Hermione fighting over their pets, he hangs out with Katie Bell and her friend Leanne

- All of them like flying, they are out one evening when they come across Sirius breaking into Hagrid's hut. They have a nice talk with Pettigrew, decide to hand him over to the Ministry for soul removal.

- Dementors crash the party, they leave Peter behind as distraction and outfly the dementors.

- McGonagall does not believe them about Pettigrew, until his body is found, at which point the Minister is his usual self.

- Sirius simply walks away as Padfoot

Bear in mind, this happens before the story begins (at the end of 3rd year)

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius has ever made.

**** It was inspired by "Call Me" but without the alt elements (and with dark hair instead of pink-dyed blonde). Honestly, I just wanted to write a girlfriend for Harry who is just that, a girlfriend. No co-conspirator, no kick-ass fighter, no "key to all kinds of knowledge", no "pureblood connections", no "connection to Amelia Bones", just someone Harry gets along without her being important beyond that.
