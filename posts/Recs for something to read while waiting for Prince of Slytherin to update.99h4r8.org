** Linkffn(Black Luminary by YakAge) if you haven't is well deserving of a read. Very Big AU after Grindelwald's fall. Probably my favorite ongoing fic currently.

Linkffn(Antithesis by OceanBreeze7), ignore the summary this fic is a better version of /The Darkness Within/ and is a solid read.​

Linkffn(12867536) and its sequels does a very solid job of dark!Harry that isn't edgey, but has real problems. The characterization struggles at times, but overall it is an above average fic that manages to have a solid plot. The last couple chapters with Harry killing Sirius was very well done.

**** If you're ever in the mood, read linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerspw)

There's a lot of talk of the intricacies that magic has, development of diferent uses for magic as a unique way of crowd control, or making a hit on someone far far away, and for me one of the best contractual marriage fics there is, simply because there's more going on than a surprise weding and insta-love or w/e. It takes about 450k words for them to even begin to talk to each other properly. So its really slow burn, and there's no evil Dumbledore, manip, or bad weasleys tropes. They're canon, Harry's the one that changed a lot, but everyone else doesn't suddendly becomes OoC because of it. They just get used to him and then evolve their own personality (mostly Hermione) because of it.

I'm doing a pretty bad job at explaining this fic. Lets try again. Best marriage contract fic imo, the only one that gets as close is Contractual Invalidation. Fantastically smart and innovative uses of magic, grim atmosphere and a gritty war, not the war that is described in 10 pages like it is in canon (i mean the news and the small attacks and everyhing else that isn't centered around Harry's vicinity) Oh and Daphne is completely different than the usual ice-queen trope that exists, so there's that. But i'm biased considering I love unique Daphne's.

*** So I have to ask about Black Luminary. I started reading it yesterday after I saw your recommendation. It sounded fascinating. I really enjoyed the first few chapters while Harry was in Grimmauld Place. I enjoyed the chapter on the train. Now we're like two days into Hogwarts and wtf is going on? Why is Daphne a total schizo? Why does Draco say man all the time? It's turned into an inexplicably strong Harry fic. Does the crazy end at any point? Will I ever find out how Harry's parents died? Where's Sirius? Why does Harry know who Sirius is? How come no one acknowledges the fact that Harry is actually a Potter?!

Harry becoming a Black and rejecting the Potter name is a big deal, it isn't to be edgey or independent. What happened to Harry's parents and Sirius are explained overtime and we get tidbits piece by piece. It's honestly done very well, I love how the author manages to paint the picture partially. If you really can't wait there is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/92ql1z/regarding_black_luminary_by_yakage/][this thread]] which should help quite a bit. Black Luminary is Very AU which means you are in for a ride and there is a lot of stuff that is either subtle or just isn't explained until later.

As to the characterization? That is a weak point of the fic as Daphne, Draco, and Tracey are not the strongest, but after a 100k words you meet Aenor Rose and she is an incredible OC.

​Overall this fic is very strong, if you are new to AU fics keep at it; it is well worth the ride.

***** I'm not remotely new to AU fics, but the characterization of Daphne/Draco/Tracy came out of left field and I was like ?? Is this it? Why am I reading a Haphne fic that has such a strong backbone regarding Arcturus and Harry's relationship. The background plot is fascinating, so thank you. I will definitely stick with it after hearing your views!

** I'm only going to recommend longer fics here, so take that with a grain of salt.

Linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is a Dish Best Served Raw): in many ways its similar and yet radically different from PoS. Its almost like a laboratory experiment to test how much I can put up with that I wouldn't stand for in other fics.

Linkffn(What You Leave Behind): a good, original-ish story with a Harry who is a year older and Cedric + Cho as the new trio.

Linkffn(The Mind Arts): a recent addition, one of the most intimate discussions of mind magic in the fandom, even if Harry does become a bit to powerful quickly in my opinion.

Linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent): one of the most original fics I have found, partly because it started post-GoF 16 years ago. Well worth the read for the world-building and characters.

Linkffn(The Seventh Horcrux): a frankly better version of the 7th book written prior to DH's release. A must read in my opinion for the fandom.

Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): possibly the longest fic you will ever read, a masterfully unique Voldemort won the war AU story.

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes): this is basically PoS but with the tropes played straight.

Linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy): one of the most original AU stories and worlds I have yet to encounter. The gist is witches outnumbered wizards and this changed the last thousand years of history.

Linkffn(The Changeling): a Slytherin Ginny story, but the author's prose and writing ability make this fic what it is. A great coming of age story.
