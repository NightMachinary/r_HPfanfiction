I mean we never encounter him after the first year, but it's not like he's killed at the end of PS, right? So this means that somewhere on Hogwart's grounds, there is Fluffy's kennel. Did you ever encounter a fic where Fluffy appears after the first year?

  He was repatriated to Greece. Dumbledore liked to put Hagrid's more foolish acquisitions back where they belong - not the forest.

** linkffn(8106168) has [[/spoiler][werewolf animagus Harry]] adopt Fluffy as a pack member, who he takes with him in the back of his bigger-on-the-inside SUV to visit some kinda werewolf party.

edit: this is an absolutely atrocious summary of the fic mentioned. Were's Harry is actually quite good, and I am sad that it hasn't been updated in forever.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

** I'd have to dig it up, but one of the +HGSS+ stories I have in my favs list has them track him down in the forest, deage him to puppy, and adopt him. If I can find it I'll edit it into this post :)

Edit: Found it in first go! Turns out it's not an HGSS like I thought at first, it's a Hermione/Viktor, with Snape a main character. linkffn(looks can be deceiving by corvusdraconis)

  What if Severus Snape had taken Hermione Granger under wing secretly during her time at Hogwarts? What if Draco Malfoy really wasn't the bigot he let everyone think he was? (Follows canon mostly up until the end of GoF, and then detours off into AU territory w/Severus as father figure)

  Set post OOTP AU NonHBP. Harry Potter and Susan Bones. Gritty realism, independent Harry and a believable Voldemort all in a desperate battle to control the fate of the wizarding world. Rating increased to Mature.

** Fluffy plays a minor role in linkffn(An Old and New World), in one of the most badass fight scenes I think I've ever read. He is only in one chapter, and its fairly deep in the story, but I cannot recommend reading this enough.
