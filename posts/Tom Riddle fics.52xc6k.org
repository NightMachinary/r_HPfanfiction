Hi!

I would like to know if there are any fic where Harry timetravels/is the brother/friend of Tom Riddle or just a PoV of Tom without Harry.

I would like to read the live at Hogwarts, the Orphanage, and the founding of the Death Eaters.

And please, NO REDEMPTION FICS, I want them training in Dark Arts, Horrocrux included. Or something original but no "good" Tom.

A fic that I read that is like this is Rebirth, at least the first part of the fic.

Thanks!


** [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=144][I am Lord Voldemort]] by Nemesis.

This was published back around 2002. It hasn't aged perfectly - but I have a soft spot for fics published before OttP came out. Chronicles Tom's seven years of school, plus a bit more.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?

  AU. Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal inspired. After recent events in his life, Hermione refers Harry to the renowned psychiatrist, Doctor T. Riddle. He is unlike anything Harry ever expected or imagined, and soon proves to be a great help against the very shadows and name that haunts his waking hours. If only it remained that simple.

  Alive. Hidden. Concealed in the metaphorical closet, and the ominous, creaking footsteps outside belong to a monster... He's sniffing the air in anticipation. He's craving more than the scent. Intoxicated by his own bloodlust, and a single, fleeting moment of weakness is all he needs. "...Harry Potter... I will have you..." Eventual HP/LV/TR. Sequel to 'Mine'.

** linkffn(Witchcraft by a Picture by anyavioletta) fits some of what you're looking for, though it's from an OCs perspective. Has orphanage, horcruxes, death eaters, Hogwarts, and only partially humanizes him, definitely not redeemed. Starts in 6th year.

** I just recced this in another thread, but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5278050/1/Hypocrisy]]) meets some of your criteria I think.

It's marked as a romance, but I really wouldn't consider that to be the main aspect of the story. Rather, it's more about the doomed friendship between Minerva and Tom who are both very realistic in this fic. Tom isn't whitewashed at all, nor is he insanely evil from the start. The story does a really great job of showing his descent into evil and the principles he believed in. He's charming, manipulative, intelligent, curious, and frankly quite creepy sometimes. And the story also shows how the war and orphanage effected him and his beliefs. It's just really, really good in my opinion.

Oh, and Minerva is amazing, but that's nothing new. Also, the story is abandoned, but there's a lot of content there that's very much worth reading.
