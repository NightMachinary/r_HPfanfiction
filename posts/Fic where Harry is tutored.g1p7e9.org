Just seems a lot smarter to privately tutor the saviour of the wizarding world. I'd rather it wasn't one of those 'dumbasadoor has planned to make you a lamb for slaughter so I, as a neutral gray power will teach you dark magic that isn't dark because of neutrality'. It doesn't have to be Dumbledore. TIA

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** *Saying No* - linkffn(7274734)\\
It's more of a "Harry got pissed off at Dumbledore after Sirius' death, and how he just picks up Harry when he needs him and dumps him at the Dursleys when he doesn't." So he says no.

Tutored, and then year 6 where Harry, Hermione, and Ron say NO to everything. Hogwarts staff bashing? Adult bashing? Kreacher and Dobby Rivalry. This is crack by the way.

Also, beware the power of Origami!
