Perhaps there was some tragedy or the other, or perhaps Bill was just lonely at the time so there's an absence in the Weasley family, thus they created Charlie, the imaginary son. For some reason, they kept this pretense going for twenty years, with all the Weasley kids going along with it. Everyone at Hogwarts goes along with it too, turning him into a prodigy and a Quidditch Star. So when Harry finally meets him, he's surprised, but assumes having an invisible brother is completely normal in the magical world. It explains his bizarre age discrepancies and just everything about him.

And yes, this was stolen from a play

There's also a short film called Pete Sweet that plays out the premise of dating an imaginary girlfriend with the same premise

**** For a minute there I thought there was a new Harry Potter play that sounded hilarious. Now I'm disappointed. :(
