So I was just wondering, in the first book, Quirrelmort tries all year to find a way to bypass fluffy and to steal the stone.

On Halloween, he even let a troll into the school as a distraction so he would have more time to try to get past Fluffy.

What I'm wondering is, why not use the Basilik? Either as a distraction for the other teachers and Dumbledore, or simply to take out Fluffy?

It's not like he wasn't aware of the Chamber... For that matter, why not use it to take out Dumbledore or Harry? I mean, a prepared Dumbledore would probably manage to take out the Basilik, but Quirellmort could have laid a trap for either (or both) of them! Why not use the troll (or the threat of one) to lure them to the Basilik? Or just have it wait behind the door while there's a teacher's meeting.

Anyway, this is just something that popped in my mind while I was trying to sleep and I'd like to have your opinions on that.


** The Doylist explanation is that they probably did not exist yet,

The Watsonian explanation could be that Voldemort feared that the Basilisk might not recognize him as the heir of Slytherin and he might lose the chance to gain the elixir of life. Teen Voldemort who was more arrogant and less desperate and cautious decided to start purging the school before he regained a body and paid the price. Older Voldemort did not want to risk it.

****** I'm not sure Rowling was the kind of author who started planning her next book before finishing her first, at least for the start of the serie (she probably did so for the last volumes of HP).\\
I mean, the whole reason why the Trio tried to get the stone is because "Dumbledore is flying toward the Ministry for Magic and won't be there in time", and she introduce her Floo Powder in what, chapter 3 of the next book?

**** It is a term from Sherlock Holmes.

They are the two ways one can engage with canon.

A *Watsonian* perspective tries to interpret the text /from the standpoint of the text/. This is sometimes called an /in-universe/ perspective.

A *Doylist* perspective stands outside the text, and is sometimes called a /real world/ perspective.

** Real answer? Basilisk likely didn't exist yet.

In universe answer? Any number of things. The basilisk could prove to be enough to get Dumbledore to move the stone. We don't know how Tom got past the whole â€˜eyes kill' thing, and it could be whatever it was wasn't usable as a parasite. It's also possible that the basilisk wouldn't recognize him as anybody other than Quirrell, making control impossible. He also may just not have trusted Quirrell enough to let him in on the secret or to not lose his nerve when having to deal with a bloody ginormous snake. Not to mention that the basilisk slithering about would bring down a lot of attention, which isn't something you want when you're trying to steal a priceless artifact.

*** I'm more partial to the real answer myself.

Regarding the basilisk being enough to move the stone, that is true if Quirellmort uses it as a distraction but can't take advantage of it to get it. And that is assuming that Dumbledore manage to get away from the Basilik.

However, Voldemort could have simply used it to kill Dumbledore. The Basilik being able to move in the pipes, I feel like it would have been possible to lay a trap for Albus. Lure him somewhere where the Basilik can get out, place a few mirrors here and there, and that's Albus taken care of.

*** Dude, the basilisk is a thousand years old, it did exist a year earlier

How could Dumbledore move the stone if he was dead via basilisk eyes?

**** They mean "didn't exist" as in questioning whether JKR had even fleshed out that there was a basilisk in the school when writing book 1.
