The cloak had some sentience and Harry wore it everywhere, he was eventually sent to Azkaban for a reason I don't recall and he ended up a demigod or god with the help of death. If anyone can help me out that'd be very nice


** When you say sentient, are you thinking like Doctor Strange's cloak, where it clearly has a mind of it's own and can move independently of it's wearer, or just something that whispers in the back of Harry's mind?

**** Could it be Blindness? I remember the cloak, ring, and wand all fused with him and spoke to his mind... And the cloak moved autonomously to protect him...

***** I don't think so, it didn't move around like floating or anything it just moved when it was on him, I also don't think he was blind
