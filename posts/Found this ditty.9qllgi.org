The aging Muggle made a mistake enabling an incident where The Pattern Of Diagnosis got plagiarized so I am hanging onto this for safe keeping: [[http://www.writerscafe.org/writing/sabledrake/2036886/][Harry Potter and The Eagle of Truthiness]] as you never seen it presented before. I think what would be funnier is Harry Potter being sent to Glenbard East High School in 1993 to attempt putting a spell on the gym teacher who raped a 16 year old.

The project he held in his hand was the second namesake as it brings him back into the 1990s when that happened. Glenbard East gained a nickname when I got a photo that was doctored looking like Harry Potter (I had the round glasses in the senior year, so the joke it got was Hogward's School Of Tabloid and Investigative Journalists.)

So anyone wanting to toy with the idea, Potter stopping Porras from killing a cab driver? You could always having Potter finding some of my roster's work too -- as that could be funny as hell what would Harry Potter make of the pulp era? She enabled an incident where Lake Fossil was getting lifted as she willfully stole my work for her bastardized franchise.
