She's a seventh daughter, the number seven being very auspicious in the wizarding world. She's headstrong, intelligent, and very good at spellcasting. I can't see how there /wouldn't/ be any stories with her as the protagonist or else just very prominent in a story without the excuse of being shipped with Harry and co. Are there any good fics that meet this criteria?


** Linkffn(the changeling by annerb) Ginny is sorted into Slytherin and slowly figures out why. Almost completed.

Incomplete; Ginny is the Gringotts lead cursebreaker in South America; [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=12260]]

Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4904485]]) Ginny goes back in time. The first two chapters were good; I didn't read past it for some reason.

Linkffn(from the flame to the spark by ephemeral-nightboy) Ginny goes back in time, is a determinator badass who goes after the horcruxes at 10 years old. Incomplete.

Linkao3(new world by seefin) complete, short shipping fic with Ginny rejecting expectations and going after the life she wants and finding love with Luna along the way.

AWESOME fic that fleshed out Ginny's OC friends and gives her goals and abilities that flesh out her badassery. Incomplete. [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/holden107/backfire.html]]

  Ginny Weasley pulls a PeggySue after Harry dies in the final battle. Featuring a determinator!Ginny who doesn't care how the previous timeline went, she's going to save Harry no matter what. Also, a minor not-really but sort-of crossover.

  There's that phrase Ginny heard sometime, years ago, she can't remember where; to look at someone as though they hung the moon. Ginny heard it and since then all she ever wanted was to be seen like that, as though she herself created someone's world, until it happened and she realised what a fucking responsibility it is to be someone's reason for living, the thing left over when everything else is taken away.

  Ginny never took Ancient Runes, but she grew up with magic seething in her sinew and coiling in her gut, and so laughter, hard and hysterical, bubbles up in her chest when she sees a precisely cut crescent moon sitting inside a pictogram of a sun.The sun marks the hours of the day, but the moon marks the passage of weeks. Months. Years. There's still shouting behind her.Ginny doesn't hesitate.

** linkffn(7921612; 6514733)

War for Hogwarts is not canon compliant. The author started out with the intention of making it canon compliant, but then he introduced enough new features and characters that it got out of hand, so he made it an AU instead.

  If this were a detective story, Ginny would write it up with the title "The Adventure of the Quidditch Player". Harry says that's a stupidly generic title for a detective story.
