:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey guys! Been looking for a fic a read a while back. I remember that Harry owes a LOT of money to the MoM with his lordships, and that Daphne and Draco join the Golden Trio in exploring the properties he now owns... I vaguely remember Harry Ron and Draco riding a magic carpet?

Any help would be great!!!


** Remembered something else! I believe that he went to Peverell castle and had a huge number of Thesterals there! Any help would rock!
