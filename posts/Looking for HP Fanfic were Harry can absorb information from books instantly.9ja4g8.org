*** Man, Barefoot coulda been so good. I absolutely fell in love with the thoughtful tone of the first few chapters, with Harry just learning everything he can using his ability. It could have been a slow, cerebral kind of story about the vastness of history and how little we really know. But then Harry started gaining new abilities and he could cast any spell since he'd seen them all cast from the wands he'd touched and ancient fairy magic turned Hedwig into a human (/not kidding/) and it just became another tired old OP harry memefest.
