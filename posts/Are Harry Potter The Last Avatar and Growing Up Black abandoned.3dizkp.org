** Here is my personal rule. If the story has not been updated in 12 months, its abandoned. The only exceptions are if their profile is updated with info. Do some research on their profile, and generally, if its 12 months with nothing, its probably abandoned, sadly. /this only really applies to Harry Potter Fanfiction. Anime/manga fanfictions are normally abandoned after 9 months, movie fanfictions are normally abandoned after 6 months, and all else is 4 months./ *Keep in mind these are MY personal rules. I do not pretend to speak for others.*

** Every time this question comes up (Is X Abandoned?) odds are that we have the exact information you do: When was the last post; has the author said in their profile or in the chapter that they are abandoning it or just busy; when was the last time they edited their profile or fav'd a story (showing activity). You can look those up for any author and make your own guess as to whether the author quit or is just busy.

**** I don't read those stories nor do I know their authors. Why don't you find out and get back to us?

***** Oh you should! They're great! Although, full disclosure, I'm pretty confident that they're abandoned because they haven't been updated in the last 18 months. Sorry that this gets asked so much. I'm new to fanfiction and didn't know if somebody else had information I didn't.

****** Typically if a story hasn't been updated in 3+ months it usually is abandoned or will get one to two more slow updates before being abandoned. Obviously there are exceptions but in my experience most stories die when the update gap gets that long.
