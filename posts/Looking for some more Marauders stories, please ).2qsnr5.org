Hey, I've read most of the popular ones: "The Life and Times", "Shoebox Project", "Against the Moon"...as well as some others like "The Age of Inertia" and "In My Time of Dying". I love young Marauder shenanigans, but I also adore stories about Lily (Snape as well, but only if they are realistic and don't sugar coat his bad traits). I'm also open to reading some about the Black sisters or Regulus. Has to be well written and canon compliant.

I need some for a plane ride tomorrow, so it'd be awesome if it were downloadable like SP.


** Check out "You Want to Make a Memory?"on hpfanfiction. Pretty decent, 400k words, complete.

*Summary:*

"This is the story of four boys. This is the story of how these four boys came to know each other, of how they became friends. This is the story of their unbreakable bond that could survive any test. This is a story that will ultimately end in tragedy."
