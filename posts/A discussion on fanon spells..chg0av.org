TL;DR: A lot of commonly seen spells probably don't work directly on humans. /Protego/ is absolutely nuts.

I see a lot of the below spells appear a lot in Harry Potter fanfiction, and often, they have vastly different or additional functions than they do in canon.

- */Summoning Charm/* - In some fics, characters are able to summon other witches and wizards. However, /Accio/ is described as a spell for summoning objects, not people. We've seen multiple objects be spelled unsummonable throughout the series (e.g. Slytherin's locket, Gryffindor's sword), so I'd assume, for sanity's sake, that wizards cannot be summoned as well.
- */Levitation Charm/* - You can't use this on people. /Mobilicorpus/ exists to move around human beings in the air, though it isn't seen being used for vertical transportation.
- */Reductor Curse/* - Oh boy, is this spell abused. People seem to think of it as some sort of explosion spell, like /Confringo/ or /Bombarda/. Sure, /Reducto/ appears to cause a small explosion, but it is mainly described as "blasting solid objects to pieces," sometimes into dust, and is /only ever used on objects/. I can't recall a single time it is actually used on a person in canon, and if it was, said person would be obliterated into tiny pieces.
- */Severing Charm/* - I believe this spell is only used once to harm another person, and it's when Hermione /accidentally/ cut Ron in Deathly Hallows after the café fight. It is never used like /Sectumsempra/, nor does it demonstrate similar cutting capability in regards to human flesh. Note that it is called the /Severing/ Charm, not the /Cutting/ Charm.
- */Shield Charm/* - ...this is pretty OP. The following assertions are all supported by the books:

  - The shield is invisible, but appears to manifest physically, as it knocked Snape off his feet in Half-Blood Prince (although this could be because of a reflected spell).
  - It doesn't seem to have a fixed size.
  - It protects against and is capable of reflecting a wide variety of spells, both visible (e.g. /Stupefy/, /Expelliarmus/) and invisible (/Legilimens/, /Accio/). It can apparently block physical forces as well.
  - It may be able to linger after being cast and could work in both directions, as it prevents Hermione from chasing after Ron in Deathly Hallows.
  - Honestly, given a powerful enough caster, it appears the only thing it /can't/ block is the Killing Curse, and maybe the other Unforgivables.

The moral of the story is, get good at the Shield Charm and spam it forever (since magical stamina /isn't a thing/).

#+begin_quote
  Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button. He punched it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air, hurtling straight toward the ground. “Hagrid!” Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. “Hagrid --- Accio Hagrid!”

  The motorbike sped up, sucked toward the earth. Face level with the handlebars, Harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer: He was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream, “Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand!”
#+end_quote

Hagrid had jumped off the bike to take out a Death Eater, so he was below. It says the bike sped up, but he had just hit the "speed up" button on the motorcycle, and I don't think Accio exerts any force on the caster. Hagrid is next seen on the ground, although he survives, so it might have slowed him down some?

** I sort of thought you were gonna be like 'the paint stripping charm is straight fanon and why would we expect it to work on human skin'. Different direction than I though you were going.

In the vein of your post though: I have two thoughts.

First: even if I can't cast the levitation charm on a human person (or, if you're familiar with Worm, if we assume the levitation charm is manton limited) then shouldn't I still be able to cast it on someone's clothes? Ditto for accio?

Second: I think the fundamental difference in perspectives here is that you seem to be thinking of spells as being task oriented. "The levitation charm is a spell designed for the task of lifting inanimate objects, therefore it cannot be used to lift /animate/ objects." I think most of us think of spells as being more function oriented. "The levitation charm is a spell which *lifts things*." For me, the severing charm is like hedge clippers. It's /designed/ to be used on dead things, or generally on non-human things. But if I want to, I /can/ use my hedge clippers to decapitate someone. If I have a hammer spell, while it might be designed for nails, I don't see an immediate reason it couldn't be used on skulls. That's not to say I think your point is without merit, it is totally possible that due to how magic works, a spell designed for task A cannot be used for task B. Maybe the severing charm has inbuilt limitations to prevent it being used on humans, or some sort of conceptual orientation so that it *is* purpose/task driven and can only do what it was built for. however, the fact Hermione accidentally cut Ron using the severing charm would seem to suggest against this. As an additional note, while the severing charm might be inferior to Sectumsempra for combat purposes, I would suggest that this has more to do with Sectumsempra being a *curse*; we saw how difficult it was to heal a wound caused by it, while presumably the severing charm would be very easy to heal, making it much less useful for combat.

Which is monumentally amazing, if you get into it...the amount of stuff you could get! I mean shit, didn't she only ASSUME Dumbledore took out some HYPOTHETICAL books on Horcruxes from the library? And yet she was able to summon said hypothetically removed books she didn't even KNOW EXISTED OR NOT, WHERE THEY EVEN WERE, or...GOD DAMN, and it WORKED! That's just insanely powerful and abusable.

I mean by that CANON manner of how the spell works, you could literally just go, "Accio lost Aztec Gold" and it'd come to you if it still existed, no matter where it was or anything! Or any other lost, historical, priceless stuff, like old paintings or whatever. You don't even need to know WHERE something is to summon it, or even that it exists! If it does, it'll just WORK. And it doesn't even matter how far away it is either!

And it works for vague shit too, like Mrs. Weasley on Fred and George's pockets of prank stuff or whatever.

Accio seriously has to be the most broken spell in the universe. And it's CANON broken.

** The problem with canon spells is that they used by JKR consistently as /deus ex machina/. Whenever she gets herself into some unresolvable problem she just pulls out of the thin air some new charm (or abuses some old one) and all is well. Yes, it doesn't make sense, because it didn't make sense in canon. Summoning charm is one obvious example, where it was obviously abused in horrible ways:

- No, I don't believe that summoning something which the caster cannot view, works (e.g., Harry summoning his broomstick in the Triwizard Tournament). She just struggled with the problem how to make fourth-year wizard compete in the really super-complicated tournament for the most qualified wizards. She cannot make tasks to easy, but she has to keep Harry's knowledge of spells quite limited. If the summoning charm was capable of doing what Harry her presents, there would so lees reason for wizards to ever move (which is generally problem: why are not all wizards and witches Vernon-like cylinders, when they can summon everything, they never have to move their feet, because of apparating, etc.?).
- Summoning something which you don't even know exists (Hermione actually didn't even know Dumbledore has the books in his office, not mentioning she didn't know the titles, she didn't know how they look, or even how many of them there are). If this really worked, the universe collapses, because most action could be done remotely, there is no need for most transportation, when unlimited transport for unlimited distances (see above) is available in one charm. What [[/u/Regular_Bus]] wrote above. It just breaks the universe.
- And yes summoning people (although, obviously that's what happened with Hagrid in DH) is a complete disaster. Why Hogwarts express, carriages from Hogsmeade, most walking, why to limit apparating in Hogwarts, when one wizard can just summon the other one (for unlimited distance, see above)? It just completely breaks the universe.

I think the only reasonable thing to do with some JKR's charms is to limit them to something reasonable in order to keep the universe functioning, and just shut your eyes when Mrs. Rowling uses them as /deus ex machina/. So the Summoning charm works on limited distance (only for visible objects?), with limited weight (no, one fourth-year witch cannot summon a carriage full of kids, nobody can summon Deathers' catapult in the Last Battle), and with a very specific intent.

And if the Severing Charm could cut people, Harry wouldn't have used it on Cedric's bag to get his attention, because, you know... risk of accidental decapitation.

  The moral of the story is, get good at the Shield Charm and spam it forever (since magical stamina /isn't a thing/).

We have seen Harry get exhausted by doing nothing but trying to master spells. The Patronus I won't say anything since there were other factors involved, but the summoning? There is no excuse there for that exhaustion unless magic usage has an impact on the body.

**** Nah he didn't I just checked the book, though it seems weirdly enough Hermione (the one not doing magic!) was the one exhausted, so I guess that one doesn't count either /sigh/

Oh well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

*** Newt summoned the Occamy egg that Jacob was holding. He also summoned his niffler, and in the books Harry summoned Trevor while practising it in the Gryffindor common room, so a living item isn't necessarily an exception, though a muggle human might be.
