Recently I've just been dying to see my red-headed HP girls in fics of their own! My last post was about Lily Evans, but this one is about Ginny Weasley, an amazing character that was dearly underutilized by Rowling, decimated by the movie series, and unfairly critisced by fandom. I'm sick of seeing Ginny being reduced to a jealous little girl who goes around and flings cutting curses at anyone who so much as looks at Harry. I'm sick of seeing Ginny get bashed endlessly for things she didn't do, or things she had no control over. I want fics that are focused on the real Ginerva Weasley---youngest child in a poor family, the first girl in generations of Weasleys, the girl who dared to defy Voldemort at the age of eleven! I want fics that explore this girl's world, and not just in relation to the Boy-Who-Lived. The longer the fic, the better! Preferably set during the Hogwarts years.


** I wrote DH from Ginny's POV. linkffn(Not From Others)

I also recommend linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince)

And if you're into AU, linkffn(The Changeling) comes highly recommended, though I haven't read it myself as I prefer canon compliant. The author is excellent though.

**** The Changelling itself is perfect, the sequels are kind of meh (the main dramatic conflict is that Hinny hides their relationship from everybody for reasons never well defined, WTF ???, I a way prefer kiss-him-in-front-of-the-whole-Gryffindor-common-room Ginny).

*** Not From Others is wonderful. I still remember how your Battle of Hogwarts made my cry. You fleshed so many things out which are only mentioned briefly in the books. It made Tonks' death so much more real to me, and the scene with Ginny and the dying girl was heartbreaking.

*** "Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince" is legit one of my all time favorites. I love Ginny's characterization and how it fleshes out Harry & Ginny's romance, making it more believable while not really changing anything. I love that it isn't entirely focused on romance, but let's Ginny be alive, and be a fun, funny and interesting character who also struggles with trauma from the chamber of secrets. And all the relations she forms with various others as well. I espescially like her interactions with Slughorn.

So yeah... Good stuff!

**** I like it for the same reasons, the only thing that lets it down is the characterisation/portrayal of Snape imo. He's too soft. I also seem to remember this fic suggesting Ginny looks like Lily and I hate that headcanon.

But otherwise, yes, an excellent fix and very well written.

***** Yes, Snape's outburst of "I WILL KEEP YOU SAFE, LILY!" Woah, boy, That really took me out of it for a while. Luckily, it's not a large part of the story, so I was able to ignore it.

I don't like the idea of Ginny looking like Lily either. It was handled a lot better when Slughorn noticed a similarity, but also treated Ginny as her own person. That makes sense, like I sometimes see someone whose appearance reminds me of someone else, but not to the point where I forget myself and start treating them as that other person.

** The [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][Changeling]] and its sequel series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/766017][Armistice]] are fantastic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary By Arabella]] is an old one that focuses on Ginny's diary interactions with Tom Riddle. It's long, complete, and portrays a Ginny who's very brave for an 11 year fighting a monster.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/book-learning-hp.446003/reader][Book Learning]] by Zerrer is a about a Ginny who's essentially been combined with Tom Riddle.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6997183][the train station]] by dirgewithoutmusic only has one chapter, but it's a really good analysis on Ginny.

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

  Ginny is reading a book by the pond at the Burrow and generally minding her own business, when she gets unceremoniously dumped in the...lake at Hogwarts? Now she is bouncing around in time with no discernible return date...maybe she shouldn't have been reading aloud. First chapter written in the form of letters back to her own time. T for language and mentions of drinking.

** One another idea, which has never been utilized WELL by anybody, AFAIK (including Ms. Rowling for her shame) ... one of the best dialogs ever written is in my opinion when Ginny talks with Harry in OOP about being possessed. That one line ‘“Lucky you,” said Ginny coolly.' ... she says two words, the line has five words, and yet we suddenly see that there are novels hidden there.

We all are touched by this line, because we all forgot (and yes, it is partially JKR's fault, because she wrote that excellent princess-saved-from-dragon-by-knight story, and then completely ignored her for two more books). What drama Ginny went through? How did she deal with the constant presence of Tom Riddle in her life? Was that the struggle which made her into a fighter? How did it change her? How will she live this change in the next fights? And nothing ... JKR just threw that dialogue to the readers and never fully followed up on it again.

There is a bit of it in linkffn(3912184;4236594), but I have never really saw it processed well enough.

*** Agree, and the scene in the library with Harry are pivotal in the Hinny relationship. Another area JKR promised so much was Ginny being the seventh daughter, and the first girl in seven generations. Nothing was written about that in her canon, yet promised so much. Can highly recommend The Changeling, and for any great Hinny stories, please check out FloreatCastellum, gryffindormischief and if you like AU, jenorama has a whole Potterverse of stories, with healer Ginny (was started before the books were finished) California Dreaming is epic! All great authros previously mentioned here, def a great place to start.
