It's my first time writing a dramione fic and I hope you all will give me some pointers to become a better writer. Thank you! It is rated M though.

Grey Space: Draco, by chance, is given a night with the most popular whore in London on the night of his 21st birthday. Little does he know that this brunette witch will forever change his life. For better or for worse. Warning: There is sexual content and there is rape and implications of rape, consider yourself warned.

  night with the most popular whore (...) there is rape
#+end_quote

So it is creepy and OOC even more than typical Draco/Hermione OOC creepiness. This is not encouraging.

And if by chance it is not yet another "rape is love" story it would be a good idea to improve description.

** First, a little detail that irks me. In the HP world the age of maturity is actually 17, not 21. In muggle UK it's 18. Since you put a lot of emphasis on that but didn't bother to do the research it shows lazy writing.

You use a lot of adverbs out of place. Draco looks at his dad "carefully", follows him "grudgingly" etc.

Voldemort took over and killed 3/4 of the muggle population. So he killed... 48 million people? And other wizarding communities didn't notice? Other countries? The muggles? How does the world look like after World War III? Because that's what you get when 48 million people suddenly dissapear. In canon this Voldemort thing is contained to UK. He uses subtlety and underhanded maneuvers to take control of wizarding Britain, such as it was.

  -FUCK. Hermione tightly squeezed her eyes as another mystery man yanked her hair. She couldn't yelp. That would earn her five lashes. Tears, another five. And if she dared fight back... you might as well sentence her to death.
#+end_quote

Okay, so I'm a little confused about why this is happening. I guess the people who would visit prostitutes are all so gentle and their partner's pleasure matters so much that prostitutes have to pretend to like it no matter what. I don't know, this doesn't really make any sense. I can imagine how that went down "These people will lose their erections or something if you don't enjoy it, so pretend you do or else it's [muggle means of punishment; let's just ignore the fucking magic, shall we?] for you." I lol'ed at "mystery man" tho. Is this what they call them these days?

Then you say people are still counting on her. I thought at first that would mean some kind of resistance, an explanation for why she didn't choose death over that life. Then I realized it probably just means "Borris" (why Borris? and that's not how you spell that name. Plus, I'm assuming Borris is a pureblood wizard, since Voldemort took over. The UK based ones are all old families who lived in the same place for generations. The only foreign one that we know of is Karkaroff, who was actually eastern european. So did Borris, a eastern european guy from an old pureblooded family traveled all the way to UK... to start a bordello? This is a small detail, but it's another thing in your story that doesn't really make sense.) counts on her to get fucked.

Reading further down now Borris is an innkeeper. So what's that, a brothel, or an inn?

Then the place is filthy and disgusting and she's getting lashes if she's not clean. Right. You could really delve into sex magic, potions, transfigurations etc here but you instead choose to make Hermione a victim and focus on how hard she has it. I'm assuming this is so that Draco can come and save the day.

*** You brought up a lot of points I didn't really think through. I know my writings really messy but thanks for pointing out the flaws in my logic. I'm definitely going to be making some changes in my first chapter.

But to address some of your points, when Hermione is having sex with one of the customers she is trying hard not to cry out because she will get punished for it, but she hates it. I'm assuming you think I tried to put it in a way where she is actually enjoying it? But I wasn't trying to do that.

As for why Hermione has decided to live instead of just kill herself, I want to reveal that in a later chapter.

Also I didn't know that the age of maturity in the hp world was 17 so thanks for letting me know that. I need to some parts of my first chapter and do some major studying on the hp world.

Thanks !

**** No, I got that. What I meant was "why?". Why does a random john care what the whore he's visiting feels like? Why would they go to pay for sex when they apparently have millions of muggles at their disposal to do as they please with? Why ignore the ways magic could work with sex? Just think about the polyjuice potion and what you could do with that. Endless possibilities and you tell me people in a brothel didn't consider them? Why does she steal one galleon of out the dude's pocket when we later learn he was supposed to pay Borris upfront? Why is she punished by muggle means when we have the Cruciatus? Why is she not enjoying it? I'm sure there are spells/potions that would turn her into a cock slut so why are they not using those... in a brothel?
