I was wondering if you fine people have read some good Non Harry Potter fiction.

What were they, and why did you enjoy them?


** [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] is absolutely brilliant if you don't know it already. Original work, groundhog day (or is it groundhog month) in a fantasy setting.\\
Difficult to stop reading once you're started.

I think the app only works for fanfiction.net, though, I'm using it quite often and I never seen an option to load fictionpress content.

  Aang awakes from his century-long hibernation to look up into Fire Nation eyes, and Mai finds that her trip to the South Pole has taken a turn for the exciting. In this Alternate Universe, the only thing more powerful than love is the call of betrayal. (This is going to be a long one, and WILL NOT rehash the cartoon.)

** The Double Agent Vader AU on AO3, where Darth Vader has his heel-face turn three years after Revenge of the Sith, and becomes the Rebel agent Ekkreth, and takes Leia as his student. The only person who knows that Vader is both Anakin and Ekkreth is KD-7, Vader's liberated Medical Droid (who looks like an Interrogation Droid, btw, and serves as the occasional voice for Ekkreth's transmissions, such as when dealing with Fulcrum.)

There are 20 stories, most of them are one-shots, but at least has two chapters.

** My favorite fic that I've read this year would have to be either from Detective Conan or Nirvana in Fire. The one from Detective Conan, linkffn(The Silver Bullets) a first person fic that I surprisingly enjoyed. It shows the interactions between two of my favorite characters from the non-protagonist's point of view. I'm normally not a fan of first person pov but I really enjoyed this one.

The other, from Nirvana in Fire would be linkao3(in the distance fading). Its a heartbreaking what-if fic that considers what it would be like if one of the characters never found out something he should have. One of the only fics that has made me cry and is just really well written.

** Linkffn(Robb Returns) is probably my favourite Game of Thrones do over story. It gets constantly updated on Alternatehistory.com and when he has enough for a full chapter he post it on fanfiction.net

Linkao3(the Ravens plan) is another do over story but instead of just sending a few people's minds back to fix things they end up sending like hundreds if not thousands of people's minds back.

** Avengers/Thor/X-men:

linkao3(A villian state of mind) A fantastic Loki - Charles Xavier cross over type fic. Loki is being held by Shield and Charles is brought in to help. God of lies vs. the guy who can read minds. Very good characterizations of both of them and has some great moments of Charles acting like a therapist to Loki just like he does for his more troubled X-Men.

--------------

Star wars Sequels:

linkao3(The Moon, the Sun, and the Star Inbetween) Completed in character Kylo Ren/Rey fic where the force brings them together and they up with a child. One of the descriptions is "parenting - sky walker style" which is to say quite dysfunctional and kind of hilarious. Has some great humour among the more serious moments and plot. Lots of fun snarky, sarcastic conversations from both of them.

linkao3(A Sepulcher of Prayer) Another Kylo Ren/Rey fic, only this one is in progress and very incomplete at this point although promising. Kylo is an emperor and thinks Rey is dead after one of his orders. Understandly he is kind of unbalanced and becomes somewhat obsessed with destroying Jedi temples and artifacts. Rey ends up in disguise at a point and interacts with Kylo and his knights with lots of great interactions and plot. Good writing, great world building and character portrayals.

--------------

Avatar/stargate sg1:

linkffn(The Dragon King's Temple)

It's an Avatar: The Last Airbender/ Stargate SG-1 crossover. Zuko and Toph find themselves prisoners on a different world and end up getting tangled up with sg1 after escaping Jaffa/bad guys together. Have to work together to fight a spirit based enemy despite not understanding each other's language or culture. Has some great mixing of the two worlds - one magical with element based powers and one with a more "realistic" sci fi setting with technology.

  Written for the Norsekink prompt: "SHIELD has Loki in custody, with the gag on to keep him from spellcasting, but they don't really know what to DO with him. They can't give him food or water or attempt to interrogate him with the gag on, and they don't dare take it off. Their solution? Call in a telepath! But Charles Xavier may find more things in Loki's head than SHIELD bargained for..."

  The Force moves in mysterious ways, and sometimes it even has its own agenda. Rey finds herself caught in a battle with fate that throws her together with Kylo Ren, binding them together in the most powerful way possible... only to have fate drop her like a hot potato.A broken Force Bond isn't the easiest thing to bear, especially when the one you're missing is your sworn enemy and the father of your child. Warning: Parenting: Skywalker Style. (Kind of a deconstruction of the X-made-them-do-it-to-have-a-child fics, which always seem to end once a kid is born, whereas I'm more interested in what comes AFTER the not so happily-ever-after.)

  Four years have passed since Kylo Ren betrayed his master and assumed the role of Supreme Leader of the First Order. He has one goal: eradicate all memory of the Jedi and their teachings. It has nothing to do with Rey, or the deafening silence in his mind since the day the Resistance fell. Nothing at all.
