  During the final battle Harry is hit with a luck spell... but who exactly got lucky? Harry finds himself in the future fighting a new war when all he wants to do is have a nice and easy life. So he decides to have fun instead.

  Harry felt the need to start over after the wizarding world took that final step off the ledge to insanity. What better place to begin fresh than a new galaxy where he would be the only magical?

**** I've tried reading a few me/hp crossovers before. Harry being the catalyst behind EVERYTHING of significance by humans in every one I read then refusing to be the first spectre for humanity only to change his mind when fem!shep comes along so he joins up and amazes everyone with how awe-inspiring and amazing he is all because he wants fem!shep to ride his disco stick has utterly turned me off me crossovers though you obviously couldn't have known that so thanks for the rec.

Tl;Dr not a fan of me crossovers but I may try to give it a go.
