Hey folks! I was over on [[/r/PottermoreWritings]] and saw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PottermoreWritings/comments/3lxcol/the_quill_of_acceptance_and_the_book_of_admittance/][this post]] by [[/u/dangerouslycheesey94]]. It's the Pottermore entry /The Quill of Acceptance and The Book of Admittance/.

#+begin_quote
  In a small locked tower, never visited by any student at Hogwarts, sits an ancient book that has not been touched by human hands since the four founders placed it there on completion of the castle. Beside the book, which is bound in peeling black dragon-hide, stands a small silver inkpot and from this protrudes a long, faded quill. These are the Quill of Acceptance and the Book of Admittance and they constitute the only process by which students are selected for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

  If anybody understands what powerful and long-lasting magic causes this book and quill to behave as they do, nobody has ever confessed to it, doubtless because (as Albus Dumbledore once sighed) it saves the staff tedious explanations to parents who are furious that their children have not been selected for Hogwarts. The Book and Quill's decision is final and no child has ever been admitted whose name has not first been inscribed on the book's yellowing pages.

  At the precise moment that a child first exhibits signs of magic, the Quill, which is believed to have been taken from an Augurey, floats up out of its inkpot and attempts to inscribe the name of that child upon the pages of the Book (Augurey feathers are known to repel ink and the inkpot is empty; nobody has ever managed to analyse precisely what the silvery fluid flowing from the enchanted Quill is).

  Those few who have observed the process (several headmasters and headmistresses have enjoyed spending quiet hours in the Book and Quill's tower, hoping to catch them in action) agree that the Quill might be judged more lenient than the Book. A mere whiff of magic suffices for the Quill. The Book, however, will often snap shut, refusing to be written upon until it receives sufficiently dramatic evidence of magical ability.

  Thus, the very moment that Neville Longbottom was born, the Quill attempted to write his name and was refused by the Book, which snapped shut. Even the midwife who attended Alice Longbottom had failed to notice that Neville managed to shift his blankets more snugly over himself moments after birth, assuming that his father had tucked the baby in more securely. Neville's family persistently missed faint signs of magic in him and not until he was eight years old did either his disappointed great aunts and uncles, or the old stickler of a Book, accept that he was truly a wizard, when he survived a fall that should have killed him.

  In fact, the Book's sternness has a purpose: its track record in keeping Squibs out of Hogwarts is perfect. Non-magic children born to witches and wizards occasionally have some small, residual aura of magic about them due to their parents, but once their parents magic has worn off them it becomes clear that they will never have the ability to perform spells. The Quill's sensitivity, coupled with the Book's implacability, have never yet made a mistake.
#+end_quote

I find the last paragraph very intriguing and I think it could have wide applications in fanfiction. Muggleborns actually stealing magic from wizards. George Weasley accidentally unlocks magic in unsuspecting Muggles causing riots and an overhaul of the world's structure. A parent sacrificing their magic for their Squib child. A psychotic child killing and stealing magic from his parents. An zany inventor in the Department of Mysteries solves the science of magic. A Pureblood family has to cope with the sudden revelation that their seemingly magical 11 year old is in fact a Squib.

I thought I'd read all the Pottermore writings so stumbling on this was surprising. I think it's a rich subject and I'd love to read stories inspired by it.

Is it exciting or am I just overreacting? Does this scream "possibilities!" to you?


** Whenever I read "muggleborns actually are stealing Magic from wizards", I can't help but think of "(insert race) actually want to harm and ruin aryans".

I would focus more on the fact that the book manages to miss actual wizards. Actual powerful wizards, just because they are not dramatically magic enough.

If you accept this story as canon then you have to accept it hasn't made a mistake. The book merely rejects early hints of magic that might be from a squib's parents, whereas the quill will write down any sign of magic. So no matter how strong a wizard will eventually become, they have to produce enough magic as a child to prove they aren't a squib. Which all witches and wizards do if it's never been wrong.

**** I interpreted the "It has never made a mistake" as meaning it has never given a false positive and allowed a squib into Hogwarts - which was its stated and only purpose according to the post. That doesn't have to mean it never had a false negative, and refused a wizard or witch by mistake.

Except by your own words a false negative would be a *mistake*, which it has never made.

There's probably a reason why it says the two strike a balance to avoid any kind of mistake, otherwise it would only be up to the book if it rejected real wizards.

****** It's purpose is not to admit wizards but to reject squibs. It is a negative selection criterion it impeccably implements.

Think of sexual fidelity. The goal is to not have sex outside of a relationship, not to have sex in one. A celibate person has perfect sexual fidelity - never having made a mistake - without ever sexing their spouse

Actually the whole point of the quill and book is to admit wizards. One tries to admit anyone related and the other waits until it's a sure thing.

Your analogy makes no sense because sexual fidelity only applies to those in a sexual relationship, otherwise it would only be called fidelity. A better analogy would be a wind-up alarm clock, where the spring inside is always trying to ring the bells, but the clock only allows it to when it's the right time. The point is still to have it ring though, not keep it from ringing.

The thread OP [[/u/Starfox5]] interprets the purpose of the entire set up to be to keep squibs out. It's a reasonable interpretation, because according to the source text the presence of magic does not identify a wizard (the book slams shut), but the /absence/ of sufficiently strong magic identifies a squib.

********* That's actually not a valid interpretation because you have no criteria for the book opening, which the text specifically states that it does. You're both simply ignoring that part and focusing only on when it closes because that was more defined.

That's like hearing a remote control will turn a TV off and thinking it can't turn it back on again because no one told you how it works.

********** I'm sorry for not explaining this well. I haven't slept in two days. I'm also on my phone now please excuse typos.

The text says that the book will slam shut when not enough magic is detected, and opens again given some dramatic expression of magic. Further, as I understand it (I have no idea how I got here) a squib is a person that isn't capable of magic at all, so that only residual paternal magic causes the quill to twitch. By contrast, wizards are capable of expressing magic but like the case of Neil Longbottom shows may not necessarily do so in a dramatic fashion.

The book and quill partition the set of children of wizards and witches, yes, but this works out as follows:

Someone is either a squib (p), or not a squid (not p); the book quill either writes down a name (q), or doesn't. It looks as though this were as you say, but we need to recognise that p is a hidden variable to the book and quill. It can not detect squirrels directly, but instead has to make use of the correlated variable of dramatic expressions of magic (m).

Thus, m implies q, and not m implies not q. But how does m relate to p? Well, p (squib) implies not m, and not not m (m) implies not p (not squib), but neither does not p imply m, nor does not m imply p. Substitute and the only true interpretation is that it never write down the name of a squid

This is provable

** It's deplorable. How many children were murdered by their 'purist' bigoted caregivers just because their magic wasn't 'flashy' enough for a book to accept? I'm thinking the only reason Neville survived as many attempts as his family put him through because there wasn't a chance of Frank fathering another son. They started small and only ended up being extremely drastic, i.e, throwing him out of windows/certain death, in his year before Hogwarts, whereas I can see that if they thought Frank capable of begetting a new heir they had likely have tossed Neville out within his first year.

Edit: possible storylines? All those squibs that were cast out were identified as muggleborns. The prodigal children return home. But then again 'VenGenCe HasT CoME/ HeRe's JohNnY!' storylines tickle my funny bone.

*** I think this entire idea goes against HP. Wizards don't have different levels of power. Neville 'almost a squib' is him just pouting and lacking self confidence and ability.

If people are born better at magic any others it reinforces the pureblood dogma. The strong marry the strong to have strong children. Can't let the mudbloods screw that up.
