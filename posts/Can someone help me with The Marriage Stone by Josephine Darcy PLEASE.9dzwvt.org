I work out in the oilfield, I am out for days to weeks at a time. This is my ultimate favorite story to read and I used to have it all printed out. But multiple moves I lost it. I can't copy it from [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] like I used to be able to, and the site that I found that I could get it copied was ArchiveofourOwn but it only has up to chapter 62.

​

​

If anyone could PLEASE help me out here, PDF or even .DOC or .DOCX or even a notepad! I would like to turn this into a PDF and get it on my kindle or- bettie yet- print it out again since I get no internet out there, cell signal is also weak. My kindle is on its last leg.

​

​

Any help greatly appreciated. Thanks!


** There are sites and programs you can use to download fics from FFN. I think there's some info in the sidebar (on mobile so can't check myself). If not, just search the sub (or [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]]) for saving/downloading fics and you should find some posts with info.

** I'm pretty sure the fic you wanted is the third one in this [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=The+Marriage+Stone][link]], you can download it as epub or mobi. It seems to work fine for me.

(You can download other stories too that are on FFN, quite useful)

** [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_ZGB-GngwP-myR4iq-QYi8Ytkh3T9sqX][Here]] is a link to a .mobi (kindle compatible) of the fic in question.

I was able to get this by pasting the [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] link into this [[http://ff2ebook.com/][converter]].
