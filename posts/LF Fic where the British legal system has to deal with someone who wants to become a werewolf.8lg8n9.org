If deliberately infecting someone with lycanthropy is a capital offence, how would the Wizengamot/DMLE/etc react to someone who actually wants to be bitten and publicly says so? Are there any decent fics that explore this?


** I'm unaware of any fic which explores the idea. However, you may be interested to know the position under Muggle English law, for a comparison.

Under English criminal law, it is possible to consent to harm which is trivial, but as a general rule it is not possible to consent to serious harm. The only exceptions to this rule are those which are in the name of public policy. So, for example, allowing sports to take place is a matter of public policy, as is permitting people to consent to medical procedures. Receiving a tattoo is another example of harm the public has an interest in permitting. A more controversial exception is the privacy of the marital home - from a case where a wife asked her husband to brand his initials onto her backside. It was considered a matter of public policy to permit people to consent to this kind of harm.

However, there are some prominent examples of harm which cannot be consented to. The most famous is from the case of R v Brown, in which the House of Lords ruled that there is no public policy ground for permitting people to consent to BDSM practices. As such, under English law, BDSM remains a form of battery/assault.

It seems likely that something like lycanthropy would fall into this latter category, especially as it is contagious. There are very much public policy reasons to deny that people can consent to the spread of the curse.

** Well lycanthropy is a thinly-veiled allegory for AIDS, so I think it would be considered in the same light as a "bug chaser"- it's illegal and probably considered a danger to society if you purposely go out of your way to infect yourself. Though if your character just ventures out to a werewolf pack, no one is going to stop them from asking to be bitten

...are you claiming that just in the context of Harry Potter, or in general? Because Wikipedia [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf][thinks]] that werewolf legends are many centuries old. And I don't think that anything about JKR's werewolves was particularly original - not a criticism of her, I'm just saying that it's doubtful she was making a political statement, when she was simply reusing a widely-known fantasy concept.

**** In the context of the HP universe

For example: Werewolves are limited in their rights and hiring opportunities based on their disease, something that happened quite often for the HIV positive in the 80s

There's a lot of fear and misinformation for the infected, as well as prejudice.

I think the registry of infected werewolves also is related? I'm not sure.

She's mentioned how Dementors are a symbol for depression, so I could see her using some real-world parallels

*** Various possibilities, depending on the situation and how the author chooses to depict lycanthropy. Perhaps to fit in with family, or with a romantic interest. Perhaps there are side benefits throughout the month, eg toughness or regeneration or enhanced senses. Perhaps just to enjoy the experience of the hunt (with Wolfsbane, of course). It could even be relevant to scientific research into how the lycanthropy curse operates. It's up to author creativity.

What I do recall is that different fics have written different things about Britain's werewolf population.
