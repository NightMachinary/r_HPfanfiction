** Have you read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966][The Second String]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Eider_Down/pseuds/Eider_Down][Eider_Down]]? "Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort."

It's Harry in Marauders era.

**** IIRC Harry's eventual boyfriend doesn't appear until 70k~ words in and there isn't any slash until 200k~ words in.

** There was one where Harry was sent back by Abelforth and he became TMR adoptive father. The story was nice enough. It's sad the sequel was never finished but the first "book" doesn't end on a cliff so that's that.

Maybe someone could provide a link.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald
