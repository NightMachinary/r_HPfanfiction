In a rational way of course. The most memorable part I remember about the story is that Harry, upon learning that Ron has arachnophobia, decides that the best way to get rid of the phobia is by turning Ron's girlfriend (Hermione) into a human/spider hybrid; which has hilarious results.

Edit: I just noticed that my title looks a bit weird; this is supposed to be a Looking For Fic post; I apologize if people thought otherwise. So feel free to take back your upvotes.

Echoes of Power, I think.

Chapter 28 is the spider transfiguration.

** Not exactly one you described but still brilliant is linkffn(The seventh horcrux)

You will see there how evil is Hermione, she planed genocide in fourth year. Also Ron is werewolf and most dangerous death eaters are Sirius Black and Hagrid.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

*** Love this fic so much. I realize the OP was looking for a specific fic, but anyone who hasn't yet should read this as well (if they're in to this sort of story). It's really well done.

*** Apologies, this was supposed to be a Looking For post, my failure to capitalize the L has resulted in some confusion. I really liked the story, that's why I posted this. Again, I'm sorry if you thought this was a preview for a story I was allegedly writing.
