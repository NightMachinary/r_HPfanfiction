Preferably Harmony, but Hinny's okay (I guess....)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/Error-of-Soul][Error of Soul]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9818387/1/The-Amplitude-Frequency-and-Resistance-of-the-Soul-Bond][The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond]] are the only two soul bond fics that I've read, and they are both good.

** I tend to separate soul-bond fics into two categories. One I call the "original" type of SB fics, where both participants actually enjoy being bonded from the get-go. Then I classify the others as "alternative" types. These are the more realistic bond fics, where both members take time to adjust to the bond that is forced upon them.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][Meaning Of One]]

This is probably the best of the "original" type of soulbond fics, where both participants actually /like/ being bonded from the start. You'll actually find that a ton of the "original" bond fics share /many/ of the same plot developments for whatever reason. This fic does pretty much of all them the best. It's Harry/Ginny, but very well written. Get past the first 2-3 chapters (where there's a ton of cliches) and you'll find a great fic here.

As to what's been recommended already, I would say both Error of Soul and The Aplitude, Frequency, and Resistance of the Soul Bond are worth checking out. Error of Soul being the better of the two.

** I reccomend my own very popular Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione fan-fiction. Harry and Ginny have the Soul-Bond. It is also a time-travel fic. It is going to be a trilogy, maybe four stories. The first part has nearly 1.5 million views.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8076284/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Bonds-Of-Time]]

And its sequel

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8531904/1/Bonds-of-Time-II-Fighting-Fate]]

Sequel is a WIP, but I actually just uploaded two chapters today and more this week, and more coming very soon!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7144149/1/Not-Normal][Not Normal]] His life was never normal, then it becomes truly abnormal. He must save a world he never cared for, but with others ... he can care. H/Hr and maybe others. Rated M to be safe.
