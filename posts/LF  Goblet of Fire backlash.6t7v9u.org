I always figured it was strange that the goblet of fire could force a magical contract upon somebody without their consent or knowledge, I figure that if Harry hadn't participated it would have been the person who entered him that was punished (in canon it would have been 'moody').

Are there any fics with examples of the GoF punishing somebody other than Harry?


** There are some I remember where he refuses to compete and Barty Crouch Jr loses his magic screaming, one where Voldemort loses his magic, and one where Voldemort loses his and his mark drains his followers magic. I remember but cant recall the names or more maybe that will help others help you though. It was years ago some before Book 5.
