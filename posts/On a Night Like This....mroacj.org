The Order of the Phoenix has gone through a terrible loss during the fight at the Department of Mysteries. But, instead of wallowing in their guilt and sadness, McGonagall and Dumbledore suggests that they pop open the 'nicer cellar' in Grimmauld Place and celebrate the now deceased people's lives. One thing leads to another, and Flitwick, Minerva, and Dumbledore are writing a 'strongly' worded letter to Voldemort in the form of a ministry interactive howler.

Meanwhile, Voldemort has marshaled all of his death eaters to talk about the loss in their numbers when an owl deposits a letter and it starts speaking in a Scottish brawl:

MINERVA: H-Hey! Voldemort!

/Voldemort stares at the letter with curiosity as everyone shifts uneasily in their seats. Draco Malfoy is slightly relieved because the Dark Lord was about to speak with him, and he had a wedgie./

MINERVA: We have some questions here in the order for you.

/Disgruntled British noises/ MINERVA: Stop it! You're just like that mutt of yours, peeing on everyone's legs!

LUCIUS: ...What?

MINERVA: How do you sneeze?

/Voldemort seethes/

MINERVA: If you're mad because your nostril's are always stuffed up, why don't you try telling some lies? It worked for Pinnochio.

/Voldemort seethes/

VOLDEMORT: Who are you?!

MINERVA: Who nose? Nobody nose!

/Voldemort seethes/

MINERVA: Hey, Hey, Severus! Why don't you cut off some of your nose and share it with him?

/Voldemort and Severus seethe/

VOLDEMORT: This is bullying!

DUMBLEDORE: Sorry! Sorry! She'll leave your nose alone, but how about that outfit? I always wondered where you got your taste in robes, Sevvy. And it certainly wasn't from me.

FLITWICK: Amarylis /\/hic** are red, you've got a big, white, shiny, greasy, veiny, blue-ish, bald head, we all hate you, and soon you'll be dead :D.

/Voldemort seethes/

DOLOHOV: Happy Valentines Day...

/Bellatrix pouts into her hands and runs out of the room in tears./

VOLDEMORT: Avada Kedavra!

/Draco Malfoy slumps on the table, dead./

VOLDEMORT: If you're going to try to take cloth out of your arse, at least have the DECENCY TO ASK TO GO TO THE BATHROOM!

*I dunno, I just think that this would be fun...*
