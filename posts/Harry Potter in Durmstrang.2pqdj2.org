I've just read Harry Potter and the boy who lived by Santi and I'm hankering for a Durmstrang fic. I know santi said he/she's close to posting more but I'm impatient.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557311/1/The-Magnate][The Magnate]] has a Durmstrang Harry. The author self-identifies it as being heavily inspired by The Santi's story, so there will probably be some familiar elements. It has a few issues that damage my enjoyment, but it's still early enough (fic is 40K-ish words at the moment) that I'll reserve judgment. Might tide you over, though.

** E. C. Scrubb's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/1/When-a-Veela-Cries][When a Veela Cries]] has Harry at Durmstrang for a good part of the fic. It's a bit of an angst-fest, but might be something you'd enjoy.

Another is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557311/1/The-Magnate][The Magnate]] by Halt.CPM. 40k words, updated in November.

  People fear Voldemort for his power -- a striking combination of innate genius and surgical precision. People fear Grindelwald for the men he led and the system he created. Voldemort or Grindelwald, Mr. Potter, which one are you? HP/FD AU - Inspired by Santi's BWL and Fettucini's Knowledge is Power. Durmstrang!Harry with a focus on politics and economics later on.

****** I didn't find the story that dark honestly. There were definitely some dark undertones but nothing too blatant. I haven't read it in a while though so I would have to double check.

It's horribly long and the second part is unfinished, but this story does a great job with Durmstrang.

*** It's a good story, but it has HP/TMR slash, as well as HP/OC slash, which might put some people off.

** This one I'm reading actually sends Harry to that school for the tri wizard tournament, so not what your looking for and the writing is ok at first but improves:
