Any recommendations for Hermione time travel fics? I don't mind what pairings really but I do love Hermione and Sirius!


** Fate Set Right is a Severus/Hermione pairing. Never thought I'd ship them, but this story made me adore him!

  In what was supposed to be her first ski trip since the war, Hermione wakes up from an avalanche to find herself back in time. Despite her search to return home to her time, she is forced to relive her last years at Hogwarts and the War that she knows will claim the faces that now haunt her. In Particular, the face of a certain Weasley that she finds herself slowly falling for.If you were forced back in time, would you try to save him?

  Hermione would like to think that she was old enough and mature enough to have a handle on her temper, only clearly she didn't, because it was 1991 and she was eleven. Again. Over a stupid slur and Pansy Parkinson being her predictably spiteful self.

  At this very moment, Hermione Granger is a tiny muggleborn child who's tried half a dozen spells. No one is scared of her. No one knows to expect her."We're really doing this," Pansy eventually says, breaking the silence. "We must be insane.""We're saving the country." Hermione tears her gaze from the sunrise across the treetops of the Forbidden Forest to find that Pansy is already looking her way, something resolute in her gaze. It's too solemn of an expression for a child, but Hermione's probably isn't better.

  Hermione Granger, age 11, makes a wrong turn when shopping for her Hogwarts supplies and finds herself transported from the year 1991 to 1941. Tom Riddle doesn't know how to feel about the fact that by trying to cultivate Hermione's knowledge hungry side he's cultivated himself a younger sister.

  Too much loss and too much suffering drove a desperate Hermione Granger to make a bid for a different outcome. Albus Dumbledore had once told her that it was dangerous to meddle with time, but Hermione was willing to sacrifice everything--up to and including herself--to change fate and create a better world for those she loved. Perhaps she ought to have asked Dumbledore to clarify the dangers of meddling with time.

  Hermione is sixteen years old when a wall of Time Turners breaks near her. She glances toward the chaos and sees time floating freely from the small golden charms as clearly as she sees a shower of glass and flashes of red and green light all around her. Then she hears something both distant and familiar; all the truth of space and time and herself swell up within her. Tears fall from her eyes before she collapses onto the floor. When she awakens, Hermione has two hearts.

  Hermione strikes a deal with Death: she collects his Hallows for him and he puts her back with the living, where she belongs. If she'd known it meant a whole lot of time-travel, robbery, lies and fights with Grindelwald himself, she might have reconsidered his offer.

Hopefully you haven't read it yet! It's well written and has Hermione plan a trip to the past for three years after the end of the war. She's pretty thorough which I liked. She enlists Sirius' help and together they try to track down Voldemort's horcruxes and destroy them. I'm only about 40% of the way through, but I hear there's a huge plot twist!

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
