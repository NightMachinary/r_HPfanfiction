Preferably including the part where Harry tells him he's seen Peter Pettigrew on the map, and then Remus (presumably) begins to work out what really happened.

Thanks (I hope I've done this right - reddit newbie)


** Yep! Although correct me if I am wrong, but I think Harry doesn't tell Lupin that. I think Lupin sees Pettigrew on there himself after confiscating the map from Harry.

Anyway, two fics I would recommend for this are:

1)[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7860277/1/Chemistry-Timing][Chemistry and Timing]] - A GREAT WIP time-travel fic with Lupins POV during most of canon (starts with POA though). One of the best time travel fics I've read and I've read a LOT. The basic premise is that adult Hermione travels back to 3rd year and hides in the castle for 10 months until she can go back to present day. The only people who know are Remus and Dumbledore. The POV switches between canon Remus and time-traveling Hermione.

2) For Sirius and Remus's POV during POA, check out [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/940338][Padfoots Tale]] and the companion [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/946711][Moony's Tale]]. They are 100% canon compliant but do take the view that Remus and Sirius were a couple before Sirius went to Azkaban. IIRC they aren't smutty at all if you aren't into slash.

  1993-94: Twelve years have passed and Remus still cannot forget, nor is he any closer to understanding why Sirius betrayed his friends and the man he loved. Now Sirius has escaped from prison, and Remus has come back to Hogwarts looking for answers. A retelling of Prisoner of Azkaban from Remus's point of view. Heavy in Marauders-era and First Wizarding War flashbacks.Warning: This story has not been edited yet, and may contain unintended problematic elements and tropes.

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? WINNER BEST DRAMA MARAUDER MEDALS 2016!

*** I think you're right, I think the part I'm thinking of might just be in the film, not the book. Thanks for the recs, I'll definitely give them a read!

** I'm writing one now! It's 100% canon compliant and is literally just PoA from Lupin's perspective. I'm planning to start posting chapters in the next week or so; I can send you a PM when I do in case you're still interested.
