** I got into HP fanfiction during the 3-year summer and it was great, it blew my mind. I feel that was the golden age of the fandom, there was so much creativity, so many ideas going around. Authors had just enough canon to write whatever they wanted without being limited by /the/ /future/.

The years after OotP weren't bad either, it introduced Luna Lovegood, it gave Ginny a personality and it killed Sirius but it didn't really tell you what would happen in the next book.

Sadly, HPB happened. The main characters HAD to chase horcruxes in some way or another in the 7th book. The ending left no other alternative.

Multiply that limiting effect about a thousand times for the epilogue of DW. That thing made everything AU and not only restricted what could happen in the 10-year gap but it also killed a lot of the "WHAT HAPPENS NEXT" thing that motivates new fans into writing and reading fanfiction.

It's not that fanfiction no longer exists or that it's all bad now but the new books completely changed the way it's written. Even random AUs tend to include what happens in the books.

I think the most similar thing to the freedom of those early years is nextgen but I can't bring myself to care about those characters.

The only book I remember reading as it came out was DH. I devoured it in a day or two, at the age of nine. But I think that's why I like EWE so much - it says, you know what? Screw the epilogue, because it limits what we can do.

And I don't really like next-gen either because it basically accepts the epilogue as immutable fact.

** There was obviously a lot more speculation. It would take time for theories to germinate and make their way through the fandom. For example, the "Harry is a horcrux" theory was suggested within days of HBP's release, but I think it took a long time for people to come around to it. Most fans (including myself) were sort of instinctively against the idea that Harry was a horcrux, it just didn't seem logical in light of what we knew about horcruxes. But there were a few pieces of supporting evidence (why Harry had a connection with Voldemort, some hidden meanings in past conversations with Dumbledore, etc.). One theory was that Harry was the heir of Gryffindor and a horcrux (which would make him "something of Gryffindor's,") but JKR debunked the idea that he was Gryffindor's heir.

By the time DH came out, the fandom was probably about 50/50.

There was a lot of speculation about who was going to die. There were even people putting bets on different characters. This [[http://www.today.com/id/13819658/ns/today-today_books/t/laying-odds-harry-potter-dead-pool/#.VjwHTaK4CTU][article]] from 2006 lays the odds on a lot of different characters, and I think it's relatively close to what the rest of the fandom was thinking. A lot of people thought Hagrid was going to die. A lot of people guessed that one of the Weasleys would die, though many were hoping it would be Percy.

Shipping trends depend on when you joined the fandom. Even as early as PA, JKR was already being very clear that Harry/Hermione wouldn't happen, while hinting that Ron/Hermione would. By GoF, it was blatant. A lot of people figured that Ginny would come up as well, and JKR might have confirmed it. So there wasn't as much actual guesswork when it came to the main pairings. However, there were definitely a few Harry/Hermione shippers that convinced themselves that a) JKR's insistence that Harry/Hermione weren't going to end up together was just her trying to throw people off the scent, or b) JKR was wrong about her own characters and obviously a terrible writer. There was also a lot of Remus/Sirius shipping. I can't remember any other major ships that didn't sail.

**** That was never a mainstream theory, to be honest. I think someone suggested it on a forum pre-DH (back when we knew curiously little about Dumbledore's family/history), and then someone else stumbled on it and shared it. I think it's only become more popular since DH came out, even though DH and the existence of Dumbledore's family puts the theory on shaky ground. I think most people just enjoyed the idea of it, and liked how well it fit together, even if they knew perfectly well that it wasn't true.

**** Part of the problem, I think, was that the books and the movies started cross connecting and infecting the canon perceptions of relationships.

I think most people would agree that for whatever reason (the writers gave Hermione all the good lines, cutting out plot points that made Ron look better, etc) Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson had better chemistry on set. This could be just a general side effect of the purposefully awkward interactions Hermione and Ron were supposed to have, but whenever Dan and Emma interacted, it felt much more organic (various parts of HBP, cemetery scene in DH, the strangely added dance scene in DH).

So while most logical folks understood that by GoF book-canon, the Harmony ship was fighting upstream, it was hard to reconcile that fact with the better on screen chemistry that Dan and Emma had. It is made even more difficult by the fact that in the movies, Harry is the obvious hero and Hermione - due to Emma's attractiveness and the writers giving her the more helpful parts - pretty much became Hero #2 instead of a sidekick like Ron.

Also, let's face it. A majority of the HP relationships are rather underdeveloped. I enjoy that the books try not to focus on relationships over everything else, but for a lot of people, H/G and B/F and R/T had very little development or just came out of the blue. On that same token, while Hr/R obviously had the major romantic subplot (especially in HBP), it was easy to say that it /felt/ more forced than anything else.

***** No, they've calmed down a significant amount.

The pairing has always rubbed non-Harry/Hermione shippers the wrong way because it involves making one if not two of the members of the trio OOC, and it usually destroys the third member of the trio in the process. Not to mention Ginny. Any other ship that involves someone outside the trio still allows one of the two main pairings to continue to exist. For example, if you pair Hermione/Draco, Harry/Ginny can still live happily ever after. If you pair Harry/Draco, then Ron/Hermione can still live happily ever after. But Harry and Hermione destroys both of the two main pairings in one swoop and usually destroys the trio relationship as well.

Before the books were released, there was a minority (or at least I think it was a minority) who believed that either a) JKR was just trying to hide the truth from fans and Harry/Hermione would be obviously in the final book or b) JKR was a bad writer who didn't know her own characters. Whereas now, most people who ship Harry/Hermione (hopefully) know full well that it's not supported in canon. But they're able to enjoy it for the same reason that others enjoy Harry/Draco.

******* You're right that it still changes the dynamic, but the trio was written in a way that accommodates a Ron/Hermione relationship without cutting Harry out completely.

In canon, there are multiple signs that point to Ron/Hermione, from their arguments in HBP to Harry telling Ron that Hermione is like a sister to him. So if you're using canon as a jumping off point, you have to orchestrate the transition from Hermione/Ron to Harry/Hermione. Which is naturally going to create some hard feelings. Best case scenario is that Ron is the one-time flash-in-the-pan boyfriend. But the more likely scenario stars Ron as the angry jealous jilted OC boyfriend who's angry at both Harry and Hermione. Within canon, Harry/Hermione don't actually have a super solid relationship in one-on-one contexts. Ron acts as a buffer. So when you change their characters to make them fit together and turn Hermione into someone who can make Harry laugh and connect with him emotionally, then Ron effectively becomes superfluous to the trio. He no longer brings anything to the table.

Ron/Hermione entering into a relationship /does/ change the trio's dynamic, but in a different way. The thing is that Ron/Hermione have always had their own relationship going. We don't see much of it because we're reading from Harry's POV, but it's absolutely there. Harry takes it for granted that the pair of them will always be together, but that's no small thing. There are multiple references to them having fun without Harry being involved, like when they came back from Hogsmeade "looking like they had the time of their lives." And note that in every year after CS, Hermione met up with Ron /before/ Harry did. Harry is used to eating his breakfast while Hermione/Ron argue or meeting up with them after spending the rest of the day alone. In a way, he's already used to playing third wheel.

And not to over-simply their characters, but there's a difference between two sidekicks hooking up and one of two sidekicks hooking up with the hero.

Hermione/Ron's relationship would absolutely affect their relationship with Harry. However, Ron/Hermione getting together doesn't create a schism in the trio like Harry/Hermione would.

******** It just bites a bit, I guess, to have a group of close platonic friends as the main characters the whole way through, only for them all to pair up at the end. Although at least the books aren't quite as bad as the movies in that regard - I'm looking at you, sudden!Neville/Luna in DH II.

The romantic elements along with the suggestions of 'endgame' and what can then be read as foreshadowing (the 'rescues' of Hermione and Ginny in PS and CS respectively) can put a bit of a damper on the friendships they had before. As if, despite their skills and the equality of the wizarding world between men and women, Hermione and Ginny could ultimately only be seen as 'the girls' and as romantic interests of Harry and Ron. And as if the friendship that they all had, no matter how strong or crucial it was, could only ever be a warm-up or a precursor, or an interim stage between the romance between the characters. Them all being friends and that not being a big deal, despite being of mixed gender, was a pretty cool departure for kids' book characters, for a lot of us growing up at the time anyway.

****** I wouldn't argue that the shipping wars have calmed down, I think they've just taken on a different nature than from 10-15 years ago (just take a look at the February 2014 reignition). Back then it was all about which ship would happen based on what is in the series. A more "scientific" approach than to what we have now. Now, we've got all the books, it's become more about which is the best pairing overall and preferences.

Which is why I think it hasn't calmed down. Harmonians view themselves as the shippers who actually stand a fighting chance against the "canonistas". The main contender to R/Hr and H/G is Harmony. Same as with the Snape/Lily shippers. There is that stamp of "recognition" from JKR, even if she disses both ships. You don't see anyone as +delusional+ vehement as the Harmonians in for example the Wolfstar shippers, even if it is still as fanon of a ship as Harmony is +cough cough even if i do believe something happened behind the scenes cough cough.+

When the books where still being written I truly believed that JK would kill off Ron. Thus making Harry and Hermione free of the trio dilemma of which you speak.

When it turned out that Dumbledore was the "big death" that pushes them to hunt the horcruxes I was crushed. I loved Dumbledores character in cannon and have never been a fan of Ron.

I know it's a children's book but there are some dark themes that would work well in Harry Potter that were never explored. Which could have been if Ron died.

** I'd echo a lot of what had already been said, but I'd add in that I spent the entire time between books six and seven SWEARING Snape killed Dumbledore on his orders. I thought it was so telling. Between the conversation Hagrid overheard in the forest and and the use of the word 'Please' I knew I had it right. Everyone told me I was a fucking lunatic trying to maintain his good name.

***** Why, the infusion of asphodel and wormwood becoming the draught of living death of course....

But really it was Snape's Worst Memory not making sense. Why is a dude who we've seen signs of an unhappy and abusive home life, a brutal violent young adulthood that he seemingly is making efforts to pay for, constantly being bullied and nearly being killed by one incident of bullying (which would sensibly be the worst memory associated with bullying) given a chapter with that worst memory?

Never mentions harry's mum, deranged lose-shit-out with Sirius black but not Lupin, reading waaaaay to much into scenes with Snape, wondering why Dumbledore trusted him so much and trying to solve that mystery was a big part of it. I also had a feeling there was some great Snape payoff to be had somewhere that included love. So much of Snape did not make sense to me while reading the series and Philosopher's Stone basically trained me to take nothing at face value (I did not see Quirrel coming). It's mostly subtext and fan analyzing.

Then you just go out on a really long limb.

** I got into fanfic after GoF came out.

Like 50%+ of long fic at that point was intended to be to end the series. We had a lot of time on our hands at that point. I remember a lot of trilogies for fifth through seventh years.

Shipping still gets a little touchy now, but it was fierce then. Shipping was a HUGE thing. People got into legit scary arguments over it in a way I've not witnessed since.

I don't know if I'm just not as invested in the fandom itself (still very invested in Harry Potter) or have just gotten older, but it definitely seems like there's a lot less drama. I remember when Cassie Claire (now a published author which still confuses my brain) got kicked of FF.N for plagiarism and a whole new website (fictionalley) happened basically because of that. Huge divides in fandom. That became the place to be for Harry Potter for a very long time.

I think a lot of the divides are also maybe gone because things are settled now. Everyone had their theories and a lot of people were very passionate about their theories (shipping or otherwise), and sometimes they didn't get along when their theories didn't mesh. But that's all sort of over. I don't know if FB or Cursed Child will have the same kind of impact, but I kind of doubt it.

But it was great. There was nothing like that community when we got new canon for the first time in years. Everyone devouring the book, discussing the book, writing fic around the book, developing new theories for the last book and desperately trying to figure out how to reconcile favorite theories that had been crushed.

** interesting that no one has mentioned a pattern i observed: before the final book came out (and for a bit after), fics naturally tended more toward the what comes next variety. it was often an exercise in wish-fulfillment; we may not get a book for 18 months but let's fill in the blanks ourselves. etc

now that the blanks have been filled it seems to me that wildly au and prequels and crossovers etc are more prevalent (or were a few years ago -- there's not as much new stuff in general these days)

*** Just having fics that ignore Horcrux's and Deathly Hallows is refreshing these days. There is an upside to having more canon information though, for example:

- Arabella Figg was just an crazy old cat lady who used to babysit Harry until Order of the Phoenix. I actually started a fic with the premise that she reports how Harry is treated to Dumbledore early on. Dumbledore doesn't care so she decides to start training Harry in secret. Enter 11 year old Harry with a full background of magical knowledge minus how to actually cast spells.
