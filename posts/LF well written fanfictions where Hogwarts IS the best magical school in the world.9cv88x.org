Where it produces highly talented students that are respected worldwide and it's a name everyone knows, with lots of competition and prodigies graduating from it. Hogwarts was described as the best school of magic in the world and I want to see something that proves it.

*** Yes, which is why I mentioned high competition. Magic is hard and these students are talented, which is what makes it the best school in the wld . I want them fighting over library books someone has checked out. Clubs and activities for extra competition because they want other things to work on, impressing foreigners, etc.

The only thing you can say about magic in Harry Potter is that it's completely and utterly inconsistent, which is why you have things like Molly randomly defeating Bellatrix in battle.

**** Pettigrew wasn't really stupid, he spied on the order without ever being caught, tricked the entire wizarding world (other than one man who he had sent to azkaban with nothing but a few well chosen words) into thinking him a dead hero then found and resurrected voldermort when he was finally found out.\\
He wasn't a great duelist or the best in his year (and his year seemed to be exceptionally talented), but nothing indicated he was actually doing badly.

I suspect that casting Fiendfyre isn't the hard part, it's controlling it, and he failed rather miserably there.

**** If we take Pottermore as canon, becoming Animagus is more a matter of persistence than talent or skill: it involves a large number of steps, many of them very inconvenient (like keeping a mandrake leaf in your mouth for several weeks, IIRC), and there are some points where you might get stuck. Since you don't really control your form, and since most forms one is likely to get aren't particularly interesting or useful, most wizards and witches just don't bother.

Ditto the Patronus, actually. Unless you are planning to tangle with Dementors and Lethifolds or know Dumbledore's messenger trick, it's little more than a cute visual effect. The reason it's not on the OWLs is that OWLs have more useful spells on them. For that matter, the hard part about it is not casting the Patronus itself but casting it in the face of a monster that drains the very emotions you need for the spell.

How is Molly defeating Bellatrix random? Do you know something about Molly's skill level that the rest of us don't?

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

** The low quality of the teaching staff would need to be addressed. I'm specifically looking at History, and Divination when I say this as (from what we can see) both are definitely sub par. Care of Magical Creatures is potentially on the list as well, though that is up to author's discretion how much training Hagrid has received, and if he is aware of the value of a syllabus.

I know that Rotaryfile has a tendency of having Hogwarts be the best school in Great Britain, with the "hedge schools" being more of the local variety. YMMV on his quality.

I've seen a few others where Hogwarts is the school where the wealthy and those intending to get into the Ministry will go, while others go to more trade school equivalents.

*** The real issue with teaching staff is DADA.\\
I doubt many places do better for divination, you're either a seer or you're not, Trelawny at least has the gift, as does Firenze, so who really cares about that (though offering it as a full OWL to non-seers might be a mark against them).\\
With the attitudes we see it wouldn't surprise me to see history overlooked.

Nothing indicates care of magical creatures was a problem prior to Hagrid, and he does seem to know his stuff (he can handle cerberi, acromantulas and tends the only tame thestral herd around), though he has problems with what's safe or not (likely because as a half giant few things are genuinely a threat to him).

DADA though has been cursed for decades and as one of the three main practical spellcasting classes is definitely going to be important. I imagine it was taught well prior to the curse and for a fair few years after, so any ranking from then could see hogwarts taking the top spot.

There's also potions which clearly isn't well taught, though snape is at least well qualified, though it honestly doesn't seem to have impacted the actual OWL and NEWT results so perhaps he's not that bad (Harry gets an E at OWL and only neville has it worse than him).

**** I was going for objectively bad, as opposed to bad from Harry's POV. I remember having a teacher I did not like, but who was technically quite competent. I also remember loving a teacher, but she didn't prepare me for the next year.

Defense is a crapshot. Some years we got Lupin, or Moody(ish). Others we got Umbridge.

Personally, I think Snape, at the very least, shouldn't be around children. He is technically competent, and could be decent in a collegiate setting, but is not fit for children and teenagers.

That said, he has potential as a skilled potions master.

  where Hogwarts *is* the best magical school in the world
#+end_quote

Ouch! Good luck on that one mate.

There's certainly a bunch of fics which still assert that it's the best school, whilst changing nothing from Rowling's framework.

I see a lot of people trying to rationalize canon Hogwarts, which, to me, is a bit intellectually dishonest. Because no matter how hard magic is in canon, there's no reason to stick with the same formulaic conception of magic in Fanon, and certainly it's pretty demonstrable that half of the Hogwarts staff is grossly incompetent in some fashion.

Anyway, finding a fic where that idea has actually been put into practice will be pretty hard, good luck!
