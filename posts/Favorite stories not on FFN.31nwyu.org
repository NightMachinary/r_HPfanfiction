** The Blackman series (HP/Batman fusion where Sirius Black is a masked wizard vigilante) by MattSilver, and /The Stalking Blood Sack/ by Nuhuh are both tons of fun and really funny, in an over-the-top way. Both authors post other stuff to FFN but those two stories are only available to DLP members.

*** Blackman series is probably the greatest crackfic in existence.

Even if you don't like crackfics in general, I basically guarantee you will laugh aloud at several points in the story. Fantastic.

*** The Blackman series sounds intriguing. Are memberships on DLP available to the general public, or do you need an invite from an existing member?

It seems like you can just register. Just don't post anything stupid. I managed to not get banned since 2008. The secret is to not participate.

In order to access stories posted in Work By Author (WbA) on DLP, you need an account. Signing up is free and I believe it lets you see WbA threads as soon as you join, but there is a slight delay before you can post while your account gets moderated to make sure it's not a bot. Correct me if I'm wrong on that, but I think that's how it goes. Either way: free, no invite needed.

I will, of course, look at that, but even the title sounds like it was, uhm, “inspired” by GM Fraser. That should be great, but the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4605681/1/The-Real-Us][last time]] somebody tried that, the result was some of the shittiest shit ever shat.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300?view_full_work=true][The Very Secret Diary]] by Arabella : A classic for the ages. It is basically an account of all the conversations between Ginny and the Diary horcrux. The last few chapters as Riddle slowly drains Ginny of her soul are truly horrifying.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=325749][Clash]] by shez :

/Albus and Rose, brilliant but opposing minds./

/He is cold, cruel, and nothing like his father. All she wants is to save her brother./

/War looms, magic consumes, and lines between right and wrong blur as they egg each other down a path no wizard has dared to go before./

/This time, it's not just about saving the world. First you have to survive it./

The first is exclusive to AO3 and the second to HPFF.

*** Holy shit, that was a chilling fic. An absolute classic! All it needed was a little "find and replace" with Ginny's name.

** /[[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]]/ (90k words, complete): In seventh-year Potions, a cauldron explodes and kills Hermione. The same thing happens the next day--and the next--but no one seems to notice except Snape...

Apologies for the slight derail --- and please don't take this as criticism of anybody's tastes --- but looking at her fics reminded me of something... There is this pattern for Harmony fics where Harry is whisked away in his early childhood to be raised by Sirius (usually). In 1995±1, he returns to Hogwarts (which is usually when the fic begins), and

1. Harry's gotten a massive upgrade relative to canon, e.g., a champion duelist, an animagus, a potions prodigy, an occlumens (all at 15±1), who has been able to cast silently since he was 12, etc.: a total badass who is also a perfect gentleman.

2. Hermione's only achievement of note has been to get very good grades (but her academic achievements also pale in comparison with Harry's, if he's ever been formally assessed). If she is lucky, she might have a friend or two, and if she is not, the whole of Hogwarts student body is lining up to bully her; and, if she happened to have had a relationship with Viktor Krum, she will have been used and her heart broken --- and that's if she is lucky.

A variation on this theme is when they get sorted into different houses and don't properly meet until 1995±1, and the divergence has resulted in Harry becoming a badass, and Hermione... not.

--------------

*The Question:* Are there any Harmony fics with this setup (Harry gets whisked away or they get sorted into different houses, and they don't meet until later) where neither Item 1 nor Item 2 hold, i.e., Harry's capabilities ans achievements are comparable to those in canon at the time, as are Hermione's? Or, alternatively, Item 1 holds, but the divergence also results in Hermione having had her own set of adventures, resulting in someone whose capabilities and achievements are comparable to or greater than those of Harry?

I know of exactly /one/ fic that comes even close to that, /Snow Queen/ by [[/u/Darklooshkin]], and that one features a Fem!Harry, whether there will be any sort of romance is unclear, and it's a heavy AU, so I don't think it really counts.

** So since you mentioned H/D and Snarry...

I'm still really bummed that Mirror of Maybe was abandoned. Have you tried the [[http://www.intertexius.com/_index-harry-potter-fanfiction-and-art.html][A Bittersweet Potion]] series? It's also been abandoned, but there are 5 completed 'books.' Very good! Also there's an incredibly long(but finished) [[http://www.noiresensus.com/authors/a_sushi.html][Civil War series]].

Anything by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/faithwood/pseuds/Faith%20Wood][Faithwood]] or [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/femmequixotic/pseuds/Femme][Femme]]. Also here's the full link to Ivy Blossom's [[http://www.noiresensus.com/authors/a_ivyblossom.html%5C][popular trilogy]] as only Origins seems to be on AO3.

The Harry/Draco Big Bang was the official Big Bang challenge and has quite a few awesome stories that are archived on their own site, but I'm not sure if the individual authors posted on ffn.
