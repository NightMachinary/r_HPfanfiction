Do you know any fics or even authors similar to (those of) scifichick774? I really love all her Sirius/Hermione fics and most of all her Remus/Hermione fics (I mean What really matters is bloody brilliant) but the pairing isn't that important rather the writing and the settings (well except for Draco or Snape fanfics I'm really not a fan of those). Thank you! Also the rating doesn't matter either I'm up for anything.
