got sent this game and thought I'd share. It's pretty self explanatory, also feel free to use different characters as well. I might try to add this game to a story I am writing. (It'd be all the boys in one chapter talking about girls and in the other chapter it would be the girls talking about the boys).


** does Hermione look like Emma Watson, or is she just an average girl?

** AK: Harry, Marry: Neville, Fuck: Ron

Harry's fine, he'll survive it. I nearly chose Ron, because I thought Harry'd been through enough, then I thought meh, poor sod would probably rather be AK'd.

Neville by far would be the most stable husband.

*** That's what I'd go for too, I think. Of all the HP boys, Neville just seems like he'd make the best husband.

I wouldn't mind a fling with Ron, just casual no-emotional-strings-attached sex. I think he'd be fun. The only problem is that Hermione would probably kill the both of us... or at least set vicious magical birds on us.

Harry has survived two Killing Curses, so he'd survive a third one. I don't really want to kill anyone...and I couldn't even cast a Killing Curse anyway... wait, hang on. I'd challenge him to a round of Mortal Kombat, and then beat him (because no way he gets any video game practice!) and then I'd perform a Fatality move! Hah!

...Probably not. Ginny and Lavender might agree to it, but I can't imagine that Hermione would.

***** Perhaps not, but I think the story of the others trying to convince her would be funny to read.

"Y'know, we should have called Luna instead."

"Oh, come on, she's like perpetually twelve. This is really more Penny Clearwater's thing."

"Or Pansy's."

"Yeah, but she always wants to be the center of attention."

"I would call Parvati, but she's so repressed."

"You're not repressed like Parvati, are you Hermione?"

****** /-giggle-/

You're right, that is funny.

Thing is, Hermione always struck me as ever so slightly prudish. Not that she hates sex or anything, but I can't see her as wanting anything to do with a foursome, much less a lesbian one. And trying to tell her that she'd be graded on her performance would no doubt sent her into an annoyed rant. :D

(I'm actually planning out a fanfic with heavy harem themes, where Hermione is one of the girls who refuses to have anything to do with it.)

** Well ... have coitus with Lavender (she seems the most “free-spirited” of them all), not kill Hermione (I wouldn't be able to cast the killing curse, but even with knowing that trying on Ginny would end badly), then not marry Ginny (because as progressive in certain areas they are, I highly doubt a girl--girl marriage is a thing for them).

I think I am seriously perverting the statistics there.

And no, using the Killing Curse on yourself is not allowed.
