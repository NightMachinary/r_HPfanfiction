I /think/ that in the fic Rosier/Dolohov was at a wedding(?) and he had this girl he really liked and she eventually died and he was forced into becoming a Death Eater. I'm pretty sure it was a oneshot and it was very long IIRC

  Antonin Dolohov hadn't always been a Death Eater. He once was a champion. He once had a family. He once had a wife. This is the story how he lost it all. Winner of the DLP July Politics Competition.
