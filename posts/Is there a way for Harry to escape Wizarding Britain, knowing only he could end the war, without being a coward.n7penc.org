I've seen in a few comments people saying Harry should've just left Wizarding Britain to fend for themselves and run away. That it was not his job to stop Voldemort.

I suppose that, yes, it shouldn't be him. But it was. Only he was in position to end Voldemort's threat forever.

These people really seem to hate Dumbledore too. Further analysis led me to believe they are confusing Canon Dumbledore with Fanon Dumbledore.


** Was it though? Harry doesn't learn of the prophecy's actual content till book 5, and even then many in the wizarding world such as Hermoine, Ron and Mcgonagall believe divination to be unreliable. The prophecy never states it is Harry, either. Considering it's basically asking a child to fight against 'the most powerful dark wizard' of his generation seems a bit off.

*** Before book five Harry could run away without being a coward, no problem. After knowing the prophecy, he kinda has the moral obligation not to.

Prophecies don't necessarily happen. Harry could end up not defeating Voldemort, but he was still the one with the Power He Knows Not. The one who had the power to vanquish the Dark Lord.

If I hand some random child the power to end a terrible war, but only after being hounded and abused for most of their life, being repeatedly tortured, and watching many of their loved ones suffer and die, all for a bunch of people that wouldn't step around them if they fell on the ground?

Let's not forget that even if only Harry can end Voldemort once and for all, that doesn't mean he's required to defeat Riddle and all his Death Eaters and other minions/allies by himself. Most of the time, everybody but a small group around him seem to shrug and go "Eh, let Potter deal with it."

No, it wasn't. It's not the job of a teenager to fight a civil war if he doesn't want to. Especially for a people, country and government that turned on him. In canon, they only won through a series of random lucky coincidences, author fiat and deus ex machina.

Voldemort also has a strong fixation in killing Harry, so I don't think he can just scamper off and be safe. Canon Harry is fully aware of this fact, and knows he can never be safe as long as Voldemort still lingers around.

** The simplest way is if he has something more important to protect.

An example:

Let's say Lupin was on a mission for Dumbledore, so far pretty canon - he did visit werewolf packs on Dumbledore's behalf, and things go wrong. After all, the werewolves have been heavily discriminated against and Fenrir Greyback convinces them pretty easily. Remus tries to escape, but fails. Or maybe it was something unrelated and he got ambushed.

Harry finds himself with a 8 month old Teddy Lupin and comes to the quite correct conclusion that he's a wanted man in Britain and he can't guarantee Teddy's safety, and he doesn't quite have anyone he could turn to in that regard.

Harry decides to leave. He might do it alone, he might take Hermione with him - she has the least attachments, contrary to Ron, who has landed family to worry about.

​

This fits both with Harry's "saving people thing" - it provides a reason to leave that doesn't stem from self-preservation or any form of deep thinking.

There are too few fics that actually admit this because you know, if a story isn't a crossover then most of the interest in Harry Potter tends to be in the conflict (the exception to this rule is Holly Potter and the midlife crisis where for some reason I find the chapters where she's just a cleaning lady to be more interesting to the chapters after she reveals that oh yeah I'm actually Holly Potter and the master of death, fuck you Odin!), but honestly, the idea that he would be a coward to leave is absolute bollocks

In short, no is a complete sentence, etc etc

Them losing their confidence means they start naming names of those less prepared than themselves and spreading their gold around, so that after all is said an done, they may have spent some galleons on bribes and walked the "Totally under Imperius" walk of shame, but after all is said and done, the results are the same as when Voldemort was put down the first time. They all walk, and they keep most of their riches and influence. As a result, they are ready to start again in less than ten years. Voldemort was only ever the symptom, not the disease.

In lesser measure, it's on some of Aurors and Hit Wizards - those who signed up for the job, took the pay, and when the going got tough failed to even show up (I'm talking about those who folded and worked in Pius' Thicknesse administration)

#2: On the muggleborns that stayed despite getting all the warning.

After all, if you are a Little Piggy and you get an advance warning that a a Big Bad Wolf is about to come and puff, and huff and blow away your house of straw and eat you up, you do not stay - you move to either another house where there are no wolves, another house that can't be blown away, or a hotel. You do not wait for the Wolf.

You're right that those who know of the threat should have the sense to run away. But the muggles don't know of the threat, neither do the new muggleborns that pop every year. And if Voldemort continued unopposed, then he would eventually take over everything, and there would be nowhere to hide.

No. Harry did all he could ever be expected to do in the aftermath of the Triwizard Tournament.

He brought back information and passed it onto Minister for Magic, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, Supreme Mugwump of the ICW and the Acting Head of Department for International Magical Cooperartion.

If they had decided to follow up on that, it would be a different matter. But as of canon, Harry's done all he could be reasonable expected to at that time and earned his Honourable Discharge - and that is if one subscribes to the mistaken belief that he ever owed Britain (either one) squat (he didn't).

#+begin_quote
  muggles don't know of the threat
#+end_quote

Patently false. Muggles have the Queen and the Prime Minister who are aware of the situation and can mobilize armed forces. With the diplomatic situation with M!Britain no longer relevant, they have no reason to hold back anymore.

After all, Death Eaters are killing their people, and it's not like they can't employ some muggleborn as spotters to get around magical tricks.

Voldemort might have been scary, but very successful he wasn't. Even Grindewald achieved more - and that guy was eventually beaten back.

********* Man, you're missing the point. My question asks if Harry, knowing only he could end Voldemort, decided not to and run away could still not be a coward. This isn't based in canon necessarily. My question assumes Harry thinks he's the only one who could stop Voldemort, and still chose not to. Knowingly leaving innocents who did nothing against him to suffer.

It doesn't really matter if Harry is indeed the only one capable. What matters is that he thinks so.

** He's only in a position to "end the threat of Voldemort forever" if you believe in the prophecy.

If Harry believes the prophecy is bullshit, he has no reason to care.

Canonically, /Dumbledore/ doesn't believe in the prophecy. His concern is that Voldemort will never stop chasing Harry because Voldemort does believe in it.

Why would Harry be a coward for not wanting to die against Voldemort? It's not his fight, Voldemort is far more experienced and skilled, and realistically speaking, he doesn't stand a chance of winning. What exactly has wizarding Britain done to deserve Harry dying to save them? They were willing to believe comedically awful yellow journalism calling him an attention seeking liar. The entire school turned on him, */twice/*, and the second time it did so, even */Ron/* got in on it. The only people who have consistently been on Harry's side are Hermione and the twins.

Fuck wizarding Britain, and fuck Hogwarts. Why would Harry be a coward for leaving?

Hell, even if you do believe in the prophecy, Harry can still fulfill it by leaving. Either must die at the hand of the other. The hand of. What is their hand? Them in-person, certainly, but if a marked Death Eater kills Harry, that's also "by Voldemort's hand," is it not? The same operates in reverse. Anybody could decide to fight Voldemort in Harry's memory or name, and if they killed him then Voldemort would have died "by Harry's hand." Literally anyone in the DA or anyone who was a member of the Potterwatch or the Harry Resistance Movement in the last two books could have offed Voldemort, and the prophecy would have been fulfilled.

Harry literally does not even have to be on the same continent as Voldemort does to fulfill the prophecy.

If anything, I'm disappointed there aren't more fics where Dumbledore takes his own disbelief in the prophecy and acts on it more openly. I like Dumbledore, but there was a point where he should have honestly just kidnapped Harry and left Britain behind to go wandering the world with just the two of them. I know why he didn't, because he did not want to leave Hogwarts vulnerable without his presence there as a deterrent. But Dumbledore behaving a bit more selfishly would be interesting as a premise.

**** You've yet to explain why walking away from the war is cowardice. You keep assuming that it is and making some sort of demand that someone explain why it isn't.

I've yet to see any explaining for why it IS.

I already outlined for you that Hogwarts and wizarding Britian don't deserve to have Harry throw his life away for them. They're a bunch of thankless bastards and midwits who believe yellow journalism is sacrosanct. Even Molly Weasley believed Rita Skeeter when she wrote an article slandering Hermione.

Fuck Hogwarts, and fuck wizarding Britain. Why is refusing to throw your life away for a bunch of low-IQ thankless asshole "cowardice?"

If they refuse to believe Harry and Dumbledore when they warn everyone that Voldemort is back, that's not Harry's problem. Let them believe what they want. His parents died so that he could live, not so that he could throw his life away. Let Voldemort have wizarding Britain. It's hardly a prize, and they deserve each other.

** There is no actual proof the prophecy even refers to Harry and Voldemort

It mentions someone born as the seventh month dies but does not state by which calender it goes by, states an unspecific Dark Lord once again making no mentions of any names or even any identifying features that may lead one to say it is Voldemort nor does it reference how it should be fulfilled beyond the vaguest bunch of b.s ever,

"Power he knows not" could be anything from some bizarre magical thing to a pack of duracell batteries

The only reason Harry is at all believed to actually be the chosen one is due to Voldemort being a paranoid idot with extremely poor long term planning skills & even then he only succeeded due to the constant (be it good or bad) machinations of Dumbledore who saw a way to end the war & took it

Hell it doesn't even state it has to be magical, given how vague the prophecy is and how close the timing is for the original releases, for all we know it could simply just be a prediction of the plot for the original Star Wars trilogy

**** Hence why I mentioned the machinations of Albus,

Dumbledore saw an opportunity to end the war with Riddle and took it by purposefully grooming Harry to be a sacrifice and that is Canon btw not Fanon,

Dumbledore openly admits as much in both his own office after Sirius falls through the Veil "10 long and dark years" & in Snapes Memories where even Snape is horrified by his own admittance and realisation that "you've been raising him like a pig for slaughter"

Thee best way to deal with it is for Harry to basically be kidnapped by Sirius after the disaster that is his fourth year, with Padfoot deciding he has already lost too much family to the war between Dumbledore & Riddle,

He refuses to lose Harry too, believing James and Lily gave their lives for Harry and not for the sake of everyone in the entire wizarding world, he simply grabs his godson and buggers off elsewhere with a very confused Harry who is slowly coming to realise that for the first time since his parents, an adult is actually putting his wellbeing first

Remove that loyalty from the equation and Harry is left with the choice of either facing an enemy who has proven to have somehow transcended death in unknown ways, possesses over 50 years experience in mastering countless Dark & Unknown Magics and is the Leader of a Militant Faction that is formed of and financially backed by numerous members of the current Ruling Government

Harry leaving is not a betrayal, he is not a god, he is not responsible for the choices of those around him, he is not property of the wizarding world, he is a at most a teenage man-child who has no idea what he is doing or why everyone keeps expecting him to save them when they spend most of their waking moments vilifying and demonizing him for not living up to their standards

In order to betray someone or something there must first be Loyalty, the Magical Populace has displayed no such loyalty meanwhile Harry has been forced to continuously prove his Loyalty to them, as such his leaving would be more akin to exiting an abusive or toxic relationship then any sort of Betrayal

Unlike Peter who shared a strong & Loyal Bond with all the Marauders for numerous years until the war began testing the Bond between them and he chose to willingly abandon them to save himself

The only reason Canon Harry won was Plot Armour and Deus Ex Machina B.S that was created solely because JKR wrote herself into a corner with how severely lacking Harry was as a Hero compared to the levels of power displayed by Voldemort

Without that Harry is both hopelessly and hilariously outmatched in terms of knowledge, mastery, followers, abilities and experience when it comes to facing Voldemort and his followers

As such he would need extensive training in order to even be classed as a halfway decent challenge which would potentially take years

As you have pointed out innocent people will die but regardless of what he chooses, stay or go, fight or train, innocent people will still die

So no, its not cowardice or betrayal for him to leave as in order for him to grow stronger, no matter what path he chooses innocents will die
