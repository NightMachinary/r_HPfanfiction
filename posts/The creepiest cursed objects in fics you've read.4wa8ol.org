A few days ago I read a fic where Harry's twin brother got a toy train as a birthday present. Thing is, the toy train then turned mutant and almost shredded his arm. The train then went into the crowd and would burrow into people, and it would come out of people's chests with duplicates.


** I dont remember the fic, but there was a comb that when one person used it, it stored the memories of that person via their left over hair, and if another person used it, they would have their memories forcibly overtaken by the memories of the previous user. Example: if you murdered someone and you thought of the murder as you combed your hair, then had say your maid comb her hair, the memeries of the murder you committed would go onto the maid as if they were her own. It made it so that even under veniterserum you would admit to the murder believing that you actually did it. It was twisted.

*** Wow, I think that's actually a pretty clever little plot device (and twisted obviously).

**** I dont think it was ever used in the actual plot, it was on display in Knockturn Alley.

But it probably would have been tho.

** In a really beautiful (and thrilling!) Drarry fic called linkao3(All Our Secrets Laid Bare by firethesound) there were Dark Magic traps that would set off Bonegrinder Curses (where your bones are ground up into dust before your eyes), and Breath-Boiling Curses (where each breath you take slowly liquifies in your lungs).

Gloriously gruesome stuff. :)

*** I've seen a few things like that too.

1. A spell called Imago Dei. If the Ministry catches you speaking of it, you're thrown through the veil, as the Ministry in the story the spell as in deems you dangerous to even rot in Azkaban.

2. Skin melting curse. It melts the skin painfully...and slowly.

***** Yes. You can do anything with it, as long as the sacrifice is worthy.

It's all in chapter 70 of Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. I have little interest in repeating a sizable portion of the chapter.

  - There is a powerful OC appointed by Sirius's will to train Harry. However, this person's potion kit is short of several ingredients, and his actions are often closer to abuse than training. He always wears a mysterious Pendant richly ornamented with jewels, and it creeps the fuck out of Harry's spidey-sense. Eventually, it is revealed that [[/spoiler][he created --- and keeps improving --- the pendant himself, by transfiguring his defeated enemies into new jewels, adding them to the pendant, and syphoning their magical power for his own purposes.]]
  - Another artefact allows (those who know how to use it) [[/spoiler][declawing someone protected by a prophecy by pouring so much psychological abuse on them at once that the prophecy stops recognising them as its capable agent]].

- /[[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][(Sacrifices Arc)]]/

  - At one point, for using in a ritual, Voldemort transforms one of his minions into a still-living resemblance of a [[http://darksouls.wikidot.com/skeleton-wheel][skeleton-wheel]] by re-forming (braking, re-growing, transfiguring, etc) their bones and organs.
  - Another character sends a timed magical bomb of sorts to Harry. The bomb's hosts are several infected humans whose bodies burst into a cloud of infectious miasmic cloud (AFAIR).

- Various stories in which horcruxes are brain-wiping (gradually or instantly) their hosts.
