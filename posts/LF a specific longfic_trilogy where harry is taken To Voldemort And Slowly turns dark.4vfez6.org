I'm new here so I apologize if this breaks any rules. But I read this thing ~10 years ago and I'm on a 24 hour guard shift so I'm digging up all kinds of shit...it's stuck in my head this long so I'm hoping somebody else knows what I'm talking about. Unfortunately I don't remember many details. I'm pretty sure the title was "HP and the * of *", it was a trilogy where each part had a title in that style, and it was either on ff.net or in some kind of pdf-looking format. Plot-wise, it was kind of twisted and dark. Harry gets kidnapped/taken by Voldemort during a summer with the Dursleys, and while he starts out rebellious, he slowly starts to work with Voldemort and see the world differently and there's all kinds of conspiracy/Stockholm Syndrome type stuff going on. Of course, I was also like 13 at the time, so it might be different from how I remember it. Does this ring any bells for anyone?


** Well, this one has Voldemort doing far more insidious things to Harry: *Yes, I am Harry's Brother*, linkffn(8192853).

If would have been a great story if it were not for that creepy Tonks romance.
