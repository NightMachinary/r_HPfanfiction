Hi!

My new obsession is any AU where single parent (Typically Remus, Sirius or Harry) raises a child (normally Teddy or Harry) and starts dating.

I recently read a Harry/George one that I loved, but I think I've gone through all of the ones above 10k words on Ao3. (I'll read on any site - but it's harder to find what you are looking for on FFN)

I prefer fics that are 10k+ words. I tend to avoid fics that are centered around any death eater character.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thank you for your help!

Edit: to clarify the death eater note I don't hate drarry fics. I mainly just avoid any of the main ones (ex. Tom Riddle, Bellatrix, Snape, the Lestranges) I will read fics with the characters in them - I just tend to avoid those when any of those are the main characters. No hate - just personal preference. I have started to be open to more and more pairings and main characters than I was. üòä


** Hi OP! What are some of your favourites in this genre if you don't mind me asking :D would love to read em

*** The majority of them are wolfstar, because what can I say, I'm a sucker for anything involving Remus & Sirius.

These are all Muggle AUs - all but one are wolfstar.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4294544/1/Always-In-Your-Shadow-Calista-Snape-Volume-I]] have it, but instead, Severus is a single parent.

This saga (there is others volumes) is easily one of my favorites.

** I feel like most of the Remus and/or Sirius raising Harry AUs that I've read have them both raising Harry or only a short period with just one of them. Do you have any recommendations?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28442610/chapters/69698007][*Astronomia Nova*]] *by sreka:* Sirius Black is almost thirty, almost always alone, and almost always stressed out. For the past four and a half years he's been raising his late best friends' son, just trying to keep himself afloat. But his exhausting life of school drop-offs and staff meetings is interrupted when he runs into a gorgeous librarian - literally - destroying a priceless book in the process. As the men continue to meet - by chance or by design - they become more drawn to one another. Soon Sirius will have to make a choice: risk throwing a wrench into his already-chaotic life and threaten the stability he's work so hard to create for Harry, or risk losing the exquisite man who's slowly but surely captured his heart.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22023679][*Until you set your old heart free*]] *by asterismal:* Harry turns sharply on his heels, swinging Teddy into the air once more, and as Teddy collapses into a giggly mess at his back, Harry looks at him, and he smiles and... Oh. Oh, fuck. He's in so much trouble. In which Sirius Black survives the war, adopts Teddy Lupin, and refuses to fall in love with Harry Potter. (Note: Harry and Sirius do not get together until Harry is in his 20s.)

I also have a few excellent Drarry as single dads recs if you're interested - just let me know. I saw you said you avoid Death Eaters as main characters.

*** I was looking for Astronomia Nova! Someone else asked the same question and I actually just posted some of the fics I read.

I'll take those recs! I'm starting to run out of good fics to read with my normal pairings, so I'm slowly starting to branch out.

**** Astronomia Nova is so cute! I especially love Rourke by the same author. It has nothing to do with your request, but I highly recommend it if you haven't read it yet.

Thanks for posting your recommendations! There are a few I haven't read yet so I'll check those out. Here are a few Drarry recs:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11979036][*Dating for Dads in Denial*]] *by aibidil:* In which one wizard designs and another reluctantly patronises a magical matchmaking service, amidst the chaos of children and parenting.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15968624][*The Godric's Hollow Wizarding Parents Association*]] *by AhaMarimbas:* When Draco decided to move his small family to Godric's Hollow, little did he know he'd have to deal with misleading television programs, some surprisingly friendly neighbours and a bit of peanut butter. Okay, lots of peanut butter.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16810249/chapters/39457795][*All I Want For Christmas (Is For You To Stop Talking)*]] *by Femme and noeon:* The Niffler's Garden is the most prestigious wizarding nursery school in England and has been for the last century or more. Harry Potter's boys are both enrolled as pupils at the Garden. When he volunteers to assist with the Yule pageant, he has no idea that he'll be working closely with another parent, Draco Malfoy. Although they haven't seen each other much since their own school days, Harry faults Malfoy for not being a hands-on dad to little Scorpius. Will the intense weeks of preparation fan the fires of enmity or something else entirely?
