I've seen and read a lot of fanfictions but tbh Time travel fics are that decent...

Can someone recommend good time travel fanfics that have a good storyline and aren't just a random splurge of words.

Thank you!!


** This one is still updating but it's wonderful. Voldemort is sent back in time so he heads to the orphanage and starts raising himself.

  A strange man adopts Tom Riddle and it is not his father, as Tom desperately wants to believe. Stranded in the past, Voldemort once again comes to the conclusion he's the only one he truly needs.

** Oh do I have a bunch for you

These are just some of my favorites

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9235939/1/Finding-Time]])

Most realistic version of the butterfly effect IMO, loved how it affected the timeline big and small

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847/chapters/18163144]])

Probably one of the best fics I've read in general, very well thought out

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440/chapters/47238583]])

Good portrayal of Lavender Brown, girl knew what she was doing

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13428032/1/In-Loco-Parentis]])

Wish there was more of this, heartwarming

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10675725/chapters/23634993]])

This. Just this. BAMF characters, cool magic ideas, definitely give it a try

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

  Hermione Granger doesn't know why she was sent back to 1992, but she's not going to waste this second chance. Even the Chosen One needs some responsible adults on his side. After all, Harry may not know it, but he's Hermione's best friend. As she takes up the DADA post, "Jean Watson" is not going to let anything happen to him-or any of her friends for that matter.

**** Seconding this one! The first act is very cinematic, the second act is just delightful as we follow along with Teddy's wild ride, and the third act has some fascinating worldbuilding. I fell in love with Teddy immediately, and the background OCs really leap off the page too.

There's a very fun [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15589665/chapters/36194733][“sequel”]] as well that basically just takes the idea of Delphi from Cursed Child (but none of the characterization) and runs with it to create an even more hilariously disastrous AU of Into the Arena in which both Teddy and Delphi were raised by Harry. I haven't read CC and don't intend to, but I love this one too. Highly recommend.

ETA: I'd also add that this author's most popular fic is another excellent time travel story.

ETA2: The bot isn't replying so I'll create a new comment and try again.

  Betad by Eider Down.Severus remembered dying, bleeding out, his consciousness barely there. He remembered pain. He remembered his one last look into those green eyes, doomed as they were to join him soon in death. His heart ached, as his neck ached, as his body ached.He greeted death as a friend.Severus didn't expect to wake up. It was rather disconcerting, really. One moment he was drifting away, and the next he was aware of his body again, just as sore as before. It felt approximately the way he imagined coming back from the brink of death should feel like. Which is to say, fucking awful.Hell would have been preferable, instead he's now back in the past, inexplicably in the infant body of Harry Potter. What should he do? Can he change events for the better? Whom can he trust?Meanwhile, there's something slightly...off about his cousin Dudley. Only time will tell, but at least that's something he has plenty of now.Severus is about to find out why they say you should walk a mile in someone's shoes before judging them. A different time travel fix-it. Likely the oddest Severitus (Sevitus) you'll ever read.

*** Absolutely LOVE this one!!!! There are quite a few spelling errors throughout the story, but if you can ignore them then the concept is just BRILLIANT

It's about Post-War Hermione who is healing from the losses of the war and PTSD, being flung back in time to just after the Department of Mysteries fiasco, and forced to essentially relive the entire war again.

What I loved the most about it is that how realistic it feels because Hermione is NOT the same after she goes back. Much as she tries to stick to her timeline, she can't think like she used to because she's a seasoned war hero. Worst part is how she has to see and interact with people she knows die and she can't exactly warn them.

** Well you can try the story HP: Dolen Amser by Jonn Wolfe. It's a Harry/Tonks story where via spell interaction Harry ends up going back in time to his first year but the original Harry is still there. So this older Harry is not allowed (swears on his Magic) to change the time line because of dangers of creating a paradox. Of course, that is easier said then done.
