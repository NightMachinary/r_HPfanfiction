  When there's a significant drop in the magical population, stressed Unspeakable Hermione Granger finds the answer. The Wizengamot threatens a Marriage Law unless a temporary Procreation Bill can make them see reason. Fortunately for Hermione, her chosen spouse knows how to work out all of her tension. --- Rated M for language and sexual scenes (Neville/Hermione) *Art by Simona Polle*

  Hermione Granger returns to England after years away. Things have changed back home, but so has she; though Hermione doesn't know just how much. No one ever said change was easy and in her case it is downright dangerous, but she wouldn't be alone. Not only do drastic changes affect Hermione's life and magic, but she will also end up bound for life to another. Hermione/Multiples

Only one I know of, but it's not really heavy on smut, especially in the later chapters. The BDSM isn't particularly heavy either--I don't recall much in the way of toys. It's one chapter away from being complete, apparently.
