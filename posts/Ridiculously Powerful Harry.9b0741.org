Does anyone know any fics that feature an OP Harry who has way too many power on his hands... (Been a while since I read something that exaggerates that much) Preferably one without a Hermione or Ginny pairing...I have read one too many of those..smh And no slash please....no offence to anyone

  A young boy in a dark cupboard is in great pain. An unusual power will allow him to heal himself, help others, and grow strong in a world of magic. Eventual God-like Harry, Unsure of eventual pairings. Alternate Universe, possible universe/dimension traveling in the future.

***** It is a great read, it isn't complete and it has VERY sporadic updates, but there is still a massive chunk there and it is fairly high quality. It is somewhat unique in that it starts harry off being fairly average (though definitely not normal) and then getting more and more powerful to the point he might as well be a god.

******** Yeah I think he basically rebuilds his starved body, putting on weight and lots of height using milk and magic. Idk what all he does.

I can enjoy super OP protagonists, but that fic didn't draw me in. I think it was the Mary Sue-ness of Harry's character, not his power. He's totally willing to forgive the Dursleys who had abused him /hard/, they change to loving him within a week or so, the way he deals with Draco, etc.

********* You weren't kidding... I had to check the story again. He's literally using his magic (wandlessly) to reshape and repair his body, fixing all his injuries, at the end of the first chapter. The thing to remember: Kids at Hogwarts struggle to make a feather float.

He's already at a point where Pomfrey would be impressed.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
