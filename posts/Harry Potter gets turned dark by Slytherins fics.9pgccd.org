I have read so many dark!Harry fics but at this point I'm tired of the same old same old. It's always either Harry gets sorted into Slytherin the first tile round, or he gets betrayed by his friends. Does anyone have anything where Harry willingly betrays his friends because he genuinely starts to believe in the dark side. I saw the beginnings of this in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7623311/1/][It's Not Easy Being Slytherin]] but it ended on a weird crack fic note and then was abandoned. The fic can have ships, but pls no Harry/voldie or Harry/Snape, they creep me out.


** Are there any actually good dark!harry fics? I'm not talkin like he uses dark/questionable magic like he's genuinely a dark lord type shit.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

** There's The Darkness Within linkffn(2372109) where Harry was sorted in Gryffindor but then betrayed his friends. It's from 2005 and complete. In case you recognise the title, there is another story by the same name (where Harry was raised by Voldemort).

  [Complete] PostOotP. The Golden Trio sit together laughing, all of them happy at the moment. A blink of an eye and the innocence is lost, destroyed from within by jealousy, distrust and above all a destiny, undeniable in its darkness... Dark!Harry
