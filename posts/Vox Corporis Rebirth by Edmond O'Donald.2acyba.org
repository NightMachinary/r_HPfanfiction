*** I could never get into it, too many cliches, and Harry is spoiled rotten by everyone, and why the hell would Hermione let him shag her after the 3rd task? no substance at all.

**** The thing about Vox Corpis is that it is basically the original H/Hr fanfictions. All these things that are now considered cliches are only so widespread because they were in this story. It's not necessarily the most popular or the best, but it's definitely the most influential.

*** Overall I thought it quite enjoyable but the last few chapters in particular didn't sit right with me: how the overpowered duo insta-killing Voldemort and a troop of Death Eaters, and how the author tried to create tension regarding [[/s][Spoiler]] but ended up writing a bunch of pointless pseudo-angst. Also, those Animagi names made me cringe..

*** I read and enjoyed it a long time ago, back when I had fresh eyes for the fandom. Were I to do so now? Not so much. I've tried to reread it a couple of times, but have never made it more than a few chapters in.

My memory of enjoying the story back when is why I still recommend it when folks ask for Harry/Hermione tales. Lorien829's are another set of go-to recs., as are your stories, which I find myself rereading from time to time.
