I like the concept of Harry being part... Something... But most of the fics I see along such lines are slash, I'm wondering if there are any good ones I've mixed. Smut/a bit of crack is fine, preferably complete and longer fics, or at least not abandoned.


** I know 2 smutfics that have this. Want me to rec them?

**** Sorry for the late response, I completely forgot about this.

Okay first off there's: 'secrets of the male veela'.

Harry discovers he's a 'male veela' at the end of fourth year and enters a threesome relationship with Fleur and her closest friend. Despite it being a smutfic there is an actual plot that is enjoyable and the writing is decent. But maybe I'm biased because this is the first ever HP fanfic I've ever read, lol.

Secondly: 'fury of the hellspawn' this one's DARK; as in Harry is EVIL. It's a Harry/Bellatrix pairing and if it weren't for a gruesome scene in chapter 2 I might have even enjoyed more of the fic instead of just the Harry/Bellatrix parts. Also, bonus, Harry only 'teams up' with Voldemort to buy himself some time and not have Voldie try to kill him. He doesn't actually support him or do anything for him.

Thirdly: 'circular reasoning' This is a really great fic that is a type of crossover of Harry Potter with Dresden Files but taking place in the HP world. The only 'flaw'it might have is that at times it feels overly descriptive.

Also, not sure if this qualifies but: 'blood of the phoenix' another great fic (completed). Harry is a human with some sort of phoenix abilities. I really like the plot and the OC he's paired with. One of my favourite OC's in fandom. It also had a completed sequel. Truly enjoyable fic, check it out.
