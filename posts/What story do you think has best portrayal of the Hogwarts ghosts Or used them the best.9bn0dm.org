Just what the title says. What story do you think had the best portrayal of the Hogwarts ghosts or used them the best?

My favorite is Jbern's The Lie I've Lived linkffn(3384712)


** There was a pre-DH one where the Bloody Baron was a Potter ancestor. I don't remember if it was good or not, but I remember it...

*** The story I linked, The Lie I've Lived, has that. Is that the story you're thinking of?

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** There's an INCREDIBLE Snape/Hermione story where Hermione dies in a potions accident in the first chapter, and then it's a slow burn til the end. One of my all time favourites.

**** Absolutely one of my favorite fics of all time. I just adore the emotions that it created. Even if the ending was a bit sappy.

***** The sappy ending worked for me, I do love a happy ending :) it's one of my favorites too ! It's both fun, happy, and sad, and has an interesting and detailed take on what it means to be a ghost.
