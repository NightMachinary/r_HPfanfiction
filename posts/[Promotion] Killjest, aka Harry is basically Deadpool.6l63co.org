Inspired by a post and comment right [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6k3cz1/hybrid/][here]] in this very sub.

Not sure of what my update rate will be since I have other things in the works, but I do like this fic. It's fun to write.

  Hi there. All right? Good. Now that the introductions are over, sweetie pie, you should know that this is a dark comedy, action-adventure starring me, Killjest, the Deadpool-inspired (coughcoughripoffcough), magical, hilarious-yet-sociopathic, neighborhood not-a-hero who is just as likely to break the fourth wall as I am to break faces. You can call me Harry, though. Oh, and if you don't like messed-up humor, you might want to keep scrolling until you hit the freaky fetish fics that you're probably looking for instead of this. (Be safe, don't chafe.)

*** Glad to hear it. First chapter's a lil short and sweet at 4k+, but others should hopefully be longer than 5k.

Just so you know, though, future chapters will not have all the same scenes as the one on Ao3 for rating reasons.
