I've read all of one, and it was really good, and it made me curious about this ship and made me wonder why you don't see it more often. Instead I mostly just see Harry/Draco, which has generally been more miss than hit for me.

  Dating's tough when you're Harry Potter. Ron watches his best friend go through some very bad dating experiences, while going through some awkward ones of his own. H/R slash. Please note the rating and warnings inside.
