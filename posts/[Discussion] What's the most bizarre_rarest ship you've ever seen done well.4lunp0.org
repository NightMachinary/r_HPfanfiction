  Filch squinted up at the ceiling as if reviewing some mental catalogue and then nodded to himself and promptly led Severus to the third-floor cupboard where Professor Flitwick had apparently locked up everything his Ravenclaws were wont to pinch for the purpose of still-making.

  "But it's Potions equipment," Severus protested, feeling the need to defend the fact that he had just spent four hours looking for the bloody things.

  "Yes, sir," Filch said, taking down the box for him.

  "Should it not be in the dungeons, where the Potions classroom is?"

  "Yes, sir."

  "I wasn't even given a key to this cupboard," he pointed out.

  "Well now, sir," Filch muttered, and sniffed. "It'll be a long wait if you hold your breath for any fucking common sense around here."

  Severus managed to startle himself with the sound of his own laughter, which was pitched slightly too high and sharpened to the edge of hysteria with too little sleep.

Snilch or Fape? Perhaps SevArgus?

Anyway, I don't want to think about it.

I've seen Harry/Hedwig done decently, in linkffn(A Promise From Her Boy). It's well within readable range, and there are some very cool and interesting ideas, but it's not /stellar/.

linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation) has a truly bizarre Hermione/Draco/Neville situation, but it's well-crafted, and the writing is perhaps /the/ most beautiful and erudite I've ever come across in the fandom.
