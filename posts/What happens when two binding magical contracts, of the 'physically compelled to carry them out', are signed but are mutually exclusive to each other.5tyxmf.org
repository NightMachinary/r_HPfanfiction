Let's say...hypothetical example, Harry is disgusted with Britain and swears a magically binding vow that he'll never go there again, but the Goblet of Fire spits his name out so he has to compete in the Triwizard Tournament as usual.

If these contracts are of the 'you're physically and mentally compelled to carry them out, no matter what' variety, rather than the 'if you don't complete them, you lose your magic' variety, what happens when two such totally-unbreakable contracts collide with each other?

** Many possibilities!

1.  Second one won't take

2.  They (the contracts) mutate together to form some Voltron-like contract abomination

3.  You just straight up die from being idiotic enough to enter into mutually exclusive contracts

4.  You magically get cloned, and one contract applies to each clone

5.  Schrodinger's cat absurdly applies to you (because that superposition is really only true in quantum situations)

6.  Antimatter like explosions

7.  Tear a hole in the space-time continuum, time unravels back to the point where only one contract applies

8.  You get to meet some Unspeakables, and no one ever hears from you again

9.  You become frozen in place, unable to do /anything/ (including age, think, breathe, die, so on)

10. Party hard

11. Become a *GOD*

12. /Raiders of the Lost Ark/ head melting

** I always thought it stupid that you can be entered into a contract without your knowledge. I mean, lets be real here. Why wouldn't you go ahead and enslave the entirety of the wizarding world by the use of magical contracts if that would work?

So, by that logic the invalid contract (the one with the lack of intent from one party's side) is ignored. Harry won't feel compelled to enter in the Triwizard and there won't be any consequences from not showing up.

*** Mm. Sometimes when I read fics with the Goblet of Fire showing up in it, I muse on the possibility of Harry or some other character asking whether a) is he bound by it, b) is it terminable, c) if the contract's nonconsensual, non-terminable, and will hurt/kill Harry if he refuses to abide by it, how is it different from slavery and why shouldn't the Goblet be treated as a dark artifact and destroyed immediately?

**** I once read a fic in which Dumbledore stormed into the antechamber, asked Harry if he entered himself and after receiving a negative answer, sent him out again as the contract was void. The official explanation was then that somebody obviously played a prank on him, the poor unknowing muggle-raised.

It never made sense. If magically binding contracts would work without the consent of all parties (like an Unbreakable Vow) there would be no magical society left. The entirety of the society would be enslaved to the first wizard smart enough to bind everybody into servitude to him and his descendants.

***** Well, in fiction other than Harry Potter, there is quite a lot of ideas of binding, contracts or geas used. The story of Cuchulain comes to mind, as well as ideas of binding demons, or what not. I think the general idea is that they have to be strong enough to enforce their will over your essence, and they get a significant advantage if they have some of your essence, whether it be your hair, blood, or name. And names are coincidentally required for the Goblet. I saw many fanfics where Harry dropped the name in, but he obtained it from Harry's signature on his homework, allowing him the name in Harry's own writing.

****** Yeah, I read those too. But the fact remains that other than the Goblet, we never see those binding contracts anywhere. If this was actually a thing, signatures would be a freakin treasure in the wizarding world. Nobody would give it, since the danger remains that it could be used to bind you to a contract against your will. People would think Harry mental for signing his homework. Every Hogwarts letter could be used to enslave Dumbledore. Every letter ever sent in the books could lead to the other person being enslaved in a contract.

No. In other fiction that may apply, but it just doesn't work in the HP universe - at least not with the Goblet.

** Presumably that wouldn't be possible, which is probably why binding magical contracts are never stated to work that way (or any other way, since they're never explained at all). Best guess, whichever contract had more power behind it/was created by a more powerful object/was cast by a more powerful wizard would probably override the other.

If you don't explain the physics behind magic, fans can't contradict you. Ingenious.

Personally, I had the idea that maybe it might be that it causes a paradox, and the wizard/witch's magic goes poof to stop them being bound by either, and that results in the urban legend in-universe of your magic going away if you break a contract, when really it only goes away if you get stuck between two mutually exclusive contracts.

Although there has to be some way to break the unbreakable, I guess, otherwise people could do impossible stuff like resurrect themselves or conjure edible food, just by signing a contract to do it.

** In canon, we are presented with two such forces- the Unbreakable Vow and the Goblet of Fire, when lit.

In the first case, participants are personally responsible for swearing by their life to abide by the terms agreed upon. If they can't fulfill them, they die. [in theory, if they never could fulfill the terms either the spell wouldn't be able to take hold or they'd die immediately; I assume the former but we can't be sure].

For the Goblet, the entrants were identified by inserting their own signature into the goblet, when it was lit for the purpose of determining participants, and that person was judged to be the best candidate to represent that school. Crouch Jr. used Harry's signature from a homework paper to put him into the contest and Confunded the Goblet into thinking Harry was the sole candidate for a fourth school. In this case, assuming Harry had already taken the Unbreakable Vow to not do something related, like 'putting my life in danger for the sake of ego or popularity during the next school year', I would hope that the Goblet would reject his submission as being from an invalid candidate. Or... the Unbreakable Vow would kill him.

I think it's helpful to imagine that there's a ghost assigned to judge such matters. If Harry makes an Unbreakable Vow, the ghost hangs out with him, checking that what he does follows the restrictions of the vow. Similarly, the ghost in the Goblet would be checking the submissions tossed into its fire. If Harry were present when his name was being submitted (and he was in the castle at the time, which would probably also be a restriction since the ghost in the Goblet has to be able to evaluate candidates somehow), the two ghosts would commiserate on the restrictions and Harry's submission would be rejected.

**** And the Unbreakable Vow ghost is saying, "I was there the whole time, dude. Didn't happen." So while the Goblet ghost might still be able to force him to compete, the Vow ghost might accept that Harry didn't violate the vow, seeing as he was shanghaied.

***** Well, it depends on what the vow was. A "...magically binding vow that he'll never go there again..." might not care if his return was unwilling/coerced/forced by another contract/etc. This isn't a sapient sympathetic ghost which will make concessions due to circumstances, it simply judges whether the terms of the vow have been breached.

That's an easy one. He will be compelled to use any means he has to make sure that the events of the Tournament happen outside Britain. Imperius a few authorities, pay off a few criminals to blow up venues, bribe some politicians, etc.

Realistically, there /are/ no such pairs of 'contractual stipulations' that cannot be circumvented with enough creativity and resources. If there ever did, since the contracts are technically just 'compulsions' and there doesn't seem to be an actual penalty for defiance, the most likely possible result would be a split personality disorder.

** Harry finds himself compelled, on a cold November day, to find the nearest nesting dragon, paint one of its eggs gold, and steal it. Fortunately, the compulsion lasts for the ten minutes of the task, so he's only managed to buy the paint, Apparate to the dragon reserve, and lose a few fingers to dragon fire.

He's off in Mexico City in February and feels a compulsion to try to save a hostage in Black Lake. He rushes off to the airport, buys a ticket, and departs. By the time his connecting flight gets to New York City, the task is over and the compulsion loses effect.

He's off in the middle of nowhere in Wisconsin when the Third Task starts. He messages Sirius, Hermione, Ron, and the twins somehow to get an idea of what the task is. Barty Crouch ensures that none of the contestants makes it to the end. Harry tries sending up sparks to indicate that he's done and unable to compete, but it doesn't end the compulsion. Sirius et al have to steal one of the competitors from the Hospital Wing and get them to the center of the maze.

** Well, I presume that things would happen as normal, but when Harry doesn't appear for the tasks (because he can't) the goblet would judge him for it and either do some bad shit or not do anything because a prior vow that makes it impossible to actually be there is enough of a reason to make it completely not his fault.

All in all, we do know the people who entered their names into the goblet are /bound/ to compete, but it is never said that they are /compelled/, and though there is the presumption that something bad would happen to the participants who refuse to do the tasks we never really learned how exactly that works.
