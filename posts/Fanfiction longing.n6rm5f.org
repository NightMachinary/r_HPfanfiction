I'm sure I can be agreed with that a fanfiction that's been abandoned or discontinued breaks our hearts. I was so looking forward to Harry Potter and the New Age of Dinosaurs and many more.


** Be assured it breaks the author's heart to discontinue their story too! it's not a decision people make lightly x

It does suck though, big time

*** Fully. I've seen the reasons that gets posted and I understand completely. But ones that dont have reason or just gets abandons, those hurt most.

** What sucks for me is there are some really good fics out there that get abandoned and your like "damn..."

There's a WIP I've been reading that I'm hoping doesn't get abandoned because it is very good.

At least I can't see myself abandoning the fic I'm currantly writing! Been milking this idea for too long and I think I'm onto something good with it

*** Naa the WIP won't get canceled, but the sequel to the sequel however will be left abandoned after exactly 4 chapters. It won't be a cliff hanger or anything. It'll be just like the end of the Sopranos where the fic just stops update mid cha-

**** Haha hopefully that's not the case with 'the odds were never in my favor' since it won't have sequels, it's just one epically long fic
