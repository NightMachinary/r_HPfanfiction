When Harry inherits it in Sirius's will, he enters a long legal battle with several magical historical societies who want it to be a preserved national landmark

*** What? No, the portrait is painted in the classical manner, it must stay! Admittedly, there is a lot of lead in the paint...

** Oh shit this is /perfect/.

I'm trying to collect a bunch of tropes and subvert them all in the same fic.

Like Harry and Ginny form a soul-bond at the end of CoS but then when he asks Dumbledore... Does this mean I'll love her?

Only if you want to, my boy.

Does this mean we'll share thoughts?

Don't be absurd, you're soul-bonded, not mind-bonded.

Well then what does this mean?

Well, if you were to get into esoteric soul-magic research working for the DoM, it would cause both advantages and disadvantages. But given your... modest academic predilections, that's certainly not going to be an issue. So basically it means nothing. Lemon drop?

Gotta add this idea to the list!

The goblin gruffly barks out, "congratulations, you're now master of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black!"

"Wow, I'm a noble?!"

The goblin pauses and answers slowly, "...sure. Sure you are. In fact, we have special services only available to nobles. For the low price of 250 galleons, you can join our Most Noble Banking Clients service. Would you like to do that?"

"Sure I would!!"

*** I always wondered why, at the beginning of DH, they kept all the lights off except for the fire in the fire place. Imagine if the whole Auror department were to swarm the place during the Death Eaters' meeting using the Floo network.
