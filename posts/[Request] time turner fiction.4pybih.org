There was this one where Hermione brought Sirius back from the veil and then she ended up going back in time and reliving Hogwarts as Mia Potter. I was really far into it and lost the tab and can't find it. Any help?


** I hate time turner travels, because you basically can't do anything or risk causing unresolvable paradoxes.

FYI, that fic is called *The Debt of Time*, linkffn(10772496), a 800k words mammoth of frustration imho.

Then there is the most recent Time Turner Travel Extravaganza: *[[https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Production/dp/1338099132/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1466956553&sr=1-1&keywords=harry+potter+and+the+cursed+child][Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]*

****** Thank you for the link. If the plot is based on a retcon of the mechanics of Time Turners, then that is a bit fanfic-ish.

** Linkffn(Old and New World by lensofsanity) has the best time turner scene in all of fanfiction IMHO. Then linkffn(The Ambiguous Artifice) which is the 3rd year of the Pureblood Pretense series (which I recommend) has a lot of time turner use by Harry throughout a year.

  Harriet Potter's third year masquerading as a pureblood boy promises to be even more complicated than the last two. All she wants is to get through her studies unimpeded, but with pureblood politics, ancient artifacts, and adolescent hormones getting in the way... well, at least she's up to the challenge. Alanna the Lioness take on HP, book three.

** Someone already pointed you to the fic you're looking for - but when you get through it (eventually..it's a real beast of a fic) I also really liked linkffn(169 Days)! I read it first and then The Debt of Time and very much enjoyed both, even though time turner fic isn't my usual. 169 Days done very differently - Hermione goes back with the intent and ability to change things, unlike The Debt of Time, but still very enjoyable (and HG/SB as well)!

*** Agree wholeheartedly. They are a cool comparison of two time turner HG/SB fics that are both well done. 169 days edges it out in my opinion, I guess just because I liked the hermione character better. I always thought Mia was kinda a bitch in DoT to anyone not in her "pack" or "family" which made her not a very relatable character for me. Also, in 169 days, the ending isnt such a neat little bow like DoT - it is messy with the multiverse stuff and still kinda sad.

**** Definitely! By all intents and purposes, by at least a few years into the Marauder days Mia Potter might as well be an OC. That said, I think the author did a not terrible job of taking some parts of Hermione and extrapolating them, but others are a bit of a stretch. All the slapping of Slytherins based solely off her hitting Draco once, for example. Otherwise though, it's an interesting idea of what Hermione would be like if, for example, she was a little less focused on rules, which it could be argued, stems from her desire to fit in to the wizarding world. More than just fitting in, but the actual fear that failure would lead to her being kicked out of the world all together. "Dead, or worse - expelled!", Hermione's boggart of failing her exams and thus being seen as not good enough to be a wizard. Where else does that true compulsion to be so smart come from? She's naturally intelligent and hardworking, but focused to the point of recklessness in a way that certainly is NOT healthy (see her first time turner experience). So, being firmly ensconced in a pureblood family with supportive friends from the beginning who have proven they love her no matter what, and basically an assurance from Dumbledore that she's not getting kicked out, yeah I think it's plausible that she would loosen up a bit at least. Not being chased by Voldemort would help too.

I also agree with your point on the endings, I like the way 169 days doesn't fix it all up perfectly, though there are a few little things I disagree with personally, but make sense in the context of the fic.

(Sorry this got a little rambly! I have all together FAR too many feelings about Hermione Granger.)

***** Sorry to the OP for hijacking this thread, but I want to talk about this!

Yes you are so right that a lot of Mia's character is a plausible (if not likely?) outcome of Hermione's new family and friend situation in the past. The things that didn't hit for me were 1) how she did not seem to rely on books very much or even like reading all that much - which is a huge change from Hermione's character; 2) her being comfortable as a peer of 11 year olds when she was 19 (this was poorly explained as "hormones"); 3) her instant bff relationship with Narcissa and other unlikely purebloods in the present day.... and probably some other things that I can't really remember right now haha.

What did you disagree with from 169? It's been a little longer since I read that one, but I thought her character was fairly true to canon - especially the long angsty lead up to her relationship with Sirius and her normal/believable relationship with Remus.

****** Yes - the books thing was definitely something I noticed! I think a lot was played off as "well she already knows it" but still, she seems more like the type to read for fun. Definitely agree about the age/maturity thing, it would have been interesting to see her grapple with that more but I guess would have made certain things (her relationships, for example) much more uncomfortable. Like, if her mind is 20+ and her boyfriend is 15, is that not statutory rape? Time travel, yo. The comfort level with purebloods is for sure something. I think it illustrates how differently she's treated when she is vs isn't seen as a pureblood and the fact that some of them probably aren't terrible people in the same way that you could be best friends with someone who is loyal and supportive and then it turns out they're racist but you didn't know and that makes them shitty, but the nice loyal stuff probably was at least somewhat genuine? It's an interesting way to show character depth which JK glosses over a lot (her insistence that Draco is irredeemable and people only like him cause he's a "bad boy") but I agree that Hermione maybe could have been more uncomfortable with all of this.

(Potential spoilers ahead for everyone - I don't know how to do spoiler tags on mobile!) I definitely agree about Hermione's character in 169! A brilliant way to show how loyal she is and everything she gave up to change the world, and the ramifications of it all on her. I'll be honest that this is probably a hugely nitpicky thing, but the whole Fehr business at the end that seemed like a glorified excuse for a ~huge makeover~. Like, as someone with curly hair, you can't just cut it all off and have it be a perfect bob?? And blonde Hermione just doesn't fit in my mind. And there had to be better ways to handle that. Um, obliviation anyone? Or glamour charms? Notice me nots? I'm not sure if I had any other big things about it to be honest! It's been a little while since I read it as well and overall I hugely enjoyed it, so it seems unfair to mention what I did since it's so small, but... Oh well.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
