:END:
So Hogwarts has a therapist on standby after the war and pretty much everyone returns for an eighth year. Draco starts having a panic attack during class and rushes off to find the therapists office. He starts having 2 therapy sessions a week and talks about how he self harms to try to get rid of the Dark Mark on his arm. His therapist helps him draw flowers over it. Harry eventually starts seing the therapist too. Also, at some point the therapist's sister comes to visit from America (Orlando, I think?) And they all go to Hogsmeade together.

I'd appreciate it if someone could link me to this fic!
