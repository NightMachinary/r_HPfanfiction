just wondering where are all the research facilities at? Department of Mysteries?

I read from [[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/8774/does-higher-education-exist-in-harry-potter][here]] that

#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts is clearly based on the UK education system: O.W.L.s are equivalent to GCSEs and N.E.W.T.s are A-Levels, not university degrees. However, schoolteachers have the title of 'Professor' which gives them the status of real-world academic professionals with advanced degrees...whether they've earned it or not! ("Professor" Lockhart? Really?)
#+end_quote

Often in fanfics, we see people experimenting in their sixth or seventh years in Hogwarts, doing their personal projects but then just thinking about it again, do they actually have that much time to specialize in that particular field when they have so many subjects to balance out?

Realising this just breaks the immersion even more when some people just become teachers for no apparent reasons other than the fact that they know their stuff. I can argue that Remus knows how to set exam papers and different grades because he follows the curriculum rigorously but definitely not Sirus, not a "genius Harry" that all of a sudden learn the fine art of pacing and teaching people.

I guess all I want to say is that I want to read a fanfic where it's about the mundane life of the professors, how they work out their schedule and have a decent work-life balance. Something more relatable now that I'm older :/

Reading a fanfic about a higher level of education for magic seems nice as well. It will be about how they apply for the courses they are interested in, how they can actually choose their halls now instead of it being assigned based of a hat, some might even go further, pursuing their own Ph.D., writing their own thesis.

**** Exactly. It's also probably easier to train a magical worker on the job post-Hogwarts than to pile yet more children on the vastly understaffed Hogwarts.

***** Most of those commercial potions probably have a ton of craft secrets anyway that anyone outside of the job doesn't get to know to prevent them just making their own.

Maybe that's why Snape hasn't gotten lynched by the Ministry, since his class is about teaching basic lab process and all his graduates have to be retrained for the specifics of what they're making anyway.

****** True. It also fits the Guild model, given their focus on monopolies of practice and controlling the pricing of their trade and such.

And could be. Though my chemistry teachers would definitely say his basic skills teaching was lacking. No safety goggles, for one. :D

** I really don't think there are any other than, I suppose, the DoM. I similarly don't think there is an education beyond Hogwarts.

That being said, there is nothing I can remember in canon that says there aren't such things... just that I can't imagine their not having come up with Hermione's being a main character. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7534131/1/Stunning-Shifts][I've certainly read a fic where an alt reality Harry works at a private R&D firm]],.

I see Wizarding Britain as a dystopia and this as just one more feature of the dystopia but that's just my take. I do wonder if there are many fics like what you're interested in though. For example:

#+end_quote

I just wonder, where's the narrative? I mean, what you're describing is (the TV show) Teachers, but if the characters have their shit together. I mean, if it was something like The History Boys but from the perspective of the Headmaster or the teachers (i.e. set around getting a particular pupil, or group of them, to meet certain standards), I guess that'd work but it does rather require a bit more attention on the pupil/s in question (e.g. Seven Periods with Mr Gormsby, another TV show... most of the staff are just as, if not more, dysfunctional than those in Teachers because sitcom but the closest thing it's got to a series long arc is "fixing" Hohepa, one of the pupils).

That being said, I guess I once had an idea a bit like this... except it would've been Snape working undercover as a PE Teacher at Stonewall since in this AU the Dursleys polite decline the offer via owl (and Hogwarts is not compulsory, even for children of prophecy). I never wrote it, though. So while I don't know any HP fanfics that look like what you want (aside from alt reality Harry's plot-adjacent job), I guess there might be some out there. Fics set during the books from a teacher POV, I mean. But is it really mundane if it's informed by the canon story?

  What happens when Ron has to sit through a lecture about the physical development of witches and wizards from Snape? Utter humiliation, that's what! Outtake from Daphne Greengrass and the 6th Year From Hell, but can be enjoyed on its own. One-shot AU.

** There are stories like linkffn(Love Is Like A Rose by liquid lily) which are positioned in the magical colleges at Oxford and such, but I found it hugely unpersuasive (although this story is nice fluffy and sweet, exactly as described on the tin). With just few hundred students per year, old journeyman-apprenticeship system makes much more sense.

** So, in Scotland (where Hogwarts is) the exams are different.

Anyway, I grew up in England so I will stick with A Levels. Until very recently, it was expected you would do 4 AS Levels and then continue with 3 of them into the second year and get your A Level. Of course, it varied depending on ability - really you want a minimum of 3 AS, but some people would take 5 or even 6. Especially if they are fluent in another language.

Yet, you're expected to have done extra-curricula projects/volunteering/activities for your UCAS application. So, I know people who did 5-6 A Levels whilst also working as a part-time Health Care Assistant on a hospital ward. Not many, of course, but those who go on to do medicine overlap with those with more A Levels.

One person was part of some sort of young programmer/google ambassador programme and had a range of projects including programming his scientific calculator to play games. Anyone into art would be expected to have a portfolio. Other people worked in care homes for experience, sat on Youth Parliament, etc. I volunteered with disabled young people and so on.

So, yes, I would imagine that high achieving pupils would need to show that they had done a project in the field of their interest.

I did volunteer while at university, but I honestly think A Levels were more hassle.

** For my Chessmaster series, I made up a system of Wizarding Universities, including the Oxford College of Wizardry, Massachusetts Institute of Transfiguration, Salem Institute of Witchcraft, and the Egypt Centre for Alchemical Studies. Here, students work towards their R.A.T (Ridiculous Arduous Test), which is the equivalent of a bachelor's degree. There's also the Grand Sorcerer / Grand Sorceress title which is equivalent to a Ph.D.
