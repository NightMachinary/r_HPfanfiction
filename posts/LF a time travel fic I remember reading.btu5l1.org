:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was something like -Harry travels back to/is sent back to second year I think -He works on fixing the wards of Hogwarts I think because dumbledore is siphoning power from them or something like that -Also there is like a young girl personification of Hogwarts who Harry thinks of as a daughter

That's all I remember. I don't think there was much to the fic. I just remembered reading it and can't find it now.

** I remember reading that myself but can't for the life of me remember the name. I do remember it being either abandoned or on hiatus when I read it, but that was months ago. May the force be with your search.
