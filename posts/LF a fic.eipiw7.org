The main thing I remember is Voldemort attacks Harry in his dreams a lot and uses the cruciactus. Harry ends up discovering shield against the unforgivables using the power of love. Eventually Hermione and Dumbledore also master the shields


** On here LF stands for long fic

**** It does stand for "looking for." I've never seen a single person in this sub use it to mean something else.

That being said, the "/What's that fic?/" flair already conveys that, so you'd get more responses if you /described/ what you are looking for in the post title.
