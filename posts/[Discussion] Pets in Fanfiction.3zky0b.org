A problem I've come across while working on a fic is that my character's pet is mostly redundant. They buy a nice new animal to begin their Hogwarts life with (or in some cases it's a pet they've had since early childhood), but aside from the occasional mention, the pet serves little to no purpose in the story. In my particular case, it's a snake for Harry (I know, I know, it's overdone, but that's not the issue right now) but it's a problem I've had with cats, too, and even owls in stories where not a lot of letters are sent.

My snake does have some use to the story: she helps sniff out Pettigrew (not perfectly--she doesn't just say "yo, Harry, that rat is actually the dude who sold out your parents"--but she's able to recognise he's not a real rat, prompting an investigation that reveals Pettigrew), helps recognise the basilisk voice as a serpent's voice, and after Voldemort dies (end of third year) she's someone that Harry can practice his parseltongue with (under the theory that V's soul gave Harry the inate ability to speak it, but after doing so fairly regularly for several years he still knows the language even after losing the piece of V's soul, so it's just a matter of staying in practice as you would any other foreign language). But at 31 chapters averaging at 9,000 words, I realised I haven't mentioned her since Ch23, and before that since Ch18, and the chapters where's she's of any real purpose are Ch8-11.

I guess what I'm getting at is *tl;dr:* if a pet serves no real purpose to the story, should they be cut out? (Perhaps with a passing mention that the character simply decides not to have one when they start at Hogwarts? Or just never mention the issue at all?) If they did serve a purpose but later on become redundant, should they be killed off?

Related Question: Have you read any fics that utilise pets really well? Perhaps in unusual ways? One I can think of is /Hedwig and the Goblet of Fire/. linkffn(5777316)

First off, I think that can be overdone all it wants, its still nice.

Second, I think you should keep the snake and keep it as, at least, pretty badass living scarf for Harry to wear.

Sold! I may have to find a place in the fic to do that.

I agree on the snakes, I just felt compelled to add the remark about them being overdone because I've seen them come up in some of the various "things you hate in fanfic" threads and didn't want anyone ignoring the rest of post just to tell me I'm using a common trope. (Although I think the biggest issue people complain about is the use of parseltongue, which I think I've managed to handle okay.)

** Here is my problem with the Harry has a snake as a pet trope. He never has a terrarium for it, it just rides around on his person all the time. Like, does it shit all over him and Harry doesn't care?

Also the snakes are always too smart and that's annoying. Philosophers stone was a childrens book and the conversation he has with the boa can't possibly be representative of how smart snakes really are. It's one of those things that doesn't make sense without stretching canon to breaking point.

*** Holy crap, I can't believe I completely neglected the terrarium issue in this fic, even though I covered it in a different fic. (And the rest of that fic was completely crap.) In this case, I've apparently been influenced by the shoulder snake trope, but it'll be easy enough to fix it in this fic, so thanks for mentioning it.

The intelligence issue I think I covered well enough because one of the "things I hate in fanfic" threads was posted at the same time I began writing and it prompted me to make a note to not have super intelligent snakes in my fic. I think people probably assume that because Harry speaks Parseltongue perfectly (his problems only ever seem to be in distinguishing it from English, but his vocab is fine) then snakes must be equally well-spoken.

*** Legacy by storytellerSpW has an interesting take on snake intelligence and Parseltongue. It presents that snakes are smart enough to communicate with parseltongues but are still interested in their basic needs (sleep, warm, food). It also has them as basically only controllable when actually in the vicinity of a parseltongue, and if they get too far away they sort of just wander off and go back to regular snake business. Like you can tell a snake to watch a door, and when you leave and come back the snake will be able to tell you if it saw anyone come through, but it also might have just slithered off to sleep or chase a mouse. They can talk, but they mostly talk about how it's not warm enough or how they'd like to get out of this damn enclosure thank you, not Snakespeare. I felt it was a good, realistic balance(or as realistic as you can get with goddamn wizards). They're useful, but not /that/ useful

** If you've ever owned or been friends with someone who has owned a pet snake, you'll know that snakes can be pretty fucking dumb animals.

You can use this to your advantage if you feel the need to add some levity to a chapter by having Harry come back from classes and finding [snake's name] stuck in a cardboard tube or something like that.

** Just because a pet/device/person isn't in much, or even isn't a major plot point, doesn't mean that they shouldn't be there. Sometimes it can be enough just to be, to create a depth or reality to the story. I mean, short of getting lost many times, Trevor serves very little plot focus in the books and I would never think JKR shouldn't have included him.

** Look at other books. See how they use animals in the plot. For example, Idéfix in Astérix is part comic relief, and sometimes he gets Astérix and Obélix to make up after they've been fighting. And he's there because it's a comic and he looks really cute, so it makes the books more fun to look at.

All Disney movies have pets and other animals as comic relief. Think of Maximus and Pascal the chameleon in Tangled, the reindeer in Frozen, etc.

Scabbers is a bit of an exception, because he's actually important in the books. His function was also comic relief, other than being Pettegrew and all that. Basically, Rowling could have used Scabbers any way she wanted, but any time he made an appearance, it was pretty funny. Like biting Crabbe in the finger, or chewing on Harry's bedsheets. Or Ron and Hermione's row after Ron thinks Scabbers was eaten, where the other comic relief (Fred and George) make it funny again.

Now, the problem with snakes is that they're not really funny creatures, like rodents and dogs are. They are generally seen as pretty scary, sometimes disgusting creatures (bullshit if you ask me, but hey). You could use that trope, though, like Harry waking up in the middle of the night to one of his (macho) roommates screaming like a little girl because of the snake slithering up his bed.

And if you've got a girl in your book you want to pair Harry with, make her not afraid of snakes, and make the snake come to her too, use him as a slithery cupid, basically.

Or make him flee when something big is about to happen. Use him to up the tension curve, write it so that the reader knows that when the snake's fleeing, shit's about to go down, and that feeling makes books a lot more exciting.

**** It's bad to include TOO MUCH in your story for no purpose. Describe a few pets, great; describing each roommates pets and why some don't have them, too much. Describing a few Christmas gifts, great; detailing 6 friends mutual gift giving, overkill.

It's about balance. Build the world with inconsequential details, but don't bury the reader in them. JK did a great job in cannon with this, as evidenced by the plethora of avenues fanfiction gets to explore and flesh out.

Harry is missing in the story so Ron assumes her interest in the Gryffindor boys' bedroom is because she misses the BWL. I always thought it was strange that in canon Scabbers was never gobbled up by a hungry owl as I'd figured they eat more rodents than cats.

In the fic, The Silent World of Cassandra Evans, Cassie is mute. But because Parseltongue is a language entirely made up of hisses she can still speak to snakes. In this fic, Shortcake (her snake) serves as her only companion that she can speak to vocally.

In Silent World, Shortcake is more than a pet, he is by all means a character in the story, so if you feel like your snake is lacking in screen time then just have Harry treat zir like a peer or a friend that he can talk to rather than as a pet or a minion.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
