I mean, yeah, he is not liable to randomly recount his entire life story or go around telling his secrets to anyone who just so happens to stay still long enough, but the guy /literally/ gave bits of his soul around to his followers including at least one (Bellatrix) who was likely to either know about Horcruxes or have a relative who does. He sent a scared 16-17 YO after an impossible target fully believing that Draco wouldn't chose to turncoat instead. Hell, his whole resurrection plan hinges on trusting /wormtail/, who was admittedly only in his side for fear and has already proved himself perfectly willing to betray his lifelong friends.

The guy was arrogant and self-centered, as a result he did trust his followers, if for no other reason than because he was certain that his power would be enough to keep them in line and to believe otherwise would mean that he wasn't as powerful as he thought.


** i think he has a capacity for trust and delegation that's often missed in fanon. in his own mind he even calls it "trusting"

  And Hogwarts . . . but he knew that his Horcrux there was safe; it would be impossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle . . . To tell Snape why the boy might return would be *foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy: Didn't their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust?*
#+end_quote

from harry looking into voldemort's brain in DH.

obviously he is very secretive still and keeps most of the information close to his chest, but i don't think it's true that he never ever trusts anybody with anything.

well, yeah, because he had narcissa as leverage. he meant it as punishment for lucius' fiasco at the ministry.

#+begin_quote
  "That's because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance lor Lucius's mistake, I know it!"

  Snape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent, but he could not pretend not to hear her.

  "That's why he's chosen Draco, isn't it?" she persisted. *"To punish Lucius?"*

  "If Draco succeeds," said Snape, still looking away from her, "he will be honored above all others. "

  "But he won't succeed!" sobbed Narcissa. "How can he, when the Dark Lord himself-- ?"

  "I cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in charge. He got himself captured, along with how many others, and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed. "

  *"Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!"* choked Narcissa. "He does not mean him to succeed, he wants him to be killed trying!"

narcissa also seems to think voldemort trusts in snape

  "I only meant. . . that nobody has yet succeeded. . . Severus. . . please. . . you are, you have always been, Draco's favorite teacher. . . you are Lucius's old friend. . . I beg you. . . you are the Dark Lord's favorite, *his most trusted advisor*. . . will you speak to him, persuade him--?"

  “He shares everything with me!” said Bellatrix, firing up at once. “He calls me his most loyal, his most faithful ---”

  “Does he?” said Snape, his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief. *“Does he still*, after the fiasco at the Ministry?”
#+end_quote

he also used to share a lot with bellatrix, and taught her the dark arts

#+begin_quote
  “I was and am the Dark Lord's most loyal servant, I learned the Dark Arts from him, and I know spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to compete ---”
#+end_quote

another important addendum to add to voldemort's characterization is that he despises people who only follow him out of fear (eg. wormtail). he wants followers that are loyal, competent, that genuinely believe in his political philosophy, etc.

#+begin_quote
  "Do not lie to me!" hissed the second voice. "I can always tell, Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever returned to me. I revolt you. I see you flinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me. . . "

  "No! My devotion to Your Lordship -"

  *"Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice*. You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go. How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding every few hours? Who is to milk Nagini?"

** I get where you're coming from, he totally gave out parts of his soul to people. I don't think it's trusting so much as arrogance. He couldn't contemplate the fact that people would betray him. I think he saw himself as so powerful and charismatic that people wouldn't dare betray him out of fear and loyalty.

*** Yeah, it was definitely arrogance on his part, but it doesn't change the fact that he /did/ trust that his followers would do their best to protect his soul pieces /and/ that their best would be enough. Trusting doesn't equate to friendly or to telling someone your entire life story, just that you are confident that the other person will react within certain parameters which favors you.

** I wouldn't go so far as to say trusting, not in other people anyways, but he most certainly came even remotely close to trusting Bellatrix anyways because she was beautiful, influential, rich, fiercely loyal and (the foolish part on Voldemort's side) quite good at Occlumency. He also trusted Malfoy to a certain extent for whatever reason but my headcanon is that the intent was always for the diary to return to Hogwarts together with Draco (Lucius at least knew it was a weapon against Muggleborns). It happened but he never had the chance to give the order and the things didn't go as intended. Voldemort also trusted Snape after learning he killed Dumbledore but that still didn't stop him from killing his servant when he needed to.

I think Voldemort was mostly trusting in his own plans, thinking how brilliant and powerful he was. He thought of himself as a god and started to disregard the fact that humans around him might have feelings too. Also he remains quite secretive with his plans as neither Bellatrix, nor Lucius know what they were given, nor does he tell Wormtail the full plan other than the fact that he will be honored with a task that most his followers would give their right hand for, nor does he tell Snape what the plan with Draco is despite him being the successor if Draco fails. Also speaking of Draco... Voldemort might have not been able to feel love but could recognize it and exploit and knew that as long as he could get faster than Dumbledore to Narcissa and Lucius, Draco would do his best to complete the mission

*** I love redemption stories about Voldemort especially ones where it actually addressed that yes he was insane due to his own doing. And yet it doesnt change him completely it's more of a slow return to humanity.

Sadly this fics are few and far inbetween most fics I see are either he was never insane and it was all a facade or ploy or that his insanity was faked by Dumbledore or other enemies

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** I disagree about Draco.

He didn't trust Draco. It was punishment to Lucius. Draco didn't knew enough to be a threat, even if he betrayed, and it would one more excuse to kill him, in front of his father. It was likely Voldemort's plan, unless Draco managed to impress him and kill Dumbledore, which Voldemort didn't believe he could do.

** I think Voldemort trusts Bellatrix's loyalty to him more than to the woman herself. And for the Draco thing, I'm pretty sure that he didn't actually believe that Draco would accomplish his task but knew that he would do his best simply not to get /Crucio/'d and also happened to have a handy-dandy Death Eater on staff to help him. He didn't trust Wormtail but merely used the man's fear of being caught by Sirius to his advantage.

*** But he still gave him a task which put him in enough pressure to seriously consider changing sides, I don't believe for a second that Draco didn't consider going to Dumbledore in the hope of working something up, yeah, his parents life's would be endangered by the attempt and it may not work, however having Draco open the metaphorical and actual gates to Voldemort's hideout for the order and even some Aurors while every DE is distracted (maybe sending some to capture the ones invading Hogwarts with the cabinet while the rest attacks in mass) could lead to a major victory for Dumbledore's side, enough to buy a pardon for his family. By the end he realized that his mission was a punishment to his father, so he probably also knew or at least suspected that even if he succeeded chances were that his family would still be always a Voldemort-tantrum away from death, by turning coat the chances of his family dying would be only slightly bigger and Voldemort probably /knew it too/, that he didn't force Draco to make an unbreakable vow shows that he trusted that Draco would recognize him as the greater danger or even that Draco would show himself loyal.

** He sent Draco that task knowing he would fail. The thing about Voldemort is that he is a psychopath, he only cares about himself and enjoys causing pain to others. He doesn't trust anyone but he knows that they are loyal to him and his cause. Being about to see into their minds can reassure him of that. He spreads the bits of his soul out as widespread as he can, because he doesn't trust anyone with them, and without them he will die. It was out of fear, not trust. Death is his greatest fear. He cares only for himself. Not his deatheaters, they are expendable.
