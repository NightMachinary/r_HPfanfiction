Okay, so this is just a prompt idea I got at 2 a.m. so feel welcome to use it. Also, I may not be the first person to have an idea like this one, so if it is similar to anyone else's prompts and it really bothers you that much, let me know. If you do write or read something like this, please leave a link in comments, I would love to read them.

Prompt:

Write a crossover fic, or series of one-shots, where a character (Not from the HP 'verse) transfers to Hogwarts during Harry's third year. He/She/They are not there to protect Harry Potter or help Dumbledore or anything like that. Instead, they developed their HP magic later in life and transfer from wherever they were before to Hogwarts to learn. The fic should focus around the incident with the Boggart, but feel free to take it in a whole new direction beyond that. Happy writing!!!
