What's that? An AU Fremione full of angst and smut that absolutely no one asked for? Well here you go. It is finished and will be updated at least weekly as it gets edited usually 3-4 times a week.

*Title: Caffeine, Strings, and Other Impossible Things*

*Rated: M*

Summary: Hermione has only ever loved ballet. She earned her way into Juilliard through sweat and dedication. The Weasley twins are musical prodigies, dropping out to peruse a career as rockstars. But when Hermione finds a locked out Fred Weasley playing on a ratty fire escape, it starts something she would have never expected. New York City is a place of unpredictable miracles and shattered dreams. Who is to say which one is which?

Pros: I am good at writing the feels. Characters are in-character even in the AU world. Heavy on the angst. Clearly marked and skippable smut. No bashing. Story is COMPLETE and thus will not be abandoned.

Cons: Removal of magic. Heavy on the angst. Rare-ish pair (don't fall in love)
