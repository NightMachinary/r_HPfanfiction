**** Thank you, I will forever resent Rowling for never making a decent Slytherin student. The fact we have 7 book and the cast consisted entirely of Gryffindors and a single Ravenclaw will always rustle my jimmies.

***** Well objectively it's a children's book series, so it makes sense that bravery and such is rewarded but not cunning. In reality you need a good mix of all four.
