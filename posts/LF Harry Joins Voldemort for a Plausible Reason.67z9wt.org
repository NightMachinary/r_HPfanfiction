Something like linkao3(The Anti-Heroine) is great, but ones with just outright Dumbledore bashing because he's evil1/1//1! aren't.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

******** Just started reading Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived -- it's not on ffn -- if you google the title, tthfanfic.org will pop up and that's the correct link -- it's really really good -- it's a non-magical AU that's kind of James Bond-esque

In terms of Slytherin!Hermione, I don't know of many. linkao3(Session Transcripts by lastcrazyhorn) and linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectare) are two, but they aren't finished. Both are fantastic fics, but I think Session Transcripts is abandoned and The King's Indian Attack updates very slowly. Of course, I can hop on my little soapbox and recommend my own fic, linkffn(Mudsnake by Flye Autumne). It's also a WIP, but I'm finally getting close to the endgame.

  "Whatever you decide to say, make it believable." Hermione Granger learned to avoid the hard questions years ago. To her, Hogwarts is a relief: a new school with new people who have no knowledge of her past...only, they keep asking the hard questions. And it's getting harder for Hermione to maintain the lies. Featuring: Mentor!Snape and Slytherin!Hermione

**** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) is great and also fits your request.

If you don't mind slash, linkao3(Again and Again)

Harry keeps getting thrown back in time every time his life ends and is trying to find a way to get it to stop. This time he decides to not kill Voldemort and team up with him instead.

The summary is not very accurate. Harry isn't really evil/dark and his power and experience is well portrayed. Dumbledore bashing is not really bashing most of the time since his behavior is somewhat understandable since Harry is ignoring him and prophecy. The slash between Tom and Harry is not too bad since it's skippable and Harry ends up making him mostly sane and look more like Tom Riddle rather than Voldemort.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Voldemort wants Harry dead. Period, the end.

There is no joining, there is never even an offer. Voldemort will not ever let Harry live.

So even if you somehow make it so that Harry wants to join the man that murdered his family (and even a super-evil darklord Harry would sooner kill Voldemort than join him for that reason) you would also need to make it so that Voldemort wants Harry to join rather than kill him onsight.

And by the time you did that it is so AU it's not even Harry Potter anymore...

*** The Horcrux's really blunted Tom Riddle's intelligence and charm (not sure if canon but it makes sense they offer a downside). If you twist things just enough that either they don't do that or he managed to counteract the impact it makes for a far more effective villain. Lord Voldemort might kill Harry but Tom might consider brainwashing while keeping his identity hidden.
