Hey,

I'm looking for the fics with the writing that is not just technically (gramatically, etc.) correct, but also ties the reader in or has plot twists or seems more like a novel than just a fanfic.

Some recommendation for authors that have great writing would also be great!

Help me out here! ~/Psantium/


** One such author I have found is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][*Inverarity*]] who wrote the /Alexandra Quick/ series and /Hogwarts Houses Divided/.

** Fics by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/981377/Seselt][Seselt]] are superbly written, for example [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12132374/1/Six-Pomegranate-Seeds][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11735486/1/Nihil-est-ab-omni-parte-beatum][Nihil est ab omni parte beatum]].

** It's a bit kinky, but I really enjoy the writing of Vera Rozalsky. Most of her works are linked to her largest story; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]].
