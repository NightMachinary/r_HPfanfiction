Or what would be the best way?


** The best way, imo, would be that she's still a dark arts pureblood fanatic. However, Voldemort /doesn't live up to her standards/. She sees the Horcruxes, and being raised in a magical household means she abhors the idea of messing with your soul. She sees the insanity that comes with it. It's a different type of insanity that she's got, and she knows it. A lot of people with mental issues are self aware of that on some level, even if it's not much.

So she breaks off and starts her own dark arts movement. She becomes the antihero to Voldemort's villain.

*** I think Bellatrix by late 70s was already a lost cause.

She was the arch typical fanatic and would not abandon the cause she believed in.

Combined with Black's hereditary mental instability and her most likely abuse of dark arts, she eventually became that monster we all know from the Series.

That's why I generally don't like Bellatrix 'redemption' fics. However, I'm very interested in how she could have turned out without Voldemort's corrupting influence, hence my like for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(5511855;10099028).

If you reread the resurrection scene in the graveyard, Voldemort says in front of all of his Death Eaters who aren't either Karkaroff, Snape or in Azkaban that he had a muggle father. It seemed to be no secret amongst them that he was halfblood.

****** I mean, if Tom Riddle kept himself as 'half blood' from the start, she wouldn't be so validated, she wouldn't have this solid ass proof staring at her in the face that only a pureblood can be as powerful. If she joined up when Voldemort already claimed to be a pureblood, she could brush his half blood heritage off as propaganda, but if Voldemort, who claimed himself as a pureblood, was out of the picture and there was only Tom the half blood, there wouldn't be any pureblood's to pit against Dumbledore, a half blood who defeated a pureblood.

** For me it wouldn't particularly matter how as long as she was in character, or at least would act in a "Bellatrix" fashion. The first half of Delenda Est I thought did that rather well, minus her muggle world experience to some extent. If she's not allied with Voldemort then she's still skilled, believes in Pureblood ideals, etc. and it's just that different experiences in life lead her down a somewhat different path.

To me I feel the most "believable" Harry/Bella would be Bella taking Harry from the Dursleys and raising him to be a greater Dark Lord than Voldemort, claiming him as her partner at some point eventually. It's got insanity, schemes it's still on the side of dark, and raising your perfect partner feels like something insane Bella might do if she were not married or attached to anyone.

** While I second the below idea that Bellatrix could remain a pureblood fanatist but stop following Voldemort if she found out he was a Half-Blood... here's how I'd do it if I had to actually /redeem/ her.

Memory-Charms.

Lock away her memories of everything past her meeting Tom Riddle, and possibly further back than that. Take the considerably-less-insane, mentally-younger Bellatrix, and try to re-educate her and show her the errors of her ways. When she's sane enough to handle it, tell her about her past memories, and, later, unlock them when you're certain the new personality she's built up can handle them. (If you want to play it safe, have her make an Unbreakable Vow or sign a magical contract to the effect of 'I won't be a Death Eater again just because I have my memories and magic'.)

*** Would the vow even work if her personality changes because of her new old memories? (For that matter: Would a vow bind someone with multiple-personality-disorder (especially if he/she knows it and changes personalities to break said vow)?)

Still, well thought out - personality changing magic would also work (I mean they have cheering charms, who's to say they don't have charms that reinforce hatred - I mean there are many pureblood supremacists, but only a few really act on their believes, but some compulsions would easily take care of that!)
