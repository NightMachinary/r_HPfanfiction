**** What the fuck did you just fucking write about Slytherin, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in Hogwarts, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on muggleborn scum, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in magical warfare and I'm the top wizard in the entire Death Eater armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will Avada Kedavra you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with writing that shit to me in /my diary?/ Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Death Eaters across the Pure-blood families and your floo address is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, mudblood. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's without my wand. Not only am I extensively trained in wandless magic, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Room of Hidden Things and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment about Slytherin was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
