  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality)

Edit: I guess I need to explain this cause someone downvoted me. Voldemort in HPMOR is not only relatively sane compared to canon, but crazy smart. Like master manipulator smart. I don't want to spoil it, but the gist is that however smart Harry is due to his upbringing, Riddle is just as smart.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

*** You don't deserve being downvoted, because you're not wrong, but you might want to take the time to explain.

Even among those who hate MoR, I haven't generally seen too many criticisms of its antagonist. He's a much more convincing evil than canon, and much more dangerous too.

  The inkwell caught fire in Professor Quirrell's hands and burned with a terrible slowness, hideous black-orange flames tearing at the metal and seeming to take tiny bites from it, the silver twisting as it melted, as though it were trying and failing to escape. There was a tinny shrieking sound, as though the metal were screaming.

  "I suppose you are right," Professor Quirrell said with a resigned smile. "I shall design a lecture to ensure that Muggleborns who are too stupid to live do not take anyone valuable with them as they depart."

  The inkwell went on screaming and burning in Professor Quirrell's hands, tiny droplets of metal, still on fire, now dripping to the desk, as though the inkwell were crying.

  "You're not running away," observed Professor Quirrell.

  Harry opened his mouth -

  "If you're about to say you're not scared of me," said Professor Quirrell, "/don't/."

  "You are the scariest person I know," Harry said, "and one of the top reasons for that is your control. I simply can't imagine hearing that you'd hurt someone you had not made a deliberate decision to hurt."

  The fire in Professor Quirrell's hands winked out, and he carefully placed the ruined inkwell on his desk. "You say the nicest things, Mr. Potter. Have you been taking lessons in flattery? From, perhaps, Mr. Malfoy?"

** World in Pieces is a fic where Canon!Harry, immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts, gets pulled into an AU by an Order that's on like their fourth Harry Potter. It's been awhile since I read this, so I forgot a good portion of it, but I remember enjoying it and that a line from the AU Dumbledore went something like: "In your world, Voldemort was insane. This one isn't."

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488/chapters/1493333]]

PS: while there are no Drarry scenes, the AU!Draco was romantically involved with one or more of the AU!Harry's that have passed away. However, the Harry who is the protagonist has no interest in Draco and doesn't ship with anybody in the story.

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.
