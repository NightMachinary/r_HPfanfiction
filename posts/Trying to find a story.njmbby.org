I'm looking for a story on fanfiction.net where after a detention with umbridge where she has harry writing using the blood quill Umbridge us able to steal the entirety of the potter fortune from harry and disown him from his own family.

i dont remember much about the story. just that the disownment made harry collapse in the first chapter and he woke up in the hospital wing and was told what had happened.

any ideas?


** I'm not sure which fic it is, but the flair you should be looking for is 'What's that fic' (for when you have a specific fic you want the link to), not 'Request' (for when you have a general idea based off which people recommend you stories).

  The year has been hell for Harry. Abandoned by everyone he cares for, Harry feels their is nothing to lose until he suddenly finds himself in the arms of Daphne Greengrass. Will things start to improve or will it get worse? My take on a marriage bond and life debts. It will not be all roses. Dumble bashing. Competent Sirius. An angry Harry with some darker tendencies at times.
