Harry grows up being told he is nothing but a freak, a waste of space, and whenever he comes home bruised from Harry Hunting, he gets called a thug. The entire neighborhood treats him as such. Harry decides to live up to his reputation as much as he can.

Features;

- Saucy McGonagall raised in a bad neighborhood in Glasgow, whose proper, stern act is a carefully designed mask intended to disguise a person who would absolutely not hesitate to shank you with a rusty clothes hanger if you attracted her ire.
- Frustrated Hermione, who can only sigh tiredly every time Harry does something... /thuggish/.
- Confused Ron, who can't understand why the Boy-Who-Lived, Champion of the Light, etc ad nauseum, is beating up Seamus with a sock filled with soap for stealing a quill.

** What do yo mean by saucy McGonagall? Like as in a sexually, provocative, femme fatale type McGonagall? That I kinda want to see.

Being Glaswegian, I can tell you a posh façade in the Gorbals of the time of the Razor Gangs, is an odd choice.

*** Saucy is probably the wrong word. I'm thinking the kind of person who, if they weren't carefully restraining it, would be swearing like a sailor at, well, everything, and is absolutely willing and able to "show you the error of your ways" with more force than is strictly required.

*** As for the posh facade, I'm not really sure what you mean. Having been poor on occasion, you absolutely do put on a "socially acceptable" mask when you need to; I can only imagine that being raised in a rough environment like I picture would only make it more necessary.

**** Having also come from a poor background myself, going to a private school on a bursary and being Glaswegian, I can tell you I have never felt the necessity of a mask to the extent you describe. Now, i didnt grow up in the rough areas, but i know people who did. Acting stern and posh will only alienate you, nobody will take you seriously. acting like where you come from is beneath you is going to cause problems.

***** Didn't really mean anything by it, friend. I can only tell you that, while I never "put on a mask", I definitely didn't go out of my way to announce my family's financial status to the masses. It leaves a mark on you, like it or not, and as I have imagined my McGonagall growing up in a poor, rough neighborhood, I can't help but think that she would carry a mark of her own.

** Sorry (OK, not too sorry) about making it Hermione-centric, but Hermione should be a daughter of a mob boss.

--------------

"House of Minions, here I come," Hermione thought to herself as she sat down on the small chair. All that was left was to think the right thoughts at the right time.

/Think: herbology, make friends, community, acceptance, love people just the way they are. Visualise: sunny meadows, smiling faces, friends, birthday party, doing homework in a group. Think: herbology, make friends, community, acceptance, love people just the way they.../

The hat came down on her bushy-haired head.

"Nice try, young lady, but you are a thousand years too young to deceive me. You may want to look up 'Occlumency', by the way. It'll help you where you're going..."

"Wait!"

"Why wait? It's the easiest Sorting in years."

"You want to send me to Slytherin, don't you?"

"You don't agree?"

Hermione thought quickly. "Look, both you and I know where I come from. You also know I'm a Muggleborn. For me to go to Slytherin is the /bravest/ thing I could possibly do!"

There was a long silence. Hermione wondered if the Sorting Hat couldn't handle contradictions, like a sci-fi robot.

"Just put me in Ravenclaw and be done with it. You know I'm smart enough," she offered.

"You know, I don't only sort based on what people want. I also sort based on what people need. Maybe you'll pick up some courage and decency after seven years in GRYFFINDOR!"

--------------

"Honestly, Harry, if you want to rise through the ranks, you've got to understand that rules are there for a reason. People who violate rules and procedures end up in imprisoned or killed---or, worse, tortured to death."

--------------

"Draco, Draco, haven't you heard that snitches get stitches?" She nodded to Ron, who delivered another kick to the tied-up Slytherin's stomach. "Was it worth the hundred and fifty House Points, Draco?"

Draco somehow found the strength to look up at her. "Granger, when my father... Ah!" He reeled as Hermione shot a carefully measured stinging hex at his eye.

"Still planning to tattle, Draco? Sounds like someone didn't learn his lesson." She crouched next to him to grasp his chin with her free hand. "Did you know that with the dose of the Forgetfulness Potion that you have in you right now, you won't remember our faces or this conversation---it'll all be a blur---but you'll remember the pain and the fear? Oh yes, you will... Magic really is amazing, isn't it, Draco? Sometimes, I wonder if it's wasted on Purebloods."

Draco whimpered.

*** Awesome! (just one nit: Draco as a pureblood doesn't know what stitches are; Arthur Weasley didn't; threatening somebody with something he doesn't know what it is, seems counterproductive).

**** "Interesting. Thank you, Ronald; I had not thought of that. And I appreciate that you waited to correct me in private.

"Fortunately, Draco got the message in any case, I think. Under the circumstances, the best we could hope for is Draco developing a subconscious association between me, the act of snitching on me, and pain and fear. The specific wording is therefore not as important."
