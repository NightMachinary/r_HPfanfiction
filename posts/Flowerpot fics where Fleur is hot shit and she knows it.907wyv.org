It feels like most Flowerpot fics depict Fleur as suffering because of her veela heritage. Girls are jealous of her, men only want her for her looks, no one sees the /real/ her, yada yada. Until Harry comes in, and they relate to each other perfectly because he's viewed as The-Boy-Who-Lived rather than his own person.

I never found this characterization of Fleur very compelling. It's like someone who was born into a rich family and never wanted for anything bitching about getting a blue car instead of red for their birthday. "I'm drop-dead gorgeous and can make men fall for me with a look, boohoo my life is so hard." How many women would kill to switch places with her?

Harry, as a hormonal 14-year-old teenager, just happening to be "allure immune" and unaffected by her looks is also unbelievable.

Are there any fics where she knows she's hot and owns it? Where she /loves/ having a power over men and isn't afraid to use it, even if it's just for her own amusement? A smitten Harry pursuing Fleur who's a bit of a stuck up bitch could be an amusing read. (He'd probably have to be a bit older than their first meeting at Triwizard for it to be believable.)

Tagged as Request on the off-chance a story like this exists, but discussion welcome.

I mean, he resisted Voldemort's Imperius, so him shrugging off the allure seems believable. Don't get me wrong, he'd still be "awestruck", but it wouldn't be due to mind-altering magic but due to the fact that he is close to/talking/kissing/dancing with a pretty girl.

*** That also fits in with cannon, He wasn't really immune at the world cup(only the first time), afterwards, he was immune.

But then, with the imperious, he wasnt that well at it the first time either, Then 4-5 times later, he can resist one from voldemort.

I mean, canon Harry isn't really affected by her. At least not to any higher degree than you see with any teen boy and an extremely beautiful woman. He doesn't actually have any notable reaction to her in the books. Her beauty isn't even noted outside of Ron's reaction, and he looks to Cho fairly quickly after.

From the book:

#+begin_quote
  It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore's speech. She had finally removed her muffler. A long sheet of silvery-blonde hair fell almost to her waist. She had large, deep blue eyes, and very white, even teeth.

  Ron went purple. He stared up at her, opened his mouth to reply, but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise.

  “Yeah, have it,” said Harry, pushing the dish toward the girl.

Grass is always greener on the other side. Attractive people can have their own problems too. At the risk of sounding vain, I understand what it's like to have problems stem from one's own appearance. I'm certainly no Fleur, but if I was, I imagine I'd find it fairly annoying. It's often overdone in fanfics, but I get it to an extent.

That said, I also get what you mean. A lot of fanfics do it. I think I might be guilty of it as well (I honestly don't remember). A Fleur with your description does seem closer to canon. She does flirt with Cedric, make out (or more) with her Yule Ball date, and generally doesn't come across as a person that's unhappy with herself. I think linkffn(Half-Blood Romantic) might have Fleur be like that to a degree? I'm not entirely sure.

** This is only tangentially related, and definitely more discussion oriented.

I think the thing that irritates me about people's perception of Fleur is that she's attractive, so she either needs to suffer for it so that we can care about her, or she needs to be a bitch about so that we can all hate her without having to feel bad about it.

Like, fuck if someone is attractive and is also a person who has emotions that matter, right? God forbid she enjoy her dates and be secure in her appearance, that's just too much for Harry Potter fans to handle.

Out of everyone, I think Fleur's treatment by the Weasley women and Hermione was the most uncalled for. I lost some respect for Molly Weasley after seeing how she treated Fleur, for daring to be attracted to love her son, and Fleur snatching the scar ointment from her and shutting her down at the end of HBP was extremely satisfying.

*** I lost a ton of respect for the Weasley women and Hermione when dealing with Fleur. Fleur, who was known as the top student in a large school pulling from Western Europe and could charm a dragon, would have wrecked the women in that household. The Weasley women in the books is crazily written, anytime someone disagrees with Molly, she just glares at them and they become frightened and submissive. Or Ginny with her ferocious temper hexes them and then yells at them. I was rooting to Fleur to turn them into the teapot set in Beauty and the Beast.

**** I agree with you with Molly. Less so with Hermione and Ginny, because even though they were wrong to dislike Fleur so much, they were also teenage girls, and teenagers are absolutely brutal to people they don't like, and both grew out of it.

But Fleur was one of the few people in Harry Potter who was brilliant, talented, and had depth of character without needing everyone she ever loved to die, and for that she what, gets to be shat on by both the other characters in the series until she "proves herself" to really love Bill, and then gets shat on by the general community because being attractive apparently means your character is worthless.

***** I think there are only a handful of characters that didn't need everyone around them dead or crippled. Fleur, Bill, Charlie, Arthur, Flitwick, Sprout (I can't remember if McGonagall losing her family is fanon or not).

TBH we really don't know how any of them will be as they grow up. In canon Hermione has the charisma of a flubberworm. She has few leadership skills and it completely baffles me that she became Minister of Magic in the play. To me she reeks of professional bureaucrat.

Ginny is strange because one moment she is irrelevant and the next she is the best quidditch player and the most beautiful girl in the school and everybody loves her. Just straight out of left field.

It was just hard to follow character development in the series. So much in the last 2 books was just wishfulfillment. No development in the characters or world especially outside of Hogwarts.

****** My dude, I agree with your whole post. The Ginny bit has always stuck in my craw, even when pairings were a non-issue for me. I read "monster in his chest" and younger me was utterly baffled about what was happening to Harry. A heart attack, maybe. Perhaps Cho came on strong and Harry couldn't resist. Guess it was just true love that had built up over the course of... oh, nope.

The Hermione bit is also spot on. I mean, I could see her becoming Minister (or finagling things so some committee or other she was on had power to enact the policy changes she wanted. But the leader of the country? Never rang true as fitting her character.

** in this she's at least a bit haughty and has some attitude:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12627473/1/The-Half-Blood-Romantic]])

But there don't seem to be many fics like what you describe. I've been looking for them too. There's a similar problem with Tonks, where Harry always has to be "I want to see the real you" and Tonk never acts offended (because Harry is implying metamorph Tonks is not the real her), instead she's always elated that someone looks deep into her soul or some shit like that.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

I think that writing Veela similar to Asari from Mass Effect works well. An attractive species who embrace their sexuality and own it. Like, Fleur knows that she can seduce most guys (and girls), has done so a couple times, it's not a big deal in her culture, and there are quite a few of her year mates who resent her because they are jealous. Some people see Veela as nothing but sex objects.

Yet at the same time, Fleur has friends and is generally easy going, takes a mentor role for the younger students at Beauxbaton and only uses the "bitch" persona to keep the most superficial suitors away.

  Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously.
