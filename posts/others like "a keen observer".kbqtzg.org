I just finished this 'Black sisters' fic from andromeda's POV and it was /so/ good, one of the best things I've read in a long time, and definitely outside my normal fic tendencies. is there anything else like it? maybe a continuation of the story? or from Bellatrix's POV, her descent into darkness and eventually madness?

** This fic looks really good! Will give it a go :-)

I have written a fic from Narcissa's POV if that's of any interest?

** This author has a few fics like that:

She hasn't written a fic about the Black sisters per se. Usually her stories star just one of the them as the main protagonist but the other two flit around the edges and they usually have powerful, illuminating scenes together.

Her “vision” of the Black sisters are of siblings who share a tragic backstory of abuse by their parents. They once loved each other, and even though as adults they have grown apart (and may even hate each other in Andomeda and Bellatrix's case) they still find themselves unwillingly bound together as victims of the same abuse.

I found the author's observations of the effects of long term abuse, dysfunctional families, and the bonds of sisterhood to be spot-on (at times, even painfully so for those familiar with any of those things). The Black sisters are portrayed unsparingly in their dysfunction, but nevertheless with a quiet sort of affection/pity that make their characters sympathetic without the reader necessarily approving of their decisions.

Andromeda Tonks, Long-Term Addict is a good one that a lot of people like. It's marked unfinished but the last chapter is a pretty good conclusion to the story anyway, so you don't feel cheated. Maybe there was supposed to be another chapter or two as an epilogue but you don't really miss it.

The Augury Origin trilogy, starring Bellatrix (and Voldemort) is very good, well-written and sharply observed as an inside take on an abusive relationship. It humanizes Bellatrix and makes you pity her, but it doesn't excuse her actions or make her a good character either. It closely follows canon, which ultimately makes it too depressing for me to ever read again. And I ultimately mean that as a compliment to the author because there are very few stories that have ever left me so upset that I was crying.

Wanting Narcissa is more of a Narcissa/Severus story, but again, it's sharply observed and entirely character driven portrait of Narcissa as she moves through the events of the latter half of the books.

The Dark Lord's Daughter is probably my favorite story by the author (and is woefully unfinished) which has Hermione as LV and Bellatrix's daughter. Despite the fact that the fic's main character is ostensibly Hermione, it's a veritable romp through the psyches of, and insights on, the Black sisters. There is a Sevmione subplot which I disliked and found slightly creepy (but I find most Sevmione stories slightly creepy---so YMMV) but thankfully it's easy to ignore since the main focus of the plot is the Blacks and Hermione.) The story also contains the single funniest Bellatrix and Andromeda scene I've ever seen in fanfic.
