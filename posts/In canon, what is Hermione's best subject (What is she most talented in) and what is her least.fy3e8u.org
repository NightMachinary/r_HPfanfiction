Charms? Potions?


** I seem to distinctly remember her saying Arithmancy, at least in third year, was her favourite subject. Now, we don't know if this translates into it being her best one, but one would think with brains and dedication like she has that interest would make it so. I also noticed many writers decide to make Transfiguration one of her best subjects, but that could just be something that got popular in fan fictions. Hermione also got 110% in her end-of-year exam in PS.

She does say that, but that's when Harry is remarking that it looks "terrible," or at least terribly complicated. Hermione may be extra defensive.

** I would say Transfiguration or Charms.

Hermione is repeatedly mentioned as doing extremely well in these classes.

In Transfiguration, when they have to transform teapots into turtles, Hermione frets over how hers looks more like a tortoise, while everyone else has more noticeable concerns--someone's turtle still had a spout for a tail for example.

Hermione's also very skilled at Vanishing--while Harry and Ron haven't mastered Vanishing mice, Hermione has already advanced to Vanishing kittens.

In Charms, Hermione is extremely skilled.

Professor Flitwick tells her in confidence that she passed with /over/ one hundred percent. She's able to use /Alohamora/ using Harry's wand to access the third-floor corridor, after only two weeks of school. She masters the Summoning Charm very, very quickly.

Hermione is able to use the Silencing Charm perfectly on a toad and then on a raven, when Ron notes that such a feat would be more difficult.

Essentially, if it boils down to theory and practical application, Hermione excels.

Anything that is instinctual--Divination, Flying, and the more abstract elements of Defense the Dark Arts (Patronuses and boggarts) Hermione struggles with.

*** I disagree with practical application. Spell casting is dependent on theoretical knowledge and so it's expected that her ability to cast spells will be better than Harry or Ron. She knows more spells, more theory behind said spells, and general magical theory. The issue is that she doesn't excel. With her level of theoretical knowledge, a course curriculum, and experience, Hermione couldn't even overcome Lupin's defense exam. Essentially what I'm trying to say is she excels at theory which lends itself to practical application and her theoretical knowledge is buffering her lack of practical ability. If her theoretical knowledge was not as extensive, her spellcasting would suffer. Note how Harry and Ron are capable of mastering charms with far less study of magical theory.

** That's complicated. Do you mean O.W.L.'s and N.E.W.T.'s only or other scores. For instance she scored a 320 in Muggle Studies before she dropped the course. Because it wasn't worth her time. So that would seem to be her best subject out of those offered at hogwarts

** We're talking secondary schooling, mandatory education. Every class needs to be somewhat accessible to the average teenager, so the ceiling for grades isn't that high.

Someone like Hermione who's extremely studious maxed everything bar DADA from the academical standpoint, getting O's everywhere, and outside of class I don't think we've seen her be especially passionate or skilled in a field of magic.

** Defense is her worst, it's the only subject where she doesn't get Outstandings. This is mainly because the grading is highly based on practical work which she struggles with. Her best subject is hard to judge, but I would guess either history or arithmancy. No practical spellcasting involved, and she seems to enjoy the subjects. She reads history books for pleasure on multiple occasions, and I believe Harry gets her an extra arithmancy book for Christmas in one of the years. Binns is a shit teacher and that can make a huge difference, so I'm leaning towards saying arithmancy.
