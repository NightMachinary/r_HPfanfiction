**** Lol, reading your post I figured it might have been the case, sadly in my long Search I don't think I've quite seen any fic that held the kind of promise hpbwl did, but if you're willing to try another fanfiction then give Greg verder vs the world a go, probably my best worm fanfiction.

****** Aye, I swear in the beginning I was really struggling to like Greg because his personality really wasn't my cup of tea but my friend told me to chill because the story was still starting and there's character development to be had and so far it's been progressing really well. The author tried to capture Greg the way he was in canon and is showing us how he's changing because of all the trials getting pushed his way and the dude is doing a good job. Plus it's a gamer fiction and I really like those when it's done well and this one is among my best.

****** I've never even read worm, I just know it's generally the story of a teen who gets the power to control bugs and that she's something of an anti hero and that's why I like this fiction because apart from a few short appearances so far we don't we really see much of her. Apart from a few canon scenes it's basically a whole new story for the mc. So yeah, I think you don't really need to read worm to understand this but maybe looking at the wiki to understand some key terms like endbringers and such would help.

  The Battle of Camlann never happened, thus the legacy of Arthur lives on. The blood of the founders still walk the halls of Hogwarts, while ancient enemies clash to this day. Years later, Harry Potter wakes up a stranger in a strange world. Between over competitive house relations and never ending mysterious plots, he must struggle to find the truth about that fated Halloween. AU

** Sarcasm and Slytherin series linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648]])

It's a Slytherin!Harry fic with Harry having a Gryffindor twin who is (at least supposedly) the BWL. Unlike his twin, Harry takes his studies seriously, although often he studies things not included in the curriculum or even illegal. Not without its faults but well-written.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

**** I was really trying to like this but the author kept trying to force some unnatural hate between harry and his brother for no reason. Anything that is a dislike for jules becomes an instant like for harry. Like bro this shit ain't adding up, like his stance on associating with death eaters is kind of wierd. I understand not blaming the son for the sins of the father but when said father is free and actively raising said son, you may want to take anything that comes from him with a bag of salt, Afterall following the way harry throws blame around he should hate death eaters because they served the one that killed his mother and effectively condemned him to his life of torture with the dursleys,anyway a good story still, just think it could use some polish.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
