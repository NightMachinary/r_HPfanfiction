Exactly what it says on the title. Looking for fics where the whole purist movement gets obliterated to the point that just thinking about it is an enormously bad idea. Bonus points for Death eater suffering and all kinds of revenge shenanigans.

Hopefully completed, but at this point I'll take what I can get.

Thanks!


** My own, Epilogue compliant series will eventually go into that direction. The first and the only one so far is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][an interview of Harry for the 20th anniversary of Battle of Hogwarts]], linkffn(12925628). It's already hinted by Harry that “they had been very thorough with Voldemort sympathizers”.

I don't expect them to carry out mass executions or torture, but they would take following measures such as:

- Establish their own political and paramilitary organization/network based on the DA. Hermione, Ginny, and Luna were working hard in their last year at Hogwarts to recruit followers for their cause. It started out as a self help group for students to overcome the trauma of the previous year, and Luna came up with the proposal to formalize it and expand it to the general populace after their graduation.
- Seize control of Magical Britain's security forces with DA veterans and Order members.
- Rile up and organize the general public to purge and reform Ministry/Wizengamot. The mass torture of Hogwarts students under the Carrows served as a primary rallying cause.
- Grant significant emergency and surveillance powers to Aurors. Auror office eventually became the equivalent of combined MI5 and MI6.
- Hold public trials and fully expose atrocities committed by Death Eaters, Snatchers, and Voldemort sympathizers.
- Reject “I'm just taking my orders” as a form of legal defense.
- Reveal the damages caused to Magical Britain by Blood Purity ideology, using examples of Bulstrodes, Carrows, Crabbes, Goyles, Lestranges, and most importantly, Voldemort himself.
- Make public support of Blood Purity high treason.
- Taboo the word “mudblood”. But instead of going after each trigger, Aurors would record the frequency and location of their occurrences, and send humans to conduct in-depth investigations.
- Vetting of all public positions (Ministry employees, Hogwarts staff) for extreme ideologies (not only blood purity).
- Confiscate assets of Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers to compensate their victims.

Does that mean fascism and communism are off-limits as well?

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4910668/1/The-Inquisitor-s-Son][The Inquisitor's Son]] by jinxdoll might be something you'll like. I don't remember much besides Death Eaters being murdered. One of the main murder was Draco and his wife while Scorpius survived. Harry is on the case. I'm not sure it is exactly what your looking for, but it is probably something you'll like. linkffn(4910668) Status: Completed
