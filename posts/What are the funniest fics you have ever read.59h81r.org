  Scorpius really should have listened to his father's numerous and dire warnings about the Potter clan. Harry feels his pain. Gen crackfic WIP, yo. Seriously, so cracky.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** Linkffn(11634921)

Harry is raised by the Akatsuki and has no concept of morality, resulting in plenty of deaths. Dumbledore knows the world makes no sense and therefore tries to see just how much crap he can get away with before someone calls him on it. So far, he is extremely disappointed.

Edit: You don't really need to know much about the Naruto universe to enjoy this fic, but it does have Naruto spoilers in it. Basically, Harry's 'uncles' are a bunch of overpowered (even by Naruto standards) amoral, kill-happy ninjas. That's not that strange for a ninja in the Naruto world though, considering they're all trained from a young age to be child soldiers (if you're lucky and don't get a bijuu stuffed down your throat at birth), but Akatsuki just happens to be much better at killing everyone else than everyone else is at killing them.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** *Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106): [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/58798e/discussion_tell_us_about_some_of_your_favorite_hp/d8y7m0a/][selected quotes]]

*The Adventures Of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited*, linkffn(9708318): I love its description of Hufflepuff's Shovel.

#+begin_quote
  Upon picking up the small hand shovel, a chorus of trumpets sounded and a word bubble popped up in Harry's vision, just as the shovel grew in length to be a full dirt shovel longer than Harry was tall and painted in yellow and black spirals up the handle and checkered across the shovels head/blade.

  "Tada! With hard labor and diligent work, you've earned the "Hufflepuff Harry" title and a new tool and weapon, the Hufflepuff Shovel. For when there is shit to be done, we know you'll be there diligently shoveling it!"

  Harry looked rather nonplussed by his new weapon/tool. "Hardy har har, you're a regular laugh riot is what you are." Harry groused as he looked over his shovel.

  "Inventory," Harry called, getting ready to put away his new weapon, only to find a new tab in his inventory called "Weapons." Touching the tab, an expanded area of the chest opened up like closet or armory; though it was rather bare armory with only one Pointy Stick resting on a weapons rack. Still, the addition of the Weapons armory gave Harry some new information he hadn't had before as floating above the Pointy Stick on its rack was the weapons Statistics of: 1 melee attack/1 defense. As Harry set down the shovel in a weapon rack, its statistics floated above it: 3 melee attack/1 defense, Plus 2 to Herbology when wielding Hufflepuff Shovel and Plus 1 to attempts to Hide Bodies or turn them into fertilizer.

  Harry paled at the last two details, "I'm never going to look badly at Hufflepuffs again." Harry stated definitively.

  Closing his inventory and shaking off the shivers that came from imaging Madame Sprout and how she made her fertilizer, Harry looked around at all the collecting he had done and realized he was done with that for now.

** There's this amazing fic, hermione/Voldemort, where Hermione has to manage a "Avada Kedavra Anonymous" group. It's well written and short, and so funny (especially if you like that pairing, since it's light and fun, a kind of fic that's somewhat missing in that fandom). And if you don't like the pairing, it's funny anyway, it's just centered on those two.

** linkffn(4019608)

An AU of sort where Lily Potter (nee Evans) has a cousin called Bond, James Bond.

After a very unlikely (yet satisfied) death of the Dursley, Harry Potter is put in his care... and trained to become one hell of an agent. More interesting is the first time meeting Hermione: he was putting a gun on Mrs. Granger's head, while 'Mione was putting another on his.

Too bad that the story is abandoned.

This one is "better". Though it is /highly not recommended/ for the young and innocent

*** The Champion's Champion is very, very funny if you don't mind horrific levels of Ron bashing. In fact, there's so much Ron-bashing in the fic that Harry and Hermione basically become side characters after the first few chapters. Fortunately, it is so damn funny and hilarious that it's a good read nonetheless.
