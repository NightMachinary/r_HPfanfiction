There are certain little things that can show up in the first chapter of a fic that make me immediately abandon it. I'm curious what types of initial things in the title, summary, or first chapter leave you with bad impressions. I don't mean that you don't like a certain pairing or slash or a particular genre of story, but rather things about the writing and narrative technique that turn you off from the start.\\
For me:\\
--Any fic that has a character name (and only the character name) as the title. This is especially true of works that have some made up character or canon character who has an overly romanticized name (e.g. "Hydrus Malfoy Black" or "Hermione Persephone Granger-Black" or similar). They always seem to be juvenile Mary-Sue or author insert types of stories. I'll never click on one.

--"one Harry James Potter" : I cringe when authors introduce Harry like this. It comes off to me like they're trying to sound adult or lend some gravitas to their writing. The story that usually seems to follow is trite, predictable, and riddled with grammar errors. Now when I see it I just move on to something else.

--Any story that features a year-by-year canon rehash in the first chapter. Usually bashing fics are the main culprits here. I just want to tell the author -- we're reading fanfiction! We kinda already know all this!

--Continued misspellings of canon names, e.g. "Lilly." It takes two seconds to check a character's name, and when I see it continuously I realize that the author probably hasn't thought much or checked out many canon facts at all, and the stories nearly always tend to be weak.

--Major grammar errors in the first sentence. I see them, I'm out.

--Any fic that has Harry (as a teenager) talking seriously about finding his "true love" in the first chapter. Ugh.

I don't mean to come off as overly critical (though I probably am), but I'm honestly curious what little things make you shake your head and hit the back button.

...

Impromptu haiku aside, have you ever seen a real conversation transcribed? It's ugly as hell. Pauses, filler words, talking in circles, run-ons, tangents --- natural speech is quite distinct from written language. Writing, on the other hand, lets you easily use a vocabulary and sentence complexity that could be awkward when spoken. The trick is finding a compromise between the written and spoken when writing dialogue, and many people fail at this.

**** The best advice I've heard on this came from the Writing Excuses podcast, and said something along the lines of

#+begin_quote
  People who write fantasy, are usually the kind of people who read fantasy growing up. They are generally also the people who feel awkward in social situations, and don't understand real dialogue as well. Dialogue for fiction is a stylized version of the real thing, and when a person learned how to communicate socially from written dialogue, their own written dialogue becomes a stylized version of the stylized version of the real thing. What you should do is go look at how non-genre movies with good banter work.
#+end_quote

I believe it was Dan Wells, but I could be wrong. I will further add from David Brin's advice on a different episode of the same podcast, transcribe the dialogue. Copying it down, word for word, engages a different part of your brain, so instead of getting caught up in the magic of the writing, you can look at where the author put the comma, and why.

***** Another good way to learn more natural dialogue is to go somewhere in public -- like, say, a coffee shop, where typing on a laptop wouldn't be weird -- and simply write down unvarnished conversations as they are heard.

Then, afterward, edit them into something that still reads as organic, but far more polished.

This technique can also be used with recorded but unrehearsed conversations, like man-on-the-street interviews or criminal suspect interrogations. But that won't get get the same level of raw dialogue in those as in random chats.

***** In my opinion, conversation can broadly boil down to a few categories:

1. Stranger-Stranger businesses interaction
2. Non-friend formal aquaintence
3. Non-friend informal aquaintence
4. Casual Friend
5. Close friend
6. Family.

Each level has a different degree of familiarity. #1 is a wholly scripted encounter while #6, #5, and sometimes #4 are so specific to the in-group and so based on mutual knowledge that it wouldn't fit in almost any other group's social context. Trying to write based upon any of your experiences level 4 or higher usually doesn't fit, while level 3 and lower can lead to that stilted dialogue.

In essence, people have to reinvent an entire social group's collective and individual knowledge sets and their personalities and relationships in order to know what people would "naturally" say. That's a lot of work, and trying to bypass that worm takes a much greater skill at writing in general.

It's not that people don't know what a conversation sounds like, it's that they lack the understanding to naturally invent one or the writing skill to fabricate one from nothing.

Weirdly, for me all it took was reading the stuff aloud, mimicking the emotions that the characters would show in their voice, and making adjustments based on how the whole thing sounds to me.

Yeah, there's the key. If two people suck equally at writing dialogue, but one tries speaking it aloud before revising it, it's pretty obvious who's going to be better and who's too lazy to try. And then, of course, there are those who suffer under the Dunning-Kruger effect, who are so bad at writing that they literally cannot comprehend how bad they are because they cannot identify good writing and cannot compare their writing to that standard.

** There's this "fanfic voice" that so many works have. I don't know if it's a consequence of how English composition is taught to children, or what, but it always strikes me as SO weird how consistent it is across fandoms and fics.

Its most common trait is the whole breathless-jumble-of-words thing. Run-on sentences show up everywhere. Lots of unnecessary and clunky "which" and "that" clauses turn each sentence into a turgid mess. You constantly see tons of extra words and an unhealthy fondness for the words like "grin" "smirk" "shudder" or "somewhat."

Maybe it's that the teenage authors of the works mostly read other fanfics and pick it up there. I dunno. I've dropped fics in the first sentence or the first paragraph before, but usually I'll power through the entire first snip to give it a fair shake. If it's written in "fanfic voice" then I'm out.

**** I don't like the traditional laid-out in italics type of backstory. But if the author chooses to write it like that, I would much rather read it in chunks than as a whole. The best option, in my opinion is to learn about the characters in dialogues or their own musings. But if your story is an AU, I will probably read it despite the backstory. Alternate Universes are my favourite type of fanfiction.

***** This is exactly how I feel. I don't mind when a story goes AU from a specific moment in canon and the author includes an excerpt of canon text in italics at the beginning, but I prefer the weaving technique for non-canon backstories as much as possible. Often those initial "this how it's different" don't feel like a story, they feel like an obligatory author's note because they couldn't figure out interesting ways to flesh out the story. I'll still read it if the rest seems good enough though.

***** I agree to an extent, but one of my first favorite fanfics was "Harry Potter and the - Wait Scratch That." Which was initially a very well done /if Harry were a girl/ fics (it has been on very slow updates for the past maybe 6 years, and it got worse after 4th year). It is basically the whole HP story, but they actually thought through the consequences of how society treats different genders. Anyway, the point of this example is, it starts at the point of divergence: +Harry+Juniper's Birth. But it's just one scene, and it kind of mirrors our actual series in that is has a baby scene and suddenly you fast forward through her early life and then she is nearly 11

**** I don't see much of a point in giving the character a different enough backstory that it all goes off the rails if you are going to summarise the differences and never actually handle it properly in the story. It's like a lazy way of saying “oh hey guys, I have no idea how to write this character so I'm going to bullshit, and since it's bullshit it won't matter in the story so I'll info-dump”.

Like, no. If you have divergent character development then either show it via scenes that cause the divergence, show it via scenes that highlight the alternate character development, or allude to it in the story and reveal the details using the character themselves when they would have done so. Or, better yet, all three in varying proportions. It's acceptable to not do this in crack fics for as long as they are still recognisable even without the extra info, but in a story that aspires to seriousness ... please do try.

I mean, let's switch mediums for a bit. If you had a game and had a side-story that caused divergence compared to canon, would you prefer to get the divergence from cut-scenes and scripted in-game character banter or from a silly info-dump at the beginning of it all and then not see it ever again? The former, you say? Yeah, that's what I thought.

** Excessive character bashing makes me abandon quickly. I don't really like the Ron/Hermione or the Harry/Ginny pairing of canon, but the evil Weasleys trope is a bit much for me and never seems realistic. I don't really like Dumbledore bashing either. Clearly he made mistakes and he even acknowledges this, but when he's painted as a dark lord I just lose all interest because it turns into a story of rebellius teenager vs manipulative/evil elder. Who really wants to relive their arrogant, rebellius teenage years by reading this stuff? If you do, I would argue that you haven't matured much since that period of your life, but that's just me. Also, any story where Hermione doesn't live up to her character according to canon makes me abandon. Some writers just never acknowledge how deep of a character she truly is, and simply use her for dialogue or for a love interest where she isn't really that important. In my opinion, she is the best character of the series and I don't like reading fics where her character sucks.

*** An incredible story that is a WIP but just amazing is linkffn(9320401)

This has untrustworthy!Dumbledore but is not bashing him. It just explores the side of Dumbledore where it's like, well Hogwarts wasn't really the safest place ever.

Slow burn Fred/Hermione/George with a friendship turned soul bond (that is part of the Dumbledore plotline). Hermione and them are so well characterized and it shows a small mischievous side to her. She's also orphaned and there's plot to that.

Alive!Sirius who was never imprisoned. Pettigrew is deep involved. He adopted Harry and is with Amelia Bones with Susan playing a role.

There is some errors - Hermione's on the Quidditch team but it is barely mentioned unless vital to the plotline and at one point she's watching a GvS game? And the fact that Ron is almost never mentioned along with Ginny unless it's part of the minor Harry/Luna relationship plotline.

Deep story but good. Can't wait to see where the characters go. Another really well done one is The Bespoke Witch by Glittrally.

** Harry, if it's not a name used on its own, is a diminutive of Henry or Harold.

Frequently with a derisive sneer. James Potter might be the child of some pairing of Charlus, Fleamont, Dorea or Euphemia, but whoever his parents were they broke the cycle of abuse and gave him a sensible name. Lily Potter was from a northern mill-town, /prime territory/ for pointing and laughing at people who give their kids toff names.

**** The key to having children act like children AND be interesting is context. To explain:

If you throw a child into a serious political situation and have them act like a child, it will be painful to read. The child's immaturity will be irritating when your real interest is in the politics.

If you throw a child into a serious political situation and have them act like an adult, it will be painful to read. The character will read as unrealistic, and other characters taking the child seriously will come off as absurd.

So what's the solution? Don't throw children into serious political situations in the first place. Keep children acting like children within appropriate contexts and you're fine, I think.

** Cub. Pup. Mouldyshorts. Bumbledork. Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Slytherin-Peverell-Merlin.

I usually reserve judgement after encountering incorrectly spelled names (Lilly, McGonogall, Pamona, Pavarti etc.). Often enough, the fic turns out to be good even with those mistakes.

If Harry acquires an almighty plot device, such as a massive fortune, an access to long-lost magicks of the arcane, a magical Animagus form or whatever else is capable of dealing with any and all challenges without difficulty, the story has, in my view, lost all its stakes. I read on for a couple chapters and, depending on the going, either drop it or continue for another couple chapters. Usually, the fic ends up being quickly dropped. However, there have been fics where a massive fortune was necessary or even insufficient to fight, say, a massively corrupt government.

**** Contractions are used to control which part of the word/phrase that is being contracted has emphasis on it. For example, with “it's” and “it is”, by default the emphasis is on “it” in “it's” but on “is” in “it is”. Another example, with “don't” and “do not”, with the former the emphasis is on the whole while with the latter it's on the “not”, thus making “do not” feel stronger as a way of disapproving something.

This can be used to great effect when writing dialogue, because it's harder to convey emotions in writing than it is in verbal speech and here is one more tool which can be used to get a bit closer.

Improper grammar is a big one. While I'm willing to forgive some errors, this frustrates me to no end: "Blah blah blah." He said. "Yip yip yip." She said.

Saidisms. 'He exclaimed.' 'He chortled.' 'He responded.' etc. One or two is fine, but you should always just use said. Using any other word is a crutch that leads to telling, not showing. Let actions and settings drive the dialogue, not vice versa.

On the same note, adverbs in identifying dialogue. 'He said angrily.' 'He said funnily.' 'She said smirkingly.' That's plain, naked telling. If someone is angry, show us! Maybe they're fidgeting. Or their eye is twitching. Or their fist is clenched tight around their wand. All those describe anger better than saying angrily.

2.  I hate reading a story that is the exact same as canon except for like, one change. It's ridiculous.
3.  Poorly written characters annoy me. I'm not reading Flat Stanley, I'm reading Harry Potter. PLEASE do not give me a two dimensional character
4.  Throwing around unforgivables or unbreakable vows like they're goddamn candy. stop.

    1. A sub-category is that stupid "I swear on my life/magic/ect." bs or "so mote it be" You're not a freemason, you're a wizard, Harry. Plus most of the time these phrases are used as cop-outs to legitimate plot holes.

5.  Forced romance. Romance is NOT like gum, where if it loses its flavor just cram more in! I should be able to feel the natural progression of a relationship! Make me want them to get together!
6.  Dumb tropes

    1. Ice queen daphne (although if it's well written, I am a bit of a sucker for this trope if I'm being honest)
    2. Manipulative!Dumbles, Dumb!Ron, Bitch!Hermione
    3. Magic Cores. Usually because they're mentioned once and then never again, or they're poorly written

7.  "I do not forgive, I do not forget" careful not to cut yourself on that edge there, thirteen year old child
8.  M-Preg/Harems/Soul-Bonds
9.  Goblins treating Harry as the incarnation of Jesus Christ himself because he was polite that one time
10. Romances that involve any deatheater or their children falling in love w/ Hermione or someone of her blood status. Because everyone loves those stories where the KKK Member marries the black woman!
11. It's Fred and George, not Gred and Forge. They made that joke one time and now everyone wants to beat that horse to death
12. While the Dursleys sucked, they weren't the embodiment of satan or something. Some of you need to chill
13. Fleur wouldn't date Harry when he was 14! It doesn't matter how mature he is it's still a THREE YEAR AGE GAP AS A TEENAGER

** Getting creatures wrong. I get there's a lot of magical creatures out there from all over the world and some don't have great descriptions. But it drives me insane when there's a clear description of say...an Ashwinder but the author describes a Runespoor and calls it an Ashwinder.

** The kind of fic that mentions sex in every chapter, I get bored with it. People seem to think it's very grown-up to write and read about sex and violence. Only those who aren't sure they write good intimate scenes do this really well, employing phrases that are subtle, but not vulgar.

** Female Character attacking Male Character (often physically) (without being called out for it) as humor.

Uh, no.

(The former is usually Hermione and the latter Ron, but it's often AnyFemaleCharacter and Harry too...)

Also - commonly misused words like Affect vs Effect or Your vs You're.

Otherwise, I'll give at least the first chapter a go.

** Constant Twin Speak. The twins only spoke in twin speak if they were messing with you or making a point. They didn't do it EVERY SINGLE time they spoke. It's annoying to read.

​

People who haven't really read the books only read Fanfiction.

** Pretty simple: Glaring inconsistencies with how the world works from the original series.

I'm okay with some subtle changes here and there, some small inconsistencies now and then. I don't like them, but I accept them.

I just can't take things that violate the world established by the original series. This includes communing with animal spirits, muggle tech working around magic, etc. Like, tweak the characters, make Ginny and Luna lesbian girlfriends who only want to use Harry to make a baby with Potter genes. Go nuts on the characters.

But the world. The world must be consistent or I'm out.

*** For me, I'm okay with it if they established that they were going to change things a little about how it works but pretending it's canon compliant is too much.
