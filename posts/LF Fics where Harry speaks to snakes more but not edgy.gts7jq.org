** Well, there's /Reluctant Ally/ by Harry50 where Harry has a snake familiar, but he's not remotely dark.

Mind you, it has a /lot/ of tropes that people tend to dislike, Harry is an emancipated lord, soul bonds, consensual sexual activity between minors(no real smut, IMO, but it's definitely present).

It also has one of the weirder cases of Dumbledore bashing I've seen. So far, Dumbledore is appearing to be quite manipulative and doing morally wrong things for the greater good, but he also doesn't lose his temper when his plans fall through like I often see.

Also, one of the positives is the relationship between Harry and the Dursleys slowly improve through the beginning. Even after Harry becomes an emancipated lord, he still lives with them, and they get along better and better as the story progresses.

You should be able to google it to find it. It /might/ be okay to link seeing as the sexual activity isn't described in great detail, but I figure it's best not to risk it.

Very long though, and snakes aren't early on

** LINKFFN(*Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them*) In which Harry is an elf. Not one of those lame house elves but a forest elf. He talks to snakes, lives in the woods and bilks rubes. Neither Harry nor the snakes he meets are edgy or dark, mostly they are just annoyed that wizards keep dragging them out of the forest.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** Serpentine - linkffn(12459242) - A good story where Harry learns a lot about magical snakes and caring for them.

The Little Child to Lead Him - linkffn(3123443) - Has a snake familiar that is fun and the fic is certainly not edgy/dark

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way- by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that seeks to either protect or destroy him.

  A Christmas visit to Harry's relatives set in motion a number of changes in his life... fatherhood being the largest. Eventually Harry and Daphne Greengrass.
