So i do rember that Harry Has these weird dreams that start to blur and he wakes up on top of a shop in knockturne alley. The original boy in the body that harry woke up in was a punching bag for the slytherin house. I also remember that he had a twin brother in ravenclaw house. I believe the pairing was tmr/hp.

If you could help, it would be the best!

Thanks!!
