Is it just me or does every f/m story with romance or "romance" have Harry in charge? Some begin with the woman in charge but all eventually reach the point where Harry takes over and dictates where things go, even if that's literally the first time he even kissed a member of the opposite sex.

So are there any stories where Harry does not take the initiative and just enjoys things wherever they go (which does NOT mean he just sits there and does nothing)? No slash, preferably with no infidelity on Harry's part.

Edit: I am actually looking for something with a plot, not just sex.

*** I knew that I forgot something. I remember that Ron and Hermione spent like half of that story having sex and neglecting Harry if memory serves right.

**** Not so much neglecting Harry as just exploring their own relationship. Plus it's really hard to consider what happens to Harry “neglect”.

***** It wasn't very relevant since Harry was balls deep in Fleur at that time, but I remember that I had issues with that background relationship since it was an asspull, even worse than what Rowling wrote.

****** I think it was just cheesy, too cheesy. I can understand why you'd have some issues with it though.

** Harry doesn't exactly get seduced in it, but is not the driving force behind everything in his relationship, and it is up to the lady to move things along.

The pace is quite fast, there are one or two cliches in play, and occasionally it stretches the suspension of disbelief a bit. But on the whole it is quite good. It isn't an epic, but it definitely isn't garbage either.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** Does it even begin that way? IIRC his first relations with ladies are two girls who are having sex with him as part of a deal to get him to fund their start up business.

That's hardly having the girls in charge imo.
