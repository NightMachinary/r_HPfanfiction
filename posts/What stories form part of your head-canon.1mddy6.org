*** Hmm... much as I enjoyed 'In the Words of GMP', I can't really see it as head-canon - there is no way Ginny knows all the stuff that the Trio do (e.g. knowing that Sirius is innocent at the end of PoA, figuring that Snape is good in DH and seeing the Prince's Tale memories, etc.).

** [[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness]] is basically what I assume happened during DH, inside Hogwarts. Only JK can tell me otherwise.

*** I LOVE this story in almost every aspect, but the one issue I have with it is that the Snape in this fic really does seem evil. There is no way you can excuse this Snape's actions - he does NOT honour Dumbledore's wish for him to be Headmaster to protect the students from Voldemort's regime.

And all the extra deaths of those 'unnamed fifty' fleshed out in the final battle made me incredibly sad.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] plays a big role in how I think of the Marauders as young kids.
