So i love Ginny Weasley even if some don't and i like fan-fictions where she is powerful and independent, I'm particularly searching for a fan-fiction were Ginny never went to Hogwarts and met harry or when she left for Hogwarts her second year and completely changed


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there), is a very sweet Harry/Ginny romance set in an non-magic AU, so there is no Hogwarts at all. Harry is a celebrity in a different way, and his parents' true identity will be revealed in the end. Highly recommended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is one of my favorite Ron/Hermione fics. Harry, Neville, and Weasley kids all went to Beauxbaton, for a very good reason. Dumbledore was brilliant in this story.

  Wherein Harry never could help himself from trying to save the day, and Ginny was just trying to survive her shift without killing any of her customers.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
