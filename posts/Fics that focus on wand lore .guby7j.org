Literally any fic that has some sort of in-depth wand explanations, main HP characters don't necessarily have to be present


** This becomes an important topic in linkffn(The Firebird's Son) but it takes a while to get there.

** It's one of the more prominent plot lines in Magic Knows No Boundaries But Those We Believe In by NeverGonnaStop. Be warned tho it is not finished and certainly over the top (may be even called Mary sue) but it is practically wandlore porn in term of explaining how elder wand is so powerful. Very cool wand creation ideas. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13162660/1/]]
