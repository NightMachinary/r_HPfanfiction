** Now listen here Naupiz Zebra Eighteen... I don't mean to dox you or your emerald orbs, but this kind of invective is just too much! It had better be one damn quiet riot because some people are trying to sleep over here.

Now that everyone knows your full legal name and that you accidentally(repeatedly) dipped your wedding tackle into basilisk green eye shadow, put those verdant orbs on ice before they turn a particular shade of puce and a throbbing vein begins to pulse wildly.

Just watch yourself there mate(cub) or I'll cast fiendfyre, whose incantation is quite helpfully fiendfyre, or perhaps some amazingly powerful wandless magic.

To my own chagrin, it seems that spells cast wandlessly always come out of my own ass, it's a very unique effect that I learned in a book titled Butt Magic and the Jedi Crossover. Unsurprisingly, it was no use to anyone, anywhere, at any time. Shazaam!

90% of the solutions between Harry, Ron and Hermione in the stories are solved by Hermione. Many of which are creative and intuitive. Shit, some of them are /inventions/, like the coin used in the DA.

"The SPEW [sic] thing" is entirely deconstructed /only/ in fanon. Canonically we have no reason to think that /being against slavery/ is in any way the incorrect solution. "House Elves rely on wizard magic" or any of the other weird excuses Death Eater / Conservative Wizard apologists in fanfiction are /purely/ fanon.

In the actual books there's no reason to think that Hermione fighting against slavery was a bad thing. The only real arguments posed against Hermione's point of view was from Ron himself, in which he mentions that they're just happy doing what they're doing. But as a group of creatures who we saw treated poorly and having their agency taken away, we have absolutely no way of knowing what they'd actually think.

I'm not going to claim that Rowling did this on purpose, but the House Elves' reactions were very analogous to USA history with the slaves. When you're told that you're shit and that you need to be directed in life from the moment you're born, you start to believe it. Do you think every slave in the US wanted to be free? /Absolutely/ not. Sure, /some/ of them fought for their freedom, but a /lot/ of slaves didn't. Shit, some of them fought against the North during the Civil War (though, of course, some were forced to).

I know it's almost contradictory to state this, but someone /born/ into slavery does not /necessarily/ have the agency necessary to /choose/ whether or not they need to continue to be enslaved. After they've been given their freedom, they're free to do whatever they want.

#+end_quote

Look, Rowling doesn't exactly go into great detail about how a lot of the magic works in the Harry Potter series, but from what I can tell there's no spell with such deviation in canon. The Dark Mark was a fucking /tattoo/ on a human that would burn when people were being summoned. The D.A. coin was an enchanted piece of metal which heated up when a message on the coin changed, with a "Master" coin, as opposed to Voldemort choosing any random follower with a Dark Mark (remember, he didn't have a Dark Mark himself).

The implementations were /wildly/ different. Perhaps "invent" was too strong of a word. I'll recant that. But her solution was absolutely not the same and so absurdly, obviously creative and clever that I'm not sure where you're coming from.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is intuitive in solving mysteries, but Hermione for the most part a​ct​s as the researcher of the group.
#+end_quote

I... honestly can't remember a single case in which Harry solved a mystery on his own.

In Philosopher's Stone, they were all wrong. All three of the trio.

In Chamber of Secrets, Hermione is the one who figured out what Slytherin's Monster was - something that not even the most knowledgeable Wizard in the world, Dumbledore, figured out.

In Prisoner of Azkaban, Hermione is the one who knew about Remus being a Werewolf. Something she had no reason to "research", by the way. That was all intuition.

In Goblet of Fire, Hermione tirelessly helped Harry wherever she could, including teaching him how to perform the Summoning Charm.

In Order of the Phoenix, Hermione was the one who tried to tell Harry that going to the Department of Mysteries would be a huge mistake. Talk about Harry's intuition on that one, why don't you.

In Half-Blood Prince, Harry definitely got a one-up on Hermione in the whole Draco debacle. No denying that. She also instantly knew that Harry was "cheating" in Potions. I put it in quotations because I'm not necessarily agreeing, just pointing out that she knew it very quickly. She also was the one who told him that using the book would end badly for him - which it did.

In Deathly Hallows, Hermione /literally/, due to her own preparedness, got them out of /every single/ bad situation that the Trio found themselves in. Every situation, perhaps, with the exception of Malfoy Manor. However, she also didn't crack under torture. Not necessarily relevant to this discussion, but I enjoy saying it, because she's a fucking badass.

Sure - a lot of those solutions were due to the fact that she was "book smart". However, "book smart" doesn't cover it. She very /creatively/ and /intuitively/ used her own intelligence for those solutions.

The idea that Hermione was a useless researcher who spent too much time in books and not actually paying attention to the world around her comes from /bad writing/ in /shitty fanfiction/.

************ In book 2, she leaves a page with basilisk info and 'pipes' in her hand writing. Harry jumps to Myrtle, the bathroom, and he and Ron do the rest. First year, Harry and co are pretty much hand-fed clues (Hagrid keeps spilling information and Harry gets chocolate frog card) and Harry decides someone was going after the stone when Dumbles is away. Most of Hermione's part generally was book knowledge - figuring out Remus was a werewolf due to researching an assignment from Snape, figuring out the basilisk due to research, etc. Being methodical is not a negative trait, but it is a trait she has. No one is completely lacking in intuition (I don't think?) and having perfect intuition is basically being clairvoyant, but Harry's more of the nutrition guy and Hermione is more methodical than intuitive. She is also not very open to possibilities outside of academic sources, unless it is something that disagrees with her sensibility. The Weasley twins are creative - almost everything they do is new and ingenious, doesn't mean they never research or do things other people have done before. Hermione making the coins doesn't make her a creative person.

She states she got the idea from the dark mark, which allows Voldie to call followers to him, implying all the dark marks are connected somehow. She, being knowledgable about magic, also knows about the protean charm, so she combines the two ideas. But you are right, it is an innovative use as far as we know.

Having said all that, this is a series written for children which means that reading it as an adult makes me notice things that I didn't as a child. For example, why didn't Dumbles, or any adult really, figure out it's a basilisk? Once you realize such creatures are possible, they're kind of obvious as long-lived serpents that petrify and kill with their eyes. Same thing with stone - if we assume that Dumbles is light and intelligent and all that is good, why would he leave a valuable artifact he knows people are after behind protection that three 11-year-olds could by pass and behind a door that can be opened with a first year spell? JKR wanted specific characters and then shoe-horned them into her plot - the books are good for the most part, but there is a reason they're not considered great literature the way LOTR is. Hermione was written to be a bookish character, Ron the street-wise side-kick, and Harry the poor mistreated orphan turned hero. If Hermione was as awesome as her fans think, then she would be a Mary Sue - super intelligent, powerful, creative, has her choice of the cast, loving well-to-do parents who totally forgive her for erasing their memories, and a humanitarian who's the only one to see house-elves for the slaves that they are. Honestly, who needs Harry or Dumbledore with her around?

  To be honest, if I wasn't extremely biased against Hermione I could admit that she is cleverish.
#+end_quote

I'm, like, super confused. What, exactly, are you attempting to debate? I've already listed a shit ton of examples of Hermione being clever from all of the books, of things off the top of my head. So far your only counter seems to be, like, 2 examples of bad ideas or, at least, 2 examples of ideas that backfired.

You're saying she isn't clever. Can you make the case for /why/ she isn't clever? Because you're rebuttal to my listing of 7 examples of clever ideas is by bringing up a single clever idea had two huge problems. If we're going tit-for-tat, you've got ground to make up. I'm assuming there are either /more/ examples or a different line of reasoning for why you think she isn't "smart"?

************ I always founded Hermione not smart or clever because of the following.

In Philosopher's Stone, she trusted a riddle wrote by Snape and made Harry drink a potion. If it wasn't a children book, all the potion would have been poison and Harry's life would have lasted one book.

You could say that she was only eleven at the time, but when I started to read Harry Potter I was even younger and I thought about it.

** I automatically assumed that it was Molly, Ginny or Hermione who would deliver that line.

At the other hand, many other approaches don't seem to fit for the well established characters. You can have Padma Patil tell Harry to "stop being a lazy bum, put your/his dick away and start thinking about solving the fucking egg", but it would be incredibly OOC for Hermione to deliver that line. And I can't think of many scoldings which do not sound like Snape, a disappointed parent, Molly or are too vulgar for the main cast.

And how often do you need to scold the MC? If they seriously fuck up, swearing works to an extent, but unless someone is using the idiot ball as anal beads, there's no need for a full dressing down either way.

Hermione tends to just huff and roll her eyes when it comes to Harry. He honestly doesn't get scolded very much in a motherly sort of way. So it's a bit OOC when we see the wonderful women in his life scolding him.
