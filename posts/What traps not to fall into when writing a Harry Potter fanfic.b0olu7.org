So I'm writing my first big story for Harry Potter (It's a crossover) and I want to know what writing errors I shouldn't fall into.

For example: Dumbledore overusing the phrase “My boy”, Harry suddenly knowing Gobbledygook, or Harry becoming this hero with so many powers that most of them aren't even relevant or necessary to the story line.

I know that becoming a bit OOC is something that is very difficult to avoid so I'm not going to worry too much about it. After all there is a line between a little and too much and even then, some OOC stories are still highly enjoyable. But do you guys have any tips I should use or things I should avoid?

Edit: Clarification


** You should decide early on about whether it's canon compliant or AU.

If canon compliant, you need to research the Books exhaustively or canon orthodox reviewers will tear you to shred for minor errors.

If AU, you need to stop worrying too much about canon stations. For example, the troll incident may not happen; the basilisk may not only petrify students, but actually kill; Wormtail may not escape because they actually stunned him; and Voldemort may not let Barty impersonate Moody and have his resurrection party in that Graveyard.

As for Dumbledore, if you just write him slightly more competent than in canon, you will have solved the canon plot easily as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/][Petrification Proliferation]]. While that makes for a good humor fic, there isn't much of a story you can write.

So the key lies with Voldemort. In canon, he is depicted as a sadistic genocidal maniac without a shred of redeeming qualities, but with tons of arrogance, compulsive-obsessive issues, and downright stupidity. Only by dumbing him and his Death Eaters down to room temperature IQ in the last two Books, could our teenage heroes with above average abilities win based on additional Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiat, Plot Armors, and a very significant amount of Luck.

That being said, it's your call to write the story you want. But if you want your fic to stand out, you have to develop a coherent original plot and a wiser Voldemort.

****** All of the Tom Clancy works other than "The Division", "Red Storm Rising" and his non-fiction works are in the same universe. "Rainbow Six" and "The Hunt for Red October" share the same universe. Well, if you ignore the movies at least.

You can mend HP and the Clancy Universe quite easily, you just have to make a few changes to what happens in America in the 90s (Nuclear terrorist attack on Denver, Ebola as a biological weapon, A war with Japan, A Japanese Pilot kamikaze-ing into the Senate).

********** Is it racist if it's true? I mean, you need to have someone as antagonist and even if somewhat stereotypical, I never felt like Clancy was bashing a nationality. The Japanese did some crazy shit during WWII, most of the recent terrorism comes from the Middle East, China is very totalitarian.

The whole "America saves the day" thing gets a little tiresome, but other than the US, no other country has the potential to do so on a regular bases, as fun as "Bismarck returns in the hour of need" or "Tsar Putin the First" would be to read.

*********** He gives a strong impression that he thinks American (and to a lesser extent, European) culture is superior, while other cultures not only promote stupidity, but also degeneracy. I remember one point in Debt of Honor where he accuses most Japanese men of liking underage girls. That's the sort of thing I was getting at. Admittedly, he's not racist in terms of people's skin colour, as long as they're American.

I'm actually fine with the "America saves the day" shtick, though I do wish he'd make the enemies a bit more threatening. Like, half the Iranian(?) army was destroyed by a single National Guard division in Executive Orders, without taking a single casualty. China was also defeated pretty handily, despite great difficulty deploying troops to Far East Russia. Japan at least had a good plan and some significant early successes.

************ Clancy certainly puts a lot of emphasis on technological disparities and how much effect a lack of competent command can have. There are plenty of battles which prove that to be true, from Rorke's Drift to Hill 3234 (VDV vs Afghans), but perhaps not to the extent he plays it up to be.

His emphasis on logistics though is pretty accurate. The Chinese were defeated because their supply chain was cut and then they were encircled like the large Soviet formations in 41 or the Germans at Falaise.

Well, not sure about every sentiment, but have you ever seen a Japanese porn movie? There is certainly a hint of age and rape play if you go by the moans and the overall depiction of consent.

Long as the explanations are engaging, I love reading about those things you say to avoid; indeed, I find it jarring for a crossover /not/ to address these points satisfactorily.

They help each other deal with the grief, finding solace in each other and, eventually, love. Rated M for mentions of child abuse, some swearing and mild adult situations.

** The best practice is rereading the original books. The original 7 books are about ~1.1 million words total, so I think at this point I (and most other people here) have read anywhere from 20-50x more words of fanfiction than the original series. It's easy to forget bits and pieces of background detail and flavour. It's easy for simple things to get overblown i.e. Hermione is called "'Mione" once, by Ron, while he's eating. It's not a general use nickname. Or as you alluded to, Dumbledore never says "my boy" in canon, only says [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8jf2f2/til_dumbledore_never_even_once_said_my_boy_in/]["my dear boy" a grand total of 4 times.]] Capturing those elements of presentation and character, moreso than specific plot elements or story beats, really make your fanfic feel more like a "Harry Potter fanfiction."

Give your fic more than one round of editing. Not just spelling and grammar, think about character development and plot cohesion. Sometimes you'll write. But once it's published, it's out there for anyone to see.

Have a general plan in mind. Maybe you know the ending you want to write, or a few plot tidbits along the way. The level of originality is up to you, but don't stick too closely to the stations of canon (which've been done literally tens of thousands of times) and make an effort to have other new elements you introduce to the world feel like flavor that fits.

Don't rewrite first year if the changes you're interested in writing don't actually pop up until later years. There are vastly AU stories like Hogwarts Battle School that don't start until 3rd year, with a ton of AU background changes, and those are smoothly integrated into the story.

** I am not sure whether it was completely the very first, but it was certainly the one which persuaded me that it is possible to write fanfiction on the quality level of “normal” literature. linkao3(601124), even though it well deserves its “Mature” rating (no, not that much sex, yes, there is some, but reasonably so, but it is mostly about depression, PTSD, and there is some rather expressive description of child torture; all very well in the story, but harsh nevertheless).

** If I'm reading this correctly, it looks like you're the author of linkffn(13211229) - which I'm quite enjoying! Some notes, relevant to your fic and in general:

Be careful with the shift in dates, as you're likely on a different calendar than canon.

Don't forget your OC/RSS characters once you get to Hogwarts.

Outline, outline, outline. You'll thank yourself later.

You've done a good job of this so far, but be mindful of the character ages - lots of fics will have 11 year olds that sound 17. I'm guilty of this as well, a bit, and it's hard to avoid - but something worth considering.

Good luck with your fic!

** The best Harry Potter fanfiction in my opinion are stories that captures the wonder of the wizarding world. Don't are Magical Cores, Evil Dumbledore, ULtra Hadrian Potter. Severus is a misunderstood emo. Fact is these characters are what they are don't try to make them the second coming of Dumbledore, or something which they aren't like showing Snape as having compassion.

The best are those that show for example Hermione being smart, but having obvious flaws dealing with pressure situations. Or Harry not being book smart at all but just having a feel for certain types of magics but not being overpowered in using them. Ron with his character flaws laid bare. He is lazy but smart with issues relating to inferiority but very moral black and white view. The point is to show dimensions of the character but try to stay true to the wonder it the universe these characters occupy.
