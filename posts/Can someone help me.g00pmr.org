:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a fanfic where it is mentioned that the Basilisk was not evil, and that it did not hate muggle-born students. It was brainwashed by Tom Riddle. I do not remember the name of the fanfic, could anyone help me?


** Do you remember if the Basilisk was killed or not? Or if Harry befriended it/deprogrammed it from Riddle's brainwashing?

To the best of my recollections, it's been done a few times and I don't think I can find anything specific without a few more points to narrow the search. Apologies.

*** The Basilisk was still killed, but I think that it might be that one fic where Snape goes back in time at the point of his canon death and befriends Harry. He probably tells him about it.

**** Ah, okay. I'm not really a big Snape-centric fic reader, so I don't think I'll be able to help with that one then. Good luck with finding it!

  What would happen if magic was more than anyone realized. What if the creatures of the magical world could bestow gifts upon those that had earned their favor? Starts at the end of year two and will go on for as long as I want. Pairing at the moment will be H/Hr but may include more. Rated T for the moment but might go to M.
