I'm looking for fanfics that have Harry paired with female characters from the potterverse, or even just female versions of other characters, as smutty and as kinky as you like, but generally good stories are just as good.


** Blindness : Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry) Harry x Hermione

Harry Crow : What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete. Hermione x Harry

A Better Man : Vernon changed in the beginning to be a better man, thanks to a wish. How will this affect Harry, and the entire Wizarding World? Now complete. Harry x Ginny
