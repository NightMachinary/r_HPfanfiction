Hedwig is actually an Eldritch abomination that has become attached to a favourite mortal (Harry) out of fondness and boredom.

When Voldemort tries to get the Stone in Harry's first year, it's not Harry that confronts him, but a simple, white owl... that quickly becomes something with more eyes, feathers, beaks, and tentacles more than it is physically and realistically possible.

No-one can understand why the Dark Lord, especially his Death Eaters, becomes so fixated on "eliminating that bloody Owl-THing!" on his resurrection.

Meanwhile, Hedwig enjoys being fawned over and given bacon (best food the mortals ever invented!) by her little pet human and his attendants, the Ginger Nut and the Beaver Reaver.

Hmm, soul pieces on bacon!

** When Hedwig "dies" it pisses her off, and she transforms into her true form. Driving the Death Eaters chasing her human insane and dismembering quite a few.

Harry didn't see any of this, he is surprised when he arrives at Grimmauld Place to find Hedwig sitting on her perch, precking at him happily.

Harry decides to ignore that she was covered in blood and ... the fact she had teeth for a moment when she smiled at him.

No matter where they go, no matter where they hide, no matter if they stick together (blink and they're gone), there's always a death.

** "Prek"

​

"What do you want girl?" Harry asked, stroking her feathers

​

"F̻̌ͪ̐̌̀̀E̘ͦͬͦͧE̜̪̺̫͍̭̦ͯ͑ͬͤ͂D̖̝̱̥̯͇ ͚̪̖̦́̐̈ͬ͘M̗̦̳͉̮͕Ȩ̻ͤͫ̂͒ͥͨ ̝̼̬̼ͩ̿̇B̭͙͓͈̥͙̩ͮ͒ͭ͞A̜̔̈̈͂̍͗͘C͇͕̝̮̫̉ͤ͆͘O͇̜͇̩̿̈́̉ͥṄ̦̗͖̂͂̓, ͚̹̙͈̲͌ͦÑ̈͑̓͌̽ͥI̦̔͋ͤ̌̈C̞̮̉̒̑̈́͗͒͐͘ͅE̙͙͖̰̭̗̍͛ͧͧ͐ ̄́̊͒͌͌̋H̘̜ͩ͛U̶̞̠Mͯͭ̔̂͛̈́ͦ҉̗̭͕̲̺̮̺A̺̜̲ͩ̑͐̄͛̒̋͡ͅN̩͎̜̳̥̜"

​

Harry stared at Hedwig. Did he just hear...?

​

"Prek" the owl barked at him again. He shrugged it off as sleep deprivation and absentmindedly handed her a few pieces of bacon. She gobbled them up and leant into his hand as he scratched at that spot just behind her ear tufts. She started purring as usual.

*** "Mate, your owl is terrifying."

"What, Hedwig? She's a sweetheart!" Harry turned and rubbed her back affectionately. "Don't listen to him, girl."

Hedwig barked, and Ron swore that she was looking at him with a baleful eye.

The moment Harry turned his back, Hedwig turned her head a full three-sixty degrees and stared at him dead in the eye.

"There, you see!" Ron pointed and waved. "She just turned her head all the way around!"

"Ron," Hermione said, clearly exasperated, "owls do that all the time."

"...Oh."

...Was Hedwig laughing at him? Or was she trying to vomit up a bit of dodgy bacon?

***** Jeconais has an excellent fic called Matryoshka Vignettes, which is a sequel to his other excellent fic Perfect Situations. MV is basically the fallout of PS, as told by about 15 different characters. One chapter, guest written by Crys, is from Fawkes's perspective and is probably my favorite of this genre. Highly recommend reading both, in order or else most of it won't make sense
