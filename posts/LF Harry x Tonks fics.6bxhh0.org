  His fight finished, his enemies dead, Harry Potter expects to move on from a life of conflict and pain. Either to the peace of oblivion, or to the embrace of those already fallen to Riddle's army. But fate does not have such a happy ending in store for our protagonist, and he arrives in another world to be found, covered in blood, by a familiar face.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

***** Have to rule out the former then too. As much as I enjoy it, it has a lot of "instant close" triggers for some people. Metamorph Harry (that is never really taken advantage of), Tonks "base form" stuff, Lord Harry sudden teenage expert in politics, silly exponential power curve, and so on.

Renegade Cause has a good many fans. I'm not one of them because I think it is far too long and a lot of the mind-altering magic stuff falls under the same /no/ category as fics with sexual assault as a major plot point. I prefer not to think about just how absolutely terrifying a world with such easy mental manipulation is.

Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for.
