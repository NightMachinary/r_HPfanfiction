Don't gotta upvote, don't gotta downvote. People here love Hermione with a fire.

I'm not going to spend this space talking about why I don't like Hermione, or why /you/ shouldn't like Hermione. That's your choice. Hermione is a strong, forward-minded woman, and I respect your opinion.

I just want to let you know that I want Hermione-bashing in a fanfic. No Harry forgives her later. No Hermione-redemption. Just some Hermione is bad. Maybe she realizes it later, but she can't change. Just no redemption arc.

I always prefer long fanfics, but anything is appreciated, especially since many people don't read this sort of stuff. If there's Weasley bashing, then that's fine! Molly-bashing Ron-Bashing and Ginny-Bashing especially. You know, if there's both Ginny and Hermione bashing, then that. is. heaven. sent.

I am fine with cliches like WBWL or Azkaban. If Harry isn't friends with her in the first place, just shuts her down, along with Ron, then that's just amazing. But because I doubt there's anything like that, I won't explicitly ask for it.

ANYTHING would be amazing. Honestly. I appreciate any correspondence. If somebody just wants to talk about Hermione-bashing, but doesn't have any recs, that be okay too! Thanks.


** I think there's a difference between bashing a character in a fic for fun and to explore new concepts, and bashing a character because that's what you truly believe they are like, inside and outside of a fic. I don't care much about Hermione either way. I like stories where she's a villain, an antihero, a talented genius, on the spectrum - etc etc. What annoys me is when people become so wrapped up in their belief of who a character is - amazing Hermione, horrible Hermione, etc - that they're unable to ever see the character differently, no matter the story.

** I love a good bashing fic. I don't even have a preference for who gets bashed, honestly; if it's well written and compelling then I'm down for it! That being said, a good fic that isn't quite Hermione bashing, but definitely a "Hermione isn't infallible and faces consequences like anyone else would in the real world" type story that I love is golden bullets.

I'm going to follow this because bashing fics are my guilty/not so guilty pleasure.

Edited to fix the link... I hope lol

*** That fanfic is so weird and nonsensical. It bashes canon Hermione for not taking opportunities that are only available in this AU. When was it said that bluebell flames indicated an affinity for flames? Why would Sleekeazy's exist if every schoolgirl knew about a charm that would fix her hair? Hermione was also the first person to ever get a time turner, but this fanfic has many people receiving it.

Don't vote-manipulate, ask for votes (that includes asking people to /abstain/ from voting), or complain about votes you are or are not getting on a post (which also includes telling people to abstain from voting your post down).
