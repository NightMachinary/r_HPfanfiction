** I think you've got it slightly wrong. At the start of the first book Harry was very keen. He read his books and couldn't wait to get started. He then learnt that Hogwarts was a school and schools can be boring.

Magic seems amazing but what can you actually do with it? Harry Potter witches and wizards aren't Gandalf, they're normal people doing normal things but with magic making things easier. We can all dream of how fantastic magic would be but what would you do with it? The first week you'd be doing lots of cool shit to amuse yourself but after that it just becomes part of your life and you end up living a normal life but with magic optimizing bits.

The majority of adult witches and wizards aren't roaming godlike mages pursing personal projects, they're civil servants. Harry Potter children are just school children and spend more of their time with magic messing about not studying because studying is boring.

*** Yes, but I think most people would learn a lot of extracurricular spells, even if it was just household stuff. Because at the end of the day, waving your wand around is still much faster and easy than using a duster or a broom. Or the spell to fold clothing. Or animating stuff to automate your kitchen tools.

And that's not even mentioning spells you learn for fun.

**** I would have read all my books and I would be very excited, like Harry was. I would dream of being the greatest wizard ever, of changing the world. Then I would discover it was hard work and I wouldn't be able to do anything exciting for years. Then I would get used to being around magic and like anyone else I'd start to grumble about other things like homework, getting up in the morning etc. There is a big difference between expectation and reality and reality has a way of disappointing. I don't care how excited about magic I was over the summer holiday come a cold wet Monday morning in January when it's dark outside and everything is miserable, all I would want to do is curl up in my nice warm bed.

Having a bit of a grumble and losing interest is basically universal. You take what you have for granted and complain about everything else. I don't think it would take long for me to take magic for granted when everyone else has it around me. I'd like to say that I would be happy every day just to have magic but I don't think every day how lucky I am to have a warm roof over my head and food in the fridge at home. Maybe I should but I don't, I do however sometimes grumble that I can't be arsed to cook or that the weather outside looks shit even when I don't have to go out in it. Maybe that makes be a bad, overly privileged person but in my experience and talking with other people it's normal. It's why self-discipline is so important. Life has a way of making special seem normal.

******** Ok, you're gonna have to open your mind. We have so much magic that we treat it as mundane or boring because we're used to it. Why dont people absolutely marvel in the wonders of our technologies? It's astoundingly amazing and essentially magic in the same vein as the HP universe: it has rules, we have to learn it, it takes a very long time to get good at it, and it's built off the shoulders of giants!

We can fly, but still it's not enough! We can move around in cars and motorcycles, either gas or electric, essentially teleportation! But it's not good enough! We have preserving charms for our food, nutritional and flavor charms, too. We can predict the weather, and sometimes control it! We have almost all the knowledge of the world in our pocket, and we can converse with almost anyone, almost anywhere in the world in real time!

And it's still not good enough.

It all about changing your perspective. We all know that if we studied super hard, we could focus on one specific topic and move mountains, but instead, most of us just want to dick around reading silly stories and playing games. Just like the boys at Hogwarts!

********* cars are not "essentially teleportation". That's like saying walking up the mount everest is like being flown across the country in an F22

The problem with your comparison is that all these things are

1. Mortally expensive

2. Completely unuseable on a small scale

3. one big patchjob

For instance, let's go back to the teleportation example. Apparition strikes me as the most useful skill known to wizards, by far.

Comparing it to cars or motorcycles or whatever is a lost cause, because it is better than those in all aspects - no need to buy a car that costs 10+ grand, no need to control said death implement as it barrels down the concrete strips, no accidents or horrific injuries as the metal components of said implement are driven through your body, and most of all, no travel time. We don't even know if it requires a wand or not.

You just turn in place, and then you're there. That's literally the best method of travel in existence. Saying that driving a 1 ton steel coffin down a narrow strip of concrete, stuck behind people who drive the same coffin but slower, is so indescribably different I can't put it into words.

The perspective shift you're attempting doesn't work, because magic isn't like technology. You can't compare things with similar function when they're accomplished so radically different. Magic comes from within, limited only by your imagination, but technology is big, cumbersome and beyond the means of most. The radical technology you're thinking of is unuseable by me - I can't buy a car for 200k, I can't take a plane from my home to my uni, but I could totally apparate there or fly a broom to solve both problems.

Magic is just... better, and there's no discussion about it. If I knew I had the power to directly alter the world using nothing but my imagination and a stick (notice how I said /directly/, technology or science is not) I would do my damndest to learn everything I could about it.

********** I think you need to reread the series, and like, all the fanfiction, too!

Magic in the HP universe is treated very similarly to technology: it has rules, it starts of with simple spells (like simple machines) built up to larger and larger constructions.

The original question was "why aren't all the kids super excited to do magic?" Well, the answer is the same reason kids in real life aren't super excited to learn math. Math is the basic building block that allows humanity to accomplish everything humanity has accomplished! Yet some children aren't at all excited about it.

The magic in the Harry Potter universe is shown to be a little boring to learn (lift a feather? How banal!), difficult to perform well, predicated by ridiculous amounts of wealth (pretty much all the kids at a prestigious boarding school are loaded and if they are poor, they perform magic worse), and sometimes painful, sickening and potentially injurious (portkeys and apparition are described in awful detail, and apparition can result in splinching). And in canon, magic can only be performed with a wand (a tool).

I can levitate myself by building and sitting in a chair, I can apparate myself by taking a bus, I can create electricity by mixing a metal and a liquid. The only difference between Harry Potter's magic and the real world is the factor of time. And if it takes years to become proficient at a time-saving piece of magic, how much time will you end up saving in the long run?

Also, do you know about Arthur C. Clarke's three laws for science fiction writing? It might not be super appropriate for the HP universe, but it's certainly an interesting way to think about both our world and fictional ones:

1. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.

2. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.

3. Any sufficiently advanced [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology][technology]] is indistinguishable from [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)][magic]].

*** Honestly I think this is the real issue. The only times in the series that we are shown or told about Harry learning something about magic through his own initiative after meeting Hermione are the Patronus Charm and the Half Blood Princes book.

JK decided that from a literary standpoint she preferred to have Hermione come out of the blue with the solution/idea/new information about magic. Eg Nicholas Flamel, Jinxes, bluebell flames, alohamora, polyjuice, basilisk, etc. And that's just some of what she brings as exposition and plot drive to the first two books. Maybe it was her self insert idealization of Hermione that made her write that way, maybe she hated writing scenes where Harry read a book and learned something relevant to the plot, maybe she was just really bad at writing exposition of that type and had to rely on Hermione and Dumbledore as crutches.

No matter what the reason for the decision was, in my opinion it was a literary decision to give Hermione that role not a characterization decision, and the affect it had on the characterization of Harry is real and a valid thing to find irritating.

In fact, I suspect that most people who /think/ that they would react more like Hermione are in fact wrong: they are overestimating their ambitiousness, perseverance, and curiosity and underestimating their distractability and ability to get bored.

Harry's reaction is normal: what was extraordinary quickly becomes mundane; learning magic turns out to be a lot of hard work, including repetitive practice, reading books, and writing essays; and while magic offers more opportunities, it also offers more distractions. Many lessons feel pointless in immediate terms (like "matchsticks into needles").

Hermione's the weirdo who reads nonfiction books for fun and learns spells even if she doesn't anticipate having an immediate use for them (and we love her for it). Harry and Ron are the normal people. In fact, other Muggleborns aren't shown being any more magically ambitious than Harry and Ron.

** Disjointed rant warning!

I think it's easy to explain why a normal kid wouldn't be all that excited beyond the first few weeks. Let's take this class by class.

Astronomy - “How is this magic?”

Charms - “Can we stop the theory and get to spells already?”

Defence - Spotty teachers.

Herbology - It's just gardening.

History - Binns.

Potions - Snape.

Transfiguration - Like charms, but also very difficult.

Arithmancy - Poorly advertised.

Creatures - /Sometimes/ cool.

Divination - You need to be a seer to get anything out of it.

Muggles - Useless if Muggleborn.

Runes - Same as Arithmancy.

Your promised to be learning magic, but you never really have any good magic classes. The only ones that teach spells are Charms, Defence and Transfiguration, but they all have problems that make it less appealing to an eleven year old kid.

And after you've been hitting the books for most your lessons, would the average kid really want to go through even more to find a spell that might be interesting?

Even then, you're discouraged from doing so unless you have someone to correct your mistakes, otherwise you end up blowing something up. (See Seamus and the water to rum.)

And when asking someone to help you out, you can't ask peers since they wouldn't know either, (unless it's Hermione,) you can't ask the upperclassmen since they wouldn't care, and you can't the teachers since they're all busy with the other 239 students they have to teach.

Harry, has been conditioned to “not ask questions” all his life. While he'll ask a question when it's just him and his teacher, he won't if he's in a classroom, not will he actively search out answers from a teacher unless he /needs/ to.

TL;DR School makes things less exciting, and Harry isn't used to being independent and asking for help.

** Except BOTH Harry's and Ron's laziness is a pure fanon. Yes, they were more lazy than Hermione, but everybody was. Looking at their OWL's (remember, number of OWL's achieved counts number of exams you PASSED, even A would be good), they were quite successful and dedicated students. Yes, perhaps they were nagged to it by Hermione, but nowhere in canon it says they were unsuccessful or average students comparing to the rest of Hogwarts, not only to Hermione.

** Not really. In terms of real life and what we see in canon, you have an 11 year old boy where at that age, most aren't super academically inclined. You're not going to find many nerds or geeks who are willing to put in the work because like [[/u/turbinicarpus]] and [[/u/FavChanger]] most of them will eventually see it as a school and it's not as easy as you're predicting (IMO).

Canonically we know for instance that many wizards can not cast a reliable shield charm and that Felix Felicis is a tough potion to brew. Even polyjuice takes a month. The point is, most children and adults won't have the motivation to do that.

** I think a lot of people forgot that Hogwarts is still a school and magic is /hard/. These kids are assigned a lot of theory and essay writing (way more than when I was 11), and it takes hours of repetitive work to learn a spell.

Add onto that that there's like 3 actual magic classes: Charms (great), Transfiguration (super hard, and McGonagall is strict), and DADA (either really good or really bad).

These kids have pretty crazy workloads, and Harry has Oliver Wood's nightmare practice schedules to deal with too. Is it any wonder he wants to spend his free time playing chess, instead of researching and practicing new spells?

(As an analogy, how many people say they'll learn an instrument or a new language, and then never do?)

He never mentioned his desire to visit his parents' graves (until DH), to learn about their time in school, the war, their friends. He never bothered to learn his family's history on his father's side; as purebloods, there would certainly be some information even if it's genealogy only. An orphan would at least express the desire to find out about family, but /nooo/ it's not relevant to the plot.

Or my favorite one- You can't cast a spell by just knowing theory, you have to practice it. That was the point of DA. Next year Harry cast /septumsceptra/ without knowing any theory, wand movement or exact prononciation. But why bother we have to raise sympathy for Draco so let's do it.

My personal suspicion, though, is that he never really thinks ahead to his adult life (as many young people don't, not in terms of all practicalities) particularly because I don't think he truly believes he will survive/defeat Voldemort.

** Given how worshiped superpowers and superhumans of any kind are throughout literature/movies/cartoons/video games it is absolutely incomprehensible to me how any Muggleborn wouldnt become obsessively fascinated by Magic and study it from the moment they wake up. Especially at such a tender and impressionable age. I can only take suspension of disbelief so far before it snaps, guys.

​

Look at us here for a perfect proof, this is all fantasy and we already are so invested and knowledgeable about it. Are we to believe that a Muggleborn studying actual, real Magic would just treat it like regular school? Nah, bro. It's crazy enough as it is, but when you consider Harry, with all the crap he has to deal with in his life, it's downright infuriating.

​

As for Ron, the kid grew up with his older brother being a sort of action hero Indiana Jones working for Goblins, his other brother a *DRAGON* tamer, two more twins being magical geniuses and a household that uses Magic for essentially everything. It's no freaking wonder he gets bored learning how to levitate a feather.

*** I think it's different chatting theory about it, to being in a school where most of the books are ancient and almost illegible. Or at the very least have not been written by someone with teaching qualifications, not least because not even the teachers need to know how to teach. (I know this parallels independent schools, but at least they get the best in.)

I see it as being quite similar to how excited I was about going to secondary school. So many fantastic clubs, opportunities to care for the school animals (being in London meant that farm animals were hard to come by) and best of all D&T and Chemistry. See, when I'd been to school open days/school transition the science experiments and bunsen burners were absolutely fascinating. In D&T we built a floating wooden boat.

Then when I got to school, it turned out that using a bunsen burner happened once a term, if that, with a smattering of non-burning tasks thrown in. Worse, the longer I was in school, the fewer actual praticals we did (even if those practicals were better). Everything involved planning, paperwork and 95% of it was dull.

** JKR should have made Harry the Practical version of Hermione... kind of like he was before the 3rd task in GOF. "MUST LEARN EVERY SPELL POSSIBLE. FUCK THEORY IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP. SPELLS DAMN IT!" and have Harry know all of the spells up til NEWT level by the end of Book 4 and learns to Silent Cast... casting his first spell Silently in the Graveyard, and learning how to do it during 5th year, and trying to teach the DA how to silent cast, but when asked the Theory, he has no fucking clue, and only learns the Theory for OWL/NEWT.

That's how any real kid would be if we suddenly regressed to 11 and went to a School of Magic. We'd be like "Fuck the Theory, Lets learn some Magic!" and learn literally every spell possible, even if it's a spell to cut your dinner up for you and seems lazy as fuck, it's like "Yeah, Magic!" rather than "Oh, Monotony"

Hermione should have also been less of an obsessed nutbag at times (Book 3 makes her seem like a learning obsessed psycho. A Muggleborn taking Muggle studies. A skeptic taking Divination) she should have taken certain subjects OWLs early. Muggle studies she could have taken the OWL/NEWT in 3rd year. History of Magic she could have self studied and graduated earlier, same for Astronomy. (Canon Runes is boring as shit. It's just learning a language, and not doing anything cool like carving an Ansuz onto something and watching it burn. It's why I like Fanfiction Runes that end up writing it similar to how Runes work in the Nasuverse)

*** I think it absolutely serves the plot and possibly he does more things outside of what JKR could fit in. It is an adventure story for children, after all.

I also think a core issue is that he doesn't really understand the textbooks he's got. Although the classes teach the children equally, it doesn't appear that the books are actually written for children with very little exposure to the magical words. The books they initially get should be explaining what terms were, but actually they're just minor edits of books that were already secondhand when his father was in school.

Most people lose interest in reading books if the books are stuffy and poorly written - outdated English, lack of glossaries.

I liked school, enjoyed all my subjects but literally nothing has carried over into adulthood like your love of art. It's great that you have it, but it doesn't mean everyone does.

Also, excusing the fact that a smarter Harry would have decimated the plot (I think JKR even wrote once that she had to drag out what Harry new about the magical world and his parents for plot) - I'm not convinced Harry's prescription on his glasses is correct. It might be that he can barely read or gets eye strain when reading too long.

For example, Harry is a Gryffindor, and he is motivated and interested in -doing things- and taking action. In the books he is very motivated when he sees purpose to what he is learning, especially to further his current goals. Unlike possibly a typical Ravenclaw, he might not be so interested in learning for learning's sake and gaining general knowledge. School can be boring and some of the teachers just weren't so great. Instead of catching up with books and experiments, Harry was up to other things, including mischief.
