I want a funny story where Draco tries to be Harry's enemy, but through some kind of manipulation or just shrugging off the mean words he ends up being Harry's best friend, despite not having any idea how it happened. That seems like a hilarious story.


** Linkffn(oh god not again) kinda and linkffn(harry the hufflepuff by bajab) kinda.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
