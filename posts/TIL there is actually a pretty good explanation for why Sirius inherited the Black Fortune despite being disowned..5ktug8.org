*** Technically not the same thing. An entail/fee tail is a type of trust and as such its terms are whatever the settlor of that trust desires. If you wanted to, you could write a fee tail that always went to a person's second cousin.

Or at least, you used to be able to. Fee tails are no longer possible under English law, having been abolished as a legal estate along with a large number of other modes of property ownership in a modernisation drive in 1925, before being finally finished off in 1996.

**** Well, do consider this: Sirius was disowned, with what they knew of inheritance rights and stuff it would all go to Regulus that way and he was “of the right sort” due to being a Death Eater.

Orion died in the same yeah Regulus has, so it is possible that he simply did not have time to write a will once it became necessary, and Walburga ... well, we do not /truly/ know her, but we do know that paintings are impressions, even if flat impressions, of actual people and her painting left much to be desired as far as sensibility goes from which we could assume that so did Walburga.

Heck, Orion /might have had/ a will, one that he kept at home because obviously the Black home was oh-so-splendidly-defended so it was better than Gringotts (I am trying to be sarcastic here, in case it wasn't good enough to notice) that Walburga simply kind of forgot about due to not thinking straight after his and Regulus's death in less than a year.

**** They're kinda mutually exclusive in that in an entail situation, you cannot change the destination of the property upon your death by a will. Your interest in the property in question is a "life interest" rather than full legal title and therefore you do not have full control over what happens to that property.

The point I was making was that "disowning" someone doesn't really mean anything, legally speaking. Telling someone that they are disowned and blasting their name off your family tree has no legal effect. The only way to disown someone legally is to write a will that excludes them from inheriting your property. If Sirius' parents did not have a will then he would inherit by the normal laws of administration of estates.

****** I don't think you have fully understood the OP.

An entail (or fee tail) is a type of property ownership where the original owner dictates how the property will be inherited. The people who inherit the property, although they "own" the property in all important senses, do not have the right to change the terms under which the property is inherited. If the Black estate were a fee tail estate then Sirius' parents would have no say over who inherited it when they died. It would simply pass to whomever the original fee tail terms stated was next in line.

This is incompatible with Sirius' parents deciding who would inherit the Black estate in their own last will and testament. To pass something on in a will you must first have the legal right to do so. They would not have this legal right with respect to any property under a fee tail.

This is why I said that the two solutions to how Sirius inherited the estate are incompatible. Either the estate is under a fee tail, meaning Sirius' parents didn't have a say in who got the estate, or they did have the right to say who inherited the estate (meaning they owned it as a fee simple, i.e. in their own right) and simply chose not to/forgot to write Sirius out of his inheritance by failing to either update their wills or write one in the first place.

******* Which basically means that there is no worth in the will when there is an entail, which is the part I'd concentrated on when I'd been replying.

So it is not that I did not understand the OP fully, but rather that you took it as “they didn't write a will [because the forgot or something but the should have written one]” whereas I took it as “they didn't write a will [for whatever possible reason, with some of those reasons (such as the entail) possibly making wills worthless]” which could count as both (no will, and entail in effect) and is what I meant in my first reply despite not being what you meant.

That said, there also is the possibility of it being in entail and Walburga not knowing about that for some reason (or being too out of it in her later years to truly understand it) and writing a will despite it being of absolutely no worth. This I believe can give meaning to the “both” possibility as with someone who could possibly write a will that isn't worth anything the possibility of there not being a will because it wouldn't be worth anything, despite being functionally identical, is a separate one.

So that is that. If you want to further insist that I don't get it then please stop and let us not argue semantics because I am afraid it could go in that direction and it probably wouldn't be constructive (pretty please; I am not trying to insult you here, in case I somehow made it unclear).

***** I think it would be able to go to Regulus or any of his descendants, but in order to go from Sirius to Draco the inheritance would first have to go upstream. Draco is the son of a female cousin, which means the property would pass back to Sirius's uncle's line, rather than his own direct family line. Draco is on a different branch of the family tree, while in P&P the father passed it down to his brother's son.

***** Yes but I believe that Narcissa's branch is a different branch from Sirius, they are only cousins, this combined with the fact that Draco is only maternally a Black this may make him a last resort.

***** Depending on the exact law the direct line could spread to the side in case of a lack of the prior owner having no male descendant simply for as long as that other possible inheritor is male (and related closely enough), or only if the line is connected by males. And there is also the issue of the distance as, again depending on the exact law, the direct line can potentially only go back so far

With the Black family being really patriarchal in that regard, and with Draco being a son of a daughter of Sirius's brother's uncle, there is both quite some distance and the potential to break the line due to Narcissa being female, and as such it would not surprise me if Draco was not considered to be part of the direct line.

Considering the example in Pride and Prejudice, there's minimal distance from the main line (brother's son, so just one sideways) and there's also an unbroken male line, whereas here there is quite some distance (a step back, then sideways, then forward; it's practically a dance on the inheritance floor) and the maleness of Narcissa is highly in question.

*** Depending on whether he subscribes to the old inheritance laws (the same ones that the Blacks subscribed to), he might potentially be able to do that (if he didn't) or he might first have to kill Draco without incriminating himself.

That said, as the exact laws are not known and we have no idea if the Malfoys subscribe to those we don't really know, and in the same vein there might or might not be loopholes of the kind [[/u/Conneron][u/Conneron]] wrote about. If you need it for a fic, check the British inheritance laws in the 16th and 17th Century and also a bit more in both directions as those laws do seem to at least somewhat be based on that, but really there's a fairly high chance that if Lucius wished to do something like that he could have (heck, in all likelihood he could simply give him so-and-so-much money as “posthumous payment for services” and the most Draco could do would be get purple unless he had proof of this being a hoax).
