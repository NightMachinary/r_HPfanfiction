*** It is considered that the spell failed. It did work, but it did not work fully/correctly, because Harry used the wrong hatred.

**** Plot hole that leads to a magical theory that's not supported by any of the previous theories told in series. Before this thing it was always said that magic was rigid and you have to perform specific motions and wand movements for spells and this things tells magic is intention based.

****** You have to like yell incantation at your max lung capacity.

BTW it's a charm, not a spell.

Even then happy memory is just a trigger. Rest is dependent on using power (Suggesting different wizards have different levels of magical power). This was plot hole of it's own kind. Some people thoguht that may be magical power was store based. Wizards have magical reserves in body and they get tired after using particular amount of magical reserve (HP was drained after using power Patrnous).

Anyway to the main point: Patronus wasn't intent based spell. It's not even a spell. It's a charm that require incantation and a trigger (happy memory).

Harry Potter: "And how do you conjure it?" Remus Lupin: "With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory." --- Harry and Lupin discussing how to conjure a Patronus

******* Spell is in my understanding anything that comes out of your wand.

A transfiguration spell, Avada Kedavra, even Wingardium Leviosa.

And the patronus charm demonstrates that your state of mind can be relevant for magic, and that it's not only waving your wands and saying words.

Silent Magic is another example where what you think influences the magic, further weakening the "Words + Movement"-Theory.

******* Well, first of all charms, curses and jinx and what not, are all spells. Secondly Lupins quote "With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory" also applies to cruciatus for example. You use the incantation and concentrate with all your might on inflicting pain and enjoying it. The main difference seems to be the emotions used and the fact that patronus is cast and forget while cruciatus requires you to maintain it actively. And while i agree rowling wrote alot of plot holes, in my opinion this isn#t one of them.

***** Not quite. Fake Moody said the class could all perform the killing curse on him and he'd only get a nosebleed which does imply intent needed in casting.

***** After the fifth book, and towards the fifth book's end, J.K. Rowling said Fuck established canon, and made things up as she went along. Naturally, they made no sense what so ever.
