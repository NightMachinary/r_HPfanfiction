I am an American. I was born in the South in the mid-90's. I have spent a grand total of 120 hours on British soil, and at least 12 of those hours were spent on a bus, in an airport, or in a train station. Aside from Harry Potter, the /only/ media I've ever seen from the UK is /Doctor Who/ and /The Great British Baking Show/.

And, considering that 5/6 of the people that read my stories on FFN are also from the USA, I'm willing to wager that a hell of a lot of people on this subreddit are very similar to me in demographics.

Why do I bring this all up? Dialects.

*I DON'T SPEAK ANY FORM OF UK ENGLISH.* Not British English, not Scottish English, not Welsh English, and not Irish English. And, I especially don't speak a version of those dialects that's now nearly thirty years out of date, what with linguistic drift and all.

Why do I bring this up? Because I have seen a lot of people on this subreddit harping on people for their word choice (i.e. "Britpicking" them). I /do not know/ how to talk like an authentic British person. Sprinkling words here or there that I've picked up is, mechanically speaking, no different than someone in the /Naruto/ fandom writing, "I'm going to use the /Kagebunshin no Jutsu/ to defeat him!"

Either it's a slap-dash hodgepodge of words from one language/dialect sprinkled into a narrative written in the other, or not at all. If you're demanding that I should write in The Queen's English for Harry potter, should I not also write in fluent Japanese for Naruto? Or, heaven forbid, should I write in one of Tolkein's many constructed languages for writing /Lord of the Rings/ fiction?

My point is, word choice shouldn't be something that should be picked on. If the story is intelligible and engaging to it's intended audience and can be written with enough ease that it doesn't stifle the author, shouldn't that be enough? Its not something I, or most other American authors, would be able to fix perfectly without months or years of exposure to the language of 90's British schoolchildren.

So, politely, I ask that you all stop nitpicking the consequences of linguistic drift. Anything else about a story is entirely fair game, but criticizing authors for their use of whichever version of English their parents taught them is unfair. After all, it'd be almost as rude to criticize a muggleborn for not being born to wizarding parents.


** While I agree with the OPs sentiment, as a Brit, I find words like ‘sidewalk' and ‘mom' jarring. Maybe I'm just being fussy but I find it breaks the immersion of the story for me.

** I understand your point of view. However, as a British reader, I am always going to find Americanisms in HP fanfic as jarring as I would cultural or language imports from any other world culture.

So much media (films, tv and books) we consume in the U.K. originated in the US. It's the same language, so it's expected to mean the same thing. When we got an amazingly popular book and film series that were British, used British language, culture, even actors, and were being consumed all over the world, that was really awesome. So yeah, when you see Americanisms (and it really does tend to only be Americanisms and not other cultures that crop up) it jars really badly.

None of that means US writers shouldn't write HP fic, but taking a bit of constructive criticism on things that just wouldn't happen in the U.K. is appreciated. We're not asking you to use British spellings and grammar in your writing, just try to avoid the pancakes for breakfast, thanksgiving dinners, paying for healthcare....

Also, I've been called on Britishism in American based fandom writings (and been accused of being a non-native English speaker, as though other forms of English don't exist) - but if I get something wrong, I'm happy to adapt it. I don't get why the same consideration can't be given the other way, and it feels a bit like US exceptionalism sometimes.

*** Aye, but frequently the feedback is given in a hostile or patronizing way. I have a British friend that looks over my chapters before I post them to catch the obvious things I missed, and it's really helped me learn about the differences in language and culture. That said, doing a lot of research and getting someone to check for regionalisms is a bit unfair to expect of an unpaid and amateur writer. It's certainly a good thing if you see it, and it's absolutely fair to expect professional writers to spend the extra effort.

What would be really nice is if there were good and comprehensive resources available to amateur non-British authors. When I do my research, it's by doing a lot of googling and trawling through shitty website after shitty website to try and find how things actually are in Britain. And sometimes, as with the school system post I made on this subreddit a while back, I still miss the mark, even after /days/ of research.

**** So, you're never going to get everything right. Absolutely not. I mean, Im from Scotland and our school system is completely different to England's, as is our legal system, so even I have to check stuff for England. And things like that change over time, so writing a Marauders fic even Brits are checking dates different things applied - and that's practically no time in a country that's had researchable culture since before the Roman occupation.

It's too much to expect someone who has never lived in the U.K. to know regional differences. We don't even all know the various regional differences, as is shown on almost every Brit picking thread ever. And anyone being an outright prick doesn't deserve you caring about their opinion, although beware of falling into the trap of taking a typed comment as being rude because you can't hear tone and it's being critical - I do this a lot and it's why I hate texting, and quickly written reviews and comments can definitely do that (and I've had someone apologise when I wrote a reply back to them about it once so it really isn't always meant). But in general, don't listen to someone who is being a knobend.

However, I'd also say if you don't know and can't research the regional differences, don't try writing regional differences and instead gloss over it - it's much more jarring to get those things wrong than just to /not/ try and write a Manc backstory for Snape for example. A Brit calling you out for not recognising Snape is a Manc is being a douche - but writing in detail about a specific region you have no experience of, without a good reference and getting cross with Brits for finding it off putting is another story.

A lot of Brits (myself included) are happy to Brit pick. If you would like the help, but don't have one already and don't know where to ask, then put an A/N at the start of your story that you'd appreciate the help if someone wants to give it. Also, this sub is full of Brits who will comment on a thread asking for help with Britishisms or British culture. Just ask, we like to help and it's lovely having people try to engage with our culture.

Unfortunately, before HP the prevailing attitude was that modern British culture wasn't that cool and nobody cared overly much outside of the U.K. - if you were going to consume English language media outside of the U.K., it would be American. This leads to the double whammy of there being very little easily available guidance for non-Brits setting their writing in the U.K., but also a U.K. audience that feels very prickly about one of their biggest modern cultural exports being Americanised.

** As an American, reading an HP fic, would you find it strange if characters used Japanese terminology such as referring to Professor Snape as "Snape-san"? Would you find it odd if all the characters refused to eat beef, as in India? Would your immersion be broken if the characters periodically interrupted their day to pray towards Mecca?

I suspect you would. In which case: why should American cultural references and language be treated exceptionally?

There's no real difference in principle between "Snape-san" and pancakes for breakfast. Unfortunately, if you want to write about a place in a way that comes across as authentic rather than immersion-breaking, you /do/ need to know something about that place. If you just impose the language and customs of your own culture on a foreign place when you write about it, then anyone who /does/ know about that place will find it off-putting.

*** I definitely prefer the work to feel British, but have rarely found benign non-British details to break my immersion to the point that it counts against the work. However, the author has to accept that the reader will know the author is not natively British. If someone cracks out pancakes for breakfast and eats ‘biscuits' with their gravy I immediately perceive the author as an American.

There's also a question of degree. For example, I would see a prom or thanksgiving chapter as an author's fancy, and would likely skim these sections. Pancakes for breakfast, on the other hand, just wouldn't rise to the level of immersion frustration. Non-British details will only break immersion to the degree that the reader is familiar with British culture, and I wonder if this is the reason why this topic is often polarising, especially with the work being a massive international export.

However, I'm writing all of this as a kiwi, so I won't be as attached to the Britishness of the work compared to a Brit like yourself. I'm also a recent arrival to the fandom because of my age, so I'm always interested to read about the perspectives of longer-time fans like you.

**** The funny thing is that the average story quality in the fandom would likely rise significantly if people were more willing to just abandon telling stories in Britain and start telling original stories, set within the HP universe but within their home countries, with authentic cultural references, original worldbuilding, new characters and plots.

Imagine if, instead of having 100,000 cookie-cutter indy!Harry fics where Harry inherits a ton of titles, becomes a super wizard, then still gets knocked out by Pettigrew in the graveyard to keep the story on canon rails, we had 100,000 original stories set in America, India, Turkey, Egypt, China, Greece, Norway, Japan... all of them telling the stories of new characters, with interesting worldbuilding and novel plots.

Sure, most of them would still be badly written. But at least there would be variety.

***** Preach it, brother, preach it!

The question is the language. I am a Czech, and there is the fanfiction writers community around the server [[http://budec.net/]], which created the idea of the Czech magical school [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District][at Budeč]]) (which is truly magical place, even as Muggle I see it), but most of stories are in Czech. I was trying to write to that community, but Czech fanfiction community is so small (and overflown with Drarry, and teenage trash), that it feels like writing just for myself. So, now most of what I do is in English and in Britain, but you are right, that is not right either. Grrr. I just so wish life was easy!

Exploring different magical countries and polities could lead to some brilliant stories. I'd add one proviso, though: I think such stories need to keep one foot in the known world. JKR was wise enough to keep a few common elements with the prequel films and it would be a very courageous writer who tried to do something totally new while still claiming to be a Harry Potter writer.

*** There should be attempts at authenticity, but I'm curious as to know if that's whats leading to the whole Victorian era/nobility related tropes. Simply because its the easiest frame of reference for worldbuilding.

[[https://professormcguire.tumblr.com/post/165200382179/slytherin-and-eton-a-primer-on-the-british-school][This piece on Slytherin/UK public schools comparison]] showcases the worldbuilding Rowling put into the series highlighting classism. Trying to emulate this form of worldbuilding is gonna be challenging given the intracacies of classism in the UK, hence the attempts of a magical Victorian world.

Another example is how Aurors are depicted as police, given how there was another post on how common it was to have Aurors as police in fics. It could simply be that its easier to depict them as police given the number of police procedural shows and go from there. If someone wanted to depict Aurors as magical British special forces thats more research. Hell, making Aurors as magical British SF isn't possible if we're trying to be accurate, given that the SAS(or any UKSF unit) doesn't recruit from the civilian population whereas Aurors go straight from Hogwarts to selection, given that the magical world doesn't have a military. Which seems nitpicky as hell as an observation, but so is getting irritated at the word "prank" in fics imo.

I can confirm that the combination is utterly delicious and if any Brit finds him- or herself in a situation where it's on offer, they should try it.

** I've always said that the heated way that dialect is treated in this fandom is detrimental to the good spirit of it. This is, after all, a hobby that people volunteer many of their own hours on, for no profit, for the enjoyment of others.

I've seen Australianisms, American terms, and British phrases that are very isolated and obscure - and the main thing that has done for me? Is taught me a fair bit about dialects around the world. Other dialects don't hurt me, I usually understand the spirit of where the author is going and it doesn't upset me that they are not writing in the exact dialect of JKR. It's a cultural phenomena of this fandom, and I cope with it by complying with British English where known but ignore people verbalising irritation if I don't get it a hundred percent. I'm from New Zealand - we were colonised by Britain and have a dialect very similar to British English, but some of it didn't stick so there are times when I don't catch NZisms. It happens.

I encourage you to ignore people treating language this way in the fandom when they give their unsolicited comments on your work, and ignore posted content that makes similar complaints on platforms. Historically, grammar and spelling has always been associated with purism, superiority and so on, so we won't see the end of it, and that's alright. We're here for fun, so protect that experience.

I remember someone saying once that they'd drop a fic if the writer used "Harry said" instead of "Said Harry" (or vice versa, I forget precisely which way they went).

Personally, I think it's because this is a fandom with a million+ fics, a lot of which follow similar trope lines, so people are looking for excuses not to read fics, more than they're looking for reasons to read them.

I've still put out a few britpicking threads myself, but to be honest, I look at it more like writing assistance than a vital service. It's "This is Harry Potter, and the characters are British, so if you wanna get better at writing British, here's a load of Brits to help you learn how to do it!", essentially.

The hostility is just because this is the internet, and hostility is part and parcel of the experience. :D

You can't be expected to get the subtleties of the language right, and no one should bitch about such linguistic variations. However, there are things that many writers screw up for which there is no excuse: geography, food, and technology being the main ones, all of which are easy to look up.

I do think that an author should do research when they are writing a story set in a country and culture that they are not intimately familiar with. That said, fanfiction authors are largely amateurs, and the majority are young. These are free works.

It astounds me how angry people get when they read fanfiction that contains a lot of mistakes and/or Americanisms. Just like it astounds me how angry they get when they read fanfiction that has plot and story elements that they personally dislike.

Rather than complaining and shaming authors for not knowing things about British culture, the poster could make an informative post. One that's not making fun of or yelling at fanfic authors, but one that says, "Here's what things are actually like in Britain."

** I've said all this before but it bears repeating: a lot of Britpicking really is nitpicking because it's totally unnecessary. I don't care whether you spell it "traveller" or "traveler", "honour" or "honor". I'll wince a bit at "gotten" but generally let it slide because it's becoming more common over here.

But if you have Harry putting on sneakers and skateboarding to the mall to meet Chet, Schroeder and Tad before heading to Taco Bell... then you're not even trying. Similarly, I can just about let people off using words like "Fall" instead of "Autumn" or "sidewalk" instead of "pavement" in narrative text, but if Harry or another British character used those words it would be plain wrong.

If you're using Americanisms in a certain way then it can ruin the reader's immersion in a story. You bring up Lord of the Rings, well fair enough: what would your reaction be to Frodo telling Boromir to go fuck himself? It's totally out of character and, assuming that sort of thing happened frequently, it would ruin the story. The same is true of Harry Potter.

I've betad for [[/u/Starfox5]] who preferred pure 100% British idioms and spelling, and for [[/u/TE7]] who just wants the really obvious stuff fixed. Well actually he probably doesn't even care about that but he gets it anyway, like it or not.

Nobody expects you to be able to write fluent "British". I've also said before that I wouldn't expect 99% of British people to be able to write correctly in the huge array of local idioms and accents that we have. You just have to read the awful mess people make of Hagrid's and Fleur's accents. But if you're not even going to try to avoid incorrect dialogue then your story is going to be bad. It's that simple. If you can't do it yourself then find someone British who can spell - there are a few of us left - to check things over for you.

** Kinda.

I'm kind of writing an original fiction thing right now. I've set it in what's an AU for IRL to avoid having to do any actual research because screw that, but the character's American. And no matter how much I hate the term "vacation", there's just no way that he's not going to say that for holiday. And so he says vacation. And if it somehow comes up, actually it probably will, that we'll come across some nappies, well he's going to say diapers. It'll be realators (will have to learn to spell that... ah, realtor), mom, faucet, fall and all the other big ticket words all the way through. And why? Because that's the character's reality.

No-one's expecting that you go out and learn how to write idiomatic scouse or whatever. I mean, look at the Harry Potter books. As long as you say snog for kiss, ah... actually, grab a non-American edition. The point is that reading Harry Potter is not at all like watching, for example, Auf Wiedersehen, Pet or The Boys from the Black Stuff or, hell, even Hot Fuzz, where you get these clearly "regional" dialects and terms. The characters in Harry Potter have dialogue that wouldn't at all be out of place in an X-Men comic with the sole exception of Hagrid and the occasional word (most notoriously, snog). All anyone's saying is that if you're going to have dad!Harry, is that he's buying nappies, dummies and whatever Brits call cots.

Look, we all know that America is incredibly insular. I mean, I'm from a part of the world that semi-regularly hears about American news programmes giving us subtitles (nothing happens here) but it really should not be too much to expect the characters to not be saying classic American words. Even just remembering to write mum over mom.

It's quite different when it comes to the narrator's voice. Because the narrator isn't really a character and is under no obligation to describe or see the world in the same way that any individual character does. And while I would probably find it a bit strange to have an American narrator with British characters, it'd be quite hypocritical given [[https://medium.com/@Frameworkisdigimon/to-the-ordinary-world-everybodys-got-to-write-an-azkaban-fic-sometime-2785009bffe8][the way I write]] and what I like to read in narrators (e.g. Thackeray in Vanity Fair or Pratchett in Discworld or, most memorably, that one comic where it had "he's right, it's a bomb" as a narration device)... that is, ones with a clear presence anyway. So, why not an American narrator with British characters? Is it any weirder than having a narrator at all? (Here's me calling third person omniscient a narrator.)

OTOH I've never been one for kidspeak or so on. The idea is to imagine the voice of the character imposed over the text. Kids are going to say some words wrong or use the wrong words more frequently. It's just a thing. But that still means not doing [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HBxfDzZaic#t=1m43s][this]] (usually, note that it makes sense for the character in that situation). There's a (possibly more) fic out there somewhere that posits that part of Snape's antipathy towards Harry is in his noticeably posher accent, which contrasts with Snape's affected one. And both sometimes say certain words in the way that no southerner would (presumably this means a short a, e.g. trap and bath have the same a sound or something). This isn't reflected in the dialogue /at a word choice level/. Or, if it is, it is very subtle and I can't tell what's going on. But it's not equivalent to "translation convention".

I guess... compare Rahne, Gambit, Rogue or Chamber to most X-Men characters. Those are American writers (for the most part) making sure to include dialectal terms or pronounciation guides (in Rahne's case) for a mostly American audience. And, at the same time, if they need to speak Japanese or Skrull or whatever it's probably just <hey, this is speaking Japanese>. I don't share these accents... and it's really freaking strange to come across NZ accents even in NZ... so it's quite possible it is completely cringey but they do it anyway.

Now, a lot of Britpicking is directed to a group of writers who have a genuine interest in trying to recreate the British feel of the books. They want to hear about the difference between porch and porch (a distinction I cannot explain but read about in one of those threads) or that your characters are probably expecting kippers for breakfast if they're millionaires (it's from the hilariously titled song [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZahtmWhH5g][Breakfast in America]]... the song's narrator imagines, much like many authors do, that Brits and Americans eat the same breakfast foods). And these big "Britpicking" threads are, realistically, the best way of providing a space to do that. And the choice of using the word porch or whatever is probably something the narrator has to grapple with.

I think this sums up part of the issue. Accents and the like are tied to how someone lives, which makes having to consciously learn both their own and the ones for somewhere else is difficult.

** I totally get what you're saying. In the past I've always tried to lesson Americanisms when writing HP fanfics (that have sadly never seen an audience because I've never been able to finish a story & I refuse to publish unless it's finished) but I always fall off the wagon & end up just writing in American English. It's one of the major factors as to why I want to write a fic set in the HP universe in modern America, specifically Texas 'cause that's the dialect that I grew up speaking.

Then don't write a British person. Case closed. Writing British people as americans is just bad writing, "idk how to do it" is not an excuse. If I decided to write some kids or elderly americans but had them speak like a Parisian technocrat because that's what I know to do and that I'm not willing to try and learn how to be more accurate to the context it would be asinine and lazy too.

*** And this is the exact sort of attitude that made me post this in the first place. By your logic, I shouldn't write anything that's not set in the 21st century and in the USA. No HP, no Naruto, no LoTR, and no to a whole bunch of other settings created by non-Americans or set in worlds where the characters logically wouldn't speak 21st century American English.

A bit silly, don't you think?

/Obviously/ I do the best I can with what I know, and even with the limitations of my knowledge there are ways to preserve the characters' vocal traits with tone and narrative voice. But there are just some things that I, as an American who never was a British schoolboy would never know.

As a related aside, Tom Scott on Youtube did a video recently on the difference between the American and the UK versions of the kids song "Jingle Bells, Batman Smells..." and other differences. Link for the interested: [[https://youtu.be/V5u9JSnAAU4]]

That's exactly what I didn't say m8. i said you had to make /a reasonable effort/ lest it falls under the category of bad writing. If you're content with it then by all means do what you want, it's not like most fanfiction have award-levels of writing to begin with.

​

I'm not saying you shouldn't write a British character because you're american, I'm saying that your op is just ranting about how you want to write an american character, by all means do so, but writing an american characters and calling them british is stupid.

** I speak Mandarin (non-natively) and while it's no problem to translate from Mandarin to English, it's much harder to translate from English to Mandarin. I view British English similarly. I grew up reading Enid Blyton and I understand it perfectly well, but it's a lot harder for me to write in British English. I'll slip with a “mom” or “She's really smart, she gets good grades” or whatever, or I won't even realize (realise?) when I've made a “mistake.”

It's jarring to be tossed back and forth across the pond.

** Agreed. Let's be honest, this is only really a problem on this subreddit. I've never seen someone complain about these things outside of here. Nobody actually gives a shit outside of when they can get some fake internet points out of it. No comments on the actual fan fiction sites ever point out that "pranks" is the wrong term, or something else.

Seriously, why does it even matter? We're reading these because we want to just read Harry doing things that aren't in cannon. I'm not reading these because I want some supreme British literature. If that's what you're after, britpicking is the least of these authors' worries.

This gatekeeping shit is moronic in the extreme.

Yeah, downvotes for being right. What else should someone expect from this cancer?
