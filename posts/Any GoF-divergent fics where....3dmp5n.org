...the other champions realise Harry is, in fact, a fourteen-year-old boy entered against his will into a deadly competition?

Honestly, I just really want something with some real camaraderie and friendship between the four champions - the only thing that came close was a middling-length Harry/Viktor I can't remember the name of. International /co-operation/ was the aim of the tournament, after all.

Complete preferable but not necessary. Any and all pairings.


** While it doesn't feature Harry as Champion, linkffn(C'est la Vie by cywscross) has a timetraveling Harry interfere in an AU where Neville is the Boy Who Lived. As part of this, the champions get friendly with each other.

Be warned, it seems to be abandoned, and you will greatly mourn the fact if you read just a few chapters of it.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** I think there is some champion bonding in On The Way to Greatness. Harry certainly stresses the fact that he is only 14 and doesn't want to compete.

** Hmm, let's see: linkffn(Patron) linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) - I know, it doesn't really fit the bill, but close enough.

I have some other ones on the tip of my tongue(edge of my brain?) but I'm drawing a blank at the moment.

*** From the summary, Patron looks like the kind of thing I'll love anyway, thank you! I've tried Hogwarts Battle School a couple of times and I just can't get into it, probably Harry's characterisation. Just rubs me the wrong way.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

  Remember Goblet of Fire? What would happen if Harry took the filter off his mouth and actually said what he's thinking? Bad things, probably. But it'll be fun as hell. My go at the Intelligent!Harry, Smart alec!Harry situation.
