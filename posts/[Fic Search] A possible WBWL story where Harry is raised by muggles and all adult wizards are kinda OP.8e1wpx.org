The OP thing was kinda of the draw of the story, basically Muggle bad ass Harry who has never been to Hogwarts get introduced to the magical world, only problem is he is like 16 and everyone but him has all the OP powers you come to Expect from badly written main characters, with reaction times that are relatively impossible.

While ok I stopped reading since the story was headed for the unavoidable pitfall of Harry eventually getting murdered by a 3rd year since he was so far behind so deep into the second war with such over powered enemies there is no time he could actually do anything even if he was the boy who lived other than fly his motorcycle around


** Was it something about Harry stole Sirius's bike and rode it on the highway? And he had police and James following him? I remember something vaguely like that? Was that it?

*** Yes it was, another seen that sticks out is the Hogwarts express is attacked and Harry goes to be a bad ass and tries to stop the attack with a shotgun and one of the DE's is assed out, dead to rights done... Harry pulls the trigger and butterflies come out of the gun. Some how the DE (who If I remember correctly was Lucius) was able to spell the flying pellets as or just before they came out the gun
