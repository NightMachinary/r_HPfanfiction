I based this off of the fact that we dont know much about Godric and I imagine him as a red head. Dumbledore and Ron are both red heads, I'll say if Godric had a sweet tooth then I would take this as my headcanon immediately but we don't know for sure.

Idk how to prove it more than that I think they're redheads and that they are all light oriented wizards.

Add more points in the comments if you can come up with some


** Dumbledore and Ron both used the sword of Gryffindor to destroy Horcruxes. Of course, so did Neville, but still.

Dumbledore and Ron both had younger sisters. Who's to say Godric didn't?
