Linkao3(Swung by Serafim)

I'm only 3 chapters in and this has been one of the most intriguing fics I've started recently. I haven't seen it recommended before and couldn't find it on the common recommendations list so I thought I'd post it.

Lockhart successfully obliviates Harry and Ron in the chamber. The story picks up at the start of third year and fills in what was missed as we go. So far, there hasn't been /too much/ cliché. Best of all it appears to be complete. I'm on four abandoned fics in a row so this a breath of fresh air.

It's rated M for anyone who cares. So far there are some f-bombs but nothing else to merit that rating.

Edit: a word

Edit 2: For posterity, I just finished this fic and can say that it is of decent quality and worth a read. That said I have a few points to bring up.

1) The first twenty chapters are far superior compared to the second twenty five.

2) There was a minor argument in the comments regarding slash fics. Technically the final pairing is M/M, *BUT* there is not a single explicit scene in the fic. Make of that what you will. I don't mind slash even though I don't normally read it, but this story qualifies in definition only.

3) The plot is strong, but this fic seems to drag itself out. It could have ended fifteen chapters earlier and would have been better for it.

4) The final pairing is only brought up in the two chapter epilogue. It's obvious for several chapters before that what is going to happen, but it isn't really important. You could just as easily skip the last two chapters.


** Only spoilers for the first chapters, some of the dialogue is amazing.

#+begin_quote
  “Offended Pure-blood sensibilities, in Mister Zabini's case. Miss Bulstrode asked me if I thought it a good idea to allow a potentially dangerous creature loose in the school.” Albus smiles. “I asked her if she thought I would intentionally bring harm to the student body.”

  “What did she say?” Snape asks. Millicent Bulstrode is a very pragmatic girl.

  “She pointed out that I hired Professor Quirrell. And Professor Lockhart, for that matter.” Albus looks grieved. “I awarded her points.”

  Snape raises an eyebrow while making a note that he needs to pay more attention to Miss Bulstrode. “Thank you.”

  Albus nods. “It was true, however painful the truth was to hear. However, I reassured Miss Bulstrode that her own Head of House supplied the potion to make our werewolf professor docile and harmless during the full moon.”

  Snape glares at him.

  “You may feel free to say, of course, that I ordered you to do so,” Albus says with a faint smile.

  He resists the urge to grind his teeth. “You did order me to do so.”

  “Did I?” Albus affects surprise. “What a wonderful coincidence. Now you can tell them nothing more than the truth.”

  “Are you /certain/ you weren't a Slytherin?” Snape asks, amused in spite of himself.

  “Of course not.” Albus pops a lemon drop into his mouth. “I do not allow myself such a limited point of view.”

******* Whoa. That fic has been going for THIRTEEN years?? I think the longest running story I'm reading that I'm still waiting for completion ..actually, I just looked mine up, which is the Code series by Aduro linkffn(2750775) and actually that's been going for 11 years. And it is probably the only series I'm actually interested in reading an update on. So I guess 13 isn't so crazy.

If a story isn't complete I basically don't ever read more than the first chapter, and that only to see if it looks like it's worth following.

Also, people don't write fanfiction to be marketable to every audience. They write the stories they want to write, and if you don't want to read them, there's nothing you can do.

** Ah, yes, one of my favourite stories. I've never cared for Snape, but this one is probably my favourite incarnation of him. The final pairing may be icky on retrospect, but I think it fits the story very nicely.

I really enjoyed the exploration of Potions and Hogwarts curriculum and also the method of getting rid of Voldemort.

The title also sounds very much a fantasy novel, so 5 stars.
