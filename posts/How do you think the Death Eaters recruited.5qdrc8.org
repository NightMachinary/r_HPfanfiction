This has stumped me. How do you guys think the Death Eaters recruited?


** Voldemort most likely started with the people he went to school with, and their children. Those Death Eaters then found people who agreed with Voldemort, and took their time bringing them into the fold.

Networking man. Networking.

*** I mean, Voldemort was a Slytherin. Can you imagine him not networking?

**** I can see him setting up a magical LinkedIn account (SlytheredIn?).

***** Considering he's the kind of kid who had licked back hair and a diary I could also see him deciding that this is for plebeians and others can network for him.

** I imagine they commissioned someone to come up with a sansy jingle they could play over the wizarding wireless. Probably during quidditch time-outs and the like.

** Similarly to the KKK probably.

Being a group centered around ideas like "Pureblood mania" and "Mudblood hate" you find people of similar temperament (many of whom you may already know) and sound them out. Friends you went to school with, your families friends, relatives, anyone who shares the same ideas

** I imagine Voldemort organizes his allies in layers. Some will be courted to gain their support. Others will be hired for simple tasks, granted more trust as their services become more useful. There would always be a temptation to know the 'deeper mysteries' that Voldemort shares only with the upper echelon, and once an inductee was interacting with him directly, he would insist that some form of leverage be in his hands to ensure loyalty.

*** And when you say “courted” ... do you mean romance or the other meaning? Because the thought of Voldemort flirting with all of the inner circle to make them more loyal is just hilarious.

** I reckon early days it was networking. Latter days, they gave a join us or die pitch, and if they refused, just Imperious them and let them live, cementing your image as both popular and merciful.
