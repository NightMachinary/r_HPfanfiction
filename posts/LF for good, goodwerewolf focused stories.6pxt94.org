What the title says.

Searching for stories where either Harry, or someone from the main cast, or even an OC is/becomes a werewolf, and it becomes one of the main points of the story. So no Grayback, unless he's on the good side this time, and gets bigger role.

Something like "Weres Harry?"


** Can I say something random?

In one of the later chapters (and unfortunately it was never finished), some of the characters put forth a worldbuilding idea about lycanthropy; originally an ability possessed by Norse shapeshifters, when they came into conflict with Christian wizards, the latter attempted to use a curse to seal off the shapeshifting power.

However, something in the ritual went wrong; casting it at the full moon meant that at following full moons, the suppressed shapechanging power would return with a vengance, overwhelming the body of whoever possesses it and going on a rampage.

I just thought that was an excellent worldbuilding idea; do you know if anyone else has played with something like it?

*** Yeah, I know. One of the reasons why I'm lamenting the stories (supposed) death. I love werewolves, and I love where a writer creates whole culture around them. "Were's Harry?" is one of the best examples of werewolves in fanfiction.

Also, no. That's why I created this thread.

*** There was a Danny Phantom crossover where lycanthropy was mentioned to have been created by Pariah Dark, who is the God of Pariahs. (A whole lot of curses are attributed to him, but lycanthropy is the stand out because Remus is the one explaining it.)

** Prince of a Dark kingdom features werewolves very prominently, and does it the best in my opinion of any fic I've read. If you haven't read it, Id definitely recommend it. Fair warning, its extremely long and most likely abandoned.

The reason Harry comes to Britain in this one is actually lycanthropy, and it contains lots of humour. It has a few crossovers, but you don't need to have seen those series

** I enjoyed "Weres Harry" as well and looked for other werewolf stories and I've found these: Whether they are good or not, I'll let you decide.

Now an outcast in the wizarding world and stripped of protection, he must learn to harness his weaknesses to become a sword and shield against the serpents in the shadows, and find new allies among the forsaken of society.

*** Thanks!

Just tell me; if you read them; does Harry has control over his wolf and transformation in those, like in "Weres Harry?"?

***** Oh. :(

I'll still probably read them, but I prefer stories where lycanthropy is perceived as a gift, not a curse (at least by the main hero/es).

****** hey I know this is an old thread but i happened to find it you might want to look in some stuff based on Werewolf: the apocalypse. It's a rollplaying game that im sure has original fiction based off it.
