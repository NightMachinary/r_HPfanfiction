Looking for fics where Harry through some temporal anomaly or time loop desperately tries to level out the playing field sometime after Voldemort returns. Not looking for MoD/reincarnated in 11 year old body fics. I want 14-16 year old Harry desperately trying to even out his odds of survival- even if he ultimately fails. It can be dark Harry, but I'd prefer it if he had good intentions outside of defeating Voldemort by any means nessasary. Thanks!
