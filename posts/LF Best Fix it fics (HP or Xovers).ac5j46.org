** Do you mean fix it as in 'Harry goes back to his first year' or 'someone goes back to first war'

#+begin_quote
  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

** How balanced do you want the story? When you say "Best fix it fics" do you mean "stories that do a good job of fixing everything" or "good stories whose theme is fixing things"? Eg if someone goes back in time to /try/ to fix everything, but runs into all kinds of interesting difficulties, would that count?
