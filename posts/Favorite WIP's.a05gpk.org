I noticed my alert page is seriously lacking. What are your favorite WIP (Work in progress) stories that update regularly? I'd prefer to avoid fics that are overly trope-y but I will read them all the same.


** The series by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/3489773/murkybluematter][murkybluematter]] is the reason I'm still alive right now.

You don't need to know Alanna the Lioness to understand. But seriously, the characterization, the world-building, the freaking plot is so amazing I just wanna find out who the author is, give him/her all my money so he/she can quit work and finish the damn series.

P.S. It takes him/her a few months to update but when he/she does BOY IT'S ONE HELL OF AN UPDATE. Think 20k-word chapters especially in the 4th story of the series.

EDIT: Added the P.S.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. A new perspective on the 1970s time travel genre. Updates weekly on Saturdays. Some slash much later.

And that technically (“The technical sense being the most important, when you're trying to get out of trouble, pet,” Ted-dad always told her) her mum had stolen her.

** His Twenty-Eighth Life

Featuring a Master of Death Harry who has been continually reincarnated into different alternate realities and has defeated Voldemort 27 times, dropped into a reality where he is once again Harry Potter, but with an older brother, Jonathan, who is the BWL in this timeline.

It's well-written with round characters (including those presented in a negative light, which doesn't always happen in fanfiction) and a really interesting plot. I have no idea where it's going, but I'm enjoying it.

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.

** linkffn(12778140) Everything [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] writes is excellent, and the Auror series is no exception. The first fic in the series, The Aurors, focus's on Harry and his OC trainee as they solve a gruesome mystery, while also getting their own lives in order. Hollow Ash is the direct sequel that starts up a new mystery, while still having elements of the first story present.

I've found the plot a little bit harder to keep track of than in The Aurors, but I think that's mainly because this plot seems more complex than the previous. The most recent chapter has also shed some more light on stuff, despite adding another layer of complexity (which I found really interesting).

All (I think) of the author's work is canon-compliant, and seemingly epilogue-compliant.

#+begin_quote
  The Battle of Camlann never happened, thus the legacy of Arthur lives on. The blood of the founders still walk the halls of Hogwarts, while ancient enemies clash to this day. Years later, Harry Potter wakes up a stranger in a strange world. Between over competitive house relations and never ending mysterious plots, he must struggle to find the truth about that fated Halloween. AU

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Fourth and last in the Black Queen series. Jen has just months in which to kill her destined foe, but after defeating the Turk, she is sure she now has a chance to succeed. Unfortunately, Voldemort spent his year's sabbatical uncovering secrets that she would have preferred him never learn. Secrets that could now prove deadly for everyone. Still not for children.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought?
