:END:
I'm looking for a specific fic (try saying that 10 times fast) and it's subsequent sequels. I remember it being quite dark in places. Holly/Harry got in to a relationship with Hermione. I seek to recall something about Quidditch goggles. Does this ring any bells? It's been driving me nuts all morning.


** Holly Evans and the Spiral Path is on fanfiction.net, along with the related stories. The only one on Ao3 is Holly Polter, which is the most recent. The version on Ao3 has more sexual content.

*** That's what it was! Thanks! I was thinking AO3 because of that fucked up scene at the tournament, but I didn't want to put a spoiler in the description just in case
