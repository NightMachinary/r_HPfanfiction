No seer Luna fics. Just a fic where Luna gets some counselling


** I think almost everyone needs counseling after Year 7, considering the crap they were put through. Here is a little scene I wrote:

[Hogwarts, September 7th, 1998]

Ginny: It's not getting better, a Hufflepuff second year blew out her dorm door last night. At this rate, someone will get badly hurt sooner or later.

Hermione: We need to find a psychologist soon. There must be a squib or two who work that field. If there aren't any here in Britain, I'm sure I can find some in other English speaking countries.

Ginny: I don't know how that Muggle psycho thing works, but I can guarantee you won't find any for tonight, which we need!

Luna: We can try a big sleepover in the Great Hall or in the Room of Requirement? Lots of people together can keep both Nargles and Others away.

Ginny: Others?

Luna: Yes, terrible tiny creatures that infest your mind. Every Death Eater and Snatcher I saw at Malfoy Manor had swarms of them.

She shuddered, Hermione and Ginny stayed very still.

Luna: Anyway, consider my suggestion. It wouldn't hurt.

Hermione: Bringing both boys and girls together, or should we separate the room?

Luna: Of course everyone should be together, it's not like they are going to have orgies.

Hermione: Luna!

-------------

Eventually, Hermione found a squib psychologist in Canada after two months. The therapy and counseling worked in a limited fashion, some got better, but many didn't.

*** It's pretty good, but I dislike the characterization of Luna in it.

Her schtick was imaginary animals and saying things that made people introspective, not orgies.

**** This is postwar, this is not the innocent Luna from Year 6 and prior. She has suffered, she has seen suffering, she has seen many deaths, and she has killed.

I think by this point, most DA members are already using sex as a way to cope with their trauma, and some could be rather daring. Luna is no exception and she never shies away from speaking what's on her mind.

I mean if you throw teenagers and children to the wolves, and if they win the day, you are going to deal with a bunch of hardened and ruthless child soldiers who also happen to have a bunch of issues.

Most of them are not going to let your shit go on any longer, and they are going to make you pay, with very very high interests. Even the Wizard Jesus can only take so much, and he will crucio anyone who spits on his friends.

***** You have valid points, but still. I was under the impression Luna was a poorly treated hostage.
