I'm surprised I haven't found one of these yet. It seems an awful lot like something Ron would do, and would easily get Harry to follow along with. Get some misunderstandings in order and Hermione might just come along too. I definitely don't see enough mystery-solving fics where the fate of the world does not, in fact, hang in the balance.

Who/what it's about and whether it ends up true or not doesn't matter to me. I'd like them to be fairly IC... Don't want it reduced to "the trio runs around screaming". Too many humor fics like that.


** You mean you're looking for a story where Harry, Ron and Hermione re-enact the plot of /Bunnicula/? Because I would read the hell out of that.

** I was certain I've read one where they tried but got totally sidetracked. Couldn't find it again, but found this one shot: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3255153/1/Death-by-Garlic][Death by Garlic]]
