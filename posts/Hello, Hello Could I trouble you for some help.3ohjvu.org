** Sentient Hogwarts is seen in linkffn(The Merging). It doesn't play a huge role, but it's there and done in a reasonable manner, I feel.

You ask for MoD crossovers, but I'd like to mention a non-cross: linkffn(coming back late). One of my favorite stories. Harry as MoD influences the plot, but it's done well, rather than being something stupidly powerful.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Days later he awakens, magic flaring uncontrollably, his soul seemingly still in one piece. But is it? With no understanding of what has happened to him, what else can he do but keep moving forwards, forced by a fate he never wanted, fighting for a life he never got to live. And fight he will.

** So... the fic I'm recommending doesn't actually fall under any of your criteria... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/12/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]]. I recommend this because it /might/ eventually loop back to being the Master of Death, but it's not a crossover. Depending on how often you frequent this subreddit, you might see it mentioned a lot. I think I would always rec this one, though. I love it.

To make up for my blunder, I'm going to rec some that do fit your criteria.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]] is a lovely Azkaban fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2219655/1/Never-Trust][Never Trust]] is a post-Azkaban oneshot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9899145/1/Great-Expectations][Great Expectations]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] are both Avengers crossovers that utilize being the Master of Death.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] is a Firefly crossover. I hadn't seen Firefly before reading this, and I still understood most of it.

** I'm not sure what an animangus is, but it sure sounds painful. Or weird. Or both.

That being said, I don't remember any stories in which any of those would be primary themes around which whole stories are framed, but nonjon's comedy fics (linkffn(2354771) and its continuations) do sort of use metamorphmagic for something (mostly for comedy), and it's also sort of used in this story (linkffn(3036211)).

Oh, and chapter 18 of this: (linkffn(8222091)) explores the concept, though it's just a one-shot and some liberties are taken with the world of the story (namely, there are some changes to the world of the story that are not a direct result of Harry having this particular ability that is being explored); all in all I think it's readable and actually nice and something I can envision (generally speaking) if someone as shallowly-rooted in his own identity as Harry had access to an ability of this sort.

**** Yeah, I know what you mean. Sadly, it's really hard to find a story like that, most likely because it is, all in all, a novelty skill that doesn't make the character that much more powerful and thus not many people bother to use it. Heck, I'd love to read a good story that deals with it (well, there are some, but the few I remember of them are ... just decent, I guess, and don't deal precisely with metamorphmagic as it is but rather with what the author envisions as being it, and it's not the same). Heck, I don't even remember the names of the other fics now, so I gave what I could and that's that for now.

And yes, I know it's “animagus” and I know what it is. I just have a really weird sense of humour so I took to the mangled word; you probably shouldn't pay attention to it because my jokes (or what passes for them) are mostly nonsense.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

**** Yeah, I know you said no slash, but so far its had none. A little fluff here and there, but nothing big. Starts off with Rose (Harry) in first year.

***** As a healthy hot-blooded male, I have no problem with femslash...as long as the characters aren't just like "Normally I like guys but suddenly I have the urge to do the lesbian sex to you", also more often the not summaries that advertise slash typically end up being smut. So, I shall take your word for it.

As long as there is no sudden "Dicks Dicks Everywhere! Explicit scenes feature only dicks!" I think I can handle it. =P

****** Lol, honestly at this moment it has been pretty mellow with sexual topics. I guess I'll wait and see as well, but like you, REALLY hope they don't go that route in the end. Vance mcgill has done a good job with a couple other fics they have, so I'm holding out hope.
