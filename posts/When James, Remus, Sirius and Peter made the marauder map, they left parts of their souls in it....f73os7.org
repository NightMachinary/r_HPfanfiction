Perhaps the way they imbued the map with parts of their personality unintentionally created a horcrux or perhaps they intentionally made the map their join horcrux. What happens now?


** The Prince of Slytherin has this concept, though without the map being a horcrux. It does contain lively imprints of their personalities that are like Diary Tom and can bring people into the map the way Tom brought Harry into the diary.

** Who'd they murder? I feel that would decide a lot of what happens next.

*** I completely forgot you have to murder someone to make a horcrux. Not my finest moment. Maybe as they unintentionally imbued the map with their personalities, they found a new way (accidentally) to make a horcrux?

**** The Werewolf Prank sounds like a more fitting place to do it on, if that.

***** Probably, but would their animagus forms matter? I can't see Wormtail doing serious (heh) damage.

** I really hope they didn't kill someone to make a prank map. That's worse than Tom Riddle killing to create the diary so that he can become immortal.

But say that they drew on other magic to create the map... maybe pulling from the magic of Hogwarts... so that the map contains a little bit of every magical being to walk the corridors of Hogwarts... that could be cool! And if they put enough of themselves into the map, maybe they could be resurrected from it. Hmmm. That'd be a fic worth writing.

** There's actually a one-shot about that, lmao. linkffn(4220317) Don't know about a longer version, though.

** I recently came across this fic the other day. It touches on the concept. I enjoyed it but I realize the pairing might not be for everyone. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/979182/chapters/1927380]]
