Fred and George are at the top of their class, they're star students and did no pranking whatsoever

At first, Percy was happy. He could finally have an intelligent conversation with the two of them and they didnt make fun of him anymore

But soon, he began to miss his /real/ brothers and after that, he has to try and make this Fred and George get silly like their counterparts


** I Honestly expected the twins to be evil masterminds in the parallel universe

*** Or Percy to feel threatened by his genius twin brothers.

Can't be the "responsible one" when your younger siblings enter your grade and are set to surpass you.

Or the alternate universe is where Percy can't be a prefect due to some weird rule and instead the twins get appointed for his year and their year.
