I don't mean necessarily like the main character is a Slytherin though that would be nice. I mean more that the themes are. Like the book series is about celebrating/acknowledging the importance off gryffindor qualities. Like the importance of being brave and standing up for you believe in. Characters that aren't very Griffindor like in the begining grow by gaining more griffindor qualities and seeing the importance of them. So like instead of that you do the same with Slytherin qualities the problems require ambition, cunning and resourcefulness to solve , the narrative and the protagonists of the story see alot of importance in those qualities. I like Harmione and Drarry but I'm pretty flexible on ships and honestly prefer if it's more plot focused than ship focused. Also totally fine if its after Hogwarts. Thanks!


** The most pro-Slytherin fic out there is probably linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). It manages to extol both the best and worst aspects of Slytherin House. There are several rather profound conversations in this fic that highlight the nature of the houses, but probably the best is when The Bloody Baron is speaking to the Fat Friar. He states that unlike the other three houses, Slytherin's greatest vice is simultaneously its greatest virtue: ambition.

Additionally, this may actually be the most pro-Hufflepuff fic I can remember reading.

Other runners up:

Linkffn(on the way to greatness) is likely the most like what canon!Harry in Slytherin would actually be like; it sucks. There is no whitewashing of the members, they're all still bullies, thugs and many are familiar with Dark magic.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** No it's good. What I mean is Slytherin is not portrayed as misunderstood in canon, like most fics. Instead, it appears the way Gryffindor appears in canon: it's complicated with much more nuance than people on the outside see it.

Yes there are thugs and people practicing Dark magic, but most of them are just a bunch of kids trying living out their days in Hogwarts. More than anything it shows there is more to them in canon than just bigotry and racism. That is still very present, but it also becomes clearer how it could actually come about and how Voldemort was able to influence and gain such a hold.

It's kind of like you read the hp books, where harry is the weak kid being picked on by the nasty bully stereotype. But then, in this fic, harry goes home with the bullied kid and sees that he was bullied at home and not really any better off than he was. It makes you feel something like pity for them in canon (they are still a bunch of bad kids for the most part, but now you feel a drip of sympathy).

** linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) is all about ambition, student hierarchy, cunning, and strategy. Even though harry is in slytheryn, it isn't so much about the house itself, but the qualities of the house. Snape is headmaster. And even characters outside of slytheryn house act ambitiously and cunning in order to succeed at the school.

I may be too positive about this fic series, because Slytherin!Harry redo fic is absolutely my jam. But this is a really well written fic. It does fall into the trap of having too-mature political Slytherin-ness, though (but I love that shit).

I don't mind that, to be honest. Reading about kids being realistic kids and keeping it interesting requires excellent writing skills, very few authors can pull it off.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is the pitfall time travel stories most often drop into. Going by fic-logic, just Harry knowing about future events should alter those events irrevocably. Going by common sense, why would you subject your readers to yet another year of petrifications and then another year of dementors and so on and so forth?

****** If you like Peggy Sue, you'll appreciate the differences this one brings to the trope, and the potential for the story to move away from canon even more over time (it's only up to third year).

I actually think the author is writing slower now because they realise they've gone too fast. They've got four and a half more years of Slytherin political dicking around to write before a finale.

Again, all that said, this is one of my favourite series.

I have the below redo fics saved for following, so it's biased towards unfinished stories. Sorry. Some of them are Slytherin. You may also enjoy the rest. Most of the Slytherin!Harry fics I've read are too close to canon to be interesting (like linkao3(leo inter serpentes: first year) )

Travel Secrets is the best Slytherin redo fic hands down imo.

Would love to get your list of recs in return. (Redo, Slytherin, or both)

Linkffn(Back again, Harry by Jedi buttercup) Linkffn(His own man by crunchysunrises) Linkffn(Messing with Time by slytherinm) - Harry travel, mid-80s Linkffn(harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) (the daddy of redo fics)

Linkao3(six pomegranate seeds) Linkao3(xerosis) Linkao3(again and again by athy)

Other timeframes involving time travel to save the world: Linkffn(The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie) Hermione travel, MWPP era (long, really good, but could really use an edit. My services are available if you're watching, ShayaLonnie.) Linkffn(The Last Marauder) - Hermione travel

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

  In the wake of the war, Dumbledore's portrait gives Hermione a task that could change the course of history if she succeeds, but unravel time itself if she fails. 1ST PLACE WINNER of the Energize W.I.P. Awards for "Most Promising Harry Potter Fan-Fiction"! IN THE PROCESS OF BEING BETA'D.

************ Circular Reasoning I found a bit gratuitous. That first chapter especially is a slog. But at least it has a relatively original approach.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)
