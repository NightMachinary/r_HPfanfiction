As the title says I'm looking for stories that feature Harry crossing over with characters from the DC Universe. I'm not picky about what you deliver, but I'd prefer them to be complete or oneshots. No slash please.


** Just a heads up: avoid anything by Megamatt09 unless you want your brains to dribble out of your penis or vagina.

Yes, his stuff really is that bad, and it all proliferates the DC and Marvel sections on FFn/AO3.

** I wrote two HP/DC crossover relatively recently. It's a form of fusion where the new DC age of heroes is just starting to get under way. They feature a Head Auror adult Harry dealing with the fallout of those events.

There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13521865/1/25][Kicking Gotham]] which is set primarily in Gotham, and the sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13694861/1/7][Toppling Heroes]] which takes place in the UK. They both tell smaller scale, self contained investigation focused stories mostly without world ending stakes.

I am planning a third story in the series, which I hope to begin posting before the end of the year.

*** Just binged both stories today and I have to say, they're both insanely underrated. Your character work and the way you blend the settings is fantastic.

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

**** Clell65619 has a few more scattered in his anthologies. IIRC, there's one where Batman and Joker scare Voldemort so he won't step foot in Gotham; another where Neville is going to be Robin; and one with a Bizzaro version of Supergirl crossing dimensions and +falling in love+ becoming obsessed with Harry.

Fair warning: some of those (like the Neville one) are just unfinished ideas up for adoption.

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.

  Everything can change in an instant, Harry Potter and Oliver Queen are proof of that. After five years of hell, the two return to Starling City as vigilantes looking to honor Robert's dying wish. What started as a promise, quickly evolved. Bonds will be broken, heroes will rise, and demons will be unleashed. With rising odds and growing opposition, can they save Starling City?

  He handed Alex the book so she could read the gold lettering stamped into the top of the front cover, The Lightning-Struck Soldier. Below a minimalistic cartoon of a cupboard door was the name "HJ Granger". / Alex felt weak in the knees. "Hermione Granger wrote this?" / Harry smiled. "Best woman I ever knew.

  Supergirl is a hero. A beacon of hope for the people of National City and the world. But when tragedy strikes, she learns that her heart isn't as unbreakable as the rest of her. In her darkest hour, when she questions her very humanity, who will be the hero that saves her? Will the darkest speedster in the multiverse be the light of hope for Kara Danvers? Can they save each other?
