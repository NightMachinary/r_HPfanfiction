I remember reading this at some point and can't find it anywhere, at first I thought it might be Chasing the Sun but it wasn't. I vaguely remember parts of it, so sorry if this doesn't make a lot of sense. I think it started with hermione in 7th year thinking of career opportunities and wanted to be an apprentice, but the war is still going so she goes to a college in America with a masters program, Draco goes as well. I believe Severus was teaching her potions secretly when he could. Hermione was also a maiden brewer, I remember that being a big deal. And she and Severus create a cure/treatment to the Cruciatus curse. Did any of that ring a bell for somebody? I reallly hope so! Much thanks!


** So I am not even 50% sure this is the fic you are looking for since I haven't read it in ages, but this seems to fit a lot of what you mentioned.
