Why do people think Remus Lupine would supporting Harry and Sirius over Dumbledore. Remember he believe that Sirius had come to kill Harry. He knew he was able to get in to the castle and he knew that Sirius could turn into a dog but he didn't want to tell Dumbledore because he didn't want to disappoint Dumbledore even though that information could've kept Harry safe. I've never understood people like of that character. And I'm not one of those that believe that Remus should've looked after Harry he was a friend of James a lesser friend.


** I always found some of JKs characters really difficult to imagine IRL. Lupin being one of them. Bit spineless throughout.

Odd he was ‘such a good friend of theirs' but had relatively little to do with Harry prior to arriving to teach. Even during third year it took him awhile to even start engaging with Harry properly. Relatively small interactions thereafter but, by the last book Harry is his child's god-parent. He struck me as overly staged and unrealistic. If he was real he'd either be better or worse. Not a wishy washy middle ground character who's somehow equally close and distant to Harry simultaneously.

*** One of the problems we have about this story is that it is told from Harry's eye, we don't know what happened before so maybe Remus did try to meet Harry but Dumbledore refused for security reasons.

And Remus Lupin is a character that often wallow himself in self guilt. He probably wanted to meet Harry, but had tens of contradictory thought like what would happen if a monster like him met Harry, what if Harry hated him or even how to say him that part of the reasons Sirius Black could betray his parents was because they suspected HIM to be a traitor. . .

I don't know if the character of Lupin is well fleshed because honnestly, considering the life he had (had a dangerous disease who make people hate him, still managed to go to school because one guy hide his disease and invited him, found some true friend there but they thought he was a traitor and died partly because of it not to mention years of poverty) I doubt I would ever met anyone in the real world who could serve as a comparaison.

** Yes! Exactly! Remus would not have chosen either of them over Dumbledore.

He had nothing to do with Harry during his ‘childhood ‘, he wanted to abandon his own son...

Refused to talk to Harry about his parents until almost forced

And unlike Sirius, Remus never even wrote to Harry

Ignored him being locked in his room in OOtP ....

Shit person, spineless and a deadbeat father/uncle

One of my least liked characters

** Well, and I don't understand why people here hate him so much. And the one person who, in my opinion, explain why people find it hard to like him got downvoted. What a surprise. I like Remus because he isn't perfect, just like me. I like him because I can relate to him on a personal level. I like him because in spite of how he is treated by society, he remains a kind and compassionate person. I admire him for this because I can't be like that. Yes, he didn't tell Dummbledore about Sirius and put Harry in danger. He admits it was cowardice. Fear of losing the trust of a person who gave him a chance of a lifetime. Selfish? Certainly. But many people are selfish. How complex would Remus be if he had made all the right choices? He would be too perfect and too boring. How many people do you know who always do the right thing. Remus ends up high on HP rankdowns due to his complexity.He also has a way with children. Any character who has a way with kids is bound to be my favourite. He is also very perceptive. I can't make you like him, nor would I want to do that because its your own business. But people like Snape as well and he isn't the nicest person. All in all, people like characters who are human, who make mistakes like any other person, who feel fear, anger, jealousy. Given the life Remus lived, I'm not surprised by his behaviour. Just like with real people, we often find it easy to judge others and feel morally superior even though we have not lived that person's life, but analysing fictional characters helped me understand this. I hope that answers your question. Remus is my favourite HP character.

** Lupin was on the outs with the Order because they suspected him of spying. He had no idea that Sirius's dog form was relevant in any way, and had every reason to believe that there was no way for him to get into Hogwarts. He didn't immediately kill Sirius because Harry and co. were also in the room and potential casualties, and was willing to hear Sirius out to keep him talking.

And, of course, what Sirius wound up saying made plenty of sense. He hadn't murdered Harry on sight, so there was that in his favor. Plus, he would have wanted to have his friend back.

*** When Lupin met Sirius in the Shack, Harry had already told him about seeing Peter Pettigrew on the map. And he saw them enter the secret passage on the map so he saw the name too. Add to this that he probably knew about Scabbers (since Hermione and Ron did have some pretty loud arguments in the castle about this and Harry may have mentionned it during their Patronus lesson) and he already knew or heavily suspected what had truly hapened.

*** Also I forgot about this until just now but didn't he /see/ Peter's name on the Map? He thought it was a glitch at first, but it made him suspect the truth, which is also why he didn't kill Sirius when he got the drop on them.

** Lots of Lupin-hate in this thread. People like complicated and multi-faceted characters that say something about the human condition, and sometimes that means people like characters that don't always make the right choices and who have pretty big issues. I think he's a brilliant character because of his flaws. He is consistent in his cowardice and he is wracked with guilt and self-loathing. He's more than the perfect teacher we thought he was in PoA, perhaps many people never shed that impression of him, and so when they are faced with the real character, they feel lost and disappointed that he not as ideal as they thought? He seems to me a perfect candidate to be someone's favorite character.

*** This is exactly it. At least I think it is. People are shocked that lovely teacher actually has serious flaws. I've seen people complaining that Remus in DH was out of character. Others said that Remus in HBP was too depressed and why on Earth was he so emotional when Dumbledore died. We get a character with flaws that are obvious and he doesn't always make the right choices, we complain. We get a character who does and says all the right things, we shout Mary Sue. There's no winning here, I'm afraid. There's also the fact that team Harry is ready to find everyone who has wronged Harry and punish them, and Remus is a very good candidate. I sometimes wonder what those people would have done if they had lived the way he did. Like one elderly lady said recently, it's easy to talk about nobility when your stomach and wallet are full. Sorry for my pointless rambling, but I think you are right about people not liking that Remus the teacher didn't do all the right things. The same goes for wise Dumbledore.

**** I feel ya. I was going to say - is it bad that I find it refreshing to see this happen to someone besides Dumbledore? It's probably selfish of me to think that, but it makes it a little bit less about the individual character and more about a reader's interpretation style.

***** I don't know if its selfish. I think we just tend to defend things we like and with fictonal characters it can get very personal, especially if we identify with them. I don't think Dumbledore is the only one who gets this. Snape gets it all the time! I've seen some very negative comments about Molly too. But it's always the same- he/she didn't do what I thought was right, so I dislike that character. I mean, I understand the dislike because it's such a common reason for choosing your favourites and the ones you dislike. I think with fictional characters it ends up being personal anyway. But it sometimes seems strrange that people can't understand why others like characters they don't. It's as if it's impossible to like a character with flaws.I've seen the opposite result too. I commented once that I wasn't as fond of Sirius as others seemed to be since he reminded me too much of Byronic heroes from classic novels. There were a few people who said they were glad they weren't the only ones who weren't Sirius's fans. But I got comments from those who did like him, and I felt as though they thought I was a little odd for not appreciating his tragedy and his good qualities. I do appreciate them, but I just find other qualities I dislike. It seems to me that one has to follow a common trend. In this fandom it's hating Snape and liking Sirius.And if you don't, everyone is surprised. Sometimes it feels like some characters have to go to something resembling that Harry's hearing and readers sit there as judges. But that might be because I've seen some very angry comments. It almost seemed like those characters were real people who had done the reader some great personal wrong. As for Remus, though, it seems a bit strange to me when those who dislike him point out his flaws and then are surprised others like him. Do they think we haven't noticed those flaws? We read the same books after all. I mean, no one would like him or other characters if they were completely immoral murderers or something. But no, maybe they would.But I don't think we have to as if justify our preferences. I mean, I'm often curious, for example, why people like Bellatrix. But with Remus and Snapeit becomes something like,'how dare you like him'. I'm tempted to suggest they analyse those characters or something. I know I read some posts about Dumbledore to understand him better. As for Dumbledore, team Harry is still powerful and I think they are the ones who dislike him the most.Someone made a post which said Vernon wanted Harry to get out in OOTP because he realised his family was in danger. The author got the usual comments about the Dursleys being horrible and how Vernon didn't think Harry was his family too. So, to sum up this long strange post, like characters others like, hate those universaly hated, talk ill about the Dursleys, then you are safe.

****** Hahaa, yes, team Harry. I've never given it a name, but it sums it up perfectly. There always has to be a bad guy. Snape is a perfect example from both perspectives because I have seen people sympathize with Snape at the expense of Dumbledore; for some reason /one of them/ must be bad and the other good, and it is often suggested that Snape was forced to work for Dumbledore when Dumbledore asked the words "and what will you do for me?". As offended as I am for what this means for Dumbledore, I actually think I'm more offended for what this means for Snape. More than once I have seen the word "shackled" used, but if Snape doesn't make the /choice/ to join Dumbledore, then what the hell is the point of these books anyway? Themes? Motifs? Why analyze /those things/. Time also doesn't apparently exist, because if Snape /is ever good/, then Dumbledore ought to have known it all along.

That's why I loved the rankdowns so much. Moose did such a great job enforcing critical thinking, and nobody was ever criticized for showing sympathy for dark and evil characters. In fact, whether or not they were good or evil took a backseat to the other far more important aspects of a character like depth and internal consistency.

** I don't blame Lupin for not contacting Harry as a child. He was a lesser friend it was always James and sirius and two tag alongs. I have 5 friends since childhood but one of them is my best friend beyond everyone else's. But that's not the point of this thread the point is he would've never done anything that would've disappointed Dumbledore. He put Harry put in more danger because he was afraid of disappointing Dumbledore.
