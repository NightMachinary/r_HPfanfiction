Anybody know any good stories where Harry Is A Healer or becomes a Healer


** Why does this get asked like once a week?

Just search this sub for "healer" and you'll find plenty of recommendations on other posts asking the exact same question.

*** along with this, one could also point out that the wrong tag was used: =Recommendation= is for recommending stuff, =Request= would be the correct one to use when one requests a type of fic... and then there exists =What's that fic?=which is for requesting a specific fic one has forgotten/lost.
