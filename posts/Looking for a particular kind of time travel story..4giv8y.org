Are there any stories in which it is clear to us, as readers, that /someone/ has time traveled and is making changes, but we have no idea who?

Just an idea I had, thought it could be interesting.

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love. This story is now complete! Stay tuned for the sequel!

*** I never got very far into this. I couldn't get over Ron grooming an 11 year old to be his wife. However there is another time traveler there with them screwing things up?
