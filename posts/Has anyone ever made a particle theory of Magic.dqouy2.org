To any physicists, or aspiring physicists (like myself), has anyone ever made or thought about a particle theory of magic, much like we have one for electromagnetism, the nuclear interactions, and (ish) gravity, considering Magic as the 5th fundamental interaction? I was thinking about possibly trying to design one myself, to have a bit of fun, but the truth is, I really have no idea where I would start it.

To anyone uninterested in sciences, this is probably really boring and just overall too nerdy, but if anyone has any ideas, or if someone's gone all out and done it before, feel free to comment below. This kind of stems from the fact that I want magic to fit in with the laws of physics in some way, shape or form. Because who doesn't want to believe in magic?


** I'm a theoretical physicist in my day job I believe it'd be a hard sell, honestly, to pull off what you want in a consistent way. Transfiguration, e.g., in the HP world is ridiculously broken in a matter-energy equivalence sense: vanishing a jelly donut means you have to do something with the mc^2 ~10^16 J, about the energy released by a 2 Mton nuclear device. Like watching Marvel Universe films, it's probably best not to over-think it.

*** I had thought about vanishing and conjuring, and they were some of the problems I was running into when trying to make sense of anything. I guess you could pass it off as 'magic can manipulate energy' but that feels kind of boring.

I know, theoretically speaking, that trying to explain magic without bending the laws of physics is impossible, but a man can dream. I just wanted to see if anyone has some sort of creative solution to hurdles like conservation of energy, momentum, etc.

Yeah, but then what does energy even mean, when thinking about fields? If energy isn't constant, a whole lot falls apart.I don't think that the Harry Potter magic system is necessarily good for this. With other fandoms (like Eragon) you probably would have more luck.

Especially since magic appears to be largely concept based (you can curse a teaching position, and when you apparate don't gain momentum based on the delta in latitude, and when you go back in time you stay in the same place, ...), I'm not sure if you could easily make it make sense.

**** I have thought of this myself as well and came up with the idea that maybe creating a QFT of the "magical field" seems to be impossible to realize because of your reasons. But how about just a mathematical formalism for magical interaction, with an own set of rules? Haven't got the time time yet though to come up with something.

** An interesting story idea is that Hsrrh can do anything with magic but the focus required is insane. He needs ti visualise his trnasfiguration on a subatomic level and to cast spells his theoretical knowledge needs to be all the way up there. This also means that with study, he can accomplish anything.
