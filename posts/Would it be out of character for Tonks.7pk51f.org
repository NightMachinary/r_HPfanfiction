To help spread a rumor. The rumor isn't vicious or anything. She just wants my OC to stop spending time with Charlie so she helps spread the rumor that my OC likes someone else namely Aidan Lynch (the now reserve seeker on the Gryffindor team since Charlie is now the main seeker.). Is rumor the right term if it ends up being true?


** I don't think it would be out of character, but I think she would probably feel a bit guilty about it. And if it's true and she knows about it, then I think it would just be gossiping.

** I think it depends. I'd say it's probably in character if she's mad or annoyed, but then when she calmed down she'd feel quite bad about it.

** I don't think it'd be out of character either, although I did think her/remus was out of nowhere and like every other romance in the book didn't fit (Why JK why did you not stick with the original plan for your character spouses? who cares if Ron would have died alone he deserves it for being such a two faced idiot)

**** Oh I have nothing against Charlie, I feel it's a better pairing then Remus. But alot of people like remus/tonks so we all have our preferences, it's harder for me cause I didn't really care for Tonks. I used to ship her with Moody. What is the story about? Is it a romance?

***** I only ship Tonks/Remus because of Teddy.

It centers around the OC older cousin of Oliver Wood named Carrisa or rather Carrie. She's a Hufflepuff in Charlie's year. She's not nearly as obsessed with Quidditch as her cousin. She eventually write for a Quidditch Magazine after she finishes Hogwarts in 1991.

***** Charlie/Tonks used to be pretty popular back in the day. One of my fanfic buddies wrote a fic called "Consequences" that was Tonks/Remus, but had a lot of Charlie baggage. I wrote a one shot companion to it called "Undone". I just looked a the file dates and this was back in 2005. I've asked her if I can post it, so I should really get on that.

**** Harry/Hermione for sure. Not sure on the others tbh. I just noticed every single pairing ever, even down to James/Lily came out of no place. Lily spends 6 years hating james for being a bullying git then suddenly 'oh he's mature now so that makes the last 6 years and his actions okay so i guess i'm in love with him and will date him now'

all of the pairings came out of nowhere. The only one that seems to work is Narcissa/Lucius, and we don't even know that much about them so that could be wrong in itself. I get romance wasn't what HP was about, but if you're going to put it in there at least make it well thought out instead of 'oh crap i need to throw characters together to give them a happily ever after lets see what names i can draw out of a hat'

JK herself said Harry/Hermione would have been a better fit and that was her original plan. I mean Ron for Hermione come on. Lets get real. I hate Canon pairings.

And the cheesy Ginny/Harry shadows of James/Lily? You barely see Ginny/Harry interact, the only "Romance" you see in the book is when the Characters are jealous over the other characters (Ron is jealous that Hermione's with Krum or Cormac, Harry over Michael/dean). But thats not even romance or showing how the feelings developed, or spending time together, or dates, etc. You don't just wake up one morning and go 'oh hey imma be jealous of every person my friend decides to date and thats cause i'm in love with her secretly and just don't know it'. It's so dumb. How one can put pairings together with barely any interaction (Ginny/Harry) or with people who fight more than anything and are complete opposites that would not attract for the sake of giving the ones left alive a happily ever after is just a cop out and is stupid.

I could go on forever about how dumb, lazy and frankly useless canon pairings are.

Her original plan was Ron/Hermione because she saw a bit of herself in Hermione and she's always liked the funny guy, so she stuck stridently to that pair, but she realised after finishing the series she should have been open to changing her plan.

I remember, I think in a tv interview, she said Harry and Hermione had drifted closer than she'd intended by the 4th book, and she considered the idea of them being together in the 7th book, so it's definitely a "what could have been".

  “I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment,” she says. “That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron.”

***** u/themoderntypewriter:

  showing how the feelings developed
#+end_quote

That's simply because it's not a romance story and does not follow a romances story plot. The relationships are really just to make it feel more real (they are teenagers), but won't deny that if she wasn't going to do them well-- she shouldn't have been throwing people together left and right (literally like everyone ended up married with large families at like 22 y/o).

But the only issue I really have with the canon pairings is that they all seemed to have stayed together-- and that's complete nonsense. At least they made Neville and Luna a little realistic in the movies-- yeah, the guy ends up with a crush on her, but do they end up married with three kids? No.

I feel like Hermione and Ron would have gone their own way, Tonks and Remus definitely would have divorced if they were still alive. Harry and Ginny -- MAJOR ISSUES there, both of them psychologically fucked up from the trauma. Don't even know how they managed to have kids, and how Harry didn't end up a raging alcoholic. But, then again, not a romance novel so what can we do.

****** Thats true, and you made some good points. Ron is so close-minded and prejudiced in his own ways, Very intolerant of anything that isn't like him or fits his beliefs. No way Hermione would have fit well with that.

I don't think Tonks would have put up with Remus's self-pity for long, honestly I feel it was more of a 'well I may die but want to be married before i do lets get hitched' type of thing.

*** Whether or not JKR was still in 2 minds at the end, I don't know, but R/Hr certainly wasn't out of the blue, just hidden really well at the beginning.

As early as book one's "You've got dirt on your nose". On book 2 you see Ron staunchly defending Hermione in that "eat slugs" incident. Ron's hatred of Lockhart who Hermione had a crush on. Book 3 has Ron and Hermione going to Hogsmeade without Harry and greatly enjoying themselves. By book 4 it was just blatantly obvious to be honest.

** Tonks is an interesting character to write because you have many options how you are going to develop her and you need to make up a personality and a backstory for Andromeda as well. Let's go over Andromeda first. (Obviously, if Tonks is just a minor background character in that fic then just write the scene).

When writing anything to the Tonks family you need to make up a headcanon for the Andromeda/Bella/Narcissa relationship and how their marriages came to be. If Andromeda and her sisters got along and were close then it stands to reason that Andi was not that different from her sisters, personality wise. She would be somewhat vicious and pragmatic, willing to cross lines to protect those she was close to. Did her sisters support the marriage with Ted? Were they rebels themselves? How did Bella fall and so on. You don't need to write that, just think about it. Andromeda's life experiences and feelings for her family are relevant since they would influence how she raised her daughter. If you go with that kind of personality she would raise Tonks with similar morals, which would make your idea perfectly fine, unless she is close to the OC then it would be a no-go. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7o2j43/how_to_write_the_most_noble_and_ancient_house_of/ds6fiyb/][For a more detailed version of that Andromeda, personality check out another post I made on the topic]].

If Andromeda had been an outsider in her family she would try to raise Nymphadora as different as possible compared to her own upbringing, meaning a lot "lighter" morales. While teenagers have a tendency to act without thinking, Tonks might very well spread the rumour but she'd feel bad about it afterwards, possibly confessing her "deed" if she is friends with your OC.

As for Tonks herself you need to decide on her personality and how her metamorphic abilities influenced her time at Hogwarts. Was she seen as the fun girl you like to hang out with? One of the boys? The school slut? The unobtainable sex doll? Note that I am talking about perception here, not what she actually did. If most of the girls call her a slut despite her not sleeping around, it would still be no problem for Tonks to deliver some payback via rumour. If most of the boys were dicks to her but she had some good female friends (including your OC) she would not spread the rumour.

We know that Tonks was a rulebreaker at Hogwarts, the question is whether she was closer to "hey guys, I nicked some Weed and Vodka so let's have fun" or to "Fuck that bitch, she had it coming." Was she seen as the daughter of a blood traitor by half of the purebloods, the niece of Bellatrix Lestrange or was her family background inconsequential? Depending on your headcanon that gives you an entirely different personality and therefore a different answer to your question. Just keep it consistent throughout your story.

*** I kind of picture of her being one of the boys while my OC is sort of a bookworm but is very fond of Quidditch being the cousin of Oliver Wood. She has a slight rivalry with my OC just because they are both friends with Charlie.

Most of the time I tend to characterize her more like her dad Ted.
