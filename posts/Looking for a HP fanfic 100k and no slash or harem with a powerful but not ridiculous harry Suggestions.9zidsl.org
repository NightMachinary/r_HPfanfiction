** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] is a long (440k) series about Harry praying to Loki for help summer before second year. I recommend this all the time, but it's not new so you may have already read it. Some minor characters are slash, but not Harry. By the end you're not given a pairing for Harry but it's made obvious that he likes girls due to previous dating history. Harry is powerful due to Loki forcing him into taking his studies more seriously and fulfilling his potential.

** Well, that's a broad spectrum of fics. I'll suggest a few of my favourites, but If you'd give me more filters to suggest, it would be better.

linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky; The Legacy by Storytellerspw; The Mind Arts; A beautiful lie maybemayba; The Merging; The Other Boy who lived; Hogwarts Battle School; Imprisioned Realm; Honour Thy Blood; Delenda Est; Stepping Back; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

The only one I could consider to be "ridiculous" would be the Harry from Mind Arts, but in the latest chapter he took quite a beating from a minion, so its arguable.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** Well, none of these have a really dark!Harry, though Imprisioned Realm IS a really dark and grim fic. Eclipse of the Sky has a Harry that is war-weary and extremely protective, so he started to do EVERYTHING against his enemies to protect and save his loved ones, mostly Kally. But only the last 3 chapters is where he's been actually dark as to torture and killing in rage. So there's that. Its actually in my top 3 favourite fic of all time.

****** Word of warning, this fic was started before the 6th book released, so there's no plot similar to it, no Prince and w/e. The author implemented Horcruxes though, but they are completely different and way way bad-ass-er than in canon.

Also, Harry is quite paranoid and prejudicial against those he thinks to be DE, and both him and Kalliandra are extremely stubborn, but don't be discouraged because of it.
