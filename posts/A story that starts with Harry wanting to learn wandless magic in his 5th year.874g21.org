Like, he reflects on the Chamber of Secrets, Quidditch World Cup aftermath, the Little Hangleton graveyard, the dementors in Surrey and the Ministry trying to expel him, and he decides he needs to find a way to cast magic without a wand?

I'm sitting on an idea like this that has him turn to Dobby to teach him (after all, house-elves use wandless magic all the time), but has anyone written a fic that starts like the above already?


** This is the only similar fic I can think of. Linkffn(2954601) is your typical post-OOTP fanfic. Cue sudden determination to work hard, learn Occulmency and trip to buy a trunk similar to the one Madeye uses... However, Harry does learn wandless magic and uses it in battles.

As for Dobby teaching Harry wandless magic, (not sure if its headcannon), Dobby shouldn't be able to teach Harry wandless magic as they are different creatures. Besides, if Dobby could really teachh Harry wandless magic, why havent other wizards and witches exploited elves?

they are too complacent,

Also can be used to get around/through wards, as seen when dobby teleports harry and co from Malfoy Manor in the deathly hallows.

**** I have to disagree. Surely not all wizards and witches are complacent with the exception of Harry. If that's the case, then Harry becoming friends with goblins as he was the only one to address them by name and no other witch or wizard did so - is a legit thing.

***** Im talking about those who are rich enough to own them. The ones that did find out, would be smart enough to keep quiet about it.

So, purebloods, yes, I can see them being complacent enough. But if a first-gen, owned one, Then...
