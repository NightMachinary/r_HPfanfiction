** I believe that's a plotpoint in linkao3(9821300), although quite late in the story. It's not necessarily just Harry, but Hogwarts starts accepting Squibs.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** Core Threads is the only one I can remember seeing this happen in. It's not a popular trope, I don't think I've seen it in anything else.

I know of a few where he /tries/ to give /muggles/ magic, or at least thinks about it (can't remember names though, just remember it happening a few times) but not many where he actually does such a thing.
