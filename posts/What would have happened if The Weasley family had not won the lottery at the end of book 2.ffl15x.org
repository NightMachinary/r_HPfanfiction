** Sirius probably wouldn't have escaped Azkaban as he wouldn't have seen the Weasleys picture. Harry would have probably gone to stay with them after blowing up Marge (think this was mentioned in the book that he would have gone to them).

The dementors wouldn't be sent to Hogwarts, so Harry and Lupin wouldn't really talk, I doubt, so the relationship wouldn't develop a lot. Maybe Harry would never find out about his friendship with James. Because the dementors aren't out and neither is Sirius, Harry wouldn't need to be as protected. He wouldn't be able to go Hogsmeade - no signature - so maybe he still gets the map, but he wouldn't be watched as closely.

As he isn't forced to sneak around as much, he likely wouldn't hear about Sirius supposedly betraying his parents, and so wouldn't know about having another family member.

Peter wouldn't have escaped from Ron - or maybe he would've because Lupin was working there (still pretty unlikely though).

I think he would still have gone missing at the end of year 3 to help Voldemort, but maybe he wouldn't. I mean, why exactly did he go? He had heard about Voldemort possessing rats. Did he go because of loyalty to the Dark Lord (doubtful)? Or because he had nowhere to go that would be reasonably safe with Sirius, Lupin and a group of kids knowing who he really was? Maybe if Sirius didnt escape, his identity wouldn't be compromised, so he wouldn't need to leave his safety.

It depends where you might want to take it after this.

1- His identity is found out by Lupin - this isn't too likely. How many teachers spend time watching kids' pets? Or maybe he gets the map and sees Peter on it. I'm not too sure if its fanon, but I'm pretty sure that though most cannot see animagi on the map (this is only in the film that Harry sees him), maybe theres a loophole that you need to know what they are to be able to see their name - this could be pretty interesting to explore. I think either way, if Lupin found him, it's pretty likely that Peter would be captured - Lupin's shown to be pretty level-headed, so I'd think he'd be pretty reasonable, but maybe not. Maybe Peter escapes regardless and everything continues as in canon, maybe not...

If Peter's captured, its change a lot. Hed be put on trial. Sirius would likely be freed and compensated. Peter would likely throw others under the bus. Maybe a lot of death eaters would be jailed, slowing the progress of raising Voldemort.

2- Voldemort could be brought back by Peter, who has run away to raise his master after hearing rumours, who he may be loyal to, or who he may just believe has a larger chance of winning the war.

3- Peter stays with Ron. He hasnt had any issues and isn't in any danger. Wormtail strikes me as the type to stay where he is comfortable, and he is. He's fed real food, warm, not in any danger etc. Why would he want to compromise this?

If Peter stays, is Voldemort raised? At the moment, he's nothing, just possessing animals, slowly gaining power.

I'm pretty sure Crouch Jr. is out of Azkaban at this time, so maybe he's about to break his father's Imperius. Maybe he is able to raise Voldemort himself. This would change a few things though, who would do the potion? Would Crouch become Moody or would something else be decided?

It'd depend on which way you wanted to go I think, and theres probably other changes, but these are all I can think of at the moment.

*** Nice description of the potential events. If I had one modification to make, it would be that Sirius evasion probably played a very big role in Lupin hiring as the DADA teacher. Without the threat of Sirius on Harry, I doubt Dumbledore would have approached him, and with the character of Lupin, he would also probably would not have agreed without a very good reason (like a chance to catch the betrayer of his friends).

So without the Weasleys going to Egypt, Harry would probably have had a different teacher for this year (maybe Moody or just a full OC).

*** Crookshanks would still be all over wormtails ass so that might account for hermione and ron fighting all of book 3.

Assuming pettigrew stays in hiding, I dont think crouch would be able to get out. He is able to break free from the imperious momentarily but without pettigrew capturing bertha jorkins, Voldemort wouldnt know who casted the dark mark at the world cup. So likely moody is safe and the triwizard cup proceeds normally with harry watching from the sidelines and not as an actual competitor.

I think peter only left because he got found out pretty much. He sought voldemort out after Sirius tried to kill him out of fear being in jail. If theres no major threat, he would just remain in hiding.

Pettigrew only knew to go to Albania because he could talk to rats. So I dont think crouch jr could have found him even if he did break out of the imperious curse fully.

So I think the only possibilities are lupin seeing wormtail on the map or sirius somehow proving his innocence. Maybe harry or lupin visit him in azkaban?

Voldemort could potentially make his way back to England at some point. I believe lucius would still have helped him regain a body. He was a high enough ranking death eater that Voldemort gave him a horcrux.

*** Pettigrew's early capture happens in many fanfics, but to me it seems like the authors just want justice for Sirius, and that's why realism has to make way.

Why would the revelation of Pettigrew being alive make him a suspect of any foul play? His survival is not even a hint towards him being the traitorous Secret Keeper and the one who killed the twelve Muggles. He could just claim, "I survived Sirius's attack by turning into a rat, and then I wanted to start a new life! My old one was ruined! I was afraid of the Death Eaters who remained free! Besides, I am an unregistered Animagus, and that would've caused trouble." Who would dispute this, and on what premise?

Remember how Lupin learned of Pettigrew's duplicity. He saw on the Marauder's Map Sirius attacking Pettigrew instead of Harry. When he got to the Shrieking Shack, he allowed Sirius to explain his actions, and only then it all made sense. Had Lupin bumped into Pettigrew at some earlier point of time, he would not have any suspicions.

I think that if the Weasleys had not won the drawing, the entire plot of Harry Potter from that point onwards would have been totally derailed. Probably at some point Voldemort would have found a new host and started new plans of returning to his own body. Harry might have already graduated from Hogwarts at that point.

**** The premise that living as a rat isn't exactly a new life, but looks a lot like hiding. Also, maybe someone would seek to declare a mistrial ("Clearly, Black can't have been guilty of Pettigrew's murder, he's /right there/"), and then find out there was none.

** In a lot of agreement with other posters. Sirius wouldn't get the push he needed to escape and no dementors would be at Hogwarts. It fits with Lupins character to refuse the post at Hogwarts without feeling like he needed to be there to protect Harry/catch Sirius. Going with Dumbledore's difficulty in finding suitable teachers he probably would have asked for Moody this year. Without being replaced by Crouch, Moody would be able to teach for a year with no downsides. Peter has no reason to flee.

Voldemort fled to Albania after being defeated by baby Harry and stayed there for 10 years before having the opportunity to hitch a ride back to try to get both Harry and the Stone. After being defeated by a first year he flees back again and stays there for two more years until someone comes to get him. Without someone to help him regain a body he is unlikely to exert any efforts to leave his hideaway.

Crouch Jr. broke free of Sr's control at the world cup but was immediately put under more severe control after being caught. Without Voldemort to free him it is unlikely that he will ever have the chance again, Sr would probably kill him first.

No Voldemort, no Peter, no missing Bertha, no Crouch, and Goblet of Fire is another easy year. Unknown who would teach Defense. It's possible that hearing about the Dark Mark being cast at the World Cup would send Peter packing to look for Voldemort, but it would be too late to plot with the Tournament. Though I feel it's unlikely, coward as he is, that he would jump ship without being sure that he has no alternative.

Most likely scenario in this thought experiment is that Voldemort doesn't return for a number of years, waiting until he has a solid plan to regain a body and power and someone to help him achieve that.

Would make for a decent set up to a fic where Harry doesn't have to face Voldemort again until he's older where Dumbledore can tell him things at an appropriate age like he wanted, where he can train, and have a decently normal childhood before the second war.

** There was a One Shot posted a few days ago, can't remember the name.

Lupin is still DADA Professor. Sirius doesn't escape and Scabbers isn't a nervous wreck so Ron takes him to a few classes, including boggart day. The boggart targets Peter and turns into Sirius and goes after the rat loudly talking about the traitor and framing him.

*** Problem is Dementors dont target Animagus, because to them they just look like animals. Boggarts are probably the same in that regard.

** JKR would have had to write a summer in which Harry visited The Burrow (again) as there'd be no reason not to invite him. Opening of POA would be more boring as it would have repeated the opening of CoS.

There are a lot of repeated elements of the Harry Potter stories - summer before school, Hogwarts Express, the Sorting, Quidditch - and through the series you can clearly track JKR desperately trying to avoid having to write them again or put a fresh twist on them.
