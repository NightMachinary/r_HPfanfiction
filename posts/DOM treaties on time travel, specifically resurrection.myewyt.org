During testing of the new time turner devices it was determined that is was possible to change time. However, due to the side effects of changing time, the wizarding public was only told that "bad things happen to wizards who meddle with time". At the time this was considered enough to keep most wizards from meddling in a very difficult and dangerous field of magic.

After the second wizarding war there was a large uptick of accidents related to wizards trying to meddle with time. The DOM was forced to reconsider their stance on not releasing the findings of at least one of their trials. Wizards kept trying to find a way to go back in time to change the past so their loved ones wouldn't die. The following is a portion of a treaties on time travel that the DOM released the the public, specifically regarding resurrection:

Previous tests of the new time turner devices have shown that an individual can travel back in time without adverse reaction as long as they do not interact with anyone they interacted with during that same time period before traveling in time. Further testing showed that by changing the time line, those affected by the change would find themselves confused, paranoid and in some cases suffering severe cases of deja vu. In dept study of souls tells us that our souls are made up of not only our essence but our memories and other experiences. By changing the past you remove events that helped define souls. Since time turners are limited in how far back they can go the damage done by changing the time line is minimal and these souls soon recover and time continues.

However there are events in life that a soul can not recover from. One of these events is death. Death leaves a mark upon the soul that can not be healed or erased. During Voldemorts first rise to power the DOM attempted to use time turners to reverse the death of several high level, key members of the ministry. While the attempt succeeded, the subjects came back changed. The subjects tended to act more brashly and were more wiling to throw themselves into dangerous situations. Eventually over time the subjects would withdraw from social life, becoming depressed and suicidal. Eventually all the subjects died either by entering dangerous situations without planning or backup or by taking their own lives.

One resurrection attempt was made by traveling further back in time using a ritual instead of a time turner. A young orphan with no family ties, who died in the war, was chosen as the subject. The subject was moved to a secure location several month before his death in the original timeline. The subject showed no adverse effects from the change in the timeline until the date of his original death. As with the original subject, the young orphan fell into depression and ended his own life.

The conclusion determined by extensive testing into the matter of resurrection via time travel is that it is not possible. The soul remembers its death and that can not be changed.

** This sounds amazing for a one shot!

** Quite nice.

However, considering the context around it I believe you intended to use ‘treatise,' meaning a formal document that deals with one subject, rather than ‘treaties' which is the plural of ‘treaty,' an agreement between two countries.
