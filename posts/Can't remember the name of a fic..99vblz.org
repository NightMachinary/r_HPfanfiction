The blood magic in the wards/Harry made privet drive a haven for dark stuff, he got adopted by werewolves, there were vampires and a hag. It was adorable. I want to read it again/see if any more has been written.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
