** Oh man, that took me back. Uh--it turns out it isn't quite what you were asking for, the premise here is that Sirius stayed the Secret Keeper, but I promise it does some interesting stuff with Pettigrew too. I never got around to finishing it (I think because it wasn't finished when I was reading it), and it was published, God, more than a decade ago, but I do remember finding it really interesting--

The Unbroken Trilogy, by Robin4 on ff.net. First book is Promises Unbroken, here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken]].

(I can think of another fic where he doesn't betray the Potters and isn't just treated as an awful guy, but there the premise is that Voldemort is actually going after Neville. Hmmm. It's weird, but you're right, I can't quite think of one where the point of divergence is that Pettigrew never broke.)

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.

** *Stepping Back* linkffn(12317784)

Post 5th Year Harry /permanently/ goes back in time to sixth year Marauders' era. Harry unintentionally prevents Peter from happening. It does show a believable reason why he did the betrayal in the first place. And Peter does find out what /could/ have happened. It does have the whole "omgwtfbbq X betrayed Y" and "holyshit X killed Y!" angst moments.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
