** Linkffn(Intersecting Realities by rightous malestrom) is a rather clever take on it. He refuses to solve their problems but instead trains/helps his (female) counterpart so that she may. However he does end up helping in the final battle.

** linkffn(11160991) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/21/0800-Rent-A-Hero]]

it's just great, unfortunately it seems to be abandoned, it does really interesting exploration of Divination as a valid and useful form of magic

** I'll put a good word in for linkffn(12383390)

Female, somewhat AU, extremely competent fem!HP wakes (not yet explained how) in the Spine of Alagaesia, with a dragon egg.

It's in progress, and due to her being competent and somewhat genre-savvy...

In particular, Eragon is not such a naive blunderer.

It's a fun read.

** Well, both are more humorous fics than serious fics.

Linkffn(Summoning for Dummies by Right What is Wrong)

Linkffn(Dimension hopping for beginners by nonjon)

I cannot remember any other fics off the top of my head. Will have to check my bookmarks if you want more. Added links since the bot doesn't seem to be working.
