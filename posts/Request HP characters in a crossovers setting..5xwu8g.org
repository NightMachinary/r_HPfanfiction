#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** You could try Tell Me The Reason Why, lnkffn(6328962): It's a HPxGundam fanfic, it takes place mostly in the Wizarding World. It's Slash, so if you don't like that, you might not like this.

** Browncoat, Green Eyes puts Harry into the Firefly universe after the events of Serenity. It's pretty well written and feels like a great continuation of the Firefly universe.

The Wizard of Harrenhall puts Harry into the GoT universe, though it isn't clear to me whether it's the universe of the books or the universe of the TV show. It's an interesting take on things, but there's a paucity of actual plot tension.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(7718942;12040341): The first story is a Star Wars crossover, in which Harry followed Sirius through the Veil and ended up in the SW universe. Emperor Palpatine captured him and successfully turned him into a vicious Sith. Harry returned after 4 years in the SW universe, but only 41 days in his home universe, extremely powerful and terrifying. Hermione and Luna managed to moderate him somewhat, but at cost of becoming quite dark themselves. Together they embarked on a megalomaniac plan of global domination.

In the sequel, their plan was disrupted by treachery and they were forced to leave Earth through the Star Gate. Out there, the power Trio took their fight to the Goa'ulds, and their ambitions now extended to the entire Galaxy.

They are now my favorite HP crossovers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]], linkffn(11027086), is an excellent HP/LOTR fic, but only Harry made it there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5291694/Steelbadger][The same author]] wrote and is writing many other great HP crossovers, focusing on LOTR world.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136), is Ginny and Sirius in Essos. It's another curb-stomp, but at least with different characters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6055799/Katie-Macpherson][The same author]] is also writing several other HP/GoT crossovers with female!Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Padma.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Ã‰owyn.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

** Shameless self-promotion-- I'm writing (and posting) a HP X Mass Effect crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12132088/1/Beyond-The-Veil][Beyond the Veil]]

It's got a good 100k words in it already, and has been well-received so far. (I think.)
