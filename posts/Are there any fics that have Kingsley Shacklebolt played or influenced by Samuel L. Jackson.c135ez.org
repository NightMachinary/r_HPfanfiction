*** Pulp Fiction and Harry Potter crossover... Ron could play the boxer, with a goblin mob boss, Fleur as the boss' girlfriend, Kingsley as the BAMF, maybe instead of Albus as his partner, put Aberforth in (he is the owner of the Hog's Head)... hmmm, Harry and Hermione as the robbers?

Meh, there's quite a few kinks to work out but that would be highly entertaining!

** Pretty sure Nightmares of Futures Past used this one a bit. Harry panicked when he met past!Kingsley because the guy had been dead for a while from his perspective and covered for it by claiming Kingsley reminded him of Sam Jackson. He didn't have much of a presence in the fic, though.

** I'd love an Idris Elba type Kingsley. He seemed to be characterized that way in the books but because of the movies you don't see it as much in fanfics

#+begin_quote
  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

** I think there's a joke in Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past, where Harry notes that Kingsley looks like Samuel L. Jackson, and Kingsley takes it as a compliment... but that probably doesn't count?
