Imagine back before the statute of secrecy, when magic was known, magical creatures were common. The wizards of the time didnt care, they had their own magic to protect them. However the muggles couldnt take the creatures with the pitiful weapons of their time, so a group of muggles hired the help of several wizards and together created potions (mutagens) from monster parts, and used these potions and specially designed rituals to create Witchers.

When the wizards found out they tried to exterminate the entire group and all witchers due to the procedures granting witchers with a small control over magic and incredible physical and mental prowess. Only muggles could survive the procedure, since the inherent magic in a wizard interferred with the magic that was imbued into the person.

However, some witchers managed to escape, and eventually they proved their usefulnes by slaying magical creatures that were terrorizing even magical towns.

Obviously this can be alterred any number of ways, all to the authors discretion. Maybe Lilys protection protects harry from the harmful effects of the procedure, maybe Geralt comes across Harry as he runs from the Dursleys and takes him in to train him and becoming a father figure to harry like he did to ciri. Sorceresses could be magicals that dismiss the magic of modern times, using the language of the almost extinct Elven race and despising the art of wandcraft, believing it unnatural. Hell it could be turned to a crack story by making Hagrid a witcher and care of magical creatures a sort of witcher school-lite

This is my first prompt so forgive me for any errors.

** Slight tangent, but Ciri would be the perfect 'device' to create a crossover between Harry Potter and The Witcher. It's canon that Game!Ciri went to Cyberpunk's world when she was fleeing the Wild Hunt.

**** Cirilla is known as the Lady of Time and Space. While escaping the Wild Hunt (a group of Aen Elle), Cirilla went from world to world and, in the game The Witcher 3, she recounts to Geralt after he found her that for nearly a year she was in a world where people all had "houses of glass" and "ships that fly" as well as other things such as crossbow-like objects that fire at incredible speeds (that's guns and stuff). This was a reference from the studio making the game about their next future game: Cyberpunk 2077.

***** Cybernetics. Like, a metal arm that can lift tons of weight, or a computer in your brain that can calculate things lightning fast, or a metal spine that never dislocates any vertebrae.

*** Yeah I enjoy those stories aswell, hell The Swallow and the Dragon was one of my favourite witcher stories, but they're pretty common. Ive never seen the witcher lore combined with HP lore.

[SPOILER] Maybe when Ciri defeats the white frost the magical magnitude of that event causes the two worlds to merge?

*** Eh, its more of a harry wishes really hard to be somewhere else, maybe a few sentences about the witcher, then randomly he goes back to the hp world and automatically finds Hermione and decides to abandon his search of his new family to train her for some reason.

Thanks for the suggestion.
