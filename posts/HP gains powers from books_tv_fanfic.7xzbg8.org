As above, i love fics where harry gains inspiration to learn more/new magic from non-magical sources.

Basically i had the thought, how cool would a story be if Harry sat at a pc, googled his name for fun, and found fanfiction? Follow that up with him reading super!harry fics, or pre-hogwarts fics, and going "wait, i can do that!? Does that even work!?" Really just harry reading fanfiction and learning magic from his alternate fictional self.

But seeing as i dont believe those stories actually exist yet, i hope to at least find some good stories where Harry learns magic from other places than hogwarts :)


** "Harry reads fanfiction" probably exists in some form. I think I even read some forgettable ones, but they were basically parodies / mocking fanfic tropes, not Harry getting any sort of inspiration from them.

For Harry learning fictional magic, there's linkffn(10681251). It's honestly not my thing at all, but it sounds what you're looking for.

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.
