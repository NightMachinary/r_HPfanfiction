Would like to know difference between them and which one is a better indicator of quality of fiction on AO3.


** - Kudos = similar to Reddit upvotes or Facebook likes. Used by the Ao3 community to indicate "good fic" without spamming one-liners in the comments section.

- Comments = equivalent to FFN reviews. You can post your thoughts, critiques, or commentary on individual chapters, and it shows up under each chapter of the story. Unlike in FFN's review section, the author and other readers can write direct replies to everyone's comments, which allows community discussion. And unlike FFN's review section, the author can delete all reviews if they choose. On FFN, the author can only delete reviews left by guest users, and the ones that are just mean stay up for good unless they break FFN T&C.

- Hits = pageviews. Doesn't mean much as an indicator for fic quality, as older fics will naturally accrue thousands of hits just for being old. Fics with walls of pointless tags will also collect views for showing up in many searches. And pornfics will get lots of views from horny people, but get little engagement.

If you want to search for quality fics, look for other users' recommendations or reviews, or sort by comments and bookmarks. Bookmarks are used by people who want to save a fic to re-read for later, and there's a "heart" bookmark option that acts as a recommendation.

*** I really wish there was a kudos/hit ratio we could see. I think that's a quick way to see the quality of a fic (at least in the eyes of the reading community on ao3).

**** I remember there being some userscript that did that. Wasn't that special. Though since it wasn't native to the site it was not working the best way. I remember that it could show the kudos/hit ratio of every fic but could only sort fics loaded on the current page.
