Eg Snape time travels back to his childhood and Lily ditches him even earlier because he's so obsessive and clingy. He later gets expelled for using the dark arts on Sirius when he's only 12 and his pranks are still schoolboy level and Sirius was nothing but nice to him after he was sorted into Hufflepuff anyway...


** Hermione makes such an effort to include Neville and improve his confidence (Even befriending him before Hogwarts!) that his grandmother never feels the need to send him a Remembrall. As such Harry never gets on the Quidditch team which Hermione loves, more time to study and train! He gets eaten by a dragon in 4th year.

** The worst thing about time travel would be going to school again. I think the most unrealistic thing in such fics (besides the whole "time-travel to a magic school" thing) is when Harry comes across as a genius and/or takes his OWLs and NEWTs early. Copying this from a comment I made on post a while back:

#+begin_quote
  I also like to see him frustrated by school. Too many of them have Harry be a super student the second time around, but I find that unlikely. He was pretty much a slacker the first time around. (Yes, Ron encouraged him to skive off, but Hermione encouraged him to study; it's on him which one he followed.) But the thing is, he still has to do all the school work. Yeah, he can possibly cast the spells, but classwork is largely theory. Essays are essays, and a pain in the butt no matter how old you are. And just because he did it before doesn't mean he retained it: anybody who ever watched the game show "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?" knows that adults have forgotten much of the schoolwork they learned. So basically, he's an adult being forced to go to school all over again, and it sucks. No, he probably can't just go take his OWLs and NEWTs and be hailed as a prodigy.

*** I agree it will be frustrating. The best thing about being an adult is freedom. Having to do all the schoolwork, spend times with 11 year olds, and having to adhere to curfews and restrictions would be very annoying.

I kinda disagree on the whole prodigy thing though. An average adult wizard would be so much better at magic, and their ability to relearn would make them seem like a prodigy in the first couple years.

Of course by the time they get to say OWLs or NEWT their skill might average down, but I feel like the teachers would be pretty impress when first year Harry do a summoning charm or the shield charm.

I see it as sort of a diminishing return kind of thing. Harry would probably coast through the first 1-4 year but all of the more advance stuff year 5 and over might be difficult if he doesn't use them routinely in his adult life.

His skill and instinct would seem a bit arbitrary. Certain spells he can do easily. Other spells that are similarly difficult seems to require a lot of studying and practicing.

Of course unless he is comprehensively tested, this might not come up.

His relationship with the Dursleys is even frostier due to some cutting remarks he made about Petunia's relationship with her sister, eventually escalating into violence during the summer holidays before second year and making his living situation untenable. He also has a more distant relationship with Professor Dumbledore, because he isn't sure what Dumbledore would do if he found out Harry's altering the timeline, so Fawkes doesn't come to help him in the Chamber of Secrets.

** I highly doubt a Peggy Sue Snape would be expelled for using Dark Magic on a schoolmate, at least not unintentionally. I can definitely see Lily being offput from him being clingy though, allthough I suspect he might have been that way the first go-around as well, if not moreso compared to how he would be in a do-over.

But to be honest, I think the main "unrealism" in Snape re-dos specifically is him acting way too nice in them, and too much like a Gryffindor, and the war being more successful than it ought to be. After all, how much does he know about the horcruxes? Sure, hindsight might allow an early death for Voldemort, but not a permanent one with Horcruxes still being around.

I've actually been tempted to write a Snape version of Sisyphus. First re-do is your typical "he gets the girl, the war is won, and he lives a long perfect life". Then he gets a second do-over... and is miserable because he misses his past life with children, wife, etc.

In The Apprentice, a Snape time travel, Snape does all he can to get out of Hogwarts and do something else. In linkffn(Strange Attractors) Hermione is in her 20s when she travels back in time, but she suffers partial memory loss so she continues school.

** I'd love to see a Hermione focused story in the vein of X-Men: House of X where she has a set reincarnation/time loop point and each time tries to fix things but ends up overcorrecting and messing things up.

*Some example ideas:*

- Hermione is able to alert the authorities to the Dursleys' abuse and Harry goes to a foster family. Harry grows up not bullied and somewhat spoiled, which leads to him dismissing the Weasleys and building a friendship with Draco Malfoy when approached.

- Hermione spends the whole of book 1 trying to dissuade Harry and Ron from investigating the Stone - reasoning that it will be safe inside the Mirror of Erised, only to be foiled at every turn by dumb luck and coincidences. Harry and Ron, turned off by her nagging, proceed to slip under her nose to protect it by themselves, and are crushed by the Devil's Snare.

- An adult Hermione, bullied by Ron aged 11, snaps back at him one day and turns the whole Weasley family against her.

- Hermione expects Harry and Ron to be more competent than they are in COS and is caught brewing the Polyjuice/kidnapping Crabbe and Goyle. All three are suspended or expelled from the school.

- Hermione attempts to retrieve and destroy the horcrux diadem nearly as soon as she gets to Hogwarts, but is lured in by the promise of knowledge and possessed. At the same time, another shard of Voldemort is possessing Ginny.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** Draco goes back in time determined to be less of a prat and on the right side of the war this time. After making friends with Harry in Diagon Alley and getting sorted into Gryffindor his parents express concern that his mental state has been compromised by spells. A thorough examination reveals 30 years of memories in their 11 year old son's brain. The Malfoys study the memories in a pensieve and make contact with Voldemort while he is in Quirrels body in order to help him gain a body sooner and win the war. Draco is obliviated and sent to school at Durmstrang

** That depends, are we talking HP style Time Travel, where everything you do is what you've already done, and history is immutable? Are we talking Back To The Future style, where if you change history in a big enough way then you get deleted? Or are we talking Multiverse Style, where you can do whatever the F you want, with no consequences?

Because, Time Turners have pretty much always existed in the HP-Verse, so if they let you change history without consequence, history would be in a constant state of flux. Someone wouldn't like it the way it was, so they'd change it, just for Someone Else to change it again, and again, and again. Time Turners are too common for that to work out all that well.

Otherwise, either everything is always as it would ever be, or Bad Things happen to a wizard that messes with time.

*** I think the question was in regards to Peggy Sue situations where the time traveler is in their younger body with all the future memories.

Like if you woke up tomorrow at age 11, like a do-over

******* I haven't read it, but skimming the first chapter it seems to fit.

A few others are backwards with purpose, a twisted timeline, or reunion.

** I know everyone says this is what they would do, but if I was a SI in any capacity, spilling the beans to Dumbledore would be the very last thing i would do. Especially if I was Harry. The guy always had some backstage plan involving that poor kid's life. And at some point, he even explicitly says he started setting him up to die.

Nah, the fear of being Obliviated and gods know what else would keep me as far away from Dumbledore as possible. And start learning Occlumency asap. In all honesty, I think a peggy sue quickly wrapping up all the problems is exactly what would happen. What time-travel stories completely ignore is the regular things. All the frustrations of everyone you knew being extinct. The frustration of every woman, or man, you now feel attracted to being a few decades older than your body, and thus would instantly reject even your smoothest advances. Having to go through homework again. Childhood. Chores. Plus, all the PTSD, anxiety, depression and survivor guilt, if the time you travelled from was a giant fuck up. But power wise, horcrux hunt wise, dealing with DEs wise, the MC would be a giant peggy sue, and it's silly to complain about it.
