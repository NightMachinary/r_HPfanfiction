** linkffn(Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7) is definitely what you're looking for. It's a wrong!BWL story but I think it's really well done. My only problem with it is how stretched out the ending is, but that doesn't really detract from how good the majority of it is.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

*** (Not OP) I'm intrigued, but somewhat scared off by the 600,000+ word count. Does the story drag on or does the plot move the whole time?

**** Honestly, I have no idea. It was very popular a while ago. So there should be a reason behind it?

I know of horcrux in it only because I was searching for the promised MoD!Harry content there (I literally used ctrl+F for it, jumped across the whole document and accidentally noticed the dialogue about making a horcrux)

Here are some mentions on reddit: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/39ssjj/looking_for_some_good_harryvoldy_fanfics/cs70jrd/][1]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4y7cyp/looking_for_time_travel_with_harry_going_evil/d6ogj3m/][2]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6n22b7/lf_time_travel_where_the_person_going_back_in/dk64nb0/][3]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6eq7eo/lf_a_fic_about_the_rise_of_tom_riddle/dict70d/][4]]

** linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) apparently has harry create a correct a horcrux, though for the life of me I've never been able to spot where he does in the fic. It's a bit hit and miss with people here as a story; personally I quite like it.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
