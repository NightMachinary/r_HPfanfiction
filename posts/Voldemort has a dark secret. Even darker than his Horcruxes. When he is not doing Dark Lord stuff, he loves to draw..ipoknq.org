** When Lord Voldemort was but young, orphaned Tom Riddle, he'd sought many a method to escape his miserable existence, if only for a brief moment.

The other boys would play games; they'd wrestle, play footie with a mostly deflated ball, play at war in anticipation of going to war and leaving their current hellhole for a different one.

But such things did not interest him. Even in the beginning, before his own brilliance had isolated him from his lessers, he had no care for such things.

In desperation, he turned to the girls of the orphanage. He never approached them, nor they him (they were wary of all boys) but he was able to observe them, and the different ways they played. It was mostly domestic, though; cooking, cleaning, tea-time. Pretending that they were all part of a family, a family that wanted them, instead of abandoning them through death or neglect.

But there was one 'girly' activity that appealed to young Tom Riddle. Drawing. There was something soothing about creating something from nothingness. Bringing life to blank white sheets through murky black ink.

The matron of the orphanage, Mrs. Cole, had even smiled at him once, and suggested that she could help him pay for admission to an art school, in the future.

But then his magical heritage made itself known, and such warm sentiments were buried beneath fear.

But Tom Riddle never gave up drawing, even when he was brought to Hogwarts and discovered all that which he could do. In the midst of shoring up his power, his influence, he found the time to draw. The one mundane, childish act he allowed himself to do. Even as his war reached a fever pitch, and hints of a prophecy plagued his dreams.

When he first died, he found that he missed the ability to draw the most. (When he'd attached himself to Quirinis Quirrel, he tried to draw, but the man's hand were inexperienced, and never ceased shaking. The one time he tried to draw as that pathetic half-thing while waiting for Harry Potter to win the Tri-Wizard Tournament, he could not reach every part of the page, and stopped in disgust).

Upon his return, after Harry Potter, once more, slithered out of his grasp, he found himself in a rare moment of solitude. Falling upon old habits, he sat himself down, and conjured up blank sheets of paper, a quill, and an inkwell.

And yet, he could not draw. His imagination was not gone. He could see the images he wanted to immortalize; the graveyard where he resurrected, his masked followers bowing at his feet, Harry Potter's terrified gaze as Lord Voldemort returned to the world, Nagini curled up in front of the fireplace after gorging herself on the rats scurrying about.

But no matter how much he desired, he could not bring pen to paper.

In that moment, that long, long moment, Lord Voldemort was struck with the idea that he'd lost something. That his resurrection was, perhaps, incomplete.

Alas, Lord Voldemort was not one for regret. He reasoned, perhaps not untruly, that his rebirth had stripped away the unnecessary parts of his being. That his new body could not afford weak, mundane desires.

Thus, he banished the items, striding out of the room and leaving the last bit of his childhood behind.

Not exactly what the prompt stated. I wanted to write more, but I've got classes to take soon. Let me know what you all think.

*** That's actually really beautiful. When I first wrote the prompt it was more in the spirit of a crackfic. Sort of like what if Martin Miggs was a beloved wizard children's hero (quite as beloved as Voldemort was feared) who disappeared all of a sudden with Voldemort's death. No finale, no closure, no promise to ever come back.

But your story is much deeper and if you were to develop on it, you could probably do a great job in portraying how the Dark Arts gradually dehumanized Voldemort.
