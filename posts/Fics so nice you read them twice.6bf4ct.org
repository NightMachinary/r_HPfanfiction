What stories (preferably complete ones) were so good that you read them all the way through again, months later?

linkffn(3401052) A Black Comedy is one I rather enjoyed; though it doesn't really go anywhere very crazy it's a decent romp of Sirius and Harry as adult men with nothing holding them back.

linkffn(10493620) Ruthless is a delightful nugget, because it accurately depicts a Harry who really doesn't see the need for all this goodguys/badguys nonsense which is getting in the way of him living his life. The only real motivated!Harry fic I have ever read that didn't need to dump in tonnes of OoC crap or AU nonsense.

What fics have you read that weren't just good in the moment, but actually stood up when you went back to them much later?


** I've read these multiple times (and enjoy them more on every re-read)

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

**** I absolutely love it for acknowledging where the originals left blanks in magic, and filling them in with the Devs as you said. I also find the politics of every book was handled well etc. And I just love the ending, it made me well up but that just shows that the characters were written well. This series absolutely is my head canon.

Also Alec is the best:

#+begin_quote
  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Reading a story twice isn't that much of a feat. When I can't find anything new, I usually just go back to a tried and true classic. Most of the stories on my favorites list I've probably read 2 or 3 times, but some like the Denarian Trilogy, or On the Wings of a Phoenix I've read 10+

**** Just be aware that I only really like it because there's a lot of great concepts in the story that I wish were used more, but in actuality the story itself isn't that great. It tends to ramble a bit, and some of the plot points are kind of pointless (such as the stuff with Ginny).

***** Ah. Oh well, no harm done. Worst case I waste 15 minutes. I would've just spent it reading other fanfiction so no real harm done.
