** They brought in Jon Snow to play Viktor Krum. I don't know what the fuck is going on or why this was made, but I love it.

*** It is actually political parody. The one who play Drunkedore (Dumbledore) is czech president and the other who turned into paperbills was czech prime minister (minister of magic) And there was thousands of easter eggs mainly about czech politics, Czech fairy tales and bizzare but also international thing. So you could for example see John Travolta on trainstation, Vladim√≠r Putin in painting, Gandalf. And then there is thousands of easter eggs for which you would need to know czech realies. If you liked it, check out this:[[https://youtu.be/e85zRrbS_zw]] It is from same author, home alone with Donald Trump in czech republic.
