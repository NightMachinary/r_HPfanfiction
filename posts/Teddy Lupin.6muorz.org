  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** "The Escapades of Teddy Lupin" linkffn(10554013) is a complete story by this author. But I enjoy their in-progress work "The Lost Children" linkffn(11995244) more. This final one's a one-shot that really isn't all that long, but it's still very good: "Harlequin" linkffn(3992413)

  Teddy Lupin thought his fifth year at Hogwarts would be just like all the others: full of fun with his friends, work, and perhaps a bit of drama. Then the muggleborns started disappearing, and everything changed. The war might be over, but the darkness remains.

** linkao3(1038392) - It's part 1 in a series of 4 fics. They're very well written and, as you wanted, very lengthy. Hogwarts House Divided is good, and people generally think it's the best Teddy fic, but I like this one better.

  It's been eleven years since Harry Potter brought an end to Voldemort; eleven years of peace, eleven years of recovery.But not every wound can be healed. Teddy Lupin is loved and wanted by his family, adored by his grandfather, welcomed in the extended Weasley clan, and happy that he's about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he still feels the loss of his parents and the last lingering traces of the war.As he begins his Hogwarts life, he finds connections to his past that he never suspected... and manages a bit of mischief as well!

**** So far this one is very good. The prose is more sophisticated at the beginning than Hogwarts Houses Divided. The main flaw of Hogwarts Houses Divided was that it had an very awkward start, and then an amazingly haunting powerful ending. Thank you for linking this one. I'm looking forward to seeing how it stacks up.
