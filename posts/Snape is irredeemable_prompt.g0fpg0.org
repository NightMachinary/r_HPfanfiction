Did Snape honestly think Lily was just going to fall into his arms after he basically called a hit out on her husband and son? "Just spare Lily." Why isn't there a fic where Lily (and maybe Harry) survives and she goes on a "Kill Bill" type murder revenge against Death Eaters and eventually Voldemort and Snape. All while she has a baby Harry strapped in a harness watching as his kickass mum turns a magic supremacist into beef tartare!


** Linkao3(If death is a doorway, I am gate seeker) qualifies somewhat. Lily almost kills Snape in the very first chapter, and treats him with absolute disgust when she next encounters him

  "The sorrow birds find what is weak, my chest, beak-marked, my eyes long gone." - Ann V. DevilbissLily Potter is dead.No.Lily Potter should be dead.The cheerful little owl clock on top of the dresser hesitates, then ticks onward. The baby in the crib sucks in another eager breath, and wails anew. The dead girl on the floor- the should be dead girl on the floor- opens her eyes.(Lily lives, but sometimes wishes she hadn't.)
