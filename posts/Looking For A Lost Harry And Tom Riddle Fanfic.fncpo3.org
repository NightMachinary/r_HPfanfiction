Hi! I'm looking for a fanfiction that I lost. All I remember is that Harry made a deal with Voldemort and agrees to go with him during one of his years at Hogwarts. Voldemort brings back James and lily from the dead and dumbledore and moody are notified and arrive at their graves (where they were just resurrected). Harry is under his invisibility cloak in a tree watching his parents (he snuck away from Voldemort to see them). And at the end, tom (who is different than Voldemort) is revealed to be disguised as moody and kind of reprimands Harry for sneaking out. I think it ended with them leaving to go back together. I'm pretty sure it was on archive of our own and I think I remember it being pretty short. I can't find it and I've been searching for it for a long time! Thanks to anyone who can help! :)
