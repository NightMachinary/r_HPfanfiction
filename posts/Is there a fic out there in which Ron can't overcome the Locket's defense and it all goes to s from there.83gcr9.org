You know the scene in the forest after Ron got Harry out of the pond? Ron then gets to stab the horcrux, but is shortly halted by the soulpiece trying to sow discord one last time by showing Ron his greatest fear.

Now I was wondering if there was a fic out there in which Ron is overwhelmed by that? Maybe one in which he then goes on a rampage against Harry and Hermione.

Well written stories are, of course, preferred, but since this is such a niche thing to look for, I'll take anything.


** That would be so interesting if he was POSSESSED FULLY, and then it would be like ironic because of Ginny back in book two! :) Yes Ron would be a Voldemort host.

** I'm intrigued by that scenario too... which is why I wrote a short [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12587046/1/Choice-of-Words][one-shot]] about it a while ago. I was in a pretty dark mood when I wrote it though.

Curious if there are other stories about that...

*** I mean, I liked it, but holy crap how many times is Ron going to say "Herms"? I have two issues with that: First, how many times do either of them call her that in canon? For that matter, how many times does anybody use a nickname for her? None on both counts. And really, does Hermione seem like the type of person who would be okay with a nickname of any sort that's not an actual pet name (love, babe, etc)?\\
Second, no matter what name/nickname you choose to use, how many times do you say someone's name when you're in a conversation with them? I feel like six of the eight times he says her name to her can be removed.

**** He's not in his right mind, he's supposed to come across as deranged and psychotic.

  Ron leaving them stranded on the hunt for the horcruxes wakes Harry and Hermione up to the fact that they cannot continue on as they have. They will have to think things through and not trust to luck or a destiny that may or may not turn out in their favour.
