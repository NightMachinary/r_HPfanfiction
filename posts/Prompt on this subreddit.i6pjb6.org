:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was a discussion or a prompt a while ago where it said that Harry ends up in James's body and obviously dosent show any interest in lily and all... She takes that as a sign of maturity and starts to have a crush on him and Harry does his best to avoid her. This fic was written in the comments on a post....

**** I was the OP in that thread: I wasn't the one setting up an arrangement for a paid fanfic. It was two dudes hashing it out in the comments. :)

***** Oh! Haha, i see. Glad to hear that, at least. It's a really fun idea - kind of like Back to the Future but a bit more extreme. I love it!

** It would also be weird if he swapped with his mom, not only would he have to deal with James, but also Snape. Oh and he'd be a girl, but hey, at least he wouldn't need glasses. That would be a weird thing to read.
