Made a prompt post here: [[https://ab.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/iuxu2k/dumbledore_acting_like_all_might/]]

I really liked the response. So I'm curious as to everyone's thoughts.


** - The plot will follow three main characters: two guys and one girl, all 11 or 12 year old students at the beginning of the story and teenagers at the end.
- The first guy is cheerful and optimistic, despite growing up poor. He also shows a distinct lack of interest in his studies (although at times he shows himself to be surprisingly intelligent and capable) and comes from a family famous for having red hair.
- The girl is smart and studious, being the top student of their class. She also comes from a "normal" background, as opposed to other main characters.
- (She eventually marries one of the guys, even though many believed she would end up with the other one)
- The second guy has dark hair and unusual eyes. He comes from an old family that was recently wiped out by the actions of a traitor.
- (During the course of the story, he finds out that the traitor isn't who he thinks he is)
- The villain is a pale, snake-looking man who wishes to become immortal, and is for some reason very interested in the dark-haired guy.
- The villain also has a spy - a highly intelligent and bitter man of questionable allegiance.
- Opposing the villain is an old but very powerful man whom everyone respects and calls "Professor".
- The villain actually used to be a student of his, but now wants to kill him (and eventually succeeds).

Oh wait.

*** A major difference would be the Triwizard Tournament would be an actual Tournament Arc, rather than just three spectacles (two of which the in-universe audience saw sweet bugger all of).
