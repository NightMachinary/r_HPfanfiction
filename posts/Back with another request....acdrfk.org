Hey folks!

I've finished reading my latest story...but now I want to reread a story. Of course, I don't know the name. Help would be great.

Here's what I remember: 1. Harry beats Flitwick in anfriendly classroom duel TWICE (of them by using his patronus as a decoy). He rushes the duel because he wants permission nto leave class early. 2. Flitwick brags about this to the other teachers and Snape is disbelieving (duh)

Annnnnd that's all I remember. I want to say that it was either post - OOTP or Post- GOF.

Thanks a ton
