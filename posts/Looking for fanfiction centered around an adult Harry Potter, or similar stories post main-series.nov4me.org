I'm a fan of content that explores more of the wizarding world, especially with cool action-y antics, or humor. Favorites include the unerringly funny "Weeb Adventures", or "A Black Comedy". I'm still a fan of more serious works, such as "Lunar Calendar" (at least so far), just not as much as the former. With thanks beforehand, I'd love similar fic recommendations.

#+begin_quote
  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.
