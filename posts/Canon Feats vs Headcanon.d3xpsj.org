This question first came about when I was making a ranking of the characters based on dueling/fighting ability. There were simply too many characters with too few feats in canon. Bill, for example, has very few feats and loses against Greyback. Ron, who probably has the best fighting feats amongst the 25 & under characters not named Harry, beats Greyback with only Neville whose not the best fighter even with his improvements. But I don't /feel/ like Ron would be able to beat Bill if they fought. This is an extreme example of course.

Characters like Draco who have some quality feats(Occlumency, Vanishing Cabinet, conjured serpent) but have very few of them as well as having some bad showings (fight vs Harry in book 6).

Ginny is said to be powerful, but has few real feats.

Fred and George are innovative in their inventions, but we never really see that applied in other areas.

So, my question is how do you determine who is more magically powerful/competent, and how do you balance canon feats and achievements against your head canon?

In the Harry Potter universe, power levels are irrelevant. Each character is exactly as powerful as the plot demands. This is how you get a 13 year old kid capable of driving off a swarm of Dementors, and struggling with his schoolwork the next year.

There's no consistency in power ratings, with the exception of the Power of Love. The person who has the most, wins.

*** Truth.

And you can use different excerpts from the Books to justify how strong/weak/smart/dumb a character is.

*** Hmm, I'd argue there is some in the books at least when comparing people.

Harry is objectively the best at DADA in his year, arguably the school by 5th year.

Voldemort & Dumbledore are both shown doing extraordinary things.

It's when you get Molly into the mix that things get iffy.

*** I disagree to an extent.

I think there are certain tiers for each characters by the end of the Battle of Hogwarts. In each tier, any character could beat the other. But, lower tiers will never a beat a person in the tier above them (barring Harry & Voldemort)

Snape completely blitzed Harry in Book 6, but fights on par with McGonagall. Mcgonagall fights to a stalemate with Voldemort with the help of two other skilled wizards (Kingsley and Flitwick?, correct me if I'm wrong).

There are definitely inferences that can be made.

**** In the context of the HP universe, power tiers become irrelevant as soon as a plot device appears.

- Lily's sacrifice of love.

- Priori Incantatem.

- Wand loyalty.

- Blood Pact. (from Crimes of Grindelwald)

- Time travel.

- Plot Fiat.

In any event, trying to find a logical way to rank power levels would result in Delphini of Cursed Child being named the most powerful, since Harry beat Voldemort, and Delphini beat Harry, who was a 40-year-old Head Auror with 20 years of experience at the time. Yes, this was approved by JKR, and she has declared it canon.

*ACT IV, SCENE XI*

#+begin_quote
  *DELPHI effortlessly rises into the air. HARRY steps back --- amazed.*

  *HARRY/VOLDEMORT (trying not to show his shock):* You learnt --- flight --- from --- me?

  DELPHI unleashes a bolt from her hand. HARRY matches her.

  *DELPHI:* Incendio!

  *HARRY:* Incendio!

  *The bolts meet in a beautiful explosion in the middle of the room. And with her other hand DELPHI sends bolts to both doors as they try to open them. HARRY looks at the doors, dismayed.*

  *DELPHI:* What? Thought your friends were going to join you, did you?

  *HARRY:* Fine. I'll deal with you alone.

  *He moves to attack her again. But she is far stronger. HARRY's wand ascends towards her. He is disarmed. He is helpless.*

  *HARRY:* How did you . . . ? What are you?

***** I will not lie to you 4ecks. I have not read Cursed Child nor do I have any intention of reading it. From what I hear, the story butchers plenty of things. You'd have no way of knowing this since I did not mention it in the OP, but the ranking I was making only goes up and through the Battle of Hogwarts. I do not take the Epilogue or Cursed Child into consideration.

The main seven books, again barring Harry & Voldemort, do a decent job of drawing that line in the sand so to speak.

Eh, 25 and under includes Tonks, Fleur, and Percy. Tonks should be better than Harry and Percy and Fleur should be better than Ron.

If we're talking 30 and under:

*Bill

*Tonks

*Harry/Fleur/Percy

*Luna/Hermione/Ron/Ginny

Of the older crowd that we see/hear of:

*Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald

*Snape/Bella/Dolohov/Amelia Bones/Moody

*Sirius (I feel like he should be 2nd tier, but eh)

*Kingsley/McGonagall/Flitwick/Slughorn

*Remus/Arthur/Lucius

*Molly

** It's a strange question, since it's not like power is one trait that can be measured linearly. Bill is probably great at slow, careful safe-cracking type magic, building and disassembling wards and whatnot, while Greyback is best at hand-to-hand combat.

*** Not to detract from your point but wards don't exist in canon. There are curses and charms that can be placed on places, but we don't really know how they're dealt with, although I agree that it's likely to be slow, safe-cracking magic (as that makes it a bit more exciting), but it could just as likely be casting a diagnostic spell then a counter-curse.
