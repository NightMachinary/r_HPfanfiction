What fic held the best OC you've read?


** linkffn(10972919) in which a SI OC with knowledge of the future ends up as a voice inside Tom Riddle's mind. Does he convince him to use his powers for good? To become the next Dumbledore instead of Voldemort? Hahaha... no.

He corrupts him even more and helps him take over the world and do it properly this time, of course.

An hilarious crack-fic.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

*** Eh, many hints point to it being Harry. E.g, when he mentions that Tom should get Dumbledore thick, woolly, socks for christmas. And the timescale seems to match up as well. Only Harry and maybe vaguely in Ron/Hermione's memory it would stay. Only Harry would remember, in my opinion.

It seems like a Harry knowledgeable and integrated into the muggle society, as he say's stuff like 'tom and jerry has a nice ring to it'

He knows a lot more about the wizarding society than he lets on- e.g telling how wizards are sorted, so is definitely a wizard.

***** Yeah, maybe that too. I didn't consider that. Probably more likely too, as he said something like ' magic's your thing' and tom commented on how when it came to his freaky powers, he knew nothing on how to improve them.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** Archie in Knowledge is Power. That fic has many flaws but Archie was a solid dude and his backstory and development into a sidekick made for a great read. I wish more people wrote Ron like that who actually is competent at something and not a waste of space.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** I really like Maud Moody from the Darkness and Light series by R.J. Anderson on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4446/R-J-Anderson]]

It's Snape/Female OC and originally written before OOTP came out with some small changes made later to incorporate the canon from OOTP.

I also really like Rüdiger Zweigl from Rüdiger Zweigl and the School in the Mountains on ffnet , sadly this story is unfinished.
