For those who don't know Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts is a deconstruction of Harry Potter and role playing games. Basically Harry grew up in a gaming community in the late 80s and got ideas about magic from that. So it's batshit insane.

I mean really insane.

You'd have to read it to get what I mean. But avoiding any spoilers Hagrid's dragon plays a prominent role, as does Luna.

If you want to delve into the reality of early role playing pen and paper games and apply them to the Harry Potter world. This is for you.

#+begin_quote
  The direct continuation of Harry Potter and the Physical Adept, in which cyberpunk-influenced, tabletop RPG-loving Harry Potter continues his life in and (mostly) out of Hogwarts. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Violent!Harry. Book 3 in Harry Potter and the RPG Influence. Rated M for language, graphic violence and sexual content.
