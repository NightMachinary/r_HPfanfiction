I llok for a caring Snape, that still stays Snape in his dry, sarcastic and non-flinching way. Due to his circumstances he is the one guy that stands up to "Greater-Good" Dumbledore.


** Not exactly what you might looking for but The Best Revenge and its sequel could be an example.\\

Also an ongoing new story named 'to love and protect'. In this story Lily potter will eventually return thanks to some magic specified in the first chapter. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12395247/]]
