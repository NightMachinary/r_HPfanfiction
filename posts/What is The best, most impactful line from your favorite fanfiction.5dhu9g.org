  "[[http://hpmor.com/chapter/20][Sometimes]]," Professor Quirrell said in a voice so quiet it almost wasn't there, "when this flawed world seems unusually hateful, I wonder whether there might be some other place, far away, where I should have been. I cannot seem to imagine what that place might be, and if I can't even imagine it then how can I believe it exists? And yet the universe is so very, very wide, and perhaps it might exist anyway? But the stars are so very, very far away. It would take a long, long time to get there, even if I knew the way. And I wonder what I would dream about, if I slept for a long, long time..."

I do agree it's quite a hit-or-miss one, though, so there are people who love it because of the style and there are people who hate it for the same reason. And then there are people who think that the story is alright but could have been better if someone took their head out of their arse when writing (I am in this group, by the way).

****** I think you meant to reply to my comments about HPMOR and you're right I was asking for favorite fics, not objectively best ones. I don't begrudge someone finding it subjectively better than another fic or even that it's their favorite. But to call the prose high quality, in my opinion, is completely wrong. Just the fourth wall breaking alone where it gets all preachy and out of character just to say things to the reader disqualify it. Then there's the repetitiveness and incredible lack of emotion. All of the MC students are just small adult geniuses who are experts in doublespeak and hiding the vast majority of their feelings. It just never felt real to me. The prose felt from the beginning like it was the author having a conversation with himself, and not conversations between characters.

If you were actually talking about CC then the same sorta applies. I can see why people consider CC to be fanfiction and I can see why they might like it a lot or not at all from that point of view. There are probably better ones, but thats always subjective. The op up there picked a good quote too.

******* No, I definitely wanted to reply to this particular comment, to add to the already going somewhat humorous and somewhat mocking comment branch about CC. HPMoR is weird in a way and a story that for most people is either one they love or one they hate, but I will not deny that some people do regard it as their favourite.

That said, I will touch on the thing with CC as a fanfic. You see, I do know that it is not a bad story per se; there definitely are better ones but there are also worse ones, and at worst it's watchable/readable and if one does not try to delve too deeply into it it can even be quite enjoyable. That said, it is not something Madame Rowling wrote, and it explicitly contradicts what she wrote and presented as canon (specifically, the bit about time-turners); while it is not a major contradiction and one /could/ sweep it under the rug with “eh, but it's a special time-turner”, when it happens in derivative works that are created by someone who is not the original author there is the automatic assumption that none of it is truly canon. And in this particular case, I see Madame Rowling's decision to approve of the work as a fairly wise decision that is going to get rid of a lot of legal rubbish, but the decision to declare it all as canon regardless of the contradictory stuff as a stupid one borne of some kind of obsession to have everything under her name as canon no matter what and thus an act that does nothing. With this, and with quite some people decrying the canonity of CC, well ... calling it a fanfic really suits the situation, since the whole situation does present it as some kind of fanfic that happened to be Madame Rowling's favourite and thus got declared canon thoughtlessly.

** One of the most impactful things I read in a fic was a paragraph:

"Power is a blessing...but it is also a curse; for the powerful it is so very easy to become hubristic and foolhardy. It lies buried deep within all of us -- the desire to rise above the troubles of the world; to overcome, and conquer. This desire, while a profound driving force that fuels progress and strength of character, is a poison to those with power; it lures them into the dark places in their own minds, and drains away their humanity and benevolence." He paused. "A student of mine once said, there is no good or evil -- there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. These are the words of a man who is trapped within himself; a man who sacrificed his own future and the futures of others for a dream which in the end, turned out to be empty. These are the words of a man who has lost his humanity, and become nothing more than a villain -- a man who has lost everything, and will never amount to anything."

*** I could never get into that fic, but I did read through that chapter after you posted this, It was definitely full of wisdom but it didn't seem to touch much on how well Harry actually took his advice. I have no context personally to guess at that but I do have high hopes that you and other readers will see in the next chapter that that monologue really was the most impactful for Harry's character.

Personally though, I thought Snape had the best single line of the chapter.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It signified a reaffirmation of his commitment to Lily and Dumbledore while also maintaining his frustrated deadpan snark. Like Harry's potential turning point, it is likely Snape will also see great personal growth that will likely be as important to the future of the story as Harry's. Plus it's just damn funny.

Thanks for the contribution.

** This is more of a rough paraphrase, if we're talking in terms of impactful stories of a semi-serious nature.

The fic is long since taken down, but I memorized enough of /Faith and Understanding,/ which chronicled the friendship of Ginny and Luna.

/Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. "Luna," she asked. "Who's your favorite person?"/

/She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the right answer popped into her head. Luna's father, her most talked-about person. Surely he was her favorite person./

Once again paraphrased. This passage is from when Ginny and Luna meet for the first time, and Luna says that she wants to be sorted into Ravenclaw, because "Ravenclaws always tell the truth" and that her father is editor of the Quibbler.

/Ginny remembered her father mentioning the Quibbler, and that while the stories weren't always accurate, they never printed anything they didn't believe was true. That, her father had said, put the Quibbler above every reputable publication that took a seed of truth and then twisted the story beyond recognition./

** I have three quotes that I liked enough that I copied and pasted them for reference. From /Sympathetic Properties/ by Mr Norrell, linkffn(10914042), where Mr. Granger analyses Hermione perfectly:

#+begin_quote
  "[You're] disappearing into a world full of unknown dangers -- and now obviously questionable ethics and morals too -- but are more terrified at the thought of leaving it than you are of continuing to face those enormous dangers, so you've taken it upon yourself to hide all of this from us thinking that if you somehow make it through unharmed that we don't have to know and won't be worried about you. Oh! Plus, there's a boy involved. Is that about the size of it?"
#+end_quote

From /Not Not-Human/ by Forensica X, linkffn(10462166):

#+begin_quote
  "Does anyone else think this is mad?" Draco breathed in a strained sigh. "You belong in bloody Gryffindor, Potter. You're an idiot to come back to school."

  "Yeah, I know," Harry snapped. "But if I don't, and it's him, and Dumbledore's plan doesn't work, I don't want to wake up months from now to an immortal Dark Lord pointing a wand at me and my family lying dead downstairs. Once is enough for me, thanks."
#+end_quote

And from /Living without Danger/ by whydoyouneedtoknow, linkffn(2306529), because it captures my experience as a writer so brilliantly:

#+begin_quote
  "Over the years, music's become almost a necessity for me. Like writing is for you. I've seen you on days when we have too much to do to let you get at your work for a while. You get irritable and fidgety."

Might try 'The Last Casualties' by muggledad. Don't think it quite hits littlebirds' heights and certainly misses for brevity but he does a bit I like a lot.. Harry's in a coma and Hermione is struggling with despair. He writes a call and response: one line from the spanish mass followed by a chunk about her struggle until it reaches resolution.

*** I'd never read that one before. It was alright in my opinion, but lacking Hermione's reasoning puts it a little back on my personal quality rating. Yeah it's a drabble I get that, but even in the worst of fics the canon deviation happens for a reason. Deviating that far into the game and in that abrupt manner just seems awkward, even in a format that is defined by its incompleteness. I was expecting it to go into why she left not into her bag. Just seemed weird that's all.

Certainly that line is impactful for the implication that she threw everything away and for how sickened Harry is by it. how he feels the same about her or at least how he thought she felt about him and Ron.  It also implies a future reunion that won't go very well, or perhaps that Ron will also leave and Harry might be shattered.

I'd say the story was okay but that line was overall great. Thanks!
