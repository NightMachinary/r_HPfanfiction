It doesn't have to be canon-compliant story wise, but personality, abilities, etc. have to stay true to his character. Preferably no ships but they're OK

Thanks in advance


** I /only/ read Sirius-centric, and you'd be surprised how tough a request this is. What is "true to his character" for one person is wildly off for another.

Here's a smattering of some that I think do well, ranging from baby Sirius, to AU-raise-Harry, to post-Azkaban:

Linkffn(the Bureaucratic Error)

Linkffn(the life and times by jewels5)

Linkffn(summer of the Phoenix)

Linkffn(dark birthright)

Linkffn(the lost ones by little.acatalepsy)

Linkao3(The Dog You Feed)

Linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies)

Linkao3(renascentia: from the ashes)

Linkao3(in the black by izzythehut)

The author The Divine Comedian generally focuses on Remus or Regulus, but their Sirius is excellent and he features heavily, most especially in linkffn(they're hiding inside of me).

Lady Altair and Lady Bracknell are two other authors who write mostly one-shots and are worth a lookup.

And finally, because I never get to rec it but love this AU and an author this creative, linkao3(runaway by draconunquamdormiens). It's over the top and ridiculous in a fun way. Sirius is maybe OP (but that's more in line with canon for me than the idiot man child can't tie his shoelaces that seems to feature everywhere else in fanfic.)

  When Sirius ran away from home he went to live with the Potters, but before he made it there he wound up lost, alone, and hurt in Muggle London. With James out of the country, Peter stuck at home, and Remus trapped by the full moon, it's Lily Evans (who hates his guts) that Sirius is forced to turn to for shelter and more advice than he could have bargained for.

  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

**** I like the series a lot. I think it's exceptionally well written for a fic and she's skilled at building characters. Her all-but-in-name OCs are great.

That said, it's not one of my /absolute/ favorites (and I'm behind on some of the updates). My ideal fics are canon compliant, and here the overarching plot is that Regulus lives after the cave and the Black family reunites because of it. I also disagree with the author on her take of the Black family; I see them a lot harsher/fanatical than she does. But then there'd be no redemption for them, and that's the story here.

Sirius is...arrogant, spoiled, rebellious, a complete pain-in-the-ass to his parents...but also charismatic, brilliant, funny, loyal to the end and stupidly brave. (He's not with Remus or Marlene here, which is a bonus to me.) Personally, I absolutely adore Sirius but find him annoying at times in this, so there's something missing for me. But it's definitely a canon justifiable take, and she's won an award for his characterization.

  Wasted potential is far more offensive to a teacher than outright mediocrity, and it is for that reason, chiefly, that she considers him to be one of the great disappointments of her career. If, then, she should keep seeing potential where everyone else has given up, and if they are to be forever discussing what he will make of himself, so be it.Minerva wonders if he is as aware of the patterns as she is.Six conversations between Minerva McGonagall and Sirius Black, 1976-1996.

  When Sirius ran away from home he went to live with the Potters, but before he made it there he wound up lost, alone, and hurt in Muggle London. With James out of the country, Peter stuck at home, and Remus trapped by the full moon, it's Lily Evans (who hates his guts) that Sirius is forced to turn to for shelter and more advice than he could have bargained for.

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. Heavy on Remus/Sirius friendship. Some Black family dynamic; Harry/Sirius family dynamic; Sirius PTSD exploration. Tonks is a major player but not til halfway through. No bashing. Harry is present but not primary; these adults prefer not to ask teenagers to save the world.
