Looking for stories that involve Ancient Runes more, how it's done doesn't matter. Any rating is fine.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

** C'est La Vie, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/C-est-La-Vie]]), has that.

I suppose Runemaster - which was already recommended - is /alright/ if you just want more Ancient Runes, but personally, I found the writing and dialogue really rather terrible.
