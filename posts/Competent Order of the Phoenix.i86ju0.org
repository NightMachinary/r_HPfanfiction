Are there any fics featuring an effective, competent Order of the Phoenix? Like they actively go and persecute death eaters besides info gathering and stuff, use lethal force instead of only stunners, and help end the war before it goes to shit like in DH.

That's basically what Lupin objected to Harry doing in the Battle of the Seven Potters - Harry wasn't being /lethal/ enough. If anything, I don't think they shy away from killing. Moody kills Evan Rosier when he isn't compliant (and Sirius even praises him for 'bringing people alive when possible'), Dumbledore sacrificed Emmeline Vance for Snape's spy position and Lupin goes on a full tirade of why Harry should be killing, and 'at least stunning'.

Edit: a word... complicity is not the same as compliance :P

** In Wind Shear the Order doesn't exist yet, but Harry hooks up with 'the old crowd'. These are veterans of Grindelwald's war. People like Neville's grandfather and Charlus Potter. It's implied before the first war heated up, Voldemort had these elder statesmen picked off before they really understood what was happening. With Harry's future warning... They're in one depicted battle and they utterly destroy Voldemort's forces. Wind Shear linkffn(12511998)

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) has a competent Order that engages with the Death Eaters in pitched battles and generally holds their own. It's very AU from canon because it was written pre-OoTP, so it's much more of an actual war, with outpost attacks and territory changing hands, as opposed to the guerilla war depicted in canon. The war isn't the main focus of the story though, so there's only a few scenes of the battles that aren't mentioned in passing or told as recaps.

** If the Order was competent, there would be no book series.

Honestly, read a "no Voldemort AU" to see what it would be like.
