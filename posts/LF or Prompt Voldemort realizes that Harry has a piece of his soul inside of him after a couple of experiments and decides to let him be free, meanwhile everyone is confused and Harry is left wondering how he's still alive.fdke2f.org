Doesn't have to be exactly that, but maybe something to it.

Rather Harry realizes he has a piece of Voldemort's soul in him or not is up to you.

I know that normally people would have Voldemort make Harry his pet or slave or whatever, but having Harry be kept alive would be his top priority, it'd be a interesting take if he was freed.


** That's basically what happens in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6512582/1/Keep-Your-Enemies-Closer][Keep Your Enemies Closer]]. linkffn(6512582)

I know of more good fics with a similar premise, but they are all eventual HP/LV.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort conquers wizarding Britain and discovers his human horcrux. Harry is allowed to live under the new regime. Attending a darker version of Hogwarts, he struggles with a strange connection to Dark Marks and Tom Riddle whispering inside his head. AU dystopia. Story is mostly gen, though praised for its platonic intimacy between the two arch-enemies.
