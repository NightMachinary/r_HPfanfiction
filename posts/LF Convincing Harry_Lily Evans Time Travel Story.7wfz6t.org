  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in 'subject to entanglement').

** How, exactly, would one write convincing "Fucking My Mom" stories? Don't get me wrong - I don't have any problems with the fetish. But when I see "convincing" I imagine "validate this and make it socially acceptable", which... well, would be impossible. Because it's your mom.

*** Harry travels back in time to save the world. Goes to Dumbledore for help after arriving in marauder era. Dumbles obliviates the shit out of Harry for the greater good cause you shouldn't mess with time. Neither of them know they are related now so when Lily dates Harry to piss off James cause he's an annoying prick nobody (besides James) has an issue with it. Then a few years after school is out they have horrible disfigured children and live happily ever after until they are slaughtered by Voldemort.

***** yea I think so. It would only cause any recessed traits in the parent to come out, and even then only at a 25% rate. Any recessed traits from the non-participating parent wouldn't appear (although it would be spread). If you are talking about a population of 500 with 10% having a (unique) recessed negative trait, would have a 90% chance of having no problems at all and 97.5% chance of any arbitrary child having a problem.

Of course, if your population is inbreeding your problem is much bigger, if it is small enough the negative traits don't breed out. Even with perfect breeding amungst the population, your entire population will end up with all 50 negative recessed traits. At that point, the chance of having a healthy child between two random individuals in the population basically impossible.

You know, this sounds like a fun post /goes off to make it/

*** 1) Lily never raised a son, so she never formed that mother/son barrier that would have stopped those thoughts.

2) Harry never had her as a mother, not really, so he never formed that son/mother barrier that would have stopped those thoughts.

3) Don't have them have kids.

4) Have them both be the same age.

5) Have them both be reluctant about it at first.

I don't know, I could see it. I've been convinced with Harry/Narcissa stories. Harry/Lily wouldn't be unbelievable to me tbh. As Harry looks like his father, Lily would think him attractive. It would really just be Harry that might have a problem. Toss him through a horrible war to lower his morals and viola! Incest!

Can't believe I just made an argument for that.

*** It really wouldn't be that hard. I mean you have magic, you could come up with a pretty convincing situation for a lot worse. Pretty easy to go 'magic changes everything your entire philosophical structure collapse when you can do the magics'. Hell, that is great subject matter if you want to write something serious. (Do de-aging potions cause concern about relationships? How about artificially aging someone? What about turning into an animal that matures faster. Or if you want to get away from sex, how about /having the power to help solve the resource scarcity problem behind so much pain and suffering yet keeping it hidden to protect yourself/.)

Anyway, onto your original topic, how about any of the following:

#+begin_example
  Magically Induced Awkward Situation: In an attempt to bring back his mother, Harry merges the contentiousness of his mother and his girlfriend.  New entity has memories of both
  Unknown at the Time: Harry goes back in time and doesn't realize who they area. Could easily be done by sending Harry back before his third year
  Fixing the Past: Harry possess his father and has to keep up the ruse or risk himself not existing (Kinda BTTF concept of keep them together or you fake out of existence)
#+end_example

Just saying, coming up with a situation that could be made into an interesting story really isn't that hard with the relatively unconstrained magical world of HP.

Edit: Also, the 'you are your own father' thing has been a thing in sci-fi/fantasy for a loooong time. /cough '---All You Zombies---', a Heinlein story that involves.. well... ... cough/
