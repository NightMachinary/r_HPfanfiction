#+TITLE: Harry chose to go back. Fine, he didnt make that exactly clear, but he couldn’t help slapping Dumbledore in the face, wishing he would learn a lesson. He should’ve expected being thrown to 1886. While six-years-old. As Bagshot’s niece. Why did these things always happen to him!?

** Would that make him Grindelwald? Sounds like an interesting prompt.

P.S.: I think the male counterpart to niece is called nephew. Unless you meant Harry to be female.

*** According to the wiki, Grindelwald is Bagshot's great-nephew. So that could possibly make Harry the aunt or mum of Grindelwald in the scenario described.
