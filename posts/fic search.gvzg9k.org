:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
this person I know was looking for a fic, and I found myself curious about it too, so I'll ask here\\
this is the description they sent:

/looking for a fanfic where harry and voldemort's son from an alternate universe somehow finds his way to canon voldemort's dimension and harry shows up to voldemort after realising their son was here; through dreams?/\\
/anyway there was a scene where alternate universe voldemort came to harry and kissed him in front of the real voldemort who was like wtf/\\
/i really want to read that fic again/\\
/i believe they had three kids, brainy boy, spunky girl, the kid who dimension travelled who loves harry more than Voldemort like the rest of them, and a baby girl./\\
/i cant remember much else but surprisingly Voldemort as a parent was portrayed accurately in it/\\
/he was definitely not a kid's favourite person/
