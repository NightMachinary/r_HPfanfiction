I came across this post mentioning the option for a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4x5shp/public_beta_useful_feature_id_like_to_see_on/][public-beta system]] which sounded neat.

I know I'd love a site where footnotes and author's notes could be toggled on or off. For instance, I'd like to sprinkle my fics with footnotes (mostly citing as to where I first got the inspiration, complete with links back to original sources as possible) but not impede the reading experience.

What features would be on your must-have list?


** I like fanfiction.net's reader. If it had a decent tag system and a separate user generated tag system I'd be in heaven.

My ideal site would also let you exclude specific tags, pairings & crossovers.

As an author id like a small reddit like forum for each of my stories as a way to communicate with my audience.

A way to rate reviews from 1 to 5 would be good too, to incentives people writing more than "please update."

Isn't this basically AO3? There is an extensive tagging system, and members can tag stories themselves. By using the search within box and -"thing to be excluded" you can filter pairings, fandoms, tags... And the comment section is publicly visible, reddit like threads. The only thing it doesn't have in rating on comments.

**** Yea, very similiar. Ideally the system would allow you to sort te results in some way as well. Only show me recommended fics based on other people that rate Harry Potter, or use my entire rating history, regardless of Fandom.

The benefit for this is two-fold. First it gives the reader more options and help in finding more stories they like, so you will be able to find good stories, but it also encourages readers to favorite/like/rate the stories they read because it will help them find more stories, which is beneficial to authors because they will get more feedback, encouraging then to write.

****** Unfortunately that only works when authors favorite stories themselves, which some have seperate accounts for reading and writting, or don't have favorites.

Alternatively they, like me, have hundreds of favorites and our lists overlap heavily making it hard to find new ones....

Which brings me to another feature I want, 'unread'. Track which chapters of a fanfiction I have read and have them colored/tagged different from stories I have read so I can quickly scan through a large list to see what I have read, what is being read but I'm not up to date on, and what I haven't read at all.

** Have stories have a forum style posting, so author makes a story post, then commenters can comment on it. Have threadmarks like SB and SV for easy navigation. Also have a story only part with the story organised like Fanfiction.net and archiveofourown, with each chapter on a separate page. On the story only, you can choose to see reviews and comments for the chapter, bascially all the thread comments in response to the chapter.

Also stories must be tagged with what relationships are in them, the fandom, rating, major characters etc. Stuff like slash or gore would be clearly visible before starting to read a fic.

A good search system. You can set defaults for your profile, like automatically getting rid of any Draco in romantic pairing, but not ones where he is just a major character. Also have a tag to seperate just erotica fics and M fics which are M because of swearing or gore. It can also be tagged as both, to warn the reader. Female versions of charcters can be done seperatly, so you can read fics about a fem!Draco, but not a male one and vice-versa. Or block both.

Summaries can be longer, say 300 words maximum. Don't need to put tags here like Dark!Harry or AU, they would be shown below the summary.

A spellcheck before you post. You can add words that are not real words, such as some spell names or animal names to your personal spellcheck.

Embed media such as music, videos, fan art and links to sources. So the reader can just click it to open it in a new tab or show it on the page. Much better then people getting around FF.nets restrictions.

Larger profile pics.

Automatic showing that it is a part of a series of fanfictions like Archiveofourown system.

** Good accessibility. There are several side benefits from this, aside from not giving a big "fuck you" to several million potential readers -- basically, accessibility requires you to write your site in a way that browsers expect, which means browsers can support more conveniences with sites with good accessibility, and plugins will work better.

Good filtering. AO3 tags are a wide net. Sometimes, when I'm looking for something esoteric, that's a good thing. But sometimes I want aggressive filtering, like if I'm looking for a Hermione / Sirius pairing, I want to read fics that are about them, not 200k words of Drarry with a sprinkling of other pairings.

Good support for authors' notes. FFN gives you nothing, which is crud. AO3 gives you notes before the chapter, which is the bare minimum to be usable. The icing on the cake version would allow you to put in author commentary throughout and keep that separate from the main content.

Series support. It's not uncommon for an author to remember to update their story a year late with a note: "I continued this story in the sequel, /Sequel Name Here/."

Guiding you through the process of posting a new story. FFN is only moderately bad about it. fanfiction.io is terrible.

Reviewing shouldn't be an implicit endorsement. I leave critical reviews sometimes, reviews pointing out problems that would require a rewrite to fix. For instance, in /Firebird's Son/, the world does almost nothing to cope with how rare male mages are. Altering that would require removing boys from Quidditch and gender-segregating Hogwarts, and that's just the start. I can't really tolerate that kind of inconsistency these days, so I don't want to endorse it. But if I leave that kind of review, that improves the story's rankings.

**** [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/index.php][Dark Lord Potter]], a HP fanfiction forum. From what I understand of its early days, it was big into (as you can guess from the name) Dark!Harry fanfiction, but has expanded into more of a 'quality' fanfiction forum, though fanfiction discussion has gone down because the amount of quality fanfiction being published is decreasing due to the fact that the fandom is sorta... slowing down I would put it.

They have a bit of a... mixed reputation, some of it (particularly the stuff from 8 years ago) earned, some of it due to people being bitter about having their stuff get a poor reception, some of it due to their attitude as a whole (I kinda like it, but I'm too lazy to join up, and frankly have nothing worthwhile to add over there).

Their library contains a bunch of good stuff, and a bunch of stuff that used to be good but didn't age well, or is worse when using todays standards. They have a FFN search client they call Scryer which is more useful for finding/weeding out fics, though I rarely bother to use it unless I'm hunting for a fic in particular.

Your second paragraph is worded in such a way to make it seem as if only the only portion of their poor reputation with any merit is from their edgelord behaviour eight years ago. That leaves one to believe that you're saying other criticism can be brushed off as it comes from sour grapes or that their current unwarranted self-importance is praiseworthy.

** Thank you for the great topic! I've really enjoyed reading the other responses.

For my must-have list:

- Egalitarian outlook: No particular subfandom or circlejerk mentality is allowed to silence another viewpoint. For example, no bullying from those who love the Mentor!Dumbledore wank from DLP or the slavish devotion to canon compliant fics as in [[/r/HarryPotter]]'s Fanfiction Friday threads.

- A numeric rating system tied to lengthy reviews. For example, voting is only open to registered users who have left a 200-250+ word review for that specific story.

- A weighting system that allows authors to determine the value of a reviewer's feedback. For example, users who only ever complain about stories that don't follow their preconceived notions would be given short shrift, but those who consistently leave valuable constructive criticism are weighted more heavily.

- A tagging system allowing users to sort by more pairings and themes than ff.net, but not the overblown mess of Ao3. I'd also prefer one that easily allows users to filter out things they do not wish to see (e.g. Dark!wank, Hermione-Sue, smut, etc).

- Day/Night backgrounds like on ff.net. Having a black background with white text really saves my eyesight.

- Near-instant response by administrators to reports of plagiarism.

- A culture that encourages new authors to contribute to their fandom. I think stagnation with few authors is what has led to the downfall of so many smaller sites.

- A 'Featured Story/Author' section that highlights particularly noteworthy fics as decided either by users or administrators.

- A screening process to weed out prospective betas who slack off and never finished what they start.

- A reward system for betas to thank them for their /invaluable/ contributions. I was thinking like some sort of reduction or elimination of the site's advertising.

- Unobtrusive advertising or a 'premium' membership that eliminates advertising. Gotta pay the bills somehow, but I think users would appreciate any effort to make adverts as unobtrusive as possible.

** I'd love to be able to highlight a paragraph or a few words of a sentence and then submit it to the author, showing them the mistakes without having to copy and paste it.

Spoiler buttons for Author Notes so I don't have to scroll 500+ words of inane bullfuckery.

Community tags, such as things like Steam, where users can tag the stories and fill in any blank tags.

** I'd like to be able to expand on other peoples discontinued stories. It's not ever going to be allowed outside some special situations, but I'd like it to be allowed more often. I'd like the be able to write a continuation of Bound to Servitude By Little.Miss.Zanda. I'm content with the system as it is though, adding something like this would undoubtedly cause many many problems.

*** Maybe when people upload their original fic they could check a box that says after 'x' amount of time has passed without an update the fic can be up for adoption. May not get many takers, but a few might opt in.

** There are so many things i could request out of a perfect FF site. But the #1 thing would be a way to force accurate tagging by authors (aka not spam tagging to grab more views) and a way to look up via tags that actually retrieved what you wanted and not ANYTHING with a similar tag. Every FF site seems to have issues when it comes to tagging and the systems in place to sort via tags.

Other things that would be nice would be:

- Easy downloading
- Reviewing separated into chapter, complete, and feedback sections with the complete section having a "star rate system".
- Sub forums for each author page
- An amazon like system that showed similar stories.
- A personal library system where you can save stories you are interested in, and sort them by "too read" or "in progress" or other such tags.
- A pared down "listing" section where users can make story lists based upon themes and others can submit stories to such lists for approval when discovered. (Think a cleaner goodreads version).
- Sectioning ratings in sub sections of the site instead of outright banning, or deleting, or merging. Fan fiction should be open and free, and it would not be hard to have an "adult" section of a site instead of censoring or other such nonsense.

There are so many more but id be up all night so this will do for now. I also realize some sites do have such features, but to have them all in 1 well designed, organized, and run site would be wonderful.

****** It would certainly be weird, but to be fair, I don't think you'd see much of it. Most 35 year olds aren't the least bit interested in teenagers having sex. Or indeed interested in teenagers. Which is why the idea of a site limited to over 35s is so appealing.
