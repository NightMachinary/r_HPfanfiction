Looking for fics that delve into the relationship between Sirius and Remus during the first war, particularly about Sirius believing Remus was the double agent.

  January 1981. Sirius is a paranoiac, Peter is not a psychopath, James is a dad, Remus is super angry, and Regulus...Regulus is alive.No-one is more surprised than him.
