It was a one shot. I liked some of the ideas but for the life of me I can't remember.


** I cannot find it now, but I just read (it was not in the centre, just a side remark) a story, where Grangers were messed up parents as well. Not bullying stupid sort like Dursleys, but businessmen perfectionists emotionally and otherwise missing in her life with serious performance based acceptance issues. Yes, we all love almost universally perfect Grangers of almost all fanfiction stories (and yes, I like linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel)), but the truth is that Hermione's pathological perfectionism and constant anxiety must come from somewhere. It explains so much about her. For example, she completely misses a need to explain her life to them, and in the end she gets rid of them completely (and she sends them to Australia); that would be a feast for Freuidian psychotherapists.

So, what if Harry sees that in her memories and he is immediately able to recognize it.

*** I remember reading one where Hermione's mother is this cold successful businesswoman and her partner is just a handsome boytoy-slash-servant. I don't think he was even Hermione's biological father, but regardless her cared for he more than her mother did. Might be the same story? It was H/Hr as far as I recall.

**** No, it was a less more complicated. Let me see ... no, this was just one paragraph mention of Hermione's family background (who was not the central figure). Perhaps linkffn(12745758)?

*** That's not the story I was looking for, but it was an interesting idea. linkffn(7409840) explores a similar idea.

I mean I love her character for being such a loyal friend to Harry, but as an adult I can see why Harry decided not to date her.

She's a bit controlling and after Dumbledore, Snape, and the Dursleys I don't think Harry could have that sort of relationship.

It does get hard to find good fics that properly criticize her (this goes true for any character) without going into bashing.
