I've been racking my brain for the name of this fanfic. It starts out with a young Harry in first year, and all the older students find him adorable. I know that's really not much of a description, but if you can find anything that is like it, I'd appreciate it. I vaguely remember Harry was in ravenclaw, and penelope was a part of the cast.

Edit: Never mind I found it, it was Sacrificial Second Chance


** Was it the one where a bunch of older witches pull him into their compartment on Hogwarts express and fawn over him? Was pretty weird, I don't remember any more details though.

*** I don't think so. I remember Harry was a first year in the common room, and Penelope and the other girls were commenting on how adorable he was.

** I'm intrigued.

But the only Ravenclaw Harry to come to mind right now is BakenandEgg's fanfics, and Penelope I don't even think has any moments in that series.

Do you tend to read incompletes? Regardless do you think you could estimate its length? Like it's definitely longer than 10,000 words, etc. Lastly, do you think you can recall what site it may have been on?

Any or all of those could help narrow it down.

*** It definitely was longer than 50,000 words, and I don't think it was complete, but it might've been. Just for reference, Penelope wasn't a listed character, but she showed up in a couple scenes and was ensnared by Harry's adorableness. I vaguely remember a scene where Penelope reprimanded Harry for something then felt bad afterwards because of how adorable he was and how sad he looked. And it definitely was on FFN.

**** Well, I did a very basic search on FFN using the search term Ravenclaw, under Harry Potter (Books), put Harry as a character, and then made it include only 50k and up fics.

I went through opening up any that talked about Harry being the main character and was starting from actual first year, and then skipped around in the few chapters to see if a ctrl+f would find "Penelope" or if the chapter titles had anything hinting at what you read.

I can't guarantee that it wasn't in that stack at all, but I'm like 90% sure it's not. Unless you think that scene you described happened way later in the narrative.. Harder to be confident then.

But that means it is either (1) probably a story with a Ravenclaw Harry that doesn't have Ravenclaw in the title or summary or (2) a story that got deleted/removed.

But yeah, sorry, it's gotten too general for me to search. But OMG, I just noticed you found it yourself, so I don't need to feel bad.

Good sleuthing!
