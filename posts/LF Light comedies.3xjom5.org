I'm looking for some easy reading this Christmas, so I'd like to have find a couple new fics that will make me laugh. Some examples I've enjoyed are "Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them", "Seventh Horcrux", and "Favorite Things". Pairing or gen is fine, but prefer no slash


** *The Adventures Of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited*, linkffn(9708318), while *Seventh Horcrux* is a good laugh, this story had me ROFLMAO!

The description of Harry's first weapon:

#+begin_quote
  Upon picking up the small hand shovel, a chorus of trumpets sounded and a word bubble popped up in Harry's vision, just as the shovel grew in length to be a full dirt shovel longer than Harry was tall and painted in yellow and black spirals up the handle and checkered across the shovels head/blade.

  "Tada! With hard labor and diligent work, you've earned the "Hufflepuff Harry" title and a new tool and weapon, the Hufflepuff Shovel. For when there is shit to be done, we know you'll be there diligently shoveling it!"

  Harry looked rather nonplussed by his new weapon/tool. "Hardy har har, you're a regular laugh riot is what you are." Harry groused as he looked over his shovel.

  "Inventory," Harry called, getting ready to put away his new weapon, only to find a new tab in his inventory called "Weapons." Touching the tab, an expanded area of the chest opened up like closet or armory; though it was rather bare armory with only one Pointy Stick resting on a weapons rack. Still, the addition of the Weapons armory gave Harry some new information he hadn't had before as floating above the Pointy Stick on its rack was the weapons Statistics of: 1 melee attack/1 defense. As Harry set down the shovel in a weapon rack, its statistics floated above it: 3 melee attack/1 defense, Plus 2 to Herbology when wielding Hufflepuff Shovel and Plus 1 to attempts to Hide Bodies or turn them into fertilizer.

  Harry paled at the last two details, "I'm never going to look badly at Hufflepuffs again." Harry stated definitively.

  Closing his inventory and shaking off the shivers that came from imaging Madame Sprout and how she made her fertilizer, Harry looked around at all the collecting he had done and realized he was done with that for now.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.

** Can't go wrong with nonjon. linkffn(A Black Comedy; Where in the world is Harry Potter)

Rorschach's Blot is another decent author. I wouldn't say he's written anything close to perfect, but his stories are fun and humorous.

I'm gonna go look at my follow list and pick out a few newer currently updating ones for you if I find any good ones.

  AU Harry is more money-conscious when he arrives at Gringotts with Hagrid. He's not going to let the wonder of magic take away his common sense and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** Linkffn(oh god not again! By sarah1281) this is a great time travel/parody story, and if you like it I would also recommend linkffn(let's do the time warp again) which also is time travel, but even more ridiculous. Sarah1281 has several good humor fics, such as linkffn(when in doubt obliviate by sarah1281) which was recommended by another poster and I've been meaning to finish for awhile.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
