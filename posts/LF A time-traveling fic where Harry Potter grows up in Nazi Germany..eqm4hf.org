** How Nazi do you want it to be? I'm actually having this problem. I'm writing a WWII era time travel fic, but I'm setting it primarily in the fictional Grindelwald war. I felt like it would be disrespectful to include real world historic figures, even though my Harry is basically the magical equivalent of Unity Mitford. It just would seem weird having Grindelwald just having a meeting with Himmler or something, so I try to mention the actual real life war as little as possible

*** Well, if the appropriate Minister of Magic is known to the appropriate Muggle Prime Minister (or President of whoever), then the German Minister of Magic must be known to Adolf Hitler, and it is just a short stretch imagination that Grindelwald made himself known to Himmler, Goering, or whoever.

** I can't think of a more controversial fic than Harry being excited to get into Hitler's Youth before the Dudley equivalent, but then finding out the letter is for Grindelwald's Training School.

"You are a fizard Harry."

"Nein!"

** Technically Altered Destinies fits even if it's not really growing up from a young age which you might be implying.
