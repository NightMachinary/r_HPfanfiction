  My main challenge is I'm not really sure how to fill up the content or what MC-SI would actually be doing. Personally, I think I--and really any insert--would probably be thrilled at studying magic. However, I don't quite understand HP's magic enough to provide in-depths experimentation for the MC to do like many amazing fanfictions seem to do. I'm considering maybe some kind of dueling tournament plot that the MC gets involved with or maybe even just a romance/fluff/slice-of-life kind of fic, but I'm not really sure.

This is the first thing you need to figure out. What challenge does your SI face, how do they overcome it and how they change in the course of overcoming that challenge. This sounds daunting, but it doesn't need to be! You can break even a huge story down into small challenges and wins.

For example---getting to Platform 9 3/4. Definitely a challenge to get there. How do they do it? Hoe are they different afterwards?

There are lots of things that can happen. Maybe they spend an hour circling around and then they manage to ask just the right person or they see someone and copy their actions or they make a friend. Then, after they've managed to get onto the platform and the train, they have a friend or higher confidence in themselves or maybe instead of a friend, they've crossed someone.

This in and of itself can be a complete story. You don't need to immediately dive into a big giant story. Tell smaller ones that are self-contained but part of a larger whole to build your skill, confidence and your version of the HP world. When I started writing HP fanfiction after OOTP came out, I started with a simple story of two people who hadn't seen each other in years having a conversation. That one story spawned my whole AU which includes a 39 chapter book. So! You can do it, but break it down into small chunks that you can achieve. Keep an eye to your larger world and it will come.

** Like earlier posters have said, take it slowly with one plot point at a time. Maybe try writing in arcs. The first arc could be focused on the entrance to the world. The first time you used magic accidentally maybe then the introduction. Did your character enter the world normally or magically? From the sound of your what you've said, it seems like it would be a SI but your character would have lived in the HP world all their life. That would make things simpler in some ways as you could say you had your own life experiences up to 11 and not have to deal with any “I know what's going to happen and who I should trust.” If you want your character older you can either decide you woke up with magic in that world or (though you could lose readers, it seems like your first priority is yourself) have hogwarts start later. Next your choices on magic. Decide how magic works with spells. Is it something down to a science in your mind with spells being the only way magic is cast, is it something like intent being a major deal, that kind of thing. Then decide how powerful you want magic to be. In some fics it's extremely weak/limited and in others it's extremely grandiose and powerful. From there I've never been a writer so I couldn't help you but remember that conflict drives a story so make sure that your character isn't OP unless you're going to make other enemy characters also be OP

** Honestly, I can't write to save my life but I do love to read, and especially fanfiction. One thing that always puts me off is when the fanfic is written in first person perspective(?). Like "I could feel my heart pounding as I saw Hogwarts emerging." I don't know if this is the case of other readers, but I would recommend using third person. If you do post it, please update us with a link!!!

** Well I guess early derailing plot points would be accidentally tripping with a known Voldemort supporter and ripping their left sleeve so all can see the tattoo. This can be done next to authority figures for better effect.

It wont fix things but will definitely kick a hornets nest by revealing the bad people early.

As for the Harry Potter magic there really isn't any deeper complex stuff about it in canon. Just remember that characters don't need to shout the spells name and later with enough mastery you can do them verbally and without wand movement, as a tactic to confuse you could say a different spell name or made up word when casting other spells.
