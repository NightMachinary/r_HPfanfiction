I just finished reading Road to Hell and I loved it. Essentially the war results in a apocalyptic world and the only about 600 magicals left go to Westeros. There they take the iron islands and begin to work their influence into becoming of one of the great houses of Westoros. Its a Harry/Daphne/Fleur and thats something I definitely like. So if you guys have anything like that please could you share thanks.

*** Started reading "God-Emperor of Essos and beyond"

The fic starts with Harrison "Harry" James Black. A quickly closed tab, that was.

"Into the Wild Westeros" lacks basic grammar to a degree that makes it hard to read. The author often skips articles and pronouns, sometimes even nouns and verbs. Combined with a very simplistic sentence structure, its only for those desperate for HPxGoT, I feel.

***** The worldbuilding is alright, I guess. I find that it takes a dive in quality in later chapters.

Overall its a power-fantasy, with Harry getting all the moneys, all the weapons, all the magic,............. I stopped at the sixth chapter. I felt the author just kept repeating how awesome Harry is for no other reason than to tell us exactly that, over and over again.
