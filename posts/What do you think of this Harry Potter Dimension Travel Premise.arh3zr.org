Okay, I'm guess we all know those stories where Harry, whether it be by walking through the veil, a plot by Voldemort, a botched attempt to weaken Voldemort, a strange and unbelievable side effect of the time turner, or for no particular reason other than Death (or sometimes, randomly, Fawkes), is sent to a different parallel reality.

Now, here's the premise: What are the chances of multiple different Harry Potters, from a Death Eater Harry to a Light Lord Harry to a lazy but incredibly talented Harry to a Grey Lord Harry (with magic cores and a great deal of inheritances, of course) and all sorts of other Harry Potters all happen to end up stranded in the same universe on the same planet at the same time? Well, they're higher than you'd think.

Basically, a bunch of different fanon Harry Potters are running around.

Edit:

The MC would probably be regular Harry, who gets ported over after his final battle.

"Love? I'm a Light Lord, and I even I would say that's not much of a power," mused twinkling-eye Harry. This Harry had his world's magic, who is apparently smitten with him so much that it had taken the form of a beautiful girl, clinging to his arm. "I mean, I have loads of special powers. On that note, the prophecy should have said 'the powers the Dark Lord knows not' rather than 'the power."

"Maybe you have Basilisk Eyes?" asked one Harry. This Harry was from a universe where his parents had survived, but he had accidentally killed them when he had awoken his power. He probably had the highest body count and was the most fucked up. He also walked around with a blindfold, but apparently he used magic to perfectly see his surroundings?

"Or maybe you're an Elemental?" asked the four different Elemental Harrys in tandem.

"No...just love," said Harry, feeling woefully under-powered.

Edit 2:

There will be 14 different Harry Potters total, each with their own lovely "the power he knows not" to boot! All summoned by a despairing Order of the Phoenix, who either did the spell terribly right or terribly wrong.

1.  Canon Harry
2.  Light Lord Harry
3.  Grey Lord Hardrian Potter-Slytherin-Gryffindor...36 titles later....Merlin.
4.  Dark Lord Harry
5.  Death Eater Harry
6.  Death Eater-Spy Harry
7.  Veteran-Dimension Hopper Harry
8.  Neville Longbottom
9.  Female Harry
10. Emotionally-scarred, physically-abused, socially stunted Harry
11. Lazy Genius Harry
12. Basilisk-Eyes Harry
13. Techno-Harry
14. ??? (This would be telling)

Edit 3: If you think of any interesting Harry Potters, let me know so I can replace the less interesting ones on this list!

** I have a premise that I'll probably never get around to which is similar to this. Instead of dropping the Prophecy in the DoM, Harry takes a wrong turn and ends up in the Death Chamber. Voldemort arrives and Harry decides he's got nothing to lose and chucks the prophecy through the Veil. It vanishes into the ether. Dumbledore arrives, showdown, yadda yadda yadda.

The next morning, surprise! The multiverse has got a few holes in it and now Harry Potters are appearing inside the Forbidden Forest. Some of them are happy to see each other. Most are not. Canon Harry must solve the conundrum he caused by venturing to the top of a nearby mountain to attain the glowing prophecy orb at the top. But to get there, he must first pass through... The Forbidden Forest Battle Royale.

As for interesting Harry Potters, you're forgetting Phoenix Harry, Dragon Harry, Werewolf Harry, Necromancer Harry, Master of Death Harry, Playboy Harry, Red Haired Harry, +Fire/Lightning/Wind Elemental Harry+ nevermind you've got those, Time Travel Harry, Transfiguration Master Harry, Thief Harry, Any-And/Or-Every-Animagus-Form Harry, [Insert Non-Gryffindor House Here] Harry, and I'm sure there's more...

You might also want to change more of those male Harrys to female for some gender equality. But that's just me and my fem!Harry obsession talking.

*** Oooh, sweet, that's a cool premise! I love the thought of Harry trying to survive other Harry Potters while he restores the universes to the natural order of things.

Oooh, of those I may try to include MOP HP, Playboy Harry, Animagus Harry (although chances are this ability will belong to one of the Harrys above--they each need to have a special power they used to dominate their Voldemort, after all!)

I may make more Fem!Harrys, although I'll have to see. I kind of like the idea of the only normal Harry, only Fem! Harry, and the only Neville forming a little pack to survive. XD

Thanks for listing all those different Harrys! I'm sure it'll help me down the road!

**** This is my take:

Instead of the "The Forbidden Forest Battle Royale", I suggest a grand conference of "Vanquishers of Voldemort", because canon Harry and PTSD Harry would NEVER stand a chance against those light lords, grey lords, dark lords, MoDs, and of course Harrymort.

So instead of them fighting/duking out each other, none of them could affect and harm the other, and everything will be resolved through debates and votes.

As things turned out, only a tiny fraction of the multiverses has Voldemort, since Tom Riddle has never been conceived, never been born, never survived to adulthood, and never become a dark lord under vast majority of circumstances. In half of the universes where he did become Lord Voldemort, he was neutralized by manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore in the 1957 meeting, when he succumbed to Dumbledore's (and Flamel's) binary alchemical concoctions. Therefore, half of the conference participants are versions of manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledores.

Of the remaining Vanquishers, their demographic breaks down as follows:

- 66% are Harry, 38% of which are female, Harrymort counts himself as "Harry".
- 13% are Neville Longbottom, among them Nevillemort
- 7% are Hermione Granger
- 5% are James or Lily Potter
- 3% are Ginny Weasley, among them Ginnymort
- 1% are Bellatrix Black
- 5% are other or unknown characters from the Series

--------------

As the conference begins, the 777 participants are being advised by Death/Fate/Magic of the agenda, instructions, and resolutions to be voted on. But first, they gather in a pre-conference meeting where they get to know each other...

Exactly. So my take on what would happen is that all the "Good" Harry's naturally start to team up against the "Evil" Harry's and it becomes this massive team deathmatch that canon Harry has to navigate through, guarded by a team of badass Harry's intent on restoring the natural order of things. This isn't helped by some of the more god-like Evil Harry's trying to initiate their version of the apocalypse (e.g. All the eldritch Harrys getting together and saying "Ohai Cthulhu"). Gives you plenty of character bonding, flashy battles, dastardly betrayals, heroic sacrifices, the lot. And basically between it all you see all of the lesser Harry's getting butchered to add a sense of horror to it.

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.

"What you described, that sounds familiar to me. I could've sworn I'd seen it before, although... how strange, it fits the definition almost word for word for Deus ex Machina," said the Lazy Genius HP in mild surprise, "I didn't think something I've only ever seen in fiction could actually manifest in reality...magic is truly wondrous indeed."

*** Many Arcs Later:

Canon Harry has Dark Lord Harry at wand-point. "Any final words?" asks Harry.

Dark Lord Harry closes his eyes. "What will it matter? Everything has been for naught. All the sacrifices I've made rendered useless." He opens his eyes, and there is a soul-deep pain. "Do you want to know why I became a Dark Lord?"

Harry hesitates, for his interactions with the Harrys before this has showed him how deep the secrets go in these other universes. Of how messed up the circumstances are.

"I wanted to become the ultimate bad," continues Evil Harry. "I wanted everyone to hate me so much that enemies and allies worked together, putting their pasts behind them for a greater purpose--that purpose being their survival. I wanted to create an everlasting peace."

"Really?" asks Harry, and his guard lowers, his wand with it.

Evil Harry snorts. "Pff, please." He lifts Canon Harry's spare wand, which Canon Harry hadn't realized was pilfered from him. "Anyway, as much fun as this has been, I've got places to be and other Harrys to kill!"
