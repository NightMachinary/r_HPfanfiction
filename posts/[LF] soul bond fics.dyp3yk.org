**** Meh, not really. I love his premise, of doing a soul bond fic that does not have the characters in love from one second to the next. But the execution of that idea could have been a lot better. From start to finish it just feels like that single idea was on the forefront of his mind the whole time he was writing. Every single scene has that "this is not your normal soul bond fic and I have to remind my readers of that fact constantly!" vibe, like he can't write anything that does not ram that one fact down the readers throat.

Sorry for that rant, was just very disappointed by it. Fics that take this approach to a soul bond are rare.

***** That's true and I completely hated whole Diablo angle (it that thing was completely erased from the story, the loss would be exactly 0), but I still liked that the author is not a paedophile pervert (as most authors of soul bond fics are) and I really liked the character of Dolores Umbridge. It is very rare to have the one which has at least far resemblance of actual human being.

#+begin_quote
  What's a girl to do when somewhere out there, there's a boy and every scar he gets appears on her body? When he's being abused? Hermione Granger, for one, is determined to find him and save him. Fourth Year. There's a big event at Hogwarts this year. The DOM is interested in the bonded. Darkness looms, old enemies return to haunt them and new foes make life more difficult.

****** The same one as above, since the bot wasn't picking up on theirs. vlaaivlaai typed the wrong title, tebebris added an exclamation point beforehand, I thought I would try it again. Seems like it's down temporarily.

******* It shouldn't matter that I typed the wrong title, because I know how the bot works: it puts the request into google and picks the right result, so giving the approximate title should be enough in most cases. My discord bot does the same (albeit with Bing), and [[https://i.imgur.com/Rno2Gky.png][it finds the fic fine]].

That's why I was rather unconcerned that I didn't link the perfect title, it's just the bot that is behaving weird. Maybe it can't google because it's stuck at a captcha or something, then even the exact title wouldn't work. (Which is why my bot uses bing, they have an actual API)

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

  Harry and Hermione decide to make a soul bond, despite not really knowing what they are doing. Horlarity ensues (portmanteau of "Horror" and "Hilarity"). This short story is not to be taken seriously.
