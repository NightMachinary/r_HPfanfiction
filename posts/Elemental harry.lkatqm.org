When fiendfyre is cast in the RoR Harry gets caught by it but obviously fate won't let him die so easily and thus as he is consumed by the flames the flames are also consumed by him reforming him and making him something akin to a logia type from one piece like ace but with magical fiendfyre instead of regular fire


** Fyre-fyre no mi

That being said you'd need to create a secondary power system or something to make it so Harry can't just shit stomp everything

** It would have to have some drawbacks, otherwise people will just see it as a powerwank. Perhaps he needs special training to not burn everything he touches?

*** As it is a magical fire that consumes magic, a portion of his own magic would be used whenever he uses it or becomes intangible with it and if he runs out of magic he can no longer become intangible or use it until his magic recovers

**** Still, this is fiendfyre, literally the most destructive magic used in canon. We don't even know if Voldemort was capable of using it, the fire he used in the movie was never described as fiendfyre and dumbledore just threw it to the side. He would need more self-control than a priest in a preschool to manage those flames

***** It would be like a logia type from one piece probably about as powerful/destructive as akainu or eneru but fire obviously and I am of the opinion that logia types have an instinctive ability to control their own element otherwise they would just be puddles/amalgamations of said element

*** special training but the author covers it in a timeskip so it's out of the way before beginning of chapter 2 LUL
