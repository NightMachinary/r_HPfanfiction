If after makeing and hiding his Hocrux Tom Riddle had faded into the background and just reasearched different methods of Immortality (instead of useing the same one multiple times) would anyone even have cared ? It's not like living for a long time is a crime. And if he really was immortal he had no need to rush after all he had all the time in the world.

Then again I think that Tom riddle rushed into creating a Hocrux he was 16 years old and wizards can live for at least 100 years easily. But he seems to have used the first method of immortality he found.

Then again mabye he was rushed into because he was livening muggle London and the Blitz happened during his fourth or fifth year.

Why do you think Tom riddle rushed and used the first method of immortality he found?

voldemort has a law passed that ritual sacrifice can be used as an alternative to the dementors kiss. legalized human sacrifice as a form of execution.

death eaters would become a government sanctioned organization. the ministry would have a horcrux repository. st. mungos would have a reconstitution wing for horcrux spirits waiting to gain a body.

******* It neither has to be a wizard, nor an innocent. He may talk and boast, but Voldemort clearly still sees Muggles as humans, just humans who are a bit more loathsome than the rest (but then, he sees nearly all humans as loathsome anyway). We know this because two of his Horcruxes were made from Muggles, you'll recall: the Diadem with a Muggle tramp, and the Ring with his father.

By the same byway of his father's murder, we know the victim doesn't have to be "innocent", at least in the murderer's eyes. Voldemort despised his father for what he saw as essentially killing his mother, and would certainly partly have seen that kill as serving "justice".

Nicholas Flamel was immortal and it wasn't a big deal. He became famous as the immortal alchemist but no government condemned him for it. The biggest issue he would have would people trying to steal the stone. Eventually I'd imagine someone would come after Voldemort trying to learn his secret.

Even though it was murder based, /no one knew he committed those./ Dumbledore had his suspicions about Tom but had no proof. I hardly think it was relevant on how he obtained immortality especially if he could not be prosecuted for it.

Because Immortality is a very obscure act/art that not many can achieve. Only three people to my knowledge have managed to gain it:

Voldemort

Flamel

Herpo the Faul.

By making such knowledge easy to access you'd have massive wars between immortals.

EDIT: Not to mention that some people (good) would prefer to stay mortal for various reasons.

The way they function is, a soul being split is against the natural order, so the different pieces of a torn soul exert a pull on one another. So if one part of the soul has lost its connection to a body, instead of moving into the Afterlife, it's going to be anchored to the mortal realm by the other pieces that are still there.

There's nothing whatsoever in there that would protect the body. Indeed, I think it doesn't prevent aging at all, and even if no one had killed him, Voldemort would have had to go through the body-making ritual eventually, just to replace the crumbling ruin his body would have become. Well, that, or he'd have made himself a Philosopher's Stone, of course, once he had the time to do so. (Tis my belief it was always part of his plans.

** The thing I've always found funny (as in strange, not humorous) about his methods of immortality is that is being half a ghost really worth it? It's not like he could just continue on with his life the same way as any other average person would. Nobody even knew he was still 'alive' or knew where he was, either. I think that there are other, more preferable ways of being immortal that he didn't bother to look into because he got so hung up on actually /being/ immortal, he didn't think of what if might be like should his body actually die. By the hand of an enemy, or just to age - it's not like a horcrux would have created agelessness, it just keeps your soul tethered to the realm of the living. I really don't think he thought this through.

Anyway, as others have said, I don't think that anyone would have cared that he was immortal if A) he wasn't trying to take over the world, and B) he either didn't kill anyone in order to become immortal, or they just didn't know that's how he did it. Immortality itself might be seen as unnatural, but considering how long magical people live, it's possible they just don't think about it. They probably have plenty of time to accomplish what they'd like to accomplish within their lifetimes.

He was able to possess people. He built an organization devoted to him to ensure he would have help getting a body back. Being a wraith temporarily probably seemed worth it, and I doubt he expected to be living in a forest in Albania for a decade without a body.
