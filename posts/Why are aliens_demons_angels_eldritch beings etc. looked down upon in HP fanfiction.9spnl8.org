Like any concept, if it is thought-out and well-executed, then people should have little problem with aliens/eldritch abominations/angels etc in fanfiction.

Personally, I think introducing such concepts breath new life into the same-old HP fanfiction that has been read. Oh, another 'Voldemort vs The Order' fanfic? Wait, what's this? A magical precursor species from a hyper-advanced society -- beings who can tank killing curses like nothing? What about a Dormammu-like entity that crushes Voldemort and the DEs like a boot would to an ant? Better yet, if these beings have a fleshed-out backstory to them.

Sure, it isn't as contentious as shipping certain pairings; yet, when people say they want something "different" and given it to them, they disagree with outside-context concepts.


** It's usually a sign that the writer considers canon magic insufficient for telling a magical story. There's also the likelihood that the new creatures/powers are being brought in to boost Harry to face Voldemort as a fair player instead of a sacrifice, which usually leads to the question 'why didn't Riddle try this before him?'.

I get particularly irritated if the crossover elements share similar talents but make them incompatible. 'Harry has mutant telepathy, which is sooooo much more powerful than Legilimency, and his defenses totally protect his mind against his enemies, though their pitiful powers can't protect them from Harry'.

It'd be fine if the threat was new and applied to both sides e.g.: Predators and Xenomorphs land on earth, and the goblins beg any and all wizards to help get them out of their tunnels; but that's not the likely scenario.

*** Yeah, balance is a huge issue. Divine creatures ought to powercreep the shit out of Harry, Voldemort and Dumbledore, so including them renders canon magic obsolete by default.

Their restrictions also seem very arbitrary, like Death who can send Harry back through time and revive him for the 1486 time so that he can +bang Hermione+ defeat Voldemort, but simply smiting Riddle down is too much?

**** That brings to mind another of my story-concept peeves: why would immortal beings care what happens in any individual life? For that matter, why would they be motivated to make life easier for Harry? If anything, they'd get more entertainment value from throwing extra obstacles in the way and see how the heroes cope with the change-up.

*** I've seen this done another, stupider way as well. In this Smallville crossover (ignoring the crap made up to excuse making HP wizards inferior), Lex Luthor id described by Harry as a "natural Occlumens" and so Harry can't really read his mind because he's so calm and guarded or whatever. Which was total crap since Occlumency is magic and not just being calm or whatever.

My approach is basically what you mentioned. If you're going to have mutants and such, making the abilities not do what they're supposed to do is completely stupid. A sufficiently good Occlumens should be able to block telepathy (Legilimency is literally just telepathy via magic) and such. My only guess is authors realize that the crossover is going to favor HP power wise and so they chuck out the logic for "balance".

** It's often used to render canon adversaries obsolete - or bash them. That's generally not a good thing for a crossover.

And herein lies the problem with all fanfiction. It is mostly (and by mostly I mean 99%+) not good.

If I read something like Aliens, or demons or whatever, I mostly presume its gonna be edgy, badly thought out, lazy in its plotting or all of the above.

*** I have to agree with this. Vampire-focused fics, in particular, have a reputation for copying the worst tropes from urban fantasy books. It's rare to see a fic in which the vampire characters aren't absurdly pretty nymphomaniacs.

** I quite like this particular kind of premise in HP fanfiction, unfortunately you are right about the rarity. The only really substantial work I can think of that works like this is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/524094/][The Denarian Series by Shezza.]]

There are a couple of Lovecraft inspired fics that I know of, but I either haven't read them in a while, or in the case of one got interrupted by something and never got back to. so I can't entirely vouch for their quality. Here are some links to them.

**** I can answer that:

No, but you'll miss some details if you haven't which aren't detrimental to your enjoyment of the story.

** I've never really thought about it. I guess because canon provides such a rich variety of creatures already? It's easier and often more satisfying to develop an existing canon element. Having said that, the novelty would be interesting.

** Generally, the main reason I don't see many good stories incorporating this, is because they usually end up being included just to be there with very little real presence in the plot. Alternatively, they often just walk roughshod over the ebtire setting.

Personally, I've always considered HP magic to be quite underwhelming, and do quite enjoy it when good authors not only incorporate beings like angels, demons, etc, but also when they scale magic appropriately, with additional depth to the while thing.

Meanwhile, we get plenty of the bad stories that do this, you know the kind. The elsritch horror that walks roughshod over the "big players" in canon, but are rendered moot against the inherent plot armor wielded by harry and Abby other characters the author happens to like.

Of course, good authors that put in the work to make a great story are more than welcome to do these things right, but they are few and far between.

** I think it's because J.K. Rowling's world building was so specific and so distinctive. When you bring in lots other creatures that were never referenced or eluded to throughout seven long books with very intricate and nuanced internal systems (and fall outside of any referenced categories of being), it doesn't feel like the same universe anymore.
