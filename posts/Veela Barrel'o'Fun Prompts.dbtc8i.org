I had these ideas in the past, but I thought "hey, people here might find these interesting", so I'm posting them here. Hopefully at least one person will find my brain-diarrhea interesting, since I like to think they're different than what most people use for veela in fics? I'm unsure.

These are separate and all jumbled but could easily be put together, I guess?

Veela have a tendency to be compulsive gamblers: however, it also has tendency to go wrong for those gambling with them as it is like playing a game against a wookie (remember that quote from Solo to C3PO about a losing wookie ripping arms off?) to the point where goblins are wary.

Pissed off, fire-hurling harpy? Yeah. Pray that your card isn't a winning hand.

Some Bulgarian Cheerleaders were pissed about the result of the match.

There were those happy that they won (like the veela who had wizards boasting to her); others, borderline apoplectic. The Death Eaters' semi-drunken raid goes wrong when they piss off the group that bet on the losing team, and rampaging veela get added to the chaotic mix.

  "Veela, Lucius!" said one of his Masked associates. "Veela! *Angry* veela!" He cradled his burned hand to his chest, his charred fingers still holding tightly onto what was once his wand.

  "No names, you fool!" Lucius snapped. "And how was I supposed to know that the Bulgarian mascots would be prowling around at this time of night!"

  The second Death Eater made a sneering sound from the back of his throat and took a step forwards...

  The wall of the tent they'd sought refuge in began to smoke and smoulder; a perfect hole burned its way into existence, and the visage of an avian demoness came into view, the contours and highlights of her face lit up by the fire wreathing in her clawed hands.

  Her cold, inhuman eyes blinked once, and she /snarled/.

  "I blame you for this, Lucius!"

  "Shut up and run!"

This was Harry's introduction to a veela's darker nature, which instills a good, healthy dose of caution in him.

Unfortunately, by the time Fleur arrives at Hogwarts, she frequently indulges her heritages' foible. And she's /terrible/ at it.

Veela have an orange and green mentality compared to a human's red and blue: their wetware OS could be compared more to a LINUX Mint than a human's Microsoft OS, so while similar, different foibles apply.

While Fleur and her family, except for her grandmother, aren't pure veela, their heritage does manifest in odd anomalies/quirks/thought processes amongst 'normal' human ones, with it all being stronger in her mother due to her being half.

Pure veela tend to black widow their husbands or significant others on their wedding nights or nights of passion, no matter how much in love they are with their spouses -- Bill and Apolline's Husband are safe because their instincts are suppressed due to not being entirely veela. They, in their OaG mentality, find it both romantic and as part of an instinctual drive.

Not Fleur's grandfather, though.

Despite this, wizards and muggles still try to chat them up, though a veela's effects on men are partly to blame.

Veela are competitive over husbands and potential partners: fights frequently break-out at family gatherings between married/taken veela and unattached ones trying to poach or compete for the same target.

#+begin_quote
  A horrid mental image of the Bulgarian mascots stopping mid-dance, sniffing the air, and then looking directly up at the top box.

  Cue everyone but a confused Harry and a paralyzed-with-fear Arthur bailing out in a blink of an eye.

  "Uh." Harry slowly moved over to the Minister's vacant seat and, surely enough, the veelas' eyes followed him from left to right as one. "That's... odd."

  He tore his eyes away from the omniocculars, blinking owlishly as his eyes readjusted from the strain.

  One of the veela, a slim, pretty red-head, smiled up at him, not that he could see it; her teammate, a dark-haired beauty with intense blue eyes, scowled at her and promptly shoved her away, sending her careening to the muddied ground.

  She was promptly jumped on from behind by a particularly lithe blonde, and before anyone could blink a vicious brawl had broken out.

  "What's going on, Mr Weasley?" He blinked and looked around. "Mr Weasley?"

  Arthur Weasley's seat was vacant.
#+end_quote

I had a vague, loosely-connected plot bunny that, on hindsight, looked to be ''written with one hand'' as someone on SB said, which amusingly wasn't my intention.

Maybe there's something salvageable from it?

- Fleur's grandmother lost a bet with her grandfather, resulting in their marriage: however, she liked him so much for his audacity that she didn't roast his magical nuts off and they actually ended up happy
- Contrarily, Apolline (her mother) won her father in a poker match, as /he/ desperately offered /himself/ up as a stake to win back family heirlooms (turns out his 'unbeatable hand' of a flush was beaten by hers, a Royal)\\
  Hes learned to live with it, is reasonably content, and has two beautiful daughters out of his fuck-up.
- Harry is introduced to poker and blackjack by the Gryffindor quidditch team back in his Third year, or maybe at the beginning of his Fourth -- it's a tradition that the active squad often have friendly games as 'team-bonding' exercises
- Amusingly, this results in Harry and Katie becoming competitive and closer as a result
- Triwizard shit goes down
- Ludo is in trouble with the veela and the goblins: there's a subplot with him desperately trying to stay ahead of either, while the goblins and veela duke it out like vultures fighting over a delicious, fresh corpse -- he tries more actively to get Harry to win (biggest payout), as do veela/goblin elements for similar interests
- Fleur learns of the poker matches/that Harry plays: things occur (the roughest, undefined part of the plot. No idea), and she's insulted for some reason
- Somehow, a chaotic poker game goes down that sucks in the quidditch team and the Champions
- Cedric bows out early, as does Krum (from experience that pissed off veela are /bad/)
- Stakes are raised as desperation and the gambler's low/high effects kick in
- Consequences/prizes/losses are random and a bit wild, such as Harry taking Katie to the Yule Ball, Krum having to learn Klingon, et cetera -- just random Scooby Doo shenanigans that involve favours, promises, and galleons
- Ends up with a desperate Harry pulling an underdog during a poker hand and winning a desperate Fleur's stake (he was desperate to win back a prior stake, maybe his Cloak; hers was basically as something valuable after she lost pretty much everything in mutual MAD)

#+begin_quote
  Sitting on the table they'd "appropriated", Harry looked between Katie and Fleur.

  Said girls were glaring at one another over their hands of cards.

  "Don't I get a say in this?"

  "No!"/"Non!"

  "Quiet, Harry!" Hermione was enraptured by the game, her eyes flicking between the two.

  "It's always the last ones you expect," he muttered.

  "Shush!"
#+end_quote

- Naturally, he's disturbed about the whole thing, though happy to get his Cloak back

- He tries to return valuable stuff to Fleur after the game, but this actually offends her (veela mentality)

  Possible outcomes:

- Fleur gambled /herself/ instead of something valuable. She lost. Harry, naturally uncomfortable with the whole thing (and remembering that angry, gambling veela = bad), tries to laugh it off and release her from any obligations. Fleur does a 180 and is /offended/ that Harry doesn't want her (and this causes fallout).

- Fleur bemoans her misfortune/fate to her mother: it ends up with Apolline cornering Harry with her family and forcing him into a poker game to win back what Fleur lost. She loses, and Harry ends up with Fleur as a prize.\\
  Amusingly or musingly, Apolline and her mother reflect on this occurrence and their own marriages' circumstances: Fleur is sort-of okay with this, since she knew of her family's history and of other veela sometimes having the same thing happen to them (it's kinda like a way of meeting potential partner to them, much like ordinary human 'dating' or goblins beating the shit out of their love-interest's siblings to show strength/impress the family)

- Gabrielle somehow wins after another chaotic poker game. Courtesy of her love for her sister and her childish view of the world (''I don't want Fleur to be an old spinster at 18! She's not had a boyfriend yet!''), it ends up with Harry having to marry Fleur when he turns 17 (or 16, due to Scottish law IIRC)

- Rita finds this all out. But, in a rare occurrence of brilliance, comes to the conclusion that /supporting/ the whole thing instead of slandering it will be more profitable in the long run -- this gets Magical Britain to support this, much to Harry's and his friends' horror.

- Messages of congratulations also come from the Continent.

Obviously it's crack humour.

Veela beauty is an illusion; only those married to them see their true selves, but by then they are so enthralled that they don't care. Harry is one of the few, rare people in the world capable of seeing what they truly are without being enthralled, and so the Delacour family is assigned to ensure he doesn't blow their species' cover.

Harry makes a joke that veela must be like swans or geese: proud and utterly nuts when aggravated. (You ever seen a geese or swan attack? Those bitches be crazy and can seriously hurt you!).

Fleur wonders how Harry worked out/discovered her species' true origins, which is kept as a well-protected secret: they're not descendant from a race of proud mountain nymphs, but are the results of an ancient, Quintaped-like Transfiguration experiment involving swans.

Her grandmother orders her to watch Harry, to prevent the secret from spreading.

Other, unrelated prompts:

Harry is not the BWL: perhaps it's Neville, or his brother, or something. Dumbledore's focus, as a result, is elsewhere.

He does, however, run an underground casino in an abandoned classroom. Galleons, favours, and information are the wagers: Lavender is hired to be the hostess; other, lesser-used characters are the few members of staff needed, like croupiers/cashiers, and Goyle and Crabbe have a side-gig as 'security' (business is business and a paycheck is a paycheck).

Eventually, Neville/his brother/et cetera and their friends discover the illicit operation by accident, while embroiled in the typical events of the 'plot of the year'.

The aftermath of the Chamber of Secrets Debacle left Harry something like half-phoenix.

His mentality becomes subtly altered (a lot of human behaviour is built on an ape OS, just a "Windows 10" version of it compared to an ape's "Windows 1.0 -- Phoenix additions would be like dumping a ton of Linux or MacOS code into Windows 10 and the resulting Frankenstein somehow meshing and working), and it affects his behavior in bizarre ways. Oh, and he randomly sprouts wings and such at inopportune moments.

Regarding girls he finds attractive: Harry trying to impress them by doing bird-like stuff, only for them to wonder what the fuck he's doing. Contrary to expectations, veela, like Fleur or the Cheerleaders, are baffled beyond belief.

...Pansy Parkinson or another lesser-used character is a closet-weirdo and finds his displays interesting, for a comedic sub-plot.

So, er, yeah. I hope these were entertaining.

** I have another two for you, if you do not mind my intrusion.

(Trope subversion)

Veela!Fleur declares Harry her mate, but Harry is completely and utterly uninterested, and thinks her vapid, vain and altogether unpleasant to be with. He rejects being her mate, and a bitter, heartbroken Fleur disappears after the Triwizard Tournament, only to return ten years later as a nascent Dark Lord in France. Her goal ? To reclaim her mate and make him pay for turning her into a dark husk, into someone that cannot feel emotion, taste food or enjoy the world in any way. For that is the fate of a rejected Veela.

(Horror oneshot)

Fleur is transfigured into a harp by a jealous blood-supremacist Slytherin girl during the Tournament, and hidden. The spell is permanent unless dispelled. After the initial search dies off, the girl keeps the harp as a memento, but leaves it at Hogwarts when she graduates a few years later. The transfigured Fleur remains as a harp until the harp finally completely is destroyed by a great magical incident thousands of years later.

All this time, Fleur cannot move onto the afterlife as she is technically still alive, merely static and transfigured into a harp. When her family dies, they hope to see Fleur once more. They are disappointed, until they are met by Death himself, who names her one of the Forgotten Ones, those who long elude him, often not by choice.

*** She graduates and tries to move on: however, over the course of a few years, she becomes increasingly cold and bitter in a decline before vanishing, worrying her family.

It'd also be far more tragic is if when she does find Harry (he fell out of the public eye and was hidden by his friends), she finds him as pretty much an emotional husk (much like those in deep, deep clinical depression), barely responsive to the world.

Rage and hate shift to pity, disappointment, and bitterness, and ultimately she tries to rehabilitate him as she continues her campaign of world-domination.

I actually had an idea of subverting the whole 'veela mate' thing myself:

This gets pretty grim-derp.

Instead of the accidental Bond causing the veela to alter her personality or cognitive functions to be a match to the wizard (yes, there are fics like that out there), or instead of the Bond fostering love and empathy between the two...

The Bond is very predatory yet rarely occurring. Much to Fleur's, her family's, and those in the know's (Dumbledore, Maxine, et cetera) horror, a connection is formed between her and Harry when he saves her.

Being invasive and incomplete due to Fleur not willingly/consciously trying to complete the process, Harry naturally tries to fight it -- and it results in him degenerating into a gibbering, insane wreck (the padded cell type). Fleur is torn by guilt on seeing him like that.

Eventually, either the bond wins and Harry finally breaks/succumbs or Fleur, regretfully, finishes the process due to guilt/horror at seeing what was happening. Maybe it's because this happened with her grandfather and (veela) grandmother, and she received advice/a revelation that her grandfather, someone she loved very much, had essentially been brain-raped in much the same way. Also even more horrifying and confusing as her grandmother accepted it over time, and by the time she was born she only knew them as being very much in love as she grew up with them in her life (see below).

The horror focus of the fic would be the waves/fallout, especially with his family and friends. Maybe it'd be from Fleur's point-of-view.

The bond begins to alter him: changing his personality and brainwashing him into, essentially, the perfect lover for Fleur. The worst thing? He knows. He understands. And he doesn't care. He's incapable of thinking a way around it, not that he'd want to anyway. His purpose in life is to be hers.

To everyone else, it's like watching a new person with the mannerisms and memories of Harry emerge and walk around in Harry's meat-suit.

But he doesn't see this. He's confused as to why people are mourning him as though he's died.

The horror and guilt she feels is unimaginable, and worse still she's stuck with him: someone who did nothing wrong but save her life and was rewarded by being perverted/personality-killed. Gabrielle quickly becomes fond of him, being so young as to not understand the situation, and is doing her best to support her sister's ''marriage''. She pretty much gained a big brother out of it, which he quickly fits into the role of (also hurting Fleur more).

And the more he tries to comfort her at night as she cries, the more he tries to make her happy as he's compelled to, merely inflicts more damage.

So, yeah. Psychological horror.
