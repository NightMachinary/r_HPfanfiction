...I present to you a 7 part Albus Potter series which doesn't clash in any way with canon although it is worth noting though some Pottermore canon was ignored because it was made after the Fic was written.

The plot is just as thorough and well thought out as the originals if not more so. A fair warning though the entire first book its almost entirely setting up the later ones. Not to say it isn't entertaining, just don't judge the series from just the first book, quite the opposite actually; there are twists and turns in my opinion rivaling Snape's backstory or Darth Vader's grand reveal and enough mysteries to keep your brain busy.

So here it goes:

It is also worth noting when the 7th novel is done (due to be by the end of the month), the author is likely to finish a half done prequel which goes into detail with the events between Deathly Hallows and 19 Years Later (Book One's starting point). To be honest this prequel is likely a better starting point to get impressions from for the rest of the series but it is unfinished and the other 7 books obviously spoil it.

** Just a review from someone who read the first three or four books, then sort of gave up: it was okay. It was definitely readable. If someone wrote passionately about how "book 7 will blow your mind, dude, you just have to push through" I probably would. But I found the entire plot of book 3-where albus essentially can't do magic because he got a second wand for dual wand use and his wands don't like each other-really silly and irritating. There's some cool magic and potions in there, and some interesting thoughts on wand lore. I always like seeing adult Harry and Hermione and Ron, so that was a pleasure as always. Solid 6-7/10. The 'kinesis' thing never really bugged me that much. It's different from cannon magic. Butoso are a lot of things.

*** I agree that it's readable, and makes an effort to stick to canon characterizations, for sure, but browsing though the early chapters... something about it the way it focuses on detail more than plot and character makes it seem not very mature to me. Example. We fans like the nice, interesting names like Albus Severus and Lily Luna, and would naturally get a kick out of every time they're discussed or mentioned. But realistically, nobody introduces themselves with their middle names. That's why JKR herself couldn't stuff them all into the epilogue and had to tell us the names in interviews. If a fanfic can't resist from focusing too much on that, it's not a good sign...

*** It does hit on those. But it delivers it in a different way. I'll copy the blurb on it from the authors page for you:

#+begin_quote
  KINESIS

  In Andy's and my Albus Potter universe, we decided to introduce the concepts of two wands (Diwandology). We also decided to further the concepts of wandless magic that JK sometimes hinted at. There were inherent problems in this, though. The first was that if using two wands made you a more powerful duelist, why doesn't everyone learn to use two wands? That could possibly be explained by "it's hard to concentrate on two wands at once," but no matter how difficult it was, you still would see it more often, because there are a lot of people willing to try difficult things and there are a lot of people who SUCCEED at difficult things. The next problem was that if there was someone who mastered two wands, they would appear to be unbeatable. How could we give a weakness to the use of two wands? And the last problem was that wandless magic appears to be possible, but it's extremely difficult and thus not usually taught. Why?

  Andy came up with something he had always imagined was in the works of the original series, but never explicitly explained--just accepted that, like physical combat, magical combat could tire you out. This concept was given the name "Kinesis," meaning in a sense "energy."

  Kinesis is, in the dictionary definition we constructed, "the potency factor of the manifestation of a spell." What this means is that Kinesis is the name given to the energy jets you see blasting out of people's wands when they use Expelliarmus or Stupefy or Avada Kedavra. It is the energy of the spell made physical. You have in your body a natural "Kinesis level," which is the source of the magical energy--AND the normal energy--in your body. You can use this energy to use magic, just like you can use it to exercise or think or fight off sickness. But if you do too much magic, your Kinesis level decreases. You get tired. Just like you can't run too much without getting tired. And if you ran too much, you would probably also be too tired to use magic a bunch. However, it is a different muscle, so you may still be able to do some magic: like doing a bunch of push-ups may tire you out of being able to do too many push-ups, but you might still be able to do some sit-ups because it uses different muscles. This is also why the seventh years' Wizarding Tests are "Nastily Exhausting." Practicing magic increases your Kinesis level, though, just like you can run a little farther every day.

  Wands come in because it is extremely difficult to channel your Kinesis outside of your body without help from some sort of magical instrument. There is a factor called Resistance. Just like going through water will slow you down, you can't send the magic outside of your body so easily. Wands are used because they provide a channel through which we can more easily send our magic; it's like how wearing fins in water eases your movement more. It decreases Resistance, because the wand chooses a wizard and they share an emotional bond. Without that bond, it will be much harder to perform simple spells, which is why Harry's usage of the blackthorn wand was less than successful. Sharing two wands means you share the bond, so it is actually more difficult to perform spells when you are using two wands, but these effects usually do not occur unless you are using them concurrently--holding both and using both, as you might do during a duel. Now, wands are matured--that is, put through a final stage of development which has been proven to decrease Resistance even further--making modern wandlore better. The extra decrease of Resistance has become extraordinarily important, because it is all that was needed to give double wands a more widespread usage. Before this point, it was difficult to use two wands because Resistance actually increases when you own two wands. Now, though, that increase in Resistance has been somewhat diminished because wands are better, and so owning two wands has become more commonplace.

  Wandless magic, on the other hand, does not have the benefit of decreased Resistance, and so it takes a lot more energy to manifest the spell, which drains your Kinesis level faster. That is why wandless magic is so difficult. The way to minimize Resistance to its lowest possible effects is to use a single wand, and that is why the most common method of using magic is by only using one wand and people don't just always go around using multiple wands.

  Hope that cleared up the ambiguous concept of Kinesis. It took a while to develop this concept fully, and so I doubt it will automatically click for you guys. But if anything else becomes important, or something I've already said becomes crucial, I will restate it in a chapter and try to make it as clear as possible so that you don't miss any important details. Thanks for reading!

  Book 7 of 7, sequel to "Albus Potter and the Chaos Contagion." Definitely WILL be finished before the end of summer 2016! (Read all previous installments first!) The fate of the world hangs in the balance as Albus discovers there is a very fine line between power and madness, a very blurry line between right and wrong, and no line at all between our world and the Abyssal Vortex.

** I liked the first couple but then the plot got really confusing and complicated.
