When the muggle world send their people, they're not sending their best. They're sending annoying, bushy haired know-it-alls who want to take a wizard's house elf.

*** I know there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10485934/1/Inspected-By-No-13][Inspected By No 13]] where Harry becomes a magical Inspector and stops Voldemort with his insane new powers.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12149140/1/Best-Served-Cold][Best Served Cold]], where Harry is a time-travelling Auditor. It was never finished (last update in 2017), but it has Malfoy rendered destitute, albeit by bringing a contract thing Draco signed in the future back to the past and cashing it in at Gringotts, who honors it despite it being from the future.

I also just decided to google and found a chapter of a random [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4019373/19/Common-Sense][odd ideas file]] where Dumbles gets audited for violating the Potter will.
