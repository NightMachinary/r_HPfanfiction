I've just started reading a fic called the legacy. By storytellerSPW linkffn(9774121) because I read it somewhere here around two days ago.

I'm halfway through and I don't know if I hate the user who reccomended it for killing my productivity and my weekend or love you for a beautiful written, very intense fic with massive amounts of character development and a completely pausible AU that even somehow avoids demonizing Dumbledore and Snape and adds masive amouts of believable magical theory.

A fic that defies and could even redifine some of the most hated tropes in the fandom: marriage contracts, alternative solving of the horrocrux situation, grey harry, very slow burn harry/daphne. Among others.

I haven't read a fic that immersive or well written since some of my favorites like the seventh horrocrux, hermione granger and the marriage law revolution, or ananke.

A true MUST READ.


** Someone please give me a second opinion before I jump into this 700k+ word monstrosity. Is it worth it?

*** I got you fam. Granted, it has been a year since I've touched it. The largest problem with 'this 700k+ work monstrosity' is that the author could easily cut out 350k of those words and not change a thing about the story. It is VERY repetitive and reiterates many aspects of the story multiple times. Now that is not to say that it is not enjoyable. I distinctly recall enjoying much of the Daphne and Harry interaction towards the wedding but as I said, there is alot work to get relatively smaller payoff than you'd expect in such a large story

**** I disagree, I won't say it aloud because of spoilers for potential readers.

It's a story very centered on its characters. If someone is looking for an action filled fic or a 'hey, we must marry, lets fuckl' they should read another fic instead

*** The story is terrible. There's a whole large swath of nothing that happens. Like, the entire first third is pretty much just the summer, where nothing happens. Take a book the size of Goblet of Fire, and have it be the dullest thing ever, and you have what it is.

Of course, there's all the cliches as well. The part that really turned the story from a tedious chore to outright bad was when the author decided to do the whole gimmick where having a piece of Voldemorts soul gives Harry access to his memories and such. It was kind of out of nowhere.

Lastly, the author tries to portray everything as logical and thought-out, but the story is really anything but that. The author presents conclusions that the in-story actions don't actually support, which creates a disconnect between what the reader is reading, and what the author thinks the reader is reading. Hermione is probably the worst offender at this, and her character is particularly unbearable in this story, though not for the normal reasons.

** This story has a lot going for it, but there's also a lot to dislike.

On the plus side, the characterisation of all the principal actors is superb. Harry, Daphne, Hermione and Ron develop in believable ways, and minor characters such as Snape are done well too. The usual tropes for a Haphne fic are mostly avoided - none of the Ice Queen nonsense, and while Ron finds it difficult to trust Daphne, it's not done in the usual boring way. The story itself is interesting and original.

On the other hand, as others have mentioned, it is slooooow. I'm all for a slow-burning story but this couldn't be much slower without standing still. It tends to repeat itself a bit too - especially in the way relationships develop. I lost count of the number of times two characters were getting on better only for something to happen that made them drift apart again. I think around 25%-50% of the words could have been cut without the story being harmed.

On the whole though, I enjoyed the story and wish it would start updating again.

*** It's not my kind of thing so admittedly I didn't try very hard; but after an overlong author's note (which I didn't read, because I think stories should stand without them) the second paragraph had 'baited breaths' (the first paragraph was copied from canon anyway), there was a typo in the third paragraph and a 'Piers Polkins' in the fourth. Which was as far as I got. It's not a new story and I can't believe that in 3k reviews, no one has mentioned those things. The author has had nearly four years to sort out basic errors like that!

It does beg the question, why do I bother with all those piddling little details?

** How are Ron and Hermione in the story? Usually, I don't bother with Harry/Daphne since most stories have Daphne as smart or smarter as Hermione, and lean heavily into pureblood apologism, with Ron being the strawman bigot, and Hermione the ignorant mudblood barbarian in need of being taught how wrong her silly notions about slavery and equality are.

*** They're pretty decent. Hermione's got a bit of that "her way or highway" kind of thing going on when it comes to how some things are to be done (Occlumency, really) that we see a bit of in canon, and Ron doesn't really trust Daphne that much. No pureblood apologism, and no Mugglewank either. Daphne's not smarter than Hermione, though she is maybe a bit more devious/vicious?

*** Present. Supporting of harry and skeptical but never hostile to daphne. No bashing neither Ron, Hermione, molly, dumbledore nor snape. not even Malfoy, although he's not a good guy. There's NO BASHING in this fic.

** I for one think the slowness of pace makes it stand out. It's one of the believable HP/DG out there

The best part about it is they don't just fall into bed after 20k words. It's meaningful and believable. She isn't a Mary Sue. It's not a Canon rehash. Harry isn't OP. The whole thing stands out because of these. I wish it wasn't abandoned :/
