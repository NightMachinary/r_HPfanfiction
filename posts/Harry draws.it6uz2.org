anything where Harry has a talent for art, thanks.


** Technically he's a painter and musician in Ingenio Ab Artifex, so it meets your note requirement, but not your title requirement.

It's a fun one where Harry and Dumbledore are very close, with a very familial-esque relationship. I can't link directly due to rule 8 (to clarify, the older person doesn't know their partner is a minor - age fourteen or fifteen, I think? - and it's completely non-graphic and basically just 'we went upstairs and had a great half an hour' but that's semi-suggestive and better safe than banned :D), but here's a link to the author profile.

He draws in The Life He Leads, though. It's his 'thing'. The fic also displays an impressive and interesting development of Big Magic Stuff with The Northern Magics that doesn't just have him picking it up overnight.

** Stargon1's Dragon Chronicles have Harry as an artist and woodworker. Too bad it seems he's abandoned it, right after starting the sequel.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** I'm not sure if he's got any talent in the story, but in linkffn(A Blank Canvas by TideTurner27), Harry takes an art class.

linkffn(The Refiner's Fire by Abraxan) has Harry with a talent for mosaics.

Harry draws in linkffn(Trust is a Relative Thing by Silverfawkes).

Harry is a fashion designer in linkffn(Bolt Fashion by White Angel of Auralon).

  Harry Potter knows that money can give you power and influence. He has learned that from a young age on, seeing how his relatives get away with many things. And others having way much more than you do can be a problem. Thus he starts his path to cause a small revolution in its own right. No matter if Dumbledore doesn't like it. Two-shot.

  Magic is more than just waving a stick and saying fancy words. Magic is about life and art. Magic is about the people one chooses to interact with. An artistic Harry Potter decides to live up to his last name and begins to craft some wonderful pottery and ceramic creations. At age 11, he discovers that not only is his work magical but so is he!
