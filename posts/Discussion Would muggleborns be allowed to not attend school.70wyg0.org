I just came across a fic where Hermione's parents pull her out of the school after the troll incident and it got me thinking... Can muggleborns choose not to attend?

We know that untrained magical kids can be dangerous to themselves and others (obscurials). Putting the situation in America aside (there is clearly some problems with identifying muggleborns there considering what happened with Credence), Hogwarts seems to be pretty reliable on getting kids their letters. Untrained kids would also be a huge risk to the statue of secrecy. Would parents be "convinced" by whatever means necessary to let their kid go?


** That's an interesting question. I know that attending Hogwarts isn't compulsory--Draco's parents were considering Durmstrang--but as to whether a magical child would be able to skip all magical education is a good one. Certainly the Dursleys were going to deny Harry magical education, even though his untrained magic was manifesting all over the place and he was becoming a hazard to them.

I would posit that in the face of possible violation of the statute, a ministry person or Hogwarts official would make attempts to persuade the parents (or the child) to attend Hogwarts (or the magical school of their choice) and if they absolutely chose not to, then the appropriate steps would need to be taken. It's not clear what these steps would be as there is no case in canon for separating a witch or wizard from their magical abilities and simply Obliviating the child from the knowledge that they are magical could cause all sorts of trouble.

I wonder if this situation would be dire enough to use the Imperius curse on the parents--could DD have just Imperiused the Durselys to force them to allow Harry to attend Hogwarts and then Obliviate the knowledge of the curse from them?

Good question!

** There was always the question (Based on the lack of info in cannon HP) of whether Muggleborns who chose not to enter the Magical world would be obliviated and somehow have their magic bound or controlled.

My guess is that school would not be required, however, if you wished to remain in the magical world then some sort of training would be required, either via private tutors or schooling. They simply would not let muggleborns who are untrained magic users run around loose (although I am sure mistakes or lack of oversight could happen).

*** If magic could be bounded, why would they use something like Azkaban as a prison?

I would think that some sort of magical education is compulsory, as untrained magic is unpredictable and dangerous, and the statute of secrecy depends on it.

Also, obliviating the Muggleborns who refuse to enter the magical world would do nothing to hide their accidental magic.

My guess is that muggle parents who don't want their child in Hogwarts recieve the visit of someone from the ministry and suddenly change their mind.

** I don't think it would be the parents choice in that matter, what with wandless magic and obscureals being issues, plus the potential to become a hedge witch/wizard (especially with hermione being an insatiable learner). Likely the issue with the troll was not shared with the parents, partly because hermione isn't the type to share things like that for the good of her parents, but also because the incident is probably part and parcel with the magic world.

** The MoM is technically a Ministry of the British government, so I can imagine part of their purview would include jurisdiction over children who display magical ability. They could say that, for the safety of the child, their family and the SoS, a magical child cannot go untrained and parents refusing to allow their child to attend a school (which doesn't even require school fees to be paid) would be seen as both child neglect and a danger to society.

Imagine a muggle parent saying their kid isn't going to school and they aren't teaching them at home. We don't even let people do that and uneducated muggles can't even blow up their aunts.

As such, rather than the nefarious use of Imperius or Confundus, they may be able to just take the child into child services. At that point they'd have to judge whether it's necessary to use memory charms on the parents in order to maintain the SoS.

** I would assume they could, but they would probably have to make sure the kids receive a magical education. either by sending it to another magical school or hiring tutors on their own cost

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

**** It was actually linkffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter by Nim-the-Lesser) although Hermione ends up tricking her parents into thinking Durmstrang was a muggle boarding school (and tricking Durmstrang into thinking she's a pureblood) so she got an education anyway. If it was up to her parents (and as far as the Ministry knew) she wasn't getting one at all though so it still made me think of the possible consequences.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)
