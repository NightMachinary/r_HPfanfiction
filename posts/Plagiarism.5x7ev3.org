I assume that anybody who would plagiarize work isn't that bright to begin with, but can someone explain to me why they always copy well known stories and never change the title or summary? It makes it incredibly easy for anyone whose spent a few weeks reading HP fanfiction to spot copies. Even if it's stupid I understand they're trying to get clicks or praise or whatever, but I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. /endrant

*** Oh and I'd be remiss of I didn't mention the guys from the TAPIR FFN forum who proactively seek out such plagiarising accounts and help out those whose stories have been copied.

** I can't remember the name of the story in question; but someone pretty much reposted a copy of my story Letters verbatium except with the name and house of an OC changed. He/she/it then claimed it was not plagiarism because it was not identical. And argued that with me. For an extended period of time.

The best part about it was they PM'd me telling me this after reviews saying it was a copy of my fic. But they wanted to make sure i knew it wasn't because they changed a couple of names so I should totally be cool with it, man.

I've also had people accuse me of plagiarizing other work when mine has a completion date 2-3 years before the publication date of the work I plagiarized. So apparently I have time machine that I put to very poor use, too.

**** It indeed does. The only better instance is the fact that My Immortal was at first a serious fic but [[/u/TE7][u/TE7]] went back in time and murdered the original writer and rewrote the entire thing as a trollfic.

Wake up sheeple. Our lives are being manipulated by [[/u/TE7][u/TE7]] and [[/u/FanfictionBot][u/FanfictionBot]] who are bound together in unholy matrimony and have primal ballbearingslapping sex every time they manage one up Barry Allen and fuck the timeline.

*** If I had a time machine to take me back. I'd take all seven HP books with me and publish them as my own.

They don't. Only the stupidest ones do that. The others are the ones you just haven't found. A lot of plagiariasts will change the titles and characters and post into a different fandom. Those are very hard to find and you have to actively go looking for them. And to be frank, life is too short.
