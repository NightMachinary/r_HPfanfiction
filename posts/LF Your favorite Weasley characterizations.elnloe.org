As it says in the title.

No character bashing, just some of your favorite Weasley characterizations. They can be major characters, minor, or anywhere in between.

They can be the main character or not.

It can be on any site.

It can be pairings focused, threesomes or not focused on pairings at all.

I'd rather it be completed if possible, but if not it's fine.

I'm fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

It can be dark, sweet, or in between.


** I think linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) has some fresh takes on the Weasleys. Offhand:

- Ron ends up super interested in astronomy and space due to early exposure to a muggle book on the subject. (The Galileo probe and space shuttle in particular.) Now, Ron being given an actual academic niche isn't all that new, but AFAIK that niche being Astronomy /is/.
- Fred and George break the cliche of in-sync twinspeak and in fact end up very much out of sync a couple of times, in the vein of "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?" "No, because I can think of at least three different followups and don't know which one you're going after."
- Percy's actually kind of awesome instead of being an old fuddy-duddy as usual.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** There was a short and sweet little entry on DLP recently, in which Mr Weasley tells babby Ron a fairy tale. The characterizations were perfect: [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/entry-5.39050/]]

** Harry spends a lot more time with the Weasleys and they become his legal guardians in Nightmares of Futures Past. Unfortunately it's incomplete and FFN took it down, but you can still get PDF or eBook from [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][Github]], and it's over 400K words, so there's plenty to read.

** Ron, George, Percy, and Fred in The Sinister Man's /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ ( linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) ). I like Ron's arc in particular. Even as a WBWL hanger-on he's unfailingly loyal, and from there he grows from there into a thoughtful and considerate person.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** This is a fun one. It doesn't end so much as disintegrate into silliness.

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/Like-a-Red-Headed-Stepchild]])

Self-recommendation, mostly about Fred and George, with some Charlie and Percy. Incomplete, but I plan to get back to it eventually.

  Fred and George Weasley are used to pulling pranks with a hairpin and pocketknife, but in their first year at Hogwarts, they find some extra help locked in a drawer in Filch's office. These characters are the property of J.K. Rowling.First Place Winner in the Honorary Marauder category in the Shrieking Shack Society's 2018 Marauder Medals. Thanks to everyone who voted!

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.
