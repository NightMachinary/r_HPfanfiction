:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm going to preface this with this might be a stretch and I might be mixing two different fanfics together. (I don't believe I am though.)

â€‹

So, from what I recall about this fanfic is that it is a post Sirius death fanfic in which Hermione helps Harry out by somehow enrolling the two of them to be trained by Aurors.

Now onto the random bits I recall to try and flesh this out. (Or just sow confusion if the above statement is true.)

1. Auror Pensieves to go over spells while you sleep. I specifically remember there being a certain section that covers basically illegal spells that Aurors are allowed to "solely" know. Entrail expelling is one I think. So is the Big Three.
2. I think biometric super brooms that are used by the auror air force or something?
3. It's a Harry/Hermione story. Almost certain of this.

Going to be fully honest, I have no clue why I want to read it again, but it's stuck in my head for some reason and no combination of going through my favorites, followed, word count (I have quite literally sorted HP fanfic by word count and just chose interesting sounding ones.) has helped me remember the name. Thank you to anybody who can help out!

** I have definitely read this fic and I cannot find it now. I do not think it is by chem prof, Clell65619, RobSt, Rorschach's Blot, or broomstick flyer - I checked their listings. I am pretty sure it is on ff dot net.

Good luck in your search!
