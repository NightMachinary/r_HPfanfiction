(no slash please) I'm looking for fics where Harry and Cedric are closer than in cannon. Perhaps the other triwizard contestants as well, but mainly Cedric. Whether it be brotherly, or friendly, I want their relationship to actually effect the story, instead of just, "oh yeah, and Harry was friends with Cedric... Anyway..." you know?

Thanks in advance!


** linkao3(because he strayed across the path), and others by LullabyKnell on ao3 have some nice Cedric character studies! From what I remember there are undertones of a crush (unrequited I think?) on Harry's side in this one but it's very subtle, though if you're super anti slash you might not like it?

** AU wherein Harry is in Cedric and Cho's year. Some nice real moments between them when Harry stays with Cedric's family for the holidays, plus you get to see what being a close friend of the Boy Who Lived would do to Cedric, who was so popular in canon. Linkffn(What You Leave Behind)

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
