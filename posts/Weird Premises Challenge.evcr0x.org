What are the weirdest prompts we can come up with for someone to write? Would you want to read how Snape ran a spin class for cash between his second and third years when he needed to make a potion for his dying (now dead) cat? Or how Narcissa Malfoy once got kidnapped by the Bulgarian owner of a Nundu drag-racing circuit looking to expand into dueling? Does Draco want to... become an Auror? /Shocked Gasp!/

Weird shit not only welcome, but applauded. No filters, slash or het welcome, Susan can be a blonde or a redhead, etc.


** Some cracky prompts

- Petunia is not actually a human, she is the accidental magic transfigured stuffed giraffe of Lily's she made into her older sister.

- Ron is unknowingly a Dragon Slayer like in Fairy Tale but as he is missing his element to eat he is constantly hungry.

- James Potter is the next James Bond. The Agency arranged to fake his and Lily's (The next Q) deaths. Vernon is a deep cover agent who is secretly training Harry in survival skills and situational awarness.

- Remus is in on Voldemorts side as a spy and trains Harry to be a right hand of the dark lord discretely.

- Hermione beliveing everything she reads comes across a Hitler Youth propaganda book translated to english before Hogwarts.

**** Hermione had been thinking of how wonderful Hogwarts was, until she heard something that made her blood run cold.

'Goldstein, Anthony'

The Jews had begun to infiltrate Hogwarts! Gryffindor was a must now, they were the house of those who stood against the darkness after all.

'SLYTHERIN!'

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Malfoy hated mudbloods but this one was making some great points. These jews had piles and piles of gold they stole from everyone else. Who the bloody hell were these dirty muggles to have something that clearly belonged to Wizards!

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Grindlewald heard the explosions and was baffled. After fifty years who would want to get to him now?

Several minutes later a young bushy haired witch, a dark haired boy with lighting bolt scar, and a blonde boy were kneeling before him.

The girl was holding out a glowing red stone and whispered words that sung in his ears.

"The Philosophers Stone Lord Grindlewald, the New Magical Riech begins with your command!"

****** I've come up with a list of plausible(ish) reasons to break out Grindlewald by the HP crew before as a thought exercise.

- He was not a muggleborn hater, he was more 'good Salazar Slytherin' wants to remove muggleborns from muggle families when they are still infants. Purebloods fought against his agenda and the heroes need a powerful trainer.

- Prophecy stating only Grindlewald can save magic. He knows the secrets of the Hollows and how to activate them for Harry. Will grant Harry the power to gift all of the world magic.

- Voldemort is winning and they will break free Grindlewald to help them if he swears an unbreakable oath.

- Dumbledore was actually the BBE and framed Grindlewald. Once Dumbledore dies from the ring curse, the spells he used to hide the truth fade and everyone is all WTF!

- Grindlewald knows the secret of Horcruxes and will trade that knowledge for freedom.

- Harry doesn't trust anyone after his name comes out the Goblet and no one believes or helps him. He names Grindlewald as his Headmaster and Advisor as a Fuck You to Dumbledore for not stopping the bullying. The goblet forces the ICW to release him or they all lose their magic.

That last one is my favorite as in my headcanon it forces Grindlewald to actually teach Harry to the best of his abilities. Harry grows strong as fuck and the two wreck house abusing the cups carte blanche ability.

"Oh what is that minister? Why are we slaughtering our way through the corrupt ministry and taking it over? Tri-Wizard Tournament business, best not interfere or you'll lose your magic. What TWT business? Oh just practicing our combat magic in real life conditions. Can't be to prepared after all." ðŸ˜‚

Oh I like this one, if I was confident in my writing I'd totally write it. It feels believable enough, while still taking some liberties for fanon, and you can characterize/personalize Grindelwald, who was only ever mentioned in the books.

Honesty, just start writing. If it doesn't turn out how you'd like, you don't have to publish it but the reason why it failed will teach you a lesson. I think I have like 30 abandoned plot bunnies for that reason, ranging from "that premise wasn't so great" to "if someone challenges you to write a Drarry romance but you despise the pairing, don't do it, because Tonks morphing into a Draco lookalike isn't a good idea". Failure is the best teacher.

And if you realise that you have only envisioned a few scenes, release that as a oneshot.

** I had a lot of fun writing a fake Rita Skeeter article for the extra credit challenge over on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] so I would love a fic that did more of that. I'm actually thinking about incorporating what I wrote (because I felt very innovative for coming up with the "biz-auror love triangle" title lmao) into a future fic.

I want to explore weird premises as bizarre rumors going around the Wizarding world--especially if there might be just the tiniest amount of truth to them after all.

Would love y'all's suggestions but here are mine so far:

- "Porn"-elius Fudge - is it true that the Minister really had a Burt Reynolds mustache and an amateur porn career in his twenties?
- Before Regulus got ahold of the Black locket, his cousin Narcissa used it for her cocaine stash a la Sarah Michelle Gellar's character in the 1999 classic Cruel Intentions
- All the Muggles think that "Crazy Train" is about the Cold War, but really it was written because one time Ozzy Osbourne was on such an insane amount of drugs that the platform barrier glitched when trying to detect a magical signature, accidentally let him through, and he was a stowaway on the Hogwarts Express for awhile before the Trolley Witch discovered him
- The Carrow siblings (correction: I am talking about good ole Alecto and Amycus here) have been involved in more than one instance of the "Devil's Triangle," which (contrary to Brett Kavanaugh's memory) is /not/ a drinking game in the Wizarding world either

** I had a whole list of these that I sent out a while ago. Here's some of my favorites (That'll I keep adding to as I remember and think of more things):

- Harry Potter isn't actually Harry Potter, he's a Jumper who ends up in Harry Potter's body while doing a Harry Potter Jump. Unfortunately, he's early in his jumpchain (within his first ten jumps), so he doesn't have that many powers, abilities or equipment, and even worse, nobody will believe him when he tells them how everything will go down. What's even worse is, if Voldemort wins, he gets to take the place of Jumper Harry, which will allow him to wreck havoc in every reality he comes into havoc afterwards as Jumper Voldemort. See [[/r/JumpChain]] for more information about Jumpchains.

- Harry Potter was adopted by mother nature. He can communicate with all animals, wilderness and nature love him, and his magic is focuses on augmenting and manipulating nature, so buffing animals, making plants grow, controlling weather, etc. Animals constantly flock to him like a Disney princess. He's also got the disposition of a Disney princess.

- Harry Potter is afraid of every major plot point, as in he has a phobia about it. Afraid of flying, afraid of potions, afraid of people going into his head, afraid of snakes, afraid of dogs, afraid of water, etc. His entire Hogwarts journey is his attempts to overcome his various phobias and usually failing.

- Harry Potter was adopted by the classical elements. Things burst into flames when he's angry, rain pours down uncontrollably when he's sad, etc.

- Harry Potter is an animagus. Unfortunately, his animagus form is that of an obnoxious celebrity, like Piers Morgan.

- Learning magic is the thing Harry Potter cares the least about. He spends his entire time at Hogwarts doing just about everything else and only attends Hogwarts because he's given no other recourse. He constantly cuts classes, mocks professors, steals school property, etc.

- Ron Weasley fancies himself a genius, but really, he just always inevitably falls ass-backwards into success. Nobody takes him seriously, but nobody can argue with the results, and thus, he spends his entire life failing upwards. Harry Potter is his long-suffering hetero life partner, and Hermione Granger only hangs around because she believes, statistically, there's no way he can that lucky, and thus /must/ investigate.

- Harry is in denial about being a wizard, and refuses to learn magic even when forced to attend Hogwarts. For this reason, he continues to have incidents of accidental magic even as he matures, all of which help him reach the end of the story.

- Harry Potter was raised in only magical society, but finds he must go to a school in the mundane world because reasons. Despite his knowledge of magic and magical skills, he can't use any of it because it would violate the Statute of Secrecy.

- Harry Potter is a very devout Christian. He views his entire adventure through Hogwarts through the prism of "This is a test from God."

- Harry Potter can eat anything. In fact, his solution to every problem in the plot is finding a way to eat it, be it the Dursleys, the troll, the gauntlet to the mirror, the mirror itself, the philosopher's stone, the basilisk, the tasks of the Tri-Wizard tournament, and even Voldemort himself. Basically, he's Matter Eater Lad, but also a cannibal.

- Harry Potter can't be hurt by anything. He lackadaisically goes through Hogwarts, never paying attention to everything that happens to him, because he can't be hurt by it. For example, when he goes to find Hermione and encounters the troll, the troll breaks its club on him, tries to squeeze the life out of him, and even tries to bite him in half, but Harry experiences no discomfort at all and is no worse for wear, all while continuing to casually talk to Hermione like it's no big deal.

- Harry Potter grew up immersed in gangsta rap culture, probably because he was actually raised by thugs and hood rats in the projects. He's basically a white gangsta rapper who packs heat, smokes weed, slangs rocks, stacks racks, and gives it 'em hos.

- Harry Potter /thinks/ he's a Jedi. His "accidental" magic seems to back it up, since he's able to sway the weak mind, move objects with a wave of his hand, and has even built himself a fully functional lightsaber. Spoilers: He's not a Jedi.

- Harry Potter turns 11 and begins attending Hogwarts in 2011. This means the entire story begins 20 years after the original series, with all the problems that would happen due to the advances in technology, including muggleborn Wizards and Witches using Instagram to show off. Wizarding society remains as dumb to advances in technology as ever, meaning the Statute of Secrecy has already been breached, and they don't even know it.

- Harry Potter /thinks/ he's a mutant, a la the X-Men, due to his "accidental" magic. Spoilers: He's not.

- Let's say for the sake of argument that Hogwarts /is/ the best school in all of the (magical) world. Just how bad are all of the other schools for this to be true? Harry tours all the other schools to find out.

It kind of grew from there, with fire spontaneously starting to keep him warm, rain coming down to give him water when he was thirsty, the wind keeping him cool on hot days, all while he just wandered around, possibly far away from civilization.

Basically, Harry doesn't magic, elemental magic magics for him so he never wants.

Really depends on your jump progression; if you did the Generic First Jump instead of the Pokemon Jump first, then do a bunch of low-level, low-danger jumps after, 10th jump isn't necessary too powerful. It really just depends on how slow Jump-chan has been easing the Jumper into actual jumps.

I once wrote an intro to a crackfic similar to that. Petunia raises Harry as her own, and he grows up an obnoxious lardass whose favorite food is chicken tendies. My plan was to eventually have him eat some basilisk meat, pass out, have Fawkes cure him, and gain an iron stomach that can digest anything as a result.

He would pretend to be affected by the Dementors to get more chocolate, steal the real dragon eggs instead of golden one so he could make omelette, boil and eat the Grindylows when they attack him in the lake, stuff like that.

** - Dumbledore was cursed by a pesky Veela hunter as a young man when he did a favor for the French government and helped to rid themselves of the menace. Said curse made him crave Veela flesh and there was no cure. However, the French were able to modify the curse so that he craves sweets instead of Veela flesh. Specifically, lemon-flavored sweets.

- Petunia Dursley actually has a drop or two of magic in her, but not enough to allow her to use magic consciously and attend Hogwarts. She unconsciously used said magic to help seduce many young men in her youth despite her average looks and poor attitude. The only reason she settled down with Vernon Dursley is because she became pregnant, though she wasn't entirely sure that he was the father. The child was miscarried but they had already married so they stuck together. This is responsible in part for their spoiling of Dudley, as they were so happy to have a child.

- There are a lot of under-the-table politics and trading of favors among Hogwarts professors. Not to mention the weekly late night games of Wizarding Whist (which shares a common ancestor with Muggle Whist and Contract Bridge but features a card deck with 7 suits and between 8 and 14 cards in each suit, and in which the cards can magically change suit during play depending on what cards have been played and on the current gender of the person holding said card). Professors Sprout and Burbage are particularly good at the game. The only professors that decline to play are Professors Trelawney (too mundane) and Dumbledore (prefers ElfenkarnÃ¶ffel but no one else likes playing it with him).

- During the summer, the elves of Hogwarts organize their own Olympic-like games with events centered around cleaning, laundry, maintenance, and cooking. These are intensely popular events and the winners get to choose where they get to work the following year. The ghosts of Hogwarts also find these events fascinating and are asked to serve as referees and arbitrators.

- Argus Filch is the Queen's representative at Hogwarts. He genuinely dislikes children, but plays up his hatred in order to be allowed to make his late night "patrols" without suspicion. Mrs. Norris is just an abnormally intelligent cat that used to belong to a student who decided to abandon her when going home for the summer.

- Igor Karkaroff is very stereotypically Polish and is the subject of many, many Polish jokes made by his students.

- Theodore Nott is a direct descendant of the Sheriff of Nottingham, the famous enemy of Robin Hood. Nott hates the Forbidden Forest and its denizens. He also has a very fierce rivalry with Terry Boot, who is the descendant of Robin Hood. As neither boy is aware of their true ancestry, they don't know why even the sight of the other pisses them off so much.

He has a rather Russian name for someone who would be stereo-typically Polish...

** Absolutely batshit insane prompts, I warned you...

- Harry Potter desperate to learn transfigured McGonagall and Dumbledore into earrings he wears so they can always give him advice.

- Harry decides that his meat wand is something he will never lose and learns to cast spells with his dick.

- After thinking everyone is dead after 5th year Harry takes some gillyweed and permeance potion. Running away to the ocean depths he meets Cthulu and decides maybe killing all life to start anew isn't so bad.

- Harry figuring he's already got one strike after Dobby so he goes all in. He transfigured, poorly, the Dursley family into animals. Then he roasts them alive and forces them to eat each other.

- Hermione has a secret dark side and wants to protect Harry at all costs. She is secretly killing off all the non-important students at Hogwarts every year.

- Hermione finds herself addicted to the effects of the imperious curse and forces Harry to cast it on her constantly. Harry grows to love it as well and soon imperious curses nearly the entire student body.

- Fun fact the imperious curse is only illegal to cast on wizards. Taking advantage of this Harry sets imperious cursed Acromantulason Slytherin House.

- Ron accidentally eats a highly magical potion ingredient. Learning he gains power from eating magical foods he soon finds himself eating the most magical of creatures, wizards.

- Learning about the japanese myth of eating a mermaid makes you immortal a desperate Harry decides the inhabitants of the Black Lake are on the menu.

- Hermione desperate for advice to win reads The Art of War. Deciding a final strike weapon is only useful if used she studies Nuclear Physics enough to create the spell Atomus Infernos.

- Dumbledore decides 'The Power he knows Not' is 80's power ballads, wild sex, and cocaine. Since he missed all of the 80's turned into a near mindless spirit.

- Harry desperately wishes to get away and a small three year old only to somehow found himself the ward of Crocodile Dundee.

- Turning to heavy drugs to escape the horror of 4th year Harry learns the power of magically enhanced amphetamines.

An oldie but goodie: rewrite the entire Harry Potter series but do a find&replace of "wand," replacing it with "wang"

The wang always chooses the wizard, Harry.

*** Or Magical Angel Dust - the Muggle version basically turns you into those running zombies from the World War Z movie, so imagine what the magical version could do. /shudders/

Also, I think the Imperious one is a thing. I remember reading a summary where Harry had an Imperious Kink, IIRC? I'm wildly asexual, so I just kept going, but it was definitely a thing someone wrote.

I do like that Cthulhu one. I can see that in an Anakin Skywalker "The angst level, it's over 9000!" sort of a way. Basically just a more interesting version of that Azkaban/Dark Creature Rebellion trope phase the fandom went through a while back. "I hate earth. Its dry, and dirty, and it gets everywhere."

And the idea of Ron basically becoming No Face from Spirited Away is, no pun intended, a delicious thought.

The Hermione secret darkness one is a thing too, I think. Adorable Violence - she nearly takes out Malfoy after he borrows a book for too long and Harry is forced to suspend cuddling time for two weeks afterward. I think the term they used was Yendere, but Japanese terminology isn't really my field.

** I've been thinking someone should write a witcher crossover where yen and triss open a portal and wind up in Hogwarts by mistake and become new professors they should routinely mock everyone for using wands and be all superior about there brand of magic not requiring bits of wood, also they should be in traid realtionship with Bellatrix who is somehow also a professor and isn't as evil as canon. yen and her should really take to each other. eventually, they notice the portal they used to get to Hogwarts was left open and a load of witcher style creatures have come through and need destroying as they start attacking the school

I'd take horrible monsters over misunderstood puppies any day of the week when it comes to representation of magical creatures in HP. And maybe we'd get some decent monster-hunting fics along the way.

** After Harry's name comes out of the goblet and he us forced into a magical contract he wrotes up another one that binds all sentient beings in the world to do as he pleases.

Or a toned down version where he takes Hogwarts as his own house Or signs Sorius release form Or makes Malfoy give him everythi g he owns OR does literally anything he likes because he can enter anybody into a contract that makes them do anything or else lose their magic.

The Parseltounge always carries the offspring, no matter what gender the snake is and the coupling always produces fertile eggs no matter what genders either party are.
