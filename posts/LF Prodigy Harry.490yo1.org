There is a term. A term people use for those who are exceptionally skilled in a field or realm of reality. I want to read a story in which Harry Potter is considered a prodigy in magic. I dont mean talented, I dont mean he is a genius. I mean that when it comes to magic Harry Potter is better than everyone around him. I was to see him battle on par with Dumbledore and Voldemort with magic but still have social issues. if this exists... and you can recommend it to me, well Ill give you a cyber cookie. Ive been looking for decent fics with this premise for around a year now. The concept of a Prodigy! Harry was what got me into the fandom. I have never found one that was complete and not a simply OP!Harry.

OP!Harry is a genius, a Harry-sue, a force of nature with no negatives. Prodigy!Harry would be dangerous with a wand, but still have issues asking out a girl.. He can be a sarcastic berk like in the books, or a quite kid who happens to pick up a wand and be able to learn and preform magic that makes even Dumbledore turn his head. That is the difference.

The closest I have found to Prodigy Harry is Smart!/Strong! Harry. So, I suppose if you cant find a prodigy Harry story, then I will settle for your best Strong!/Smart! Harry stories. /Please have all recommendations be over 80k words./

TL;DR- Give me your best Strong!/Smart!/Prodigy of Magic! Harry potter fanfictions over 80K words. sorry for the rant.

** Personally, I don't think what you're asking for is realistic. I mean, no matter how prodigious a teenager is, they simply cannot have the knowledge, skill, and experience needed to be on par with Dumbledore and Voldemort, two of the most powerful wizards in history.

I do get where you're coming from though, and the following are some stories that have realistically strong/intelligent/prodigious Harry.

*** but Riddle.. He preformed one of the darkest works of magic as a 6th year. I have a theory that there just isn't a lot of knowledge in JKR's magic. Maybe by the time you graduate Hoggywarts you know a significant portion of what is known. The rest is raw ability and a few outlier spells, like the Fidelius, the Horcrux ritual/spell.

Sure there are Muffilato and Septumsempra but they are only variants of a silencio and a diffendo.

"It slices, it dices, it even makes julienne fries!"

Possibly because what the hell else would you need that the standard Hoggy education doesn't provide?

*** I can understand why you think its unrealistic... However I also find it hard to believe that Dumbledore and Voldemort are strong just due to experience or knowledge. If that was the case the most powerful witch introduced would be Marshbanks since she saw Dumbledore "do things with a wand I have never seen before" during his newts. Therefore her experience would trump Dumbledore's.

Dumbledore and Voldemort were equal in stat totals in my mind. Dumbledore had a higher dexterity and adaptability trait than Voldemort who had a higher power output. Where Dumbledore leaned heavily on environmental manipulation and control, Voldemort made use of fierce power and coordination. A prodigy!Harry in my mind would go through the middle of those two. I picture that form of Harry as a wizard is a mixed assault with the ability to adapt to situations.

I also just wrote a massive response to you and for that I apologize. Thank you for the suggestions though. :)

**** I think it's more of a debate of whether or not wizards are born equal. By that I don't mean the status of blood or rights in the world. I mean on a genetic/magical level (whatever is deemed to be magical prowess). Does every wizard start off the same? Or are there exceptions to the rule? Did Merlin, Dumbledore and Riddle start off as exceptionally powerful wizards even before being tutored? Or did they only become great through accumulation of knowledge, skill and experience?

^ I believe that is the real debate here. Different authors will have different approaches to this.

Personally I'm more of the opinion that everyone is the same initially but they specialise or find that they are slightly more talented in certain areas of magic than others. That allows for a certain degree of prodigious magical use in certain spectrums. (Eg. Voldemort/Dumbledore's performance in their duel at the Ministry in Order of the Phoenix).

**** First, don't worry about the length of the response. We're mostly geeks and nerds here, so I'm pretty sure most of us, including me, enjoy these kinds of discussions.

Now, when we see the canon, it becomes evident to us that some wizards are just much more powerful than others (e.g. Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape). These are the types of people who "do things with a wand I have never seen before," which makes sense because canon tells us that many wizards can't even cast a shield charm. Marshbanks was probably one of the average, or slightly higher than average witches (I'm not sure where you go the "most powerful witch" part from, seeing that there's no canon evidence to back it up). So, Dumbledore could "trump" Marchbank because he had sheer magical ability, where as she only had experience.

The problem with Harry being in par with Dumbledore and Voldemort is that the two have experience /and/ sheer magical ability. Sure, Harry is obviously very powerful, seeing that he could summon a Patronus that drove away 100+ dementors. But at the face of wizards who have similar or greater sheer power as him (Voldemort and Dumbledore were considered some of the brightest students in Hogwarts, whereas Harry was above average) but also have skill and experience as back up? He simply has no chance.

To use an analogy, it's like they're all in a gun fight. Harry has a superior gun, so he can beat most people his level, and maybe those a few levels above him. But he would certainly stand no chance against Dumbledore, who has a similar superior gun, and has been using it for decades.
