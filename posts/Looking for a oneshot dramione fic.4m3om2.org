This is a longshot, but I read this oneshot a few years back that I really liked and i thought I had added it to my favourites on fanfiction.com, but since then I haven't come across it.

The story consists of draco bringing a gift to hermione for her birthday or christmas. He meets up with her and she's with harry only to reveal to the reader that he's actually talking to their portrait. From what I remember, both hermione and harry are in the portrait together. She becomes ecstatic that he's brought her another gift, but draco is upset because she hasn't been able to open the others or the one he's brought.

If anyone remembers this one, please please please let me know. I've been dying to read it again.


** The only other place I can think of that may know your fic would be the Dramione Asks tumblr. I've asked in the Dramione Facebook group for you, so we will see if anything comes of that.
