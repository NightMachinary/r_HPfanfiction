I've read fanfiction in which there is a magical void... a space created that cancels out magic. Sometimes it is created as a sort of safe space to provide incubation for someone whose magic is unstable or sometimes it is a magical anomaly. I'm working on a part of my story where something like this occurs and it made me wonder what would happen if someone walked into a space like that with a bag like Hermione's that has the extendable, undetectable magical storage. When the magic is canceled on that item, where does all the stuff that is stored in it go? Does it break the bag? Spill out into the room? Get vanished to who knows where? What do you think?

Also, what other unintentional consequences might there be if you walk into a space like that not knowing that all your spells are going to disappear?


** This is probably the point where I bring up that one D&D post, where a gun-user got his hands on an anti-magic ring. Instead of wearing it, he welded it to the end of his gun, then got a mage to shrink down a bunch of cannon balls to bullet-size.

Presto, as soon as they leave the barrel, they're restored to their true size, moving with all the speed the 'bullet' was. You now have a handheld siege weapon.

** For the bag thing, it probably depends on two things: How the bag does it and how the void does it.

If the bag is just a fold or dent in space that allows for more "surface volume" accessible in a small opening, then it's gonna spill out.

If the bag is a portal to a cut-off piece of space to store stuff in, then it'll all be lost in the ether.

If the void works to slowly unravel all magic, even that shifted into higher/lower dimensions/metaphorical constraints within, then the bag will slowly unravel, either spilling out or dissolving into the ether. It would also be able to rob the Fidelius of its power, coincidentally, and most likely destroy a Horcrux.

If the void works to aggressively cut off the flow of magic from source to enchantment, then most things will just de-power. Brooms stop working, Wands become inert, etc. Most likely, the bag would just break, spilling its contents both into the ether and the world as its enchantment fails.

*** Those are really good points and very helpful as I work on this scene. Thank you so much!

** For the bag, I'd say it would revert to being an empty bag and the connection to the expansion space (and its contents) is lost. I have a headcanon that certain rare house elves may be able to find lost pockets like these -- but not Dobby. By elf standards, he's insane.

*** Oooh! Nice... I like the idea of house-elves being able to help track them down.

*** So, do you think that the magical void would strip house-elves and other magical beings of their magic or does it only affect wixen?

**** Depends on your philosophy of magic, I suppose. The magi are human with access to magic. From my schema, most magical creatures use magic to sustain their abilities, and being stripped of it would effectively give them radiation sickness -- systemic failures as if normal regenerative processes had been broken. They wouldn't die instantly, but the sickness would be nearly immediate.

Magical constructs stripped of their enchantments would just stop being enchanted. I don't know what that would do to Riddle's manufactured body, but I'd think the Riddle-baby would be more at risk than the form he was restored to in the Graveyard. I would assume that the null magic field is only a filter space in that it doesn't remove the magic so much as mute it. Once removed, the enchantments in living beings and Cursed objects would return, whereas simple charms would be lost but reasonably easy to recast.

It's your story, though, so you make the rules. The important thing is to know what they are and be consistent in applying them. Even better if you can maintain that consistency without ever having a character explain what the rules are. Let the readers suss it out.
