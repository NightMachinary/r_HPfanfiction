*** Unfortunately, no, that's not the fanfic I'm looking for. But I've never read this one, so, new things to try, right? Thank you!

**** Darn. It's crazy how hard it is to find a specific fic.. if only there was money in developing a fanfic search engine better than the ones on ffn or aoe. Do you remember what site this fic was from?

***** Yeah, sometimes I spend hours trying to find that one singular fic I want to read again... But this time I can't find it, no matter how many key-words I use to search.. I was thinking that maybe the author deleted the fic or something like that. And if I'm not mistaken, the site was ao3

*** OMG! I'm sorry it took so long for me to reply, but, YEEES, that's the fic I was looking for!!! Thank you so much!! You're a God (or should I say Merlin?) send! I was even doubting someone would even know about this fic because of the pairings and all that... Thank you again for the help!

** It may not be the one you're looking for; it's been so long since I read this the only thing I remember is how it starts. linkffn(Let the Guilty Pay by Janara). Harry takes a potion to turn himself female - I forget why - which leads to the realization that he's a stolen Malfoy child.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is sick and tired of the way everyone is treating him. Realising that drastic measures are needed, Harry stages a Potions accident. How was he to know that his actions would unravel secrets long hidden? And just whose son is he? AU year 5 HP/SS
