:END:
So I have been reading HP fanfiction for over 2 years now I think, and it gets kind of boring. As different as some stories are in the end there is still a lot in common (after all they are all fanfiction).

Because of this I always crave stories with new things and original concepts. One great example of this is linkffn (Hell Eyes).

I also enjoy crossovers because there is something "new" guaranteed.

To finish up with the request I would ask for any stories you think would help avoid this problem, another trope I enjoyed is when Harry discovers magic pre Hogwarts and learns to control it, especially if its a magic from a crossover. Like those stories where he watches Star Wars and tries to use the force, again crossovers are preferred for this

If you have anything good to recommend then thanks.

I feel like I may have rambled on a bit and didn't make much sense, hope you don't mind I do that a lot while writing.

** linkffn(A Long Journey Home) - Almost no action happens inside Hogwarts, all of the story is post-Hogwarts, and don't be put off by fem!Harry, that's not the center of the fic.

linkffn(A Black Comedy) - Almost no canon action, but you probably already know this one

linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) - A great story but the same author as "A Black Comedy", with similar humor - but it's well-done Firefly/Harry Potter crossover. The crossover is so well executed that you sometimes ask yourself if the makers of Firefly secretly worked with JK Rowling.

linkffn(Shadow Walker) and linkffn(Shadow Walks) - The finished story comes first, and it's a truly unique concept that you really might like.

If you haven't read it, maybe linkffn(Barefoot) too, it has a unique concept as well.

None of these are particularly unknown fics, but I hope I could recommend something that you might enjoy and heaven't read before.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense; Reverse) are very AU and introduce a lot of different magical concepts. The Pureblood Pretense is a hybrid crossover with Alanna the Lioness, but knowing anything about it isn't required at all to read the series.

** I know it's not really within the tropes you mentioned, but I recommend The Serpent and The Mirror by Paimpont :

linkffn(6034766)

It is using canon material in such an original way to tell its own story that it is one of the most original fanfiction I've ever read.
