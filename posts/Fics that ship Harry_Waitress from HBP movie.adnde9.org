I thought it was the best scene in the film and it had me intrigued because I thought they were going to have a major departure from the books by shipping Harry with a muggle. Plus the chemistry between Gallacher and Radcliffe was way stronger than between Radcliffe and Wright. So if anybody would be so kind as to send me a link to some fics with these two that'd be awesome!

  What if Harry had waited ten more minutes and said goodbye to the waitress in HP/HBP? Prequel, "What We Had," is now up on my page!

***** Yes we did. People were texting from the mid-90s, we just didn't do it very often because it was expensive. It was an emergengy way of getting a message to someone if we knew they couldn't take a call, or if we weren't in a position to ring out. Like a really expensive alternative to paging.

******* True. I was an exception - my first mobile phone was given to me by my uncle in about 1997. It was a Vodafone PAYG thing, and it was analogue so there was no SIM. Credit came as scratchcards, and you had to top up every two weeks or your phone got canceled.

******* Also in the UK, forgot to add that. I specifically remember my parents texting when I was a kid around '97 - my own phone was on the ETACS network, which was analogue and so didn't support texting.

In fact, I can say more on this because I'm a tech nerd and a history nerd, so I'm a tech-history nerd a little too - the first mass-produced GSM phone was the Nokia 1011, which came out in '92. It supported SMS.

******** But the networks didn't provide this capability across the board yet back then. It only started deployment that year and 1993.

Furthermore, many handsets from other manufacturers didn't support it yet. Although, two years later things looked very different.

*** Hmm. It's an interesting premise, but it felt like they were quite serious about each other quite quickly, considering that they only just met. Which is rather different to how Harry has interacted with any other girl. Guess I'm more into slow burn stuff.

**** Rowling can do a lot of things, but writing a decent romance is not one of them. Case in point, there's something questionable about pretty much every shown relationship other than Cedric/Cho and maybe Percy/Penelope.

It's not unbelievable that someone goes from just met to crush to love in a short period of time, especially since we are talking about teenagers, but more time spent together would be required to sell this particular pairing.

**** This is true but harsh at the same time.

In the books and especially in the films, Ginny is given almost no time to persuade the reader/viewer to her side. Bonnie Wright had a particularly difficult job as some of the best Ginny moments from the books were lost (no elbow in the butter dish, for instance). She doesn't even get a line in the epilogue.

So I can't disagree that she has zero chemistry but I'm not going to blame the actress. The couple of moments she does get are quite nice - the backward glance at Harry as he stays in the RoR with Cho, for instance, and her reaction when Ron tries to give her his dress robes in the mistaken belief they're for her.

Another Harry/muggle story I liked was linkffnet(5244417)

In this one, Pier's younger sister takes a liking to Harry Potter. It's also pretty fluffy, but unlike Grow Young With Me, it's complete!

** Thank you for this thread! I've followed both links and bookmarked them. :)

I've always liked that little coffee scene, and was curious about that girl must have felt. Then I had the thought 'can you imagine if she had gotten to know Harry and was sucked into Wizarding drama' whether she just became his friend, or dated him.

I also wonder about the other coffee waitress, the one freaked out by the Death Eaters. I'd love to read a little oneshot in her point of view.

Yeah I was really excited about that whole scene. When it was playing out, I was like "this wasn't in the books, but I like where this is heading." And then Dumbledore appears and dashed out all my hopes for an entertaining divergence from canon. Oh well, this is why we have fanfiction.
