** I'm pretty sure a quarter of HP stories is Harry Potter becoming Lord Potter-Black and receives a fortune in his will while collecting a harem of women and murders all who opposes him because his godly magical powers have been unlocked.

*** I honestly hate harem fics so freaking much and I just can't see Harry killing people who aren't either trying to kill him or aren't Death Eaters. The Lord Potter-Black makes sense, though I hate it when people add on Slytherin or Gryffindor. Out of the both, Slytherin was most likely to be a noble than Gryffindor. I'd just rather have him inherit their estates (including half ownership of Hogwarts and its lands and control over its vaults) instead of him being called Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin.

** The best one without any of that kiddie master politician and harem bullshit is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167). But instead of using some titles to impress the Wizengamot, he uses the Fiendfyre.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052), features a less violent, but more sneaky Harry. He joins Sirius after falling through the Veil in another dimension. They play wizarding politics during the day, while robbing their 'esteemed' Wizengamot colleagues at night.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  A few weeks after the Battle of Hogwarts Harry gets a letter from Gringotts about his accounts. It turns out that he just inherited a lot from Voldemort! Who knew that the Right of Conquest was still a thing? Now, Harry doesn't just have property and money but ownership of lives as well. Will they accept his offer of redemption? Will they ever heal from the horrors of war?

** One that amused me a great deal is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12562072/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Daft-Morons][/Harry Potter and the Daft Morons/ by Sinyk]]. I don't remember how long it takes to get there, but there's definitely a point where he goes in front of the Wizengamot, and forces them to repeal some laws as unenforceable.
