I'm looking for Harry/Luna fics that focus more on the romance/relationship rather than being a sideshow to a more dramatic plot. I've already read Protection from Nargles and Contemplating Clouds and enjoyed them thoroughly and I couldn't get into Luna's Hubby at all, the ooc Luna/child aspects I just found very strange.

Thanks in advance for any recommendations.


** Honestly the only thing about Luna's Hubby I really didn't like was the Bellatrix LeStrange subplot.
