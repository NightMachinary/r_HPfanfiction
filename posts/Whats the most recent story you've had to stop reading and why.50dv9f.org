I understand that /many/ people love political fics, but I just /can't/ get into them. It's a blind spot, for sure.

*** I've started this and stopped it halfway through so many times. Can't figure out why but something just makes me give up. Not even just the ridiculous politics but it's just a bit creepy in places with all the weird sex stuff and Hermiones weird slave thing going on...

I already wanted to stop reading at the beginning with the description of the robes and jewelry. Hermione normally doesn't seem to care about that. And then that other girl's robes were also described in strange detail. However, I do like the writing style and the story seems interesting

** Just stopped reading Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse...oh dear goodness I have never read a more pretentious character. Like he gets on the train and lectures Ron about how he doesn't care about sports because books and knowledge is more important than such trivial matters and anyway he can work out in his own time with his familiar so there's not even that benefit...I swear the author must have never even met a child...

It's mainly annoying how long I kept reading it for because I think the premise is class but...argh...in the space of about 5 chapters we had the goblin buddies meetup, yelling at Dumbles for mind rape, weird conversation with flitwick about how he is the product of his father raping his goblin mother, lecture to Ron about being a bigot, lecture about how not all Slytherins are bad, many instances of 'Harry could respect that'. And the plot is brilliant! It's so frustrating.

Snape has been charged with mind rape and Harry is getting taught potions by Pomphrey. Oh and he has still only given one person permission to call him Harry. Because like all 11 year olds everyone has to use titles and kiss the hand of every women the meet. Despite Harry being literally the only person to do this. Flitwick even calls him out on it later and tells him to stop being so weird so it's not even a world building thing, just something the author wanted to put in...

I eventually cracked around the time it became clear the author is practicing for their own book. By Christmas Harry has destroyed 4 of the horcruxes, manipulated the Wizengamot (as Scion of the Houses Black and Potter by birth and law and the Houses Slytherin and Guant by conquest - sidebar he's totally going to be Scion of Hogwarts by the end of the story) into being friendly with the Goblins who are the only people who know Harry is Death...and all the other things here...not that the inconvenient Harry Potter bits are gone we're moving straight on to the evil monsters from beyond the veil that Harry is spending the rest of the fic fighting whilst they try and unleash the Apocalypse...

At this point I should mention that there's 3 other Riders supposedly just as powerful that apparently have nothing to do with this (or any issues of their own) and in a tiny school are impossible to find despite Harry literally walking round as Death on halloween (you know in costume like we see all the time in canon).

Such a good premise though.

**** Just the Harry being the literal Death of the Bible and the other Riders existing...it was setting up for something cool and early on the author was mentioning "look I know i've got the goblin thing and shopping in the first chapter but it's necessary to get it out of the way". Then they show up every other chapter to help Harry out.

More the premise than the plot really.

I just don't understand fics like this. It has a pleasant writing style, until Harry starts talking to Ron I agree that was completely ridiculous. But what I don't understand is: if you are going to write about Harry with a different personality, why write about Harry? Why not write about an OC who was also raised by his aunt and uncle and becomes a hero? I really don't understand what it is that authors of such AU fiction like about the characters they're writing about. I guess it's more that they use the facts about Harry as we know him to make it somewhat recognizable or convenient (?). I have nothing against such fics...I'm just curious what goes on in the author's head

** I /really/ tried to enjoy a A Black Comedy. But there where just so many aspects of the fic that made me go /"What?? Why?"/ I love Sirius more than any other character, but I couldn't deal with the Harry in that story, nor the Ginny-ghost.

*** For ghosts you need to keep in mind that they are a shallow version of what the living person was - basically reduced to what's holding them back from moving on. Nearly Headless Nick cares so much that he died without dignity. Moaning Myrtle probably wasn't as Moany in real life.

And for Ginny that shallow copy is her love to Harry.

But yeah, the Harry is pretty OOC, and it's never established how he goes from researching the veil to "I don't give a fuck". But in the end you'll find out that Harry actually /does/ care. He isn't Sirius.

I can see why you don't like it, but there are many funny situations in there. Just don't take it too serious.

** Hearts on Detours by Stanrick. Couldn't get past the first chapter. The prose is too verbose and the dialogue is poor. Cormac is great, though. Shame.

Currently reading [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2339&chapno=1][Shifts]] by FernWithy. Remus becomes a teacher at Smeltings for Dudley's protection. I'm really enjoying it a couple of chapters in. Hope it goes better than the last one.

** Harry McGonagall. I wanted to like it, but couldn't get over Harry's characterisation, esoecially regarding house elves. Actually entirely regarding g house elves. I don't know why that irked me so much, but it just seemed so off that he was immediately (at 11 years old!) going to try and change things.

  Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi
