I started it last night and forgot to go to bed, oups its almost 5 in the afternoon.

Really loved this fic, its been recommended a bunch of times and I finally got around to it. Was a ton of fun to read, and now I'm sad that its an incomplete story.


** I've always loved the alternate tasks in it the most...and the Hat, of course. It's a pretty awesome fic and even without a sequel it's one of my favourites. A sequel would be good, yes, but I think that you can imagine how things went from there, so there's no real need to ruin a great fic with a lacklustre continuation that the author doesn't necessarily /want/ to write.

*** Yes the triwizard tournament felt like a magic tournament, it was great. The Sorting Hat was amazing, the enhanced Harry was done in a fun way. The lack of a sequel would bother me less if the author didn't say there would be one. It's a cruel thing to dangle in front of me.

**** It's been many years, though, so I believe all hope of a sequel has been lost. I'm suppose that somebody only reading it now would be surprised that the once-planned sequel never came, especially with how popular the fic is, but I think that sometimes things are best left just the way they are.

**** The sorting hat in Lie I've Lived is one of my favorite characters in fan fiction.

** It's not an incomplete story, it just doesn't have a sequel. It stands pretty well on its own.

*** Well it says there is a planned sequel, but it was never written, that seems incomplete to me.

But yeah it stands okay on its own, but I want to know what happens next. I hate no resolve.

** Am I the only one who thought the ending was disappointing? I, for one, would have been much more interested in reading about the remaining tasks rather than the Voldemort shenanigans which seemed strangely half-hearted, especially compared to the blood chilling resurrection scene in canon.

*** Endings often are, no? It's been quite a while since I last read this fic, but lots of fics I read have endings that feel rushed--almost as if the writer saw the finish line and, exhausted by the journey so far, decided to just get to it as fast as possible, ignoring the view. Endings are harder than anything, I think.

**** The ending makes sense if you consider the idea that the sequel was being made. Without out it does seem rushed.

***** Yes. I think a sequel was planned and then, when push came to shove, the author couldn't face actually writing it. After such a great fic, I suppose that his creative juices had run somewhat dry, then, by the time he had ideas again, it had been so long since the original fic was finished that he'd lost interest in it. That happens a lot, I reckon. I see lots of fics that are left as stand alones, despite their having been a sequel suggested, or that are abandoned halfway through the sequel because the author's gotten bored.

****** I think in this case it was that the author graduated to having his own published works which took over his time.

JBern of fan fiction became [[http://www.jimbernheimer.com]]

*** Yeah I think the end was rushed. Theres like half a chapter of Voldie then an epilogue. Your post just made me remember that dementor scene though. I'm gushing all over this post, but I read for like 16 hours straight through the night.

** The Hat is fun, and the action is okay (if a bit charmless) but LTIL will always struggle under the weight of its terribly written Harry/Fleur romance.

Fleur is written as such a trophy girlfriend it's painful. Her entire existence is to pleasure Harry. Harry repeatedly massively invades her privacy, a violation that would horrify any normal person, but when she finds out she barely cares, because of course, she only exists to make Harry more awesome. She doesn't have thoughts of her own, she's just a reflection of Harry's greatness: by managing to secure the affections of a beautiful and nominally talented woman, Harry is made to look better.

I say nominally talented because it's not like she actually ever gets to use that talent other than, again, to contribute to Harry's character growth. She doesn't get to support her own interests.

The fact that jbern wrote this relationship as a straight up romance worries me. I can't understand how he didn't see the rather disturbing nature of what he'd written.

Also, I thought the tasks were kinda dull. Changing the tasks from the original three is fine, but you have to come up with more interesting ones than a broom race and an extremely repetitive set of duels.
