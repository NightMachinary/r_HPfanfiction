  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** One pure HP fic and two crossovers:

linkffn(Knowledge is Power by RobSt) - Time-traveling OP Harry and Hermione. Also featuring Squirrelmort.

linkffn(One Punch Wizard) - Harry is raised by Saitama. Turns out the training boosts his magic too. One almost pities Voldemort...

linkffn(Potter's Protector by mjimeyg) - First in a series of four crossovers (mostly Buffy, Marvel, and DC), starting with a Xander from after the Buffy TV series showing up at Hogwarts and taking Harry under his wing. Harry doesn't /start/ totally OP, but he gets there by the end of the first fic. Quite long, but a lot of fun. There's one moment in the first fic that caused me to quit the series for a long time, but I did come back later and was glad I did.

#+begin_quote
  After his adventure in the Department of Mysteries, Harry finds a new power over air which gives him confidence. He's "live and let live" until you come after him, then watch out. This starts just after the revelation of the prophecy at the end of book5.

** linkffn (4545504)

Aspirations by megamatt09

A Harry/Ginny story with them manipulating pretty much all of their enemies and taking on the Wizarding World. Somewhat AU though.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

***** People around here seem to love the super long (300k+) fics, but I've yet to read one that wouldn't be improved by being edited down to half its length. I'm sure it /can/ be done, look at Sanderson and of course, Tolstoy. But there's something to be said for completing a story arc in 80-200k words. Even a very talented author is generally better off forcing themselves to do that than meandering on.

****** I've read only 1 that wouldn't be improved by editing it down to half it's length. SOmetimes you just want things to end. It can get boring. A Cadmean Victory was so boring I stopped halfway through, and then got the ending spoilt which made me wish that i'd stayed to see it.
