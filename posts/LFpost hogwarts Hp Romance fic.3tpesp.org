  (Post-war) One witch 7 years his junior, one witch his own age, and one witch 7 years his senior. All vying for Harry Potter's affections. Who will win out? (Not harem, but possible sexual situations/lemons) (All credit to abovethestars@TDA for the banner)

** Linkffn(another dream) Snape/Hermione. One of the best fics I have ever read. Post-war. Snape lives but cannot speak due to his neck injury. All from Snape's point of view. One of the most realistic romances I've read in fanfic. Friendship that naturally develops into something more. Hermione is of age. The author, Dragoon811, has other fun ones.
