And Harry has a personality change in some way from being raised by them. (Not neccessarily bad)


** I recommend A Marauder's Plan by Catsarecool (Rachel500) on Ao3.

"What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision..."

*** Is it any good? The summary - especially the parts "Dumbledore gets a Howler" and "Muggle and Mundane" - gives the impression that there will be Dumbledore and wizarding society bashing.

**** The Howler is during the Sorting Feast, and is Sirius' proclamation of innocence, and Harry has a TV set modified to work around magic, much to Dean's appreciation.
