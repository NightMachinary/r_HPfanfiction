Hi I am searching if there is a fic where Harry having found his breaking point about the wizarding world and how he doesn't know anything about the wizarding world because of being denied the knowledge be it by being raised by muggles, Sirius incarceration, or Dumbledore choices to have him naive, decide to abandon his magic and becomes a muggle or a squib. And make it so it is Dumbledore fault, the consequence of his decision.


** Linkao3(No Fate) sounds like what you want.

  1995: Harry Potter tells the Minister where to stick his underage magic trial. That's the last the wizarding world hears of him. 2004: Corporal Harry Potter, RLC, is trying to have a quiet drink...
