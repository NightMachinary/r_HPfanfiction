***** I would even say not knowing anything about DxD added to my enjoyment of "FILFY Teacher". I learned everything with the MC, as Harry has no idea about anything either in the beginning. I loved the story and was pretty lucky to even read it, because the title really doesn't promise too much. I only read it because I liked the other stories by the author.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** linkffn(I'm not a hero)

Harry starts out as enemies with his brother, but later becomes a proper mentor to him after their parents wake up from a Longbottom-type situation

While it does contain bashing and a lot of independant!Harry cliches, thankfully it doesn't have Harry as a robst-type "can do nothing wrong" character, and it's some very well done bashing where the characters being bashed aren't utter morons and a huge part of the problem is Harry's attitude towards them. Also Dumbledore, while being a typical manipulative!Dumbledore and doing the cliche stuff like magic binds, indoctrination etc to his brother, actually pulls some stuff off rather then failing everything the moment Harry gets involved

  James and Lily have been put into a coma, Adrian Potter is the boy-who-lived, Dumbledore raises him and drops his twin at his aunts. Harry the twin brother of the boy-who-lived comes to Hogwarts and gets sorted into Slytherin. Harry is different from what anyone expecting and he holds a few secrets. Dumbledore bashing, select Weasley bashing, Hermione bashing. (HarryxDaphne)

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

  'He followed the noise, and came to what he was looking for. A red door. A bright red door. A crimson door. Apollo knocked three times. The scuffling froze. The door opened surprisingly quickly. The girl standing in the doorway had dark red hair, emerald green eyes, and pale skin. The girl looked to be about seventeen and was very very pregnant.'
