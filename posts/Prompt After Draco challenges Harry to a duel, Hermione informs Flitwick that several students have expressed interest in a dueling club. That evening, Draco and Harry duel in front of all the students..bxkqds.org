** This is actually a pretty good prompt. I think it could spiral out where Harry takes an interest in dueling, improving his academics in Charms and Transfiguration.

***** No, you're definitely right.

/The Midnight Duel/ is Chapter Nine of the first book. /Halloween/ is Chapter Ten.

Hermione is very much a rules-follower at this point in the canon, and often comes across as /extremely/ self-righteous.

****** My main issue with canon Hermione is the she is fairly self-righteous. She gets worked up if someone bends the rules, but doesn't hesitate to confund someone she doesn't like.

******** Dobbyelflord has Harry Potter: Mercenary and Harry Potter: Hit-Wizard which pretty much address that issue.

I personally prefer a fic where Harry isn't so dependent on her without bashing that isn't a Canon rehash. She strikes me as a kid trying to be an adult.

  What if when Draco challenged Harry to a duel at the beginning of first year it had a lot more significance then either realized? A duel not only for bragging rights but for injustice and eventual love. Harry/Harem
