Odd Ideas by Rorschach's blot has great chapters with great story lines. Any exceptional ones you'd recommend?


** I really like the monster harvester Harry. IIRC there's like 3 or 4 chapters with it spread throughout.

** Big Sister Tonks is my favorite. I want a full book on that. A Siriusly Senior Firsty is also good, as is Better Living Through Chemistry

(If anyone knows full length stories based off of them, please link them!)
