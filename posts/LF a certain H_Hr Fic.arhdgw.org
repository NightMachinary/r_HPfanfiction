Hermione steals Harry's Firebolt and lets Terry (I think, I know it's a Ravenclaw) borrow it but he accidentally breaks it. Harry eventually finds it and then goes ape-shit and then Hermione tries to stun him. Harry then tries to fix it under a tree with Hermione eventually helping him.

(The story is a lot better than it sounds...)


** I thought I had searched out every H/Hr fic but I've unfortunately never heard of this one
