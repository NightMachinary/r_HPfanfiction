I'm looking for fics that focus heavily on rebuilding, politics, and/or power struggles *after* the war.

Epilogue-compliant is not at all necessary. I quite liked Lady of the Lake, for example, and that's got people acting pretty OOC basically from the start.

Please no cross-overs, marriage law, or Lord Potter/Lord Black fics... I think it's definitely plausible that the old pureblood families have a designated seat on the Wizengamot or something like that, and it seems reasonable that being the 'heir' or the 'head' of a one of those families means that person has more political influence and such, but most of the fics that I've read or started that involve Lord Anyone usually end up being utterly ridiculous.

I'm fine with most pairings, het or slash.


** You may enjoy reading linkffn(Made of Common Clay). The Lord stuff exists and there is definitely politics and class struggles, but it's all subverted and refreshing.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

*** I sort of feel like the plots in all the Lomonaaeren fics that I've read are totally bonkers but somehow still interesting or at least entertaining so... yep, it's probably worth looking at.

** Well, the last third of my story "Divided and Entwined" deals exactly with that kind of rebuilding. Sorting out the war crimes, reforming or preserving the Wizengamot, people trying to do some mob justice, splinter groups of all factions not being willing to stop fighting, power struggles between the factions in the Ministry, and the ICW poking their noses in while foreign powers try to gain influence in a war-torn Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** I think actually started reading this at one point but it wasn't really what I was in the mood for at the time. Maybe I'll look at it again though.

** "We Are Young (I'll Carry You Home Tonight)" by Femmequixotic is a fun Draco/Harry fix that focuses a lot on British-style politics. The author based her characterization of Blaise Zabini on Malcolm Tucker from "In The Loop", and the story maintains quite a bit of that "In The Loop" political vibe.

*** Thanks, I'll check it out. Maybe the movie too, if I like the feel of the fic.
