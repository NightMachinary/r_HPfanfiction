** Hermione creates such a group in my Story "Divided and Entwined". Harry works with them when possible but is focusing on his training with Dumbledore to take out Voldemort.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Dumbledore's Army and the sequel Harry Potter and the Spiritus Crystalus by bobmin356. I'm rereading it for the third time this year. Also Harry Potter: Dark Memories by blueowl. These authors know how to write.

** I remember of one where Harry creates a group and also host his relatives (Dursley) in the HQ of his new group. He creates some fighting force and people get trained (he's maybe seen as general? not sure). There also are a healer group in it if I remember well.

Does anyone knows which one it is?
