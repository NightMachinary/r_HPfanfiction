As the title says, I'm always curious about stuff like this for different series.


** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=10917][The Seventh Horcrux by Melindaleo]]

Written in 2006, the story had been traded as the leaked copy of DH in the internet at this time. There are quite a few details in this story that almost made me believe that parts of DH are a copy of The Seventh Horcrux, lol. For me, it is the better version of DH.

*** Not hard to understand either. Everything about the fic feels more...earned I suppose. The perfect example I would say is Ravenclaw Diadem. It was actually a challenge, and far more tense than the return of the ferret+gorillas we got in DH.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

*** Ah, Melindaleo. The fandom doesn't have writers like her any more... people who write stories so close to canon that they could pass for an alternate book by JKR.

**** I know what you mean. Personally, I think it boils down to two words: Deathly Hallows.

That book muddied the waters far more than I can describe. In the aftermath, now that we look back on the series as a whole, it makes you see a great deal of it in a different light.

Deathly Hallows sort of highlighted the downsides to trying to change tone dramatically mid-series.

** After the End (linkffn(282139)) is a post-war fic that was concluded in 2003, the day before the release of the Order of the Phoenix. I just read it a while back (thanks to a recommendation on here) and loved it! While I can't remember specifics, some of the corresponding details include:

- the death of one of the Creevey brothers
- the death of one of the Weasley brothers
- the death of Dumbledore on Hogwarts' grounds
- Hogwarts in ruins after the final battle
- the massive corruption of the Ministry during the war, leading to a haphazard/disorganized Ministry after the war with an Order member as its Acting Minister (who eventually becomes the actual Minister!)
- Fleur getting together with Bill, as well as Fleur taking a job at Gringotts
- Neville becoming the Herbology professor

I'm not 100% sure how many of these had already been hinted at in the canon at when the story first began (in 2001). The whole story felt very true to the characters, though, so I'm sure there were others!

*** Apart from Fleur marrying Bill, none of that seems that special honestly. Herbology was the one subject that Neville was always good at so it doesn't seem that far-fetched for him to become the professor.

In war, many people are going to die and it's always dramatically satisfying to have a twin killed off so that doesn't seem special either. Also you're saying one of the Weasley/Creevey brothers so it could probably not even be the right ones.

And Dumbledore would /need/ to die in most war fics for Harry (I'm assuming he's the protagonist) to come into his own. It only makes sense for him to die on Hogwarts, possibly delaying the enemy/ saving the students . That way his death is more satisfying dramatically

**** Yes, fair criticisms! And you're right on point about the way Dumbledore died. I just assumed -- as I wasn't around in the fandom at the time of publishing -- that things like Neville mustering up the confidence to become a professor or Dumbledore dying prior to the Battle of Hogwarts might not have been easy predictions, especially knowing only up to Goblet of Fire.

However, I feel like in hindsight, I would have thought those were obvious too! But despite not being special or jawdropping (and admittedly broad, regarding the deaths of the siblings), they were predictions nonetheless, which I thought might fulfill the request.

** There was a few fics that predicted Snape loved Lily in some manner. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/165421/1/Lily-Evans-Potter][Here's one from 2001.]] I also recall another in which Severus confronts James about making sure Lily is happy or something along those lines from either 1999, or 2000, but I can't currently find it. (Saw it months ago.)
