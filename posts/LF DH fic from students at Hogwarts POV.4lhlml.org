**** Which is a shame, because regardless of whether or not people care for the story (or author), it does fit the request.

****** Yeah. It's a huge clusterfuck. I'm personally glad that I had read the story before finding anything out about the author. It's still a story I enjoyed, though, even if it doesn't hold up well to rereads.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

** linkffn(Not From Others by FloreatCastellum) by our very own [[/u/floreatcastellum]] is possibly the best DH Hogwarts fic in the fandom (although it is Ginny-centric).

  She may not have been able to join Harry, Ron and Hermione, but Ginny refuses to go down without a fight. As war approaches, Ginny returns to Hogwarts to resurrect Dumbledore's Army and face the darkest year the wizarding world has ever seen. DH from Ginny's POV. Canon.
