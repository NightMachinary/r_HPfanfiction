I had imagined somehow 2 sorts of types for this.

the one being Voldemort is sending Bellatrix in Disguise as a Spy to the "Good-side/Rebels" (whether Snape still acts as his like in Canon or doesnt even do it from the beginning or if he still has this position, but Voldemort wants 2 Spies to get sure doesnt matter). During her time as a Spy, she serves as a valueable member and the Leader of the Light-side Group "promotes" her to his right hand and maybe even as a Spy for his side. Unexpectedly for Bellatrix, she develops feelings for the Leader and at some Point might reveal herself to him. She is torn between her Worship for the Darklord and the Leader of the Good ones (pretty objective, i know, but maybe it can be made believable. I would expect her to be a good in use of occlumentic and "hide" her different Personalities). Maybe her Leader even knew or "guessed", that she was send by the Evil ones. The Rebel Leader and Bellatrix might sleep with each other at some Point.

â€‹

The other type would be that Harry might be the Leader of the Good side and anything above happened with Harry in this Role or Leader remains but harry is still present. No matter what, i have thought that Harrys part would be "smutty", as he sleeps with 3 Women: Bellatrix (if harry is the leader), Fleur and Tonks. Fleur might come to Harry at some Point and try to comfort him, while he would be depressed (maybe doby died or someone other). The Purpose of her visit is to comfort him and "cheer him up", even if she has to sleep with him. Whether she and Bill happen like in Canon and she visits Harry at the Evening/Night before her Wedding or she is Single doesnt matter.

I have no idea, how Tonks part would happen, but what i know is that she isnt with Lupin.

I do realize, that it might sound like some Game of Thrones version of Harry Potter, especially with those intended sex scenes, but it really is a coincidence. I just would want to have a slightly adult Version, but without getting to Dark like Torture or stuff, atleast when its not necessary. As an Optional Point i would Add, that Harry is a couple of Years older than in Deathly Hallows in Canon. So he appears more "like a Man". I wouldnt mind if the time space of voldemorts "Reign" and the duration of the War is changed a bit, so that it al happens Past the point ot time, when it would happen in Canon.

Instead of Bellatrix or Tonks, Hermione could be a Women that Harry gets under the sheets or even Ginny....but i wouldnt want any Hinny Fics with this. Here Harry is paired with no certain Partner, but the mentioned Women and the Situations their are in would lead to the Session. Maybe the one or the other Women would confess, that she has feelings for Harry, but he wouldnt reciprocrate those, either because he doesnt feel anything more than Friendship for them or because the current Situation with the War, fighting and stay alive is dominating his Mindset...maybe he has other reasons, but these would be the ones that i can think off.

Instead of Bellatrix, Narcissa could also work as a Spy. It should be a mature Women in my eyes, so she is optical at the same level as the Leader.

Who the Leader is....i havent thought much about it, but i like it, if it is an OC or some of Harrys Generation, even if it would collide with the Point in the Spy being at the same level. Of course no Dumbledore. He may be part of the Good side, but i imagined him to be dead.

So maybe some fics like this exist and you can name them. If not and you may like the Description, you can use it for your own.
