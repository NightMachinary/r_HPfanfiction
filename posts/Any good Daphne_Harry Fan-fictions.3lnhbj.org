** There are some good ones:

linkffn(Song of the Trees): Minor Harry/Daphne, but excellent story. Probably the best mystery fic in the fandom.

linkffn(Unatoned): Has issues with Harry's characterization and improbability of the setting, but it is a wonderfully written and executed femme fatale.

link(Lost Time): Excellent, but abandoned. Minor Harry/Daphne.

[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=15341][Intoxication]]: Excellent story all round.

linkffn(The Game is Afoot): Decent one-shot, if a bit long-winded.

linkffn(Death before Dishonor by SuperNova26): Just started, has promise. Too bad it barely updates once in six months.

linkffn(Uncle Harry by R-Dude): Fun oneshot

linkffn(A Game of Style and Brutality): Readable, but I see it as more of a disappointment than a success. The Quidditch scenes are good, everything else is /dull/.

linkffn(The Uprising by Captain Cranium): Readable, but not much to write home about. Oh, and Ron bashing. Ugh. Still, it updates, and the author's finished it beforehand, so it will definitely be complete.

There are a few others that I don't care for (Snakecharmer, Perfect Situations, Traitorous) but you might like them. Also, if you see Daphne and Tracey as identical (I see no difference, but it's a thing apparently), then you might want to look at linkffn(What Lies Beneath by Master Slytherin) and linkffn(Tequila by Johnny Farrar).

  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.

#+begin_quote
  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.
