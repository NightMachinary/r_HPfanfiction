Are there fics where the order of the Weasleys is changed?

example:

Ginny - > Percy - > Ron - > Bill - > Twins - > Charlie

I think that could give stories a good spin.


** I read a fic The Quartet that is still in year 1 where Ron and the twins were swapped. The changes are pretty weird so far.

  Ron is the older brother, the twins are at the same year as Harry, and hence a tight, dynamic group is created. But it changes more than just their own courses of lives - four creative minds set on advancing and learning change the entire war, and take back the power and the knowledge from the devious adults. Will also feature Ginny, Sirius and Susan Bones. AU

** Would Harry still be with Ron no matter the year, or would he be the same age and become friend with "Sibling N°6" (may be hard if its someone like Percy, especially if he also becomes friend with Hermione) ?

I don't remember reading any fic like that though. It could be interesting, especially how it could change some of the characters (a Ron who didn't grow in the shadows of his brothers would probably be different, just like a Bill who went from N°1 to something like N°4).

I also sont really see that Percy would become friends with Harry. Maybe Harry would mingle a bit. Maybe he becomes pretty close to Sheamus and Dean.

Ohhh... I like it. Sounds good. Ginny's a professional Quiddich player and meets Fleur at the Triwizard Tournament. Ginny came to visit the family and to support Bill's friend Harry.

Fleur and Ginny would look hot together. Energetic, fiery duo.
