Looking for stories where someone travels back in time and raises Voldemort, already read Altered Destinies, the one where Hermione travels back and moves in with a Black and then cheats with Lestrange, and a one shot of Luna traveling back to raise him. But I'm looking for long stories, to see the impact on the world if Voldemort is good all along.

And stories where Voldemort is not all evil, but Dumbledore/the world doesn't have the whole picture. Or Dumbledore has been manipulating Harry to believe he is evil, like in Limpieza de Sangre or On the Wings of a Phoenix. Stories where maybe Voldemort has the right idea, cause there are more muggles than magical and what will happen if they discover magical. Where he tries to change the ministry cause it's all backwards. But he goes about it the wrong way, but he still has the right idea.

No graphic (and unrealistic) slash please


** linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) is always amusing.

linkffn(The Evil Overlord List) is an unusual twist on the "back in time to raise Tom" genre.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sympathy of Souls) is very mild slash showing Harry and Nicholas Flamel working on healing Voldemort's mind from the Horcrux-caused insanity.

My own linkffn(Tom Riddle and the Sorcerers' Stones by Achille Talon) has the premise that after the Forbidden Forest scene in Deathly Hallows, the Scar-Horcrux's piece of soul is sent back in Harry's body instead of him, with the mission to redeem his other self, by Merope Gaunt. linkffn(Rectifier by Niger Aquila) shows a non-evil Tom Riddle from an alternate universe.

Finally, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) has a Voldemort who is still the antagonist but is both much more terrifying and much less insane than his canon counterpart.

  Thanks to the love of a mother, the part of Voldemort inside Harry's scar gets a second chance. Sent back to life and back to Earth with a mission to bring down his other self, can he resist the temptation to go back to his old ways?

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
