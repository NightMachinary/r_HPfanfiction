What if Voldemort had death summoned for his resurrection, because he wanted his greatest enemy, which was death. So then he uses the essence of death for his Resurrection instead of blood of the enemy. I have no idea how the semantics for such a thing would work but this idea seemed pretty crazy.


** Death would have a great laugh at him and would turn around with a lazy wave.

"/Catch/ you later, Tom."

At least that is how I imagine it.

** Well, considering the effects making horcruxes had on Tom's ability to actually fully die, him doing that would feel like a demented version of Romeo and Juliet.

** Well.. If you believe in destined titles as JK implies exist in the HP world, in a sense he did summon death. Harry would be the master of death so it makes sense that in some form he would be labeled 'Death'. Otherwise can you actually build a body without the blood?

*** I think the fact that it came from an enemy, that the blood was a part of their /being/ was more important than for it to be blood. He can always tweak the ritual I'm sure.

** What would the essence of death be and how would he obtain it? Will death be personified? <- I haven't read a story where it is done well. It's an interesting idea that raises a bunch of questions!

** Neil gaiman's sandman starts with a man who tried to bind Death and captured Dream instead. Things don't go well for him.
