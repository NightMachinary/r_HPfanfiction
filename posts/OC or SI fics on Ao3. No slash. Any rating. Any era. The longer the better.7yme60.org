I've pretty much exhausted FF's OC stories and have yet to dive into Ao3. Any recommendations?


** Any males SI's?

All I find are female self inserts and if I do end up finding a male SI it is sadly a gay male SI.

I can't vouch for the whole thing since I'm not that far into it, but its interesting so far.

  I wasn't the Lavender that could have been ... I was no Gryffindor.(A realistic attempt at an SI fic, with absolutely zero Mary-Sue-ishness).

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4829807/chapters/11061878][Faith and the Devil]] is a really good SI fic. It's restricted by the author though, so you need to be logged into your AO3 account to view it.

fanfictionbot doesn't really work with restricted fics, so I'll post the summary here:

#+begin_quote
  It was eleven AM on a Saturday and I was sitting at the desk, spreading a disappointing Vegemite substitute across an equally disappointing piece of gluten free toast. The only thing that wasn't innately disappointing was that I'd made a very good cup of tea. It was still steaming in my giant, garish mug and I was counting on it to make this breakfast worth getting up for.

  Less than an hour later, Lucius Malfoy would be trying to convince me I was his long lost daughter.

  *Characters:* Self Insert Character, Lucius Malfoy, Narcissa Black Malfoy, Draco Malfoy

** Have you tried Perks of Survival? Its not on FF or Ao3, but on spacebattles. I'm not a fan of reading fics on forums, but its worth putting up with the format.
