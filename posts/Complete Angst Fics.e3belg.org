Hello! I'm an avid HP fanfic reader and have read a ton. However, I'm still looking for more and always am. I have all my favorites on my fanfiction account here for the ones I might have already read: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/m/f_story.php]]

Anyway, if you happen to know of any books at all that fall under the following categories, have decent grammar, and a HP realistic plot line preferably with Sirius or Remus in them, please let me know.

- Sick Harry (cancer, illness, Dragon Pox, etc.)

- Abused Harry (abused by Vernon, harshly or lightly, abused by James even if he was still alive, etc.)

- Tortured Harry (Voldemort, Death Eaters)

- Captured/kidnapped Harry (Voldemort, Death Eaters, etc.)

- Harry self-harms (cutting, anorexia)

- Harry dies (in the final battle, Department of Mysteries battle, kidnapped and tortured death, etc.)

- Harry commits suicide (jumps of astronomy tower, the like)

- Harry has amnesia (loses memory after 4th year, etc.)

- Or anything else with a lot of specific Harry Potter and co. angst.

Thanks!


** linkao3(An Hour of Wolves by thebiwholived) Harry goes through depression, develops an eating disorder and does some self harm.

TW for r*pe.

**** linkao3(Do you feel your life is threatened by fabricated stories by iceprinceofbelair) is a wonderful one shot. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3608871]]

linkffn(a thousand words by Ailee17) is really well written and has a refreshing slow burn pace [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10948484/1/A-Thousand-Words]]

linkffn(Digging for the bones by paganaidd) is a popular one [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6782408/1/Digging-for-the-Bones]]

linkao3(exordium by stickersformymac) scratches the hurt/comfort &&& angst itch [[https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/31898880?show_comments=true]]

linkao3(broken mind, fractured soul by Sensiblytainted) can be a little difficult to get through at times and, in the end, was unsatisfying for me, but I still enjoyed it and have reread it and think it's work recommending bc boy howdy angst galore [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8873683/chapters/20344381#workskin]]

linkffn(the first day by little0bird) the first fanfic I ever read and it's stuck with me. while all the other fanfics I've recommended take place while harry is in school, this one looks at his recovery after the war. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day]]

(edited to add the last recommendation)

  Memory charms aren't failsafe. Harry discovers this early in his fifth year when he starts having something akin to flashbacks but there's one distinct difference: he can't actually remember.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter watched his mother die when he was fifteen months old, a piece of Voldemort's soul invaded his own, Vernon abused him, Petunia tore him to shreds with her hateful words, and Lockhart molested him throughout Second-year. After all that trauma, is it any wonder Harry created multiple personalities to deal with it all? In Harry's third year, Severus Snape decides to do something about it. He gives Harry therapy in secret, and this opens Harry up to a friendship with Neville Longbottom, another victim of Lockhart's perversions, and Draco Malfoy who can understand Harry's Slytherin alter better than anyone else.

  Harry never could have predicted how much his life would change after making a surprising discovery at the Dursley household the summer before Second Year. The young wizard returns to school looking for answers, and ends up finding a whole lot more. Snape/Harry mentor fic. No slash.

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.
