I've been trying to find this story I never finished but lost. It's a fem Harry one where the Dursleys keep her isolated in her cupboard/room. I remember a specific chapter where after first year, the Dursley lock her in Dudley's second room and don't let her out for weeks. She lets Hedwig pace the room and gets food through a hole in door. I left off where she escapes. I believe I read it on Archive of our own. If you can tell me the name that would be great
