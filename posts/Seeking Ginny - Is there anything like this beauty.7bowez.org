Together with NOFP those are by far the best fanfictions I've ever read. You know what, the best stories I've ever read together with HP 1-6. So, is there any good fanfiction like them? A story that is about a complex relation between harry and ginny, without mking it seems forced or rushed or all the other infinite numbers of possible mistakes? A story that feels real?

** My problem with Seeking Ginny is it is a very good story, but not necessarily a Harry Potter story, specifically how it treats Ginny. Granted, the story was written in 2001 I think so Ginny was still this demure girl obsessed with the idea of Harry Potter, and perhaps the author was truer to that version of Ginny than the one we eventually came to know. But too often it felt like I was reading an OC. Virtually every character could've been an OC without really changing anything.

Ginny was a bit selfish and unlikable in the fic and I found it difficult to root for her. It's fine to have a main character who is often unlikable or does bad things (see Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Sopranos) but it doesn't work so well for romantic stories.

The premise is also a bit pathetic, no? A Ginny who never really grew from her girlhood crush, and had it debilitate her so much she'd leave her life behind?

Good story, not a good portrayal of Ginny and personally I need by HP fics to keep the main characters true to canon.

** Annerb writes the best harry/ginny in the fandom. She has several that are all worth a read. Keep in mind, her ginny isn't always exactly canon Ginny, but I think it really resembles the personality Rowling had in mind for her Ginny.

*** She is definitely among the best but you're right, it's not really Ginny we are reading, or Harry in a lot of ways either. But I could see what you're saying that this may have been what Ginny would be like in Slytherin. I actually hold that since many think it was a problem that Rowling didn't portray Slytherins in a better light, if she had Ginny actually be in Slytherin, it could've worked out really well. The whole Chamber/Heir of Slytherin thing kinda works with Ginny and their eventual pairing would carry added weight with her being considered an enemy just for being in Slytherin.
