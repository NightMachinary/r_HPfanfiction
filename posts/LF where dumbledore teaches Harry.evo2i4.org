Sixth year fics where they do something other than going over memories where dumbledore teaches Harry magics that he believes Voldemort can't or won't access


** That happens in two of my stories - "Divided and Entwined" and "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief". Well, it's not "Magic Voldemort can't access" but "Magic/tactics where they're on a more equal footing than duelling".

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** I recall a story where Dumbledore teaches Harry to utilize his mother's sacrificial magic in combat. I think Dumbledore even sacrificed himself for Harry so Harry could cast the spell. I don't remember which one it is though. I'll go through my list and get back to you.

Year 1 is complete and all years will be posted in this story. The first chapter of year 2 comes out on March 8th for FFN.net and is out on my discord right now. The story will drift further and further away from cannon as the years progress.

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater.

**** It depends on what you define as OP I guess. Personally, I'm not one of those people who enjoy reading stories where Harry is godlike and has no adversity. I would say he's OP compared to his first year classmates, but not in general (at least not yet, though he will get there)

Also, I didn't really read the bit about sixth year, so it starts in year 1 :)

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
