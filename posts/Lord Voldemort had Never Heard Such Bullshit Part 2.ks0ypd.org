Good folks of hpfanfiction, I present a Voldemort who's just done with absolutely everyone.

I wrote a somewhat cracky one-shot a few months ago of Voldemort debriefing Lucius on the diary fiasco (first chapter), so this seemed like a natural progression (second chapter).

Hope you enjoy!

** That was hillarious I loved it! Requests for chapters that you can completely ignore::

Voldy arguing with Quirrell during those stupid and pointless Philosophers Stones tasks. Why were they even a thing? Voldemort had to play chess for at least 20 minutes!??

Why the hell did Voldemort set all his fecking passwords to "Open"? The Locket, the chamber of secrets? What terrible password management is that?

Any of Voldemort under the turban. Genius plan sir 10/10.

The Death Eaters rioting the quidditch cup for literally no reason other than to be arseholes. Honestly you'd think the story was set in America....

Barty crouch's intensely specific plan to bring Harry back that involved so many convoluted steps it makes absolutely no logical sense at all.... Kidnap the kid. Don't take down an ex-auror, become a fully fledged teacher with lesson plans and grading to do, rig an international tournament, ensure that a 14 year old child wins said deadly tournament through a cunning use of chineese whispers that had absolutely no guarantee of working and hope the child doesn't die when he's doing it because again, HES A CHILD...

** Hilarious! Voldemort's casual disregard for plot-armor and actually sensible expectations of how his followers should act in opposition of how they actually acted is pure gold!

*** Thanks! I actually re-read the canon department of mysteries scene before writing this to make sure but yea, the Death Eaters really didn't seem to have much of a plan.

Edit: This is actually great. I might do another scene with Lucius coming up with the plan. Lucius get's assignment, has all year to create a plan, ends up with "1) Be there at the same time as Potter. 2) Death Eaters on three. 3) Profit."

*** Lol thanks, I plan to, writing these is super fun!

I found out Tom Riddle would have been about 13 when Wizard of Oz came out and it became my head cannon that he somehow saw it during one of his summers away from Hogwarts. I couldn't resist slipping it in.

EDIT: Actually, re-reading it I'd be interested in seeing a whole fic based on a divergence after on the above's chapter three with the hagrid-detention.

** On-topic: love your story;

Off-topic rant: why do you guys send mobile links to ffn? If you're on the phone and receive the desktop link, it will automatically adjust... but if you're on the laptop and you receive the mobile link, it will still show as the mobile site.
