Plus I think children would actually enjoy Dumbledore's sense of Fashion, at eleven I definitely would have), so he does his level-best to become as ‘Dumbledorish' as possible (focusing on his studies plus other areas like Alchemy, getting eye watering bright-colored clothes to wear in his spare-time, acting like he knows all your secrets and anything you do is part of his grand plan even when he knows nothing and has no plan at all...)

Where does this happen? When he lets his school headmaster keep him from writing the only two friends he has? Two years in a row? Or how about when he lets him keep him from living with his godfather? You know, the one that lives under a fidelius?

Nothing in that series is Harry taking control of his life. We're told in canon that Harry is brought up and guided to a death Dumbledore planned for him. That definitely sounds like control of his own life to me.

****** The problem is that many confuse “being independent” with “disregarding all rules and/or laws” with a side-dose of “Doing the opposite of anything others tell you”. True independence doesn't need to be re-affirmed all the time by ignoring what others tell you, it is in taking the facts in consideration and then making a decision yourself.

Harry /choose/ to put his trust on Dumbledore in fighting Voldemort as he was the only one actively trying to do something to fight. Dumbledore in no moment locked Harry at the Dursley's and threw away the key (even the order was only guarding him instead of keeping him prisoner, otherwise he would know that they were there and they would have taken measures to prevent him from leaving), he only said that Harry couldn't stay at Hogwarts during the summer -he didn't in anyway interfere when the Weasley's invited him over- Harry /could/ have run away, he could have asked to stay at another classmate's house, /he */choose*** not to, even the whole blood-wards thing only came later.

But much more important, Harry /never/ asked Dumbledore's permission for either his ordinary or extraordinary activities. Even disregarding the times Dumbledore simply wasn't present to interfere one way or another Harry never even thought about showing the map to Dumbledore, he went to Hogsmead /despite/ being told not to, /he/ wrote to his friends over the summer, /Ron and Hermione/ were the ones who didn't write back at Dumbledore's orders. Yeah, he didn't flip the bird to the underage wizardry laws, but disregarding laws (even more so with breaches being so heavily monitored) is not being independent, it is only breaking laws, being independent does /not/ give someone the right to ignore laws because they don't agree with them, try to imagine a world where it did.

Truth is that Dumbledore barely interfered on Harry's life and the times he did he actually had good reasons to: the guard to protect him after Voldemort came back, putting him with the Dursley's (They were the logical conclusion with Harry's parents and their friends dead or in prison, plus he couldn't possibly know how much they hated magic -no reason for Lily to tell him, Mcgonnagall's one day of vigil only told him that they spoiled Dudley and had the money to support Harry and his only /personal/ prior interaction with any member of the family was the letter that Petunia sent him), not telling a fifteen years old school boy that would be at Hogwarts for most of the year anyway sensitive information about the war that he could either let slip by accident, revel under Veritaserum (as almost happened), or simple have a legillimens take from his brain.

People really make it seems as if Dumbledore was micromanaging Harry's life when in truth he would have many things that would be much more important to do, like trying to find Horcruxes, directing a war, directing a school, Fighting Voldemort, Fighting the ministry, work for his administrative jobs, plus time to rest, live his own life, eat, interact with friends... the whole thing is really blown way over the top

******** Ok, first of all Harry had access to his parents inheritance (which we have no reason to think was in anyway restricted), plus, while Sirius may had been willing to take guardianship of Harry the fact is that he was either believed of being on Voldemort's side by Dumbledore or on the run (for some time both). In the two occasions in which the Fidelius was put to use it went wrong, the first was when Pettigrew sold the Potters out to Voldemort and the second when /Dumbledore/ -who was the secret keeper- died, so we know that it isn't perfect nor is Dumbledore immortal.

Even disregarding Sirius' likely mental disabilities acquired in Azkaban him being innocent doesn't change the fact that he was being hunted by both magical and muggle government /and/ by Death Eaters who /knew/ about his animagus form, plus being trapped permanently on Grimauld Place with no release in sight.

And all of it is assuming that Dumbledore even /has/ the power or political capital to ensure a change of guardianship /and/ that this change won't be given for the highest bidder. All we know about Dumbledore's political powers and positions is that he had a voice in Death Eater's trials, that he did /something/ for the Wizengamont and the ICW, that he was easily ousted by Fudge, he implied that he had some experience with laws (not specifying if he helped create them or if he only participated in it's application), he didn't have the influence to prevent the ministry from either sending Hagrid to Azkaban, killing Hagrid's Hippogriff under a ridiculous claim maid by a spoiled child, couldn't have more DE's sent to Azkaban, and couldn't prevent the ministry from wasting a year after Voldemort came back. Overall his actual politic power is never specified and it seems like many of his positions were purely ceremonial with most of his actual influence coming from being trusted and respected by those who actually /did/ hold the power.

And most of all, all of this has nothing to do with our discussion. I wasn't arguing that Dumbledore made the right call in sending Harry to the Dursley's, I was arguing that it was /Harry himself/ who made the decision to stay when he had the means to move-out. He was mostly in control of his life with little to no input from any adult at all, he wasn't some bystander who was forced to move in a certain direction chosen by others every step of the way.

********** Ok, what duress, what consequences and what weight?

He literally had seven years to consider the possible consequences and repercussions to plan ahead. He wasn't in a small time-window of opportunity under threat to force him in a certain behavior (aka the definition of duress).

Which consequences was he ever threatened with? Dumbledore didn't let him stay at Hogwarts and later explained about the blood protections, that is it. He never even hinted at any negative consequences if Harry left the place or proposed that Harry should stay locked there.

And finally what weight? Politicians can't by themselves arbitrarily distribute punishments to those who disobey or displease them (even Fudge had to find an excuse and call a hearing when trying to get Harry expelled) and we have just gone through the reasons that prove Dumbledore didn't have power by himself rather than the ear of those who had power. On the personal interference sphere Harry had absolutely no reason at all to ever believe Dumbledore would personally attack him, Dumbledore never showed unreasonably violent tendencies at all (even less so towards students or children as a whole), plus always acting in an affable way. Plus, for all fanfics generally put stock on the mind arts and potions as a way of controlling people the only canonically proved ways of controlling someone else are possession, love potions and the imperius curse -Love potions are shown to be so obvious they are treated as jokes, possession needs the person to pour their soul on someone else and the imperius has it's effects and the feeling of being under it solidly defined- thus none of those were being used on Harry, obliviate works if you want to make someone forget a secret, not to change their wishes or behavior (enche the need for a prison instead of just having the criminals brainwashed.

******* Beyond the one above I would say linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt) is a good one;

linkffn(More than Equals) is short and abandoned, but was good while it lasted;

linkffn(A Cadmedian Victory) is an inversion of the normal tropey types where it goes terribly wrong for /everyone/;

For the Love of Magic has it, but fair warning, that story has issues. The author seems to actually /believe/ that feminism is wrong and even for someone like me who does disdain the concept of religion some of the things the author put about Muslims are downright nasty - but to give credit where it is due, the world building is one of the best I've seen- the story is blacklisted, so no link;

Linkffn(The Very Best) is a lighthearted and childish version of it;

Linkffn(Elementary Calculations) is abandoned and stopped at the beginning, but was shaping to go that way.

For a more tropey, but still enjoyable read I would recommend either Linkffn(Rise of the Wizards) or Linkffn(Savior of Magic).

Linkffn(A simple act of Vengeance) kind of gets there eventually.

Linkao3(Mischief's Heir by Esama) is more borderline in the sense that Harry is the moving force behind many of his projects and doesn't really have someone moving things “behind the scenes” Well at certain point there kind of is, but this is more of a minor plot line that gets resolved relatively quickly.

**** "What's gotten into you, Harry?" Ron sobbed from his bed, "This is the third time this week!"

"Sorry," said Harry to the Gryffindor Dorm.

The soaking wet Gryffindor Dorm.

Seamus' loud snores echoed in the small room.

"What the hell... Harry... Are you alright?" Neville asked as he rubbed his eyes. Dean simply stood up, opened his trunk, grabbed a dry set of clothes, and entered the bathroom.

"I said I'm sorry, aight?" Harry shouted, but then calmed himself, "Sorry... again. It's just..."

Ron slipped from his bed and conjured a simple chair beside Harry's bed. "It's alright, mate. You'll be fine."

"But... Sirius..."

"The last thing that man would want would be to see you sad." Ron patted Harry's hand.

"I don't know enough about Mister Black ---"

"Sirius," Harry was finally smiling, "he hated being called Mr Black."

"Sirius then," Neville too smiled gently. "I'm sure Sirius would want you to move on. He didn't seem like a brooding type of person."

"You're right," silent tears streamed down Harry's cheeks. "He would want me to prank the whole school in his memory."

"I can ask Fred and George for you," Ron supplied.

"No need... I'm just... drained I guess."

"Come on," Ron started pulling Harry away from his bed, "on your feet, now!"

"Where..."

"Kitchens!"

Harry thought about rejecting it for a moment, but finally conceded. "Yeah, let's go."

Neville waved them away, his set of dry nightwear already in hand for his turn of the bathroom.

"That was impressive," Ron said when they had finally exited the Fat Lady's portrait. "Enough water to drench the whole room, and that too without a wand! Bloody awesome!"

"Hazardous, more like," Harry said, "Imagine if it had been fire instead."

Ron stopped for a second, gulped, then continued walking. "Point taken. You need to learn control."

"Yeah, subconscious control. Hermione lent me a book about it," both boys smirked, then Harry continued, "it has gone way over my head, though."

"Understandable," Ron said solemnly.

"Still, that leaves me nowhere to go. Sprout won't know anything about it, I'll make Gryffindor lose the house cup for the next ten years of I try McGonagall by the number of points she will deduct, Flitwick is a half goblin, his mind is fundamentally different from ours, and..." Harry suddenly stopped walking.

Ron turned around, and gulped again, when he looked at Harry's face.

"And," Harry continued in a tone colder than the castle, "I will willingly kill myself kneeling before Voldemort before I /ever/ ask Snape for help!"

"Harry... you're bloody scary."

Harry visibly calmed himself before he resumed his walking. He smoothed out the Marauder's map that had gotten crumpled in his hand.

"So that leaves no one," he concluded finally.

"You know there are more than those... 4... teachers in Hogwarts, yes?"

"Did you just count Snape among the teachers in this school, Ron?" Harry's chilly voice was back.

"Nnnn--yeee--ummm---" Ron found his salvation, "what about Dumbledore?"

Harry's mind changed like a switch. "Not a bad idea, actually." He started walking again, and Ron quickly followed.

As they reached the kitchen door they were greeted by an exiting Luna.

"Hey Luna!" Harry called.

"Hello Harry, Ronald Weasley!" she waved her hand not missing a beat as she departed quickly.

"Why am I Ronald Weasley but you're only Harry?"

"I asked."

Harry tickled the pear. He then pulled the handle.

And they were greeted with chaos.

Elves were frantically slicing, dicing, washing, arranging in such a choreographed fashion that it was somewhat hypnotic.

Harry shook his head, and followed Ron as he ducked under a low ceiling and made his way inside, only to find...

"Professor Dumbledore?"

"Harry Potter?"

"Ronald Weasley?"

"Professor Dumbledore!"

"Harry Potter!"

"Rona---"

"Stop saying your own name, Ron."

"Well someone's gotta do it!"

"I what health do I find you gentlemen this fine," Dumbledore glanced at his watch, "this fine 2 AM?" He looked at their terrified faces, already anticipating weeks of detention. "That can't be right..." He tapped his watch with his wand, "Hmm, what a terrible time for my watch to malfunction. How can I be of help to such fine, rule-abiding students such as yourself?"

Their terrified faces quickly changed to grinning ones.

Ron started, "Harry started shaking and moaning again, and then something exploded, and then we were all wet."

"Don't say it like that!"

Dumbledore stroked his beard, "Ah that seems like a job for our resident Medi-Witch. Have you visited the infirmary yet, Harry?"

Harry sighed, "It's not what it looks like, sir. Ron is..."

"So your magic didn't act of its own accord when you were asleep and experiencing a nightmare due to the recent events in your life?"

"Never mind it is exactly what it looks like. Please carry on, sir."

Dumbledore nodded. "I still believe a preliminary visit to the infirmary is in order."

Harry sighed in defeat. "I... just wanted to have a cup of hot chocolate."

"Here, master Harry!" A little elf placed a cup in Harry's hand, then disappeared with a pop.

"Shall we head to the infirmary, Harry? If nothing else, then just to satisfy an old man's curiousity?"

"... fine," was Harry's morose response.
