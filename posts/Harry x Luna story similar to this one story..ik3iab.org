So i have been reading anthesis. I liked harry and luna there and got upset when she died.

Anything equally well written fanfic with the same pairing. A similar relationship but a happier ending.

**** Do you mean Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin? I have no idea; I've never read it and never intend to. However, edgy political Harry and WBWL are big nos for me so I already know it wouldn't be my cup of tea.
