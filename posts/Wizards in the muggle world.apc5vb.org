I recently plowed through Exile by bennybear, and am now hunting for more fics about pure or half bloods adjusting to the muggle world and realizing it's worth something. Anyone know anything? Not picky about pairings, but prefer complete. Thanks!


** Have you read linkffn(the strangers at drakeshaugh)? It's a cannon-compliant, postwar fic told from the perspective of Harry's muggle neighbors. When the Weasleys pop over for a party, there's a lot of the-audiance-knows-but-the-narrator-doesn't going on.

There's also the scenes from the absurdly cute linkffn(grow young with me by taliesin19) where Harry brings his OC date to the burrow. Watching the Weasleys at the burrow trying to pretend to be muggles is just priceless.

There's also the great linkao3(the man who lived by sebastianL). Draco is working with troubled muggle kids in New York City. He essentially tells them that he was in a neonazi gang. This one is slash.

  Draco breaks a cup, and one thing leads to another. A story of redemption, tattoos, dreams, mistakes, green eyes, long conversations, and copious amounts of coffee. Set in New York twelve years after the war.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** Hmm, I wonder if you may enjoy my TP. Harry gets stuck in Muggle London for a bit and has to hide his magic and pretend to be a Muggle and all that fun stuff. :)

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable.
