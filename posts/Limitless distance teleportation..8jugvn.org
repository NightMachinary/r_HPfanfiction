Are there any fics(crossover or not) where there in no actual limit to Apparation/Portkey/Portal like 9^{3/4} etc... It always striked me as strange that there was a limit, it doesn't matter the distance when you're essentially folding space. The energy needed to do that is so high that distance isn't really a drain on it's own. So any fics where Harry, or others teleport from Britain to America regularly, or from planet to planet(if it's Mass Effect/Star Wars/other sci-fi). I also don't mind if Harry, or whoever is the MC is just special, and only they can do it for whatever the reason. As long as there's no hard limit.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** I always write teleportation magic like this.

I had one where the solution to space-"travel" for magicals was to send a chimney to another planet and floo there.

In another one the only quirk of a portkey to the other end of the world is that you arrive with the same body-orientation there, as in: If you portkey from Britain to Australia, you better prepare to make a handstand.

Apparition only has the limitation that you need to have been at some place once to go there again by Apparition.

But unfortunately I don't know a fic in which this is the case. I only ever remember the ones where they make a big deal out of apparating a 100 km.

HP magic is independent of law if physics, so assumptions like that don't make sense.

*** I don't know if that's entirely the case. Heavier objects are more difficult to lift, which seems to be the case with levitating objects as well (otherwise they would have just levitated Fluffy off that trapdoor, among other things). It doesn't apply to everything, but I think it's a bit hasty to say it's completely independent of physical laws.

**** Magical creatures (and living beings in general) are magic-resistant to a degree, with dragons and basilisks being famously almost impossible to bring down with spells. You can't /Accio/ a human toddler as easily as you could a piano or even a cruise ship. And I think Fluffy was more that than his mass.

That being said, you do have a point for other instances.

********* Hmm, okay, so it's magical resistance for difficulty scaling and not necessarily SIZE? Because I don't like if it's SIZE because you're not wasting ENERGY when you transfigure something, I mean there's no MANA POOL so it shouldn't be any kind of STRUGGLE. That wouldn't make sense to me. Transfiguring a skyscraper should take as little effort as a teacup. The same effort. Just like Star Wars, where Yoda is all "SIZE MATTERS NOT" but then SIZE DOES MATTER so it was a contradiction and a lie. :( Grrrr. Pick one and stick to it! Either it matters or it doesn't.

Not really.

  Well, there are Switching Spells ... but what's the point of Switching it? Unless you swapped its fangs for wine gums or something, that would make it less dangerous ... the trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon's hide ... I'd say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven't got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall ...
#+end_quote

Transfiguration is mentioned as an alternative because you can't get spells through dragon's hide. Ergo transfiguration must not be limited by this or be less limited.

My story has this. :) My main character goes all over the globe whenever she wants, because there aren't limits to teleporting distance which never made sense I agree. If you're already teleporting, instantly moving across space and time, then WHY would there be some random invisible cutoff for that, why would it MATTER how far you actually go?

Apparition requires great knowledge of the place the wizard wants to visit, as they need to be able to visualise it clearly.

There's your limit right there. You can keep it up all day long as long as you know the place and can focus.

** linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) Harry makes a Portkey that sends the holder into orbit, and previously from his ship (Which is in space) to the Forest Floor of Kashyyyk.

linkffn(Havoc Side of the Force) Harry's internal monologue goes over the details necessary for Apparating, specifically in regards to changing altitude and orienting yourself in relation to the curvature of the planet. He kills Darth Maul by Apparating them both outside a building, and while Harry is able to use Apparition to lessen his impact, the Sith had no such protection.
