In many fanfics, I see that after the cleansing of the horcrux by whatever means(sometimes goblins, sometimes black family library, sometimes another AK) Harry's lightning bolt scar disappears completely. It really is annoying. Harry's scar is not due to the horcrux. So even after the horcrux was removed due to Voldemort's Avada Kedavra the scar stops causing him pain but the scar remains.


** It doesn't have to disappear completely, but from the cursed scar which doesn't heal properly at all, it is just a regular one, which can heal to some extent (although remaining visible).
