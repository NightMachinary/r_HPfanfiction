What do you find more interesting as a reader/writer?

Stories where Harry is a prodigy and becomes a leader (Dumbledore-like in terms of power and leadership

Or

Stories where the trio leans on each other and minimizes the faults of each other


** I hate overpowered Harry. The whole point is him not being all powerful. That's what the books are about. To me, superHarry always feels like it was written by a teenager

** Depends I guess. I don't really care for Harry being a "prodigy" in the sense of being an overall, certified genius. Rather, I prefer it if he grows into excellence. It's inherently more compelling characterization to most people, I think. An awesome-by-default character just reads as less interesting since the conclusion is, and is often foreshadowed as being, an inevitable ending where he steamrolls the antagonists.

Conversely, a team oriented story has a lot of merits and possibilities that can't be done with an OP Harry.

** "Genius of Hard Work" Harry. He can be Overpowered Harry that way, but he has to earn it through Blood Sweat and Tears, with Rock Lee levels of extreme training. "If i cannot cast this spell, i will run to Hogsmeade Station on my fingers!"

** I prefer Harry doing the work. I don't like over-powered, Merlin-like Harry, but more like Harry who actually makes an effort and goes out of his way to actually learn things beyond classes knowing he has to defeat an insane dark lord with 50+ years of strong magic under his belt. So yeah I like him to study and learn and take extra lessons. I like him working for it and taking the initiative.

** Personally, I prefer a stronger Harry than a stronger group. We go on the journey with Harry, and to see other's do 'his' work does not offer a story as compelling as one where Harry works hard and overcomes his own obstacles. That's not to say I don't enjoy competent allies, I just enjoy stories more where we don't look externally for solutions - I think that was one of the downfalls of the original stories and the root of most fanfiction, the fact that most of the problems were solved by others such as Dumbledore and Hermione, and so Harry did not develop as much as he could.

** Both, depending on what I want to read at the moment.

** If Harry is as powerful as Dumbledore, then he'd better be as old as Dumbledore. The kind of control Dumbledore has over magic took him ages to learn and master. “Well what about Voldemort?” I hear you ask. Voldemort was around seventy, so yeah, Harry better not be a God at 30.

The other prompt is interesting as long as it's not overdone. Make the faults that are covered up sparing, just enough to keep them dependent. We wouldn't exactly want to read about weaklings that are constantly getting their arses saved by someone else.

** Neither. I prefer a Harry who is more intelligent than canon. I tend to saying my standard is at least 5 or 6 outstanding OWLS and 2 or 3 Outstanding NEWTS. Not that grades are particular markers of intelligence but it's the easiest way to describe my perspective. I like Harry to be a leader but not Dumbledore's protege. Bonus point if the trio are all competent

** As a reader: both can be done well, it's all in the writer's talent. As a writer... neither, really. Making Harry OP to /these/ levels can almost only be done by making a Harry in name only, and Harry isn't, anyway, a very interesting character; but on the other hand I find writing the trio in an interesting and dynamic fashion rather hard (also, we've /seen/ what the trio working together looks like, it's canon, so been there done that). So as a writer I tend to pick different main characters. Hermione, Voldemort, the Sorting Hat, just about anyone.

** What I find most interesting is a Harry who develops into a strong leader and a powerful but not exceptional wizard.

Head auror Potter is the tier of achievement I prefer to see Harry reach.

Voldermort and Dumbledore are shown to have led lives consumed by their thirst for magical might/knowledge. I can't see Harry be that devoted, as written in canon.

** The latter, because it means Harry is hopefully less prominent.
