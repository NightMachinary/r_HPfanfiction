10 years after the battle of Hogwarts, Peeves is sitting and thinking, a new year is about to begin a fresh batch of ickle firsties to play with, but he doesn't know what to do, it seems like he has done it all before, if only he had a friend to help.

All of a sudden a great gush of wind blows open the door behind Peeves and a loud wailing echoes off the walls.

Peeves is caught off guard and starts to leave when he hears laughter.

He calls out "Who's that trying to scare Peeves the Poltergeist?".

A new ghost appears out of thin air, wearing a green woolen jumper with a big yellow F on the front.

"Hello Peeve's, let's have some fun".

** Peeves didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He realized that there was a chance, a fairly large chance, that his place as the biggest prankster of all the spectres of Hogwarts had now been significantly threatened. On the other hand, he would no longer be the sole target of the Bloody Baron's wrath. Trepidatiously, he also wondered if he might, finally, have a kindred spirit with whom to wreak havoc on the denizens of the castle.

“Fred Weasley? A Hogwarts ghost?” he sputtered.

“In the flesh! Rather, in the echo plasm, actually, you get my drift, yeah?”

“ Will you be Peeves' friend and ally in tormenting the folk of Hogwarts castle, Fred Weasley?”

“You can dispense with my last name, old chap. Just ‘Fred' works for me. I haven't pranked this school since George and I created that swamp during Umbridge's time here as Grand inquisitor or whatever she called herself.”

“What shall we do first, to initiate Fred We---Fred, into ephemeral pranking?” queried Peeves.

“I have an idea, friend Peeves. Figured we could start small, me being new to ghostly existence and all. Let's mess with Dumbledore's portrait!”

“That's a plan I can get behind, friend Fred, uh, Fred.”

“I have an idea; come on!”

Soon, the new partners in prank were in the Headmaster's office, having drifted past the guardian Gargoyle, to which Fred made an obscene gesture as they passed.

“ I like your style!” said the poltergeist.

“Then wait until you see this!”

Fred handed Peeves what appeared to be a Muggle rifle. “No, Fred!” The poltergeist cowered for perhaps the first time in his lengthy existence. “The Baron will have my arse! He'll think I put you you up to this!”

“Just wait, Peeves.” Fred demonstrated the power of a paintball gun, firing a green and silver splotch of,paint and hitting Dumbledore square in his sleeping face. “Amazing!” Peeves gushed. Let me try, Fred!”

The Weasley twin handed the paintball gun to Peeves. “Hit him; he's awake now.”

“Peeves, please reconsider, my boy. Defaced, my portrait will not hold the degree of distinction that it merits,” Dumbledore pleaded.

“And?”

Peeves aimed and fired, sending a jet of orange paint at at Dumbledore's crooked nose. “Owww, Minerva! Baron!” Dumbledore cried, hoping help would arrive.

Fred and Peeves high-fived each other, and gave Dumbledore obscene gestures as they floated through the door. “Show me your rooms , Peeves. We have planning to do.”

*** I'll give it a whirl:

Fred and Peeves floated through the gargoyle, gleeful in their success at defacing Headmaster Dumbledore's portrait. Fred relished the exhilaration of mischief, so sorely missed. How many times had he led George down these very halls in their attempts to cement their place in history as Troublemakers-in-Chief?

Of course, George had had a bit of a habit of keeping him grounded. Just a little bit. Making sure the pranks stayed legal. Mostly. And George was the one who used the Marauder's Map most. Not that Fred would need the Map now, of course. Harry would have it...or possibly Harry would have passed it down. To Teddy, maybe? Only right for the Son of Prongs to pass it down to the Son of Moony.

Caught in these not-particularly-pranking thoughts, Fred didn't notice that he and Peeves were about to walk right into Filch until it almost too late. And Peeves had used the paintball gun on a dozen different portraits and three suits of armor.

Peeves wasn't sharing the paintball gun? After all the work Fred had done to get it?

"Peeves!" Filch shouted. His eyes narrowed when he saw the paintball gun. "Graffitiing the fine works of art of Hogwarts? Oh this will be recorded! And I shall summon the Baron, oh yes I will!"

Peeves shot Filch in the chest with a pink paintball.

"Peeves will not allow you to spoil his fun with his friend! No he won't! No he won'!"

"Augggh! I will see you exorcised for this, Peeves!"

Exorcisms? Well, that didn't sound like very much fun at all. Fred decided to make himself known. He had hoped to wait for a bigger reveal, but eh, even with an eternal afterlife, there was no time like the present.

"Hey, Filchy. Did you miss me?"

"WEASELY?!" Filch shrieked in fear. "Here?! How?!" His eyes widened in shock and outrage. "No! No! It cannot be! You died!"

"What, so just because I'm dead, I can't visit my friends?" Fred grinned. "I missed you, Filchy. Can I have a hug?"

"No!"

"But I missed you! Peeves, don't you think Filch needs a hug?"

"Oh yes. Always so grouchy he is, oh yes! A big one!"

Filch screamed something that sounded vaguely like "Mummy!" and tore down the corridor waving his hands in the air.

The chase was on! Fred whooped with joy and he could hear Peeves cackling as they soared down the halls.
