Not that I routinely read terribly much from there these days, but it looks like portkey.org has died. Is this the case?

[Edited to add: Does anyone know how to get in touch with Portkey's administrators?]


** Oh damn. That is sad news. Portkey was my second foray into HPFF after ff.net. Posted my very first attempt at writing there too. Some fics like The Cardinal Curses and Coming Back Late were my first favorite stories in the HHr ship.

Too bad it went down.

**** Somehow I got it in my head portkey was going down when The Qudditch Pitch was, so I downloaded a whole bunch from both sites. They're mixed amid other stories, so I cannot share a complete collection of what I do have from portkey, but if anyone is looking for a specific fic then I can check my files to see if I have it.

** Very fucking sad if its gone forever, some stories are unbelievable important to me, almost the only fan fic site for me. If you go to the face book group "Portkey Friends" Someone there has Emailed James ( one of the one who started it)whose trying get an answer from Nappa who has all the codes and server information to fix the site. So far no word from Nappa

*** Well, this is absolutely dreadful. I've contacted the site admin Nappa, [[mailto:imran.nappa@gmail.com][imran.nappa@gmail.com]], and not a word in response. He's always gotten back to me promptly previously, so genuinely sad about this. There are a number of Reddit posts and Tumblr posts also regarding this as well. I've suggested in my e-mail that the community could provide financial support, or at least, I'd be willing to help. There is a site archive on the wayback machine, but I've noticed some stories with the yes no content protection buttons appear to be missing. It is relatively recent however, from 7 Oct 2016, so might be useful for some of you potentially. This is a huge pity, because the site was still being updated all be it erratically, there are unique stories unavailable elsewhere, and the site was still attracting a good amount of traffic. Very sad indeed, and apart from politely e-mailing, there is nothing we can do.

****** People sometimes avoid communicating when they're upset with themselves for having neglected something. It's a very human sort of thing. For example, people will sometimes fail to respond to the most important email in their inbox, the one that they absolutely have to reply to, because they're afraid of messing up when they reply, and then as time passes they get more and more reluctant to confront it ("what if they're mad at me for not replying?") and become even more likely to avoid replying.

This sort of thing happens to everyone. Our species is pretty badly wired. Usually I think the best thing in such circumstances is to be understanding.

******* Indeed, my messages, all three of them, have been very polite and understanding. Nappa has usually responded within a couple days previously, and if this is a hardware failure, for example, it can't be helped. They've obviously been trying to recover data, hence the message displayed on the site, but it would be a massive loss to have all of these works simply disappear.

********** Just to let you all know, there is now a Portkey friends page created on Facebook, started by a former mod of the site, just in case any of you want to join. The mod is contacting Nappa as well, to ask about the site. I've had no further contact with him since his last request to e-meil over the link to this Reddit and another one. I imagined he may have posted something by now. Possibly life is just getting in the way.
