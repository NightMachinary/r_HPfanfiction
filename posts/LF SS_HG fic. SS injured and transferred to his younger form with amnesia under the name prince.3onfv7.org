--------------

Author had the word mistress in their name

Post war.

An attack on SS by a bitter LM leaves him injured and with no memory.

LM is very vicious and we see him kill GW and torture HG in flashbacks.

The staff/order give him some of their youth to turn him back into student aged.

He and HG bond over potions and renovate a green house together.

He begins to get his memories back and eventually ages rapidly.

Author has written multiple SS/HG fics.

Really annoying me I can't find it again, any help would be great!

Edit

Same author had a story post war where HG and SS worked in a potions shop together.

HG wore a tulip apron. She began having dreams with SS in them after he performed a spell he thought rigid make him dream of lily.
