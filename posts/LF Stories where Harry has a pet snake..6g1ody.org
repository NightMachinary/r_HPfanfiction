There were two REALLY AMAZING ones I read (neither of which I can remember the name of now, I've read way too many AUs) and I'm crossed between wanting to read more, and wanting to find those again. So let's split the difference.

Give me your favorite AUs where Harry has a pet snake, I'm sure I'll find old and new favorites alike :3


** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) Has a medium sized pet snake that was originally summoned against him. Her name is Inana and she likes to tell him that she is a queen of something (A country in Africa/South America?).

linkao3(A year like none other) Has a small pet snake that he often talks to.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** There's linkffn(8149841) He has Jormy. Fanfic is bit slashy later on. And Jormy isn't a major character or anything, just occasionally mentioned.

There's also the one where (several actually) where he has a pet Runespoor. I think one was Runespoor Shield or some such. But it's been awhile since I've read that one and I'm pretty sure I'm misspelling it when I look for it to link.
