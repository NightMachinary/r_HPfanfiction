Looking for fics where the Golden Trio are a threesome or are in some other polyamorous relationship. Strongly prefer mixed groups of witches and wizards. Ideally something where all or most of the Lightside Six (H/Hr/R/G/L/N) are involved. Not just a 'tangled pile of limbs' type of one-shot, hoping for something that shows the dynamic of a polyamorous relationship developing over time. Bonus points if it is part of an established coven or the main characters are in a coven with several others.
