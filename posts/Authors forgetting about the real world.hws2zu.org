Its happened in a few stories I've read but what I mean is that some things can only be understood if its written down. The one that comes to mind the most is it was a harry/fleur and a nickname that was used was flower but to make fun of her harry would call her flour now on paper alright makes sense but if you say it outloud with most accents its the same word. Any one else see things like this


** Big pet peeve of mine ( when j notice it )
