Looking for fics where Sirius was either never in Azkaban or was freed earlier in canon and raises Harry

Would rather have it be completed, can be as canon or AU as possible or anything in between.

Would rather it not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione just because I don't like the pairings, unless it's written well.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
