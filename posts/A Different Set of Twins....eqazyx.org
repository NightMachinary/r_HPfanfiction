In the spirit of inter-house unity, and Harry's dislike of the giggling and gossiping girls in his year, Harry and Ron take a different set of twins to the Yule Ball.

The Fifth year Carrow Twins were a handful. Hestia refused to allow her date to sit and mope, eager (though markedly cold and impassive) to remain in his arms and on the dancefloor. Only letting up when she saw Flora unable to coax her Gryffindor from the table and reluctantly lent her her partner. The other girls attitude the same.

They glared at anyone trying to cut in and sneak off with their man. They escorted him back and forth from the punch bowl and snack table. They slinked their arms around his and encouraged a slow, languid walk through the chilly, conjured garden. And they ended the night with a soft kiss to his cheek and a seemingly empathetic decree that the night had been "perfect".

All without cracking a single smile or portraying themselves as anything other than poised and pristine.

Despite himself, Harry wouldn't say the night was awful, though not one he was overly fond of when his sore feet finally made their way back to Gryffindor tower. The Carrow's were weird, and Harry was just glad that was over.

However, the emotionless twins not only vastly enjoyed themselves, but are in the market for a repeat. They would very much like to get to know their dance partner more intimately, and will not take a "No" or a petty house rivalry as reason not to pursue him.

*/Oh dear.../*

Harry genuinely believed his fourth year could not get any worse. Until...

/â–ªï¸Ž Rita Skeeter went missing./

/â–ªï¸Ž Bartimus Crouch Jr was outed as alive and impersonating Alastor Moody./

/â–ªï¸Ž The rat Pettigrew and the homunculus Voldemort were left in small boxes at the foot of his bed./

/â–ªï¸Ž The Ministry of Magic revealed Sirius Black was owed a proper court case for his alleged crimes./

/â–ªï¸Ž Professor Snape found himself unable to speak whenever something vile or derogatory came to mind./

And a very expectant pair of familiar young ladies impatiently asked the Boy Who Lived what else they had to do to get a second date...


** come and play with us harry forever and ever and ever

** I imagine Ron being against the relationship, but not in the usual bashing sense. Rather, he's freaked out by the twins' expressionless and emotionless faÃ§ade and is worried for Harry.

Harry though learns to roll with it. So when the twins bring him Pettigrew's head, Ron goes "see? they're insane!" while he's like "aww, how sweet, you shouldn't have".

*** "Look Ron, not every Slytherin is like Mal-"

"I bloody know that mate, I sit with Davis everytime you partner with Hermione. It's not cause they're Snakes!" Vehemence gave way to a sharp, pale look of discomfort and fear, "It's their eyes mate, I swear they don't blink."

"Ron-"

"Be honest, have you ever seen them smile? Have YOU ever seen them blink."

"Well Ron-"

"Are you sure they're even human, mate?"

"Ron!"

*** Bonus: Hermione IS super suspicious of them (especially after all they did to help) and does her own investigations trying to find a possible ulterior motive.

Ron recruits a VERY jealous Ginny to confirm or deny whether the two have souls.

Turns ou the Carrows are just following the advice of romantic novels but went a little overboard with their 'big romantic gesture'.

*** "I swear, it's like they don't have souls or something!" pleaded Ron.

"You know, they say the same thing about gingers" rejoindered Harry.

Maybe they could be related to the Addams Family?

*** Hestia and Flora are gently telling Harry and the assembled Weasley's about how they'd jokingly called Peter clever for severing his finger to make his death seem more convincing... before cutting off the rest of his fingers one by one.

Hermione and the Weasley's are appalled. Harry is surreptitiously peering through a catalogue for engagement rings whilst trying (and failing) to keep his breathing even and the scarlet blush off of his face.
