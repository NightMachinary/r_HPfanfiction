i thought of this idea where it could be set like 10 years in the future with a new mc that isn't a potter of weasley or malfoy or anything. maybe harry Ron and Hermione could be teachers. idk seems like a idea i havent heard anyone say before


** I have one idea cooking, barely sketching the outline. But it is like over 110 years after the battle of Hogwarts

*** That sounds really cool actually, I hope you go into a lot of Cyberpunk type stuff mixed with magic as it is in the far future even right now.

If you ever do post it please link it, I'd love to read it

** Haven't heard of anything like this.

It would be really fucking hard to write as-well. You'd have to not only figure out the world-building aspects of it (What has changed in Wizarding Britain in those 10 years), not only would you have to nail down the characterisations of the original cast, 10 years later but you also have to somehow figure out a plot. An antagonist, something that forces the plot to progress and the characters to evolve. All that while also creating new characters that aren't boring or walking cliches.
