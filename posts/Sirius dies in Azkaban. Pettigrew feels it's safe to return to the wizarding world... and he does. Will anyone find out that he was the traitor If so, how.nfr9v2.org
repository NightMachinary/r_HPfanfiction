This just popped into my head.


** He has the dark mark, I guess he can hide it. Well as soon as Voldemort comes back he won't be able to keep lying, he's too much of a coward to turn back on Voldemort. He might become a spy, but then Snape's true allegiance is Dumbledore so he's gonna tell about him anyway. If he had to chose between Snape and Pettigrew I think Voldemort would chose Snape ( a far more better wizard ). But then Voldemort really was paranoid so he might keep Pettigrew as a spy and no one would know about him...

Pettigree really had the ability to go abroad and live a normal life with no one ever finding out about him. Everyone thought him dead, I really don't understand why he stayed at the Weasleys.

*** Without Sirius as a threat, I doubt Pettigrew would turn back to Voldemort. He didn't for twelve years so why start now? The books heavily hint that by the time his first fall occurs, only the Lestranges and BCJ were still following him out of loyalty and not out of fear. Also there were plenty of people that had the Dark Mark and were never incriminated such as Snape, Lucius, Karkaroff, Macnair, Avery, etc. Which always made me wonder... would it have been practical for Voldemort to give Pettigrew the mark at a time when paranoia was at an all time high? Especially as he needed him as a spy in the Order. Also he doesn't seem to hold him in much regard throughout GoF unlike other people in his Inner Circle (he also doesn't give Fenrir the mark despite relying constantly on him). So I always sort of imagined he gave Pettigrew the mark while in homunculus form (he was still able to cast spells in that form) as a way to summon him if he was away.

** Imagine how it could change the books if Harry grew up with Pettigrew as an uncle-like figure. The only connection to his parents he has, Harry would idolise him.

He would be a key figure in the Order of the Phoenix. He would occasionally leak information to Voldemort and no-one would know who's doing it, sowing distrust. He's very manipulative so I imagine he would plant doubts in Harry's head about the leak being one of the other OOTP members- maybe Lupin, as he's the person most likely to guess Peter's identity as the spy. The reader wouldn't notice they're being manipulated either. We'd remember the war stories Peter told: “And we thought Lupin was the traitor! All those long absences, his growing allegiance to the werewolf band he was supposed to be infiltrating... but the traitor was Sirius, it seems. How silly we all were.” And the reader would think they were clever for guessing that the plot twist was there were /two/ traitors, Lupin and Sirius.

With Sirius dead, I think it would be Pettigrew's job to lure Harry to the Department of Mysteries. A lie about how the Order needs the ‘weapon' right now and how Harry is the only person who can get it. Pettigrew's explanation doesn't quite make sense- why now? Why is no-one else from the Order going with them? Harry is confused but never suspicious until he picks up the prophecy and Pettigrew says “Hand it to me. I can keep it safe” and the gleam in his eye is greedy. Harry finally puts the pieces together. Rather than losing his godfather in the DoM, he would lose his father figure to something worse than death- betrayal.

** I doubt anyone would know for quite some time.

When Voldemort returns he'd have no choice but to join him again.\\
This wouldn't reveal him, he'd return to bring a spy, and a very effective one, one that no other death eater knows, which is how it seemed to work the first time.\\
Everyone on both sides thinks Snape's a double agent, which is why no effort is made to conceal him.\\
But noone knew about Peter.

I imagine Peter wouldn't reveal his true colours until at least the fall of the ministry, and if the Order are still an active threat not even then.\\
And if not then he may well not show his true colours until the final battle.\\
As for what happens then, well he'll either be forced to fight alongside the other death eaters (by far the most likely, Voldemort is unlikely to let anyone sit that out) or try to avoid fighting at all.
