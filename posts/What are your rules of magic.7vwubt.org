Mine are pretty loose but you get out what you put in. If you use a neutral spell, it basically burns calories. If you use a dark spell, it uses your baser emotions to fuel it while muting higher emotions. As for transmutation, if Harry got a hold of the philospher's stone and tried to turn one pound of iron to gold, he'd get about 4 cents worth of gold since that's how much iron goes for.

** Mine is more Neil-Gaiman-esque, with a strong nod to Platonic philosophy. So you have the world of Matter, which is the everyday world. And there is a world of Form, which is the abstract ideas relating to material objects. So for instance, earth is made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen etc in the World of Matter, but also has many abstract ideas linked to it such as Steadfastness, Growth, etc. Wizards can manipulate the World of Form through power of will, which is then reflected within the World of Matter.

EDIT: Almost forgot!! The reason why I mentioned Neil Gaiman is because Narrative is paramount. The ideas knocking around in the World of Form coalesce into Narratives and other groupings. Powerful wizards, such as Dumbledore, have a feel for these underlying narratives in the world around them, which is why some of their decisions seem eccentric to those who can't feel the weave of the story.

** It's about imagination and concentration. The easier it is for you to imagine the effects of a spell, the easier it is for you to cast it. The better you are at concentrating, the longer you can hold the spell and the more spells you can cast. The smarter you are, the better you can get at imagining things and concentrating on making them/keeping them real.

That's why transfiguration is considered to be a highly intense and difficult field to master-the amount of sheer brain power you need to transfigure one object into another object scales with the difference between the two. That's why, despite being taught from first year onwards, transfiguration seems to have so few who can claim to have mastered the art.

That's also why Voldemort is so feared too-despite his obvious insanity (his stated goal is to rule the magical world, which is kind of like wanting to create a ranch for cat-herding without the easy and laid-back lifestyle such an occupation would afford), he still wipes the floor with the most powerful wizards and witches of his day.

It's my favourite explanation if I wish to impose limitations on wizards-they don't have magical cores, but they still court exhaustion by trying to do too much with magic. It taxes them, leaving them fatigued and weary if they indulge themselves for too long.

*** I loathe core stories. And magical exhaustion is just a crappy way of uptrying ot use dnd mechanics without using them.

I use calories because harry, while practicing the patronus charm, gets tired from the constant casting and concentration iirc. Since the human brain requires 20% of the daily input of calories at rest, i like the mechanic of young wizards needing high caloric foods.

I may use calorie dense shakes potentially combined with pepper up pitions in my current stories to refresh a wizard. While the pepper up is a cold curative, i also use it as a general pick me up with pepper up lattes being popular.

**** I generally skip the mechanics entirely. There is no need for a limiter in the first place, really, given that being able to cast 'anything you can imagine' is of little help to the unimaginative. Boredom, stress, frustration, confusion, concentration, anger and other emotions can physically and mentally tire you out even if all you do is sit on a couch all day, let alone when fighting or building or sneaking around. There really is no need to consider calorie consumption as part of that, especially since anything related to magical exhaustion would thereby translate into the witch or wizard developing refeeding syndrome because they cast too much magic and things such as chubbiness would be a muggle affliction the magicals have trouble understanding rather than something a few HP characters exhibit.

**** I choose to believe that magic itself is more of an ambient force or energy. Magical species, including humans, evolved the way they did because the world's magic affected them and their evolution. Wizards and witches can channel and wield magic to use spells. So you can't technically run out of magic, but where the ideas of skill in magic use or magical exhaustion is that the ability to channel magic is like another set of muscles for your body; it can be improved through conditioning, not everyone will be equal, and it can become exhausted and “sore” as well.

Best comparison I got is that it's kind of like Force users in Star Wars, but it taxes the body when you use it.

All rules about spell/casting/ would more or less stay the same as a result

***** I do use the ambient energy theory. I don't go deeply into it in stories yet but i often use the hypothesis that magic is a chaotic energy source akin to dark matter. The mages most capable of using it also show their own chaotic nature, such as dumbledore's eclectric dress sense or voldemort's madness. I usually call it orthogonal radiation from the muggle pov and akashic and/or octarine from the mage's pov.

** - Magic is only limited by your understanding of it. Knowledge, Intelligence, Wisdom and Creativity are the mix from which magical power arises.
- Spells work because people believe they work. The language and movements are technically arbitrary, but become important once they are propagated through what I would call magical hegemony - the establishing of a widely accepted and through magical elites (e.g. the Professors at Hogwarts) taught and shown forms of magic. Different cultures therefore have different forms of magic, which are ever changing through new influences and cultural shifts.
- Similarly magic works for the individual through belief first and foremost. Confidence in one's magical ability makes great effects possible in the first place. Low confidence hinders magic. Silent magic functions by being absolutely confident in your ability to cast a spell.
- Wandless magic is mostly dependent on the understanding and methods of magic in a culture. While Hogwarts students have an easy time with wands, they have to wrap their heads around foreign and new concepts in order to learn wandless magic. Uagadou students, on the other hand, have the exact opposite problem of having an easy time casting wandless spells, but a hard time working with a wand.
- Foci (such as wands) make casting not necessarily easier, but add a layer of precision to it that is otherwise impossible to achieve.
- Magic takes no more energy than it takes to think and make the movements required.
- Emotion based magic such as the Patronus or the Cruciatus, exchange confidence for more primal states of mind, such as happiness or hatred.
- As magic is mostly based in the state of mind of the caster, symbolic values/forces are more important for magic than physical values/forces.

I also want to add that I loathe any form of physical limitation to magic. Magic as a muscle, magic (in general) taking a toll on the body, or magical "cores" take magic down to a physical plane of understanding that I find to be utterly uninteresting and dull. The worst forms of such representations of magic are taken when these limitations are based on traits characters are born with, as it sets limits on what a character can achieve, no matter how hard they try, in a universe which always suggested to me as a child that anything is possible as long as you believe in yourself and have the will to see it through.

*** That's actually very similar to how I view magic, though I include stubborness/willpower into the equation.

To put it in other terms, in my headcanon, Magic is similar to a large, lazy river. For the most part, it simply goes with the flow. The vast majority of the European Wizarding world believes that magic requires foci? Well then, Magic is going to go with the flow and essentially declare that all European magic will require a focus.

Note that the above example can be avoided. If someone truly believes without a shadow of a doubt that they can cast spells without a wand, Magic goes with the flow; however, if the wizard has any doubts on the matter, Magic will go with the general consensus.

Just like large rivers can have very powerful undertows, there are some things that Magic is adamant about- namely the fact that it exists. That way, Magic's strength wasn't damaged after the implementation of the Statute of Secrecy. It simply started exerting itself in never before seen ways.

Leaves no physical trace. However, if you recall Half Blood Prince (I think it was) the Ministry was able to tell that the Riddles were killed via Killing Curse. It's not a question of "tell by the traces who did the magic" but a "tell that magic was done, and if you are really good, what kind of magic and (if possible) how to undo."

** We are surrounded by the spirits of the dead. They flit about, lingering near people who seem familiar to them or who entertain them. A strong and experienced sorcerer has dozens if not hundreds of these spirits following him around like groupies, waiting for something to do.

Wands allow us to give more clear and specific orders to the spirits, but they don't speak english and find it much easier to mimic something that exists than to create something never before seen.

They have the power to see forward and backward in time, so restoring something to its previous state is much simpler than remaking it.

One of the principle abilities of the spirit is to open holes to other places. The earliest form of this was to release fire. Later uses included Vanishing and apparation.

***** Yeah, it doesn't really work as a system. Basically any transfiguration/conjuration would be impossible because the energy required to create matter is far more than human caloric intake. Even a nuclear explosion takes less energy than creating a few kilograms of matter. Treating magic as energy is just a bad direction to go in with the HP magic system.

** The whole light/dark divide is politics, not magic itself. Magic itself is not sentient, it is something the caster does. Magical combat, unless we are talking about Dumbledore level here, boils down to throwing spells at someone more efficiently than the return fire. Which means that blasting and piercing curses, as well as magical lances (big ass laser beam), are the most effective weapon to wield. Yes, magic is awesome and I am reducing it to basically space blasters and energy shields, but why would anyone bother with transfiguration? The time you take to transfigure something can be used by your opponent to cast something more lethal.

  Congratulation, you turned that debris into a lion. You also took a blasting curse to the chest while your opponent can deal with the lion while you are dead.
#+end_quote

Mastering a spell takes repeated practice, the same way you do mindless repetitions to master anything (best way to get better at riding a bike is to just that for hours). During that process, you get better results, better casting speed and begin using only as much magic as the spell requires. Gradually you can drop wand motions and verbal casting that way.

**** What I mean is you often see authors making up stuff like "dark wizards cannot cast the Patronus" because the Patronus is a light spell. The Patronus is fueled by happiness. If it makes someone happy to oil up the rack and get the old thumbscrews out of the basement, then that would be just as effective as someone using the M/F/F/F foursome with three prostitutes or the last Christmas with his parents to fuel the spell in my stories.

At the same time, hating someone enough for the Unforgivables does not make the caster dark. You just need to wish someone dead and hate him. If random Death Eater 13 raped your fiancee, then you will definitly hate him enough to cast that spell. You will want to see the DE suffer for what he did/is doing. That does not make you dark. After all, you could simply use a levitation charm to drop a half-molten rod of iron on him. Or conjure a knife and stab him. Why would the one make you dark while the other does not? In both cases, you act with the intent to cause death and pain. Both times, it is perfectly justified self-defence.

Stuff like Horcruxes, Voodoo or Human Sacrifices are black magic, but 99% of what is commonly considered "dark" makes me simply roll my eyes.
