***** Got it. Here you go, a standardized pairing formula for harem fics:

 

Pairing = *HP + Σ(F - PD - DU)*, where the unit *HP* represent Harry Potter, *Σ* is the sum of the bracketed expression, *PD* is Petunia Dursley and *DU* is Dolores Umbridge.

****** Does that mean Bathilda Bagshot is also in the harem (since she is not one of the exceptions)?

Because that can be scarring to some readers.

******* Yes. The author is off course free to add restrictions like "no old folks" but it's up to them. If it can happen to Lily Potter, Minerva, Amelia Bones, Augusta Longbottom, Hedwig, etc it can happen to anyone...except Petunia or Dolores. I base that on the assumption that no amount of time travel or de-aging potion can produce a scenario where HP would pair with either character. That being said, there are anarchist writers out there looking to break the bounds of decency who may write a HP/DU, but lets hope for the best.

******** Yeah, I agree with your train of thoughts.

To be honest, I'd sooner pair anyone with a dementor than with either Petunia or Dolores, so the assumption of yours seems fair.

*********** The only ones I found don't actually qualify as a pairing. It was multiple fics with the reoccurring theme of "DU has her way with a less than willing HP during detention". So...it was not a fun time.

****** I feel like some kind of conditional would work better... Extended upper bound due to slower magical aging. ⨯ is the cross product e.g. A ⨯ {B,C} = {AB, AC}.

Pairing = HP ⨯ {F|16 ≤ age ≤ 65}
