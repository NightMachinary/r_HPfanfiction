- Draco/Harry is the OTP and I can prove it

- AO3 is a much better site than FFN

- Rowling's currency exchange rates actually do make sense <insert math here>

- Resurrexit is actually the best written fic in the fandom, despite what [[/u/ScottPress]] might tell you

- Luna was not just a misunderstood teen. She is certifiably insane.

- You should never write a chapter longer than 5k words, because...

- Deathly Hallows was the best book

** The Order of Phoenix was basically a personal guard for Harry and the prophecy that did nothing else useful towards the war effort in the second war. I state this because in our interactions with them in the books and movies, they are usually moving Harry from point a to point b, and hiding out in a hallway/Grimmauld place. We never actually see action on the part of the order unless the dork Lord and his death munchers start the fray ie the trap in the department of mysteries/Bill's wedding. They never proactively do anything to help the main targets of the war, muggleborns/light families/neutral familes. I think it would have been far more realistic and thought provoking to see them do more to help in that part of the war. Hell Neville does a better job pulling targets out of the Carrow siblings view than the order does with anything else including guarding Harry.\\
Yes I get that trying to talk the other beings out of joining him would have helped had it succeeded, but it didn't. But if it didn't work in the first war it sure as hell wouldn't happen in the second war.

*** The books are told from Harry's point of view. He doesn't know what the Order does when he's not actually there. When he's there the summer before 5th, he rarely sees any order members outside of Sirius and Molly other than on meeting nights/days, because they have jobs--regular jobs and things they are doing for the order. They're not all just hanging out in this one house in London. He goes to the Burrow before 6th year--he doesn't even get to see the order members/HQ. And before 7th is the same--he goes to the Burrow for the wedding, and the order members aren't mentioned as being around, and are likely busy doing actual work. Ofc Harry's interactions with them are them protecting him--from their POV, he's a little kid with a bunch of adults targeting him. Ofc they are going to be protecting him. They do plenty to proactively help, but given that we have an unreliable narrator, who can only speak from his own POV, we see little of that. Doesn't mean it isn't happening.

***** Okay, lets go through each point.

The purpose of the "seven potters" was to through off Voldemort. This was Snape/Dumbledore's idea, a way of ensuring the Voldy thinks Snape is reliable and has good info (the date) without giving away too much and letting Harry get through it.

They can't directly help him. Harry, Ron, and Hermione made the decision to essentially go off grid and do this on their own. They have bigger things to worry about--getting muggleborns and family, squibs, etc. out of Britain. The Weasley's were critical to this, as were other Order members--by staying in the Ministry, they know what is happening and can help.

I think the Trio's attempt to get the locket makes this glaringly obvious. Because they have no "in", no mole, they had no idea what they were walking into, what was actually happening in the courtrooms with muggleborns being tried for "stealing magic", etc. They were completely blindsided by a lot of what they saw...The Weasley's are the Order's eyes. People are so used to dismissing them as incompetent, poor "bloodtraitors" that they don't consider them a threat. And despite Voldemort being in charge, they still need normal ministry people to do the regular day to day work of keeping the government running.

From potterwatch, it's clear there is some level of outreach going on, even if it is Fred and George--who are part of the order now. Also, the Order has no clear organization remaining at this point, just a bunch of members trying their best to keep helping in the periphery. They can't be too obvious about what they're doing and get caught because they can do a lot more good just moving people away and keeping them safe, and out of sight. Also, keeping the Taboo in mind, and the ministry's ability to track magic AROUND an underage witch/wizard--how can the Weasley's leave? They can't really go into hiding with Ginny, who is still underage, because the Trace tracks magic around her, and would allow them to be found. The law mandates that all school age wizards MUST go to Hogwarts, so they can't just keep Ginny at home--Ron has to pretend to have spattergroit, an incredible contagious and dangerous wizarding illness to get out of going to Hogwarts. And, in a VOldemort run ministry, you can be sure that the rest of the family leaving or doing anything blatant would see them punishing Ginny, Arthur and Percy, the family members they have the easiest access to. If you recall, Ted Tonks is going around helping others on the run from Snatchers. Does that not sound like the Order doing something? The Ministery--DMLE, Aurors, Dementors, Misuse of muggle artifacts office, Underage magic office, etc.--are in charge of the wizarding world. I think people here/in fanon forget what that means because they assume that Fudge being incompetent means every last person--of which there are literally hundreds--in the Ministry is equally incompetent. The people who monitor underage magic will continue to do so. The Trace still exists. Muggleborns, halfbloods, purebloods, anyone underage can be tracked, and just not doing magic is not enough--they have avoid being AROUND magic being one as well (remember Dobby?).

What if the government, our government, were corrupt and after you and your pals. You have about 20 adults able to help you. Would you rather they run around with guns trying to help a few people here and there and be completely unaware of what the enemy (who has funds, resources, and many many poeple) are doing, or would you want one or two in different positions within the government to alert you to what is happening? How much good does it do to go in with guns blazing when the other side has guns too? Wouldn't it be better to be forewarned and just move that family out? And if they just moved the targets, would you hear about it? It's not exactly very exciting is it? "The Spinnets have decided to take a small vacation to France as of earlier last week, and were thus unable to be reached for a minor investigation." Also, would VOLDEMORT's ministry (remember the man hates admitting defeat or any failures of his own, but loves to punish them in others) admit they couldn't get to a target before they left? No, it makes them look weak. So how are Harry & Co. supposed to hear about this stuff?

Ron without any problems lived with Bill and Fleur in the house that was under Fidelius. But I agree that this line is more about Trio stupidity.

The most obvious way of help is getting more people. Go from 20 to 200. As you're saying the Order helped some people to leave the country, but did nothing to overpower Riddle and DEs and win the war.

********* Seriously, think about it. McG is at Hogwarts, as are other order members, as professors. Death Eater professors are also there--with a means of immediate contact with Voldy. Clearly, they can't do anything there. The Carrows and other DE's are also on the train and able to immediately contact Voldy. Again, nothing they can do. Okay, so when they go home for the holidays..except, the entire family would have to be snuck out without alerting any DEs to the plans. Which is great in theory, except, Floo, Apparition and Portkeys are tracked by the ministry, which Voldy and the DEs control. Okay, so broom...and muggle transportation. Brooms are clearly very VISIBLE, and expensive--not every family has a broom for each member. Okay, so Muggle transportation. Except, most wizards have no idea how to blend in with Muggles and little to no idea of how to travel like one. Forget that the Muggle world doesn't even know they exist, so the needed documents for leaving the country, at minimum--VISA, Passport, some form of ID--they don't have. So that's out too. Really, the only way to get people out is in groups of 2 and 3, with broom, under cover of dark, with some way of quickly abandoning ship and disappearing if DEs are alerted--so basically, it's extremely difficult.

And remember, Mad-Eye hated the plan, and was suspicious of Dung. However, he's not the head of the Order, and clearly was overruled.

*** I have to say that when I first started writing HP fic, I put it on AO3 because it was where my other fandoms were. What I've found is that you get different kind of community responses between FFNet. Our FFNet ones, with a couple of exceptions, are general comment responses 'i liked x' 'more please' 'this is cool' which is of course lovely in it's own right. You can thank people for that easier. However, by and large, on AO3, we get comments that go into the meta of the characters and the decision, questions out how we interpret the canon and the world building and we get into discussions in the comments. As such, AO3 FEELS more communal to me because we interact more with the readers and get into comment discussions.

*** /Back in the mid 90s being gay wasn't nearly as accepted as it is now./

Depends what you mean by accepted, and where. I'm in the US, not the UK, so things unfolded differently, but mid-90s had a lot of out gay people. Cosmopolitan cities, especially harbor cities where a mix of cultures already existed, tended to be more accepting. Rural areas, not so much. Northern England wouldn't have been a great place to be gay, I imagine. Manchester and Glasgow, ditto.

So yeah, there was overt and dangerous homophobia, but there was also a flourishing and increasingly accepted gay presence, including on the global artistic/musical stage. What didn't exist then were the nonbinary, genderqueer, and finely parsed versions of sexuality and identity that have their own vocabulary now. But then, any fic that uses jargon as part of its characterization ("Hi, I'm Pansy Parkinson, and I'm demisexual!") is instant back-button territory for me.

I will always take reading an abandoned fic that has fascinating worldbuilding, good prose, amazing dialogue and perfect character portrayals over an okay finished fic thats kind of bland.

But if it just ends in the middle of a story arc or something then I find it highly irritating because it's all build up and no payoff. To put it a little more crudely, it's all foreplay no climax. I'm not going to lose any sleep because there are stories that other people say are great that I'm never going to read.

As for incomplete sequels, it depends on if the first story interested me enough to read it. Once again if the first story leaves me at a big Cliffhanger and there's no resolution in the sequel, I don't really like to read those.

Interests change, real life happens, just because they wrote so many words doesn't mean they have the desire, time or even the skill to wrap up their story. They don't get paid for it and they don't owe their readers anything.

A lot of fics also tend to be not structured or written well. They end up 100k words into the fic while Harry is still in his first year and never get to a conclusion. Its easy to get stuck writing something that never actually progresses the plot line somewhere and just stop.

This even happens to professional authors. George R.R Martin got stuck writing game of thrones "a dance of dragons" book because his world building was so complicated that he couldn't find a way to converge story lines together. It took him years to figure it out. He also doesn't seem to have any desire to finish his books anytime soon so I doubt we will ever get the conclusion to those. And this is an author that wrote 1 million + words on this series already.

Ron Weasley was the most undeveloped of the trio. He never really found himself in the series or the later released info. He never finds anything he's passionate about or his own 'niche'. Even after the series is over, he either ends up riding someone else's coattails (an auror with Harry) or is riding his dead brothers borrowed dream (working at the joke shop).

Even Quidditch, the closest thing he has to something he's passionate about is more fully realized by his sister Ginny instead who becomes a professional Quidditch player.

*** He was somewhat lost in the fray after Book 6, but I think people read so much fanon they forget the absolute GOLD that is Ron's loyalty. Remember, Ron has family that can be hurt by his actions. His little sister--who all the Weasley brothers are protective of--is still at Hogwarts (in DH) and right under the Death Eaters' noses and within their purview. He canNOT afford to be seen with Harry and Hermione (whose parents are safely on the other side of the planet), because they will hurt his family (which the weasley's value more than anything). In addition to the stress of the Horcrux hunt, the Horcrux pulling at his mind and emotions, Ron has an additional stressor/worry--his family, and his very exposed little sister. He is of course worried about his older brothers too, Bill, who is a known Order member (Charlie is somewhat safer with the Dragons), Percy, in the midst of the ministry, amidst enemies, and likely feeding information to Order supporters/members and helping muggleborns, and Fred and George, who run potterwatch and are likely on the run with their friend Lee.

He's known to be great at Quidditch as a keeper--remember the game where he literally saves EVERYTHING? But it might be that he wants to settle into a stable job and support Hermione's ambitions, like an actual husband, you know? And I think the War would break anyone out of needing the spotlght or wanting it. He likely has more fame than he wants as one of the "Golden Trio" who saved the wizarding world. Maybe he really wanted to be an auror, or maybe he decided to help George with the shop so that he doesn't drown in his own grief and has someone, family, around to help and miss Fred with him? Ron, in the books, in canon, is a good friend, and I think Harry forgets to acknowledge or consider how much added pressure Ron is under BECAUSE he has a loving, close, family--Harry is too busy being jealous of it and wanting it to even try to understand what actually having a group of 8 other people that you love and would do just about anything for truly means. Again, the books are from Harry's POV.

This is the statement that I disagree with.

There are two definitions of character development:

1) The definition of character development refers to the process of creating a believable character in fiction by giving the character depth and personality.

2) The change in characterization of a Dynamic Character, who changes over the course of a narrative.

Rowling clearly succeeded in developing Ron as in interesting and vibrant character in the first case.

Rowling didn't grow his character much in terms of major character or personality change over time in the second case.

You are saying Rowling failed at Ron's character development in the second sense. I'd contend that she didn't fail because it seems to me that she intentionally didn't grow his character, which is fine.

There are plenty of characters and people in real life who don't change much or learn new things as they get older. That doesn't make them poorly written characters.

Trying to make up excuses and explanations for ill-thought out plot devices or tropes ("Adults are useless", House-Elf slavery, Abused Orphan Hero, Unbreakable Vow) just so they don't wreck internal consistency, the plot, or the setting is far, far inferior to simply changing or ignoring what part of canon doesn't fit your story.

Actually this brings up another issue, so it's interesting to raise it. It's /not/ that uncommon... in the US. It's pretty much incredibly uncommon outside of media and stories aimed exclusively at very young kids in the UK, where HP comes from and is set. So as a British person myself it's a really unfamiliar element that completely breaks my suspension of disbelief.

But I can completely understand to US readers it seeming just like another element that canon was oddly missing for some reason. It's just another way our cultures vary and some things don't translate, and we each don't realise because we assume certain things are universal.

For example the vast majority of US standup comedians' acts and personas are actively offputting to many in the UK, and it might well be the case vice versa as well.

Comedy that crosses a line, where, in the UK, the /crossing the line/ in and of itself would be the source of the humour, e.g. Frankie Boyle style. Like, the person crossing the line is shocking and a source of humour, but in the US, the comedian is encouraging you all to cross the line with them, that the line shouldn't even be there because it's silly, or something.

Not to say that the UK (for example) /isn't/ at all sexist, but it wouldn't be so blatantly brought up or used as a source of joke material in the way some US created-material will just go in with "haha it's funny because she's a woman so she must be stupid/useless/a whore" etc. I just can't imagine a joke like that flying on modern British TV, for example.

** First of all, I love the way you worded this, I actually laughed. Well done. I will also try to do my very best answering you.

HP Canon: Ginny Weasley is a garbage character. She's spiteful, mean, bad-tempered, and boring. Harry should never have ended up with her. Her most outstanding trait is a hex that is not even clearly defined, and her beauty. Her bad behavior and rudeness is never called out or reprimanded and she was shoe-horned in as a love interest. There's no believable relationship development between her and Harry, and there's no believability behind Harry falling for the “sporty, pretty girl.” Harry notably doesn't enjoy the attention he receives. Ginny is awful.

HP Fan Fiction: I wish I could say there was only one thing. I'll start with, FFS Snape is not Draco's godfather. Jesus, where does this BS come from? Even if Snape and Lucius were close in the series, which they aren't, it would've come long after Draco's birth. They barely attended Hogwarts together, being so far apart in years, and they were not born in the same socioeconomic ‘class.' Their only real “relationship” is through Voldemort, and the fact that Snape teaches Draco. Additionally “wards, “wolf mates,” “magical cores/signatures,” “soul bonds,” and “floo openings,” are not things. Hogwarts has /enchantments/ that project it. Those enchantments are not /keyed/ to people, they're just enchantments. JKR compares being a werewolf to being afflicted with HIV/AIDS, pretty sure that doesn't come with a soulmate or ‘bond.' Mr. Weasley mentions that he connected the Dursley's home to the floo network for the afternoon, not that he keyed it to a Weasley specific /signature./ Presumably, for that time, anyone who chose to floo there and knew the location would be capable. Like connecting a phone line, if you know the number, you can call. Magic cores are from something I've obviously never read/watched/played because Harry gets injured constantly and his “magical core” doesn't deplete like a fucking energy bar. /gagging motion/

HP Community: Dumbledore is not a manipulative bastard. Dumbledore is a man who can see the bigger picture, he's a man who has made mistakes and carries crippling guilt over it. He's a man trying to atone for his sins. He knew Harry wouldn't die if he let Voldemort kill him. He did play chess pieces, and he did use people, but (aside from Harry, arguably) he did not knowingly lead anyone to their death. He loved and trusted Harry and he gave him the only information he had. His time was short, and he made certain things the priority. Harry is not being fair by being upset he didn't know about Dumbledore's past. Obviously, it was tragic and Dumbledore could barely face it himself, it's unfair to expect him to share it with a child, even one he cares for. It's unfair to judge Harry for his anger either, IMO, Harry is a teenager, of course he's upset. He named his son Albus, because, again my opinion, he grows and changes and understands that there are certain things you don't want to share (because of shame, or whatever), that kids aren't ready for.

Also, for the Snape haters, I disagree with you too. Lol. This comment is long enough though.

As a side note: I adore this post and I am really hoping everyone on this sub answers, please answer. There are tons of fanfic authors and readers on here and your opinions are valid and helpful, please give them!

In GOF, she is away from home, and she is perfectly within her rights to want her own food/cuisine rather than something she doesn't like. In HPB onwards, she's away from her family, her culture, and in the midst of her fiancee's family, none of whom are doing anything to make her feel welcomed or at home. They call her Phlegm, and are generally resentful and distrustful. She fell in love with an English wizard and is choosing to stay in Britain, to get to know his family, to be part of his life, to let him continue to live in his home country--giving up all of this, in the face of the distrust and disgust many feel towards "half-breeds" and Veela, and yet they are so unkind to her.

**** Sorry about the wall of text, I'm on mobile, usually am honestly, and it doesn't look the same but I try.

As for Ginny, I think I've read the books upwards of 10 times, on the /very/ conservative side. This opinion is in no way based on Bonnie Wright or the movie portrayal. I blame neither of those things. I mention that because I want my opinion clear, I do not like the character, books/movies/parallel dimensions, whatever. I do recognize that Rowling intended this pairing from the start, and I'm sure her intentions were good, the same as her Hermione/Ron intentions were. However, even she admits that that particular pairing was based on a personal ending. I'm sure Harry/Ginny was as well. I say shoe-horned because Harry was an ‘honorable Weasley' until he married Ginny. Then he was an ‘actual Weasley' and I think JKR, along with a lot of fans, wanted that. That's not necessarily wrong, I just disagree. I may be overstating it with “spiteful and mean” but I don't recall Harry saying that Bellatrix was a ‘former beauty' while she was torturing Hermione. Even though it would be correct. When Ginny was terrible or frightening, she might as well have been a kitten smacking a Great Dane for all the consequences she suffered. She was almost always peripherally rewarded or commended for being mean. Additionally, even people that should hate her still talk about how pretty she is like she's some sort of siren or goddess. It's unrealistic and makes me want to gag.

***** I think you are overstating how mean she is, as you are ignoring all the times she is kind. I agree that she can be mean and a bit of a bully, but I think this makes her a flawed and well-rounded character. Ginny is shown to be jealous at times and immature. Fairly typical behavior for a teenage girl. While you might be right that she doesn't pay for her flaws, its different than saying we aren't supposed to see them as flaws. I mean, when Ginny gets jealous of Cho, I'm pretty sure the reader is supposed to view her as a bit jealous and petty.

But Ginny also has a lot of great moments, like her bravery in fighting, comforting that girl as Harry walks past her, and being loyal to Harry when he needs it and putting him in his place when he needs that.

Also, while I'm not necessarily excusing all her actions (well maybe I am), most of her mean moments are a reaction to something. Fleur treats Ginny like a little girl, which is Ginny's biggest pet peeve. So of course she won't like her. Zacharias Smith is shown in canon to be an ass, so is it really surprising that maybe he pestered Ginny for info in an insulting way before she hexed him? And while she went over the line with Ron after he caught her kissing Dean, he did imply she was being a slut.

Finally, despite how one might feel about Ginny, she absolutely works well with Harry. They share interests, a sense of humor (very big point), a noble streak, and a shared dark experience. Ginny can reach Harry like no other character and she represents a life after the war. And so what if he has a firmer connection to the Weasleys through her. Getting along with your in laws is an important reason why a couple work well.

I think perhaps Rowling did go a bit overboard in making Ginny too perfect for Harry (she was sort of the "Cool Girl" trope). But I think Ginny gets a bad wrap as a character and as Harry's love interest.

****** I disagree. I don't think I'm overstating how mean she is. Ginny is the first person in the series to make fun of Luna, she often hexes people who annoy her, she snaps at people all of the time, at one point I think she tells Hermione ‘don't act like you care about quidditch, you'll embarrass yourself.' That's incredibly mean, Hermione is Harry's best friend, she cares about him and that's why she's worried about him with the potions book. When Ginny behaves in these horrible ways her character is admired or rewarded instead of admonished or recognized as out of line. There is no retribution for her bad behavior.

She is more than jealous and immature, she is small and loves Harry Potter the idea more than the man. The only reason she stops acting like a fan girl with Harry is because Hermione tells her to. She spends her entire teen years trying to win him over, which is more fan girl behavior. This speaks to her inability to truly understand him as you describe. If she truly understood him she wouldn't appear to enjoy his fame so much.

She does have great moments, and they're uncomfortable and put in in an attempt to force the audience to like her. The same way every death eater, Slytherin, student at hogwarts, etc, is meant to suddenly think she's this unstoppably beautiful goddess, who can play quidditch, throw every hex perfectly, laugh with the boys, etc, etc, etc. I think Harry deserves a real character. I don't see Ginny as real, she's a bully on her worst day and a Mary Sue on her best. I'm glad people do like her though and I understand your feelings, I just find her frustrating and shallow.

******* How many hexes did she actually throw at people who annoyed her? Does she snap all the time? You're correct about her comment towards Luna but she does change and defends her a year later. I think Ginny shows some of the greatest growth of any character, though unfortunately it's mostly off-page.

I firmly disagree with this notion that she never gets over her fan girl phase. First, a lot of her crush is actually more about Harry himself than the boy-who-lived stuff. She is excited to meet him, as is practically everybody in the wizarding world. But after she saves his life, her crush is more about Harry himself. But she absolutely grows out of that. In Goblet of Fire, when Ron and Harry are laughing about Neville (I think), it's Ginny who chides them both. She gives Harry the business in OOTP and frequently talks to him as a friend throughout the series from GoF on. She dates other boys to move on and not keep pining after him. I don't see how from at least Year 3 on, she tries to win him over. Please provide examples of that. Yes, she always liked him (and why not?). But a fangirl would not act like Ginny does. And remind me where she enjoys his fame in the book. Even in book 2 she seems to understand he doesn't want any fame and tries to protect him.

I agree it probably would've been better if Ginny was maybe given detention once in a while for some of her stunts, but I think that's a relatively minor issue. It doesn't bother me whether she gets punished for her flaws if the reader clearly sees them as such.

Finally, I think we simply have a different interpretation of the fight with Hermione. I think Ginny when she is defending herself or someone she loves can get vicious, as we see here. But remember the context. Harry is feeling awful and Hermione is just making it worse, since she needs Harry to know that she was right all along. Of course Hermione cares about Harry, but in this moment, it really doesn't seem that she is trying to be supportive. Ginny correctly assesses the situation and sees that Harry doesn't need a nag; he feels bad enough on his own. He needs someone to have his back, which Hermione arguably has not done that year. So she sticks up for Harry, perhaps going a bit over the line in doing so. This scene says a lot about Ginny, both good and bad. Most importantly, it shows her understanding of Harry and why she is a good match for him.

I mean, I do understand the perception that Rowling just turned her into this perfect character for Harry. She didn't /need/ to include the scene where even the Slytherins talk about how pretty she is. She did enough to suggest Ginny was pretty as it. So I get that. And she's awesome at Quidditch and really funny etc etc. And this all sort of happens in the 6th book. But people do forgot that Rowling does show Ginny negatively in the books too. So it's odd to hear people complain about Ginny being awful one second and then going on about how she's made to be perfect the next. I personally feel that if the reader can easily identify flaws in a character, just because she isn't called out on those flaws doesn't mean they don't exist or she's a Mary Sue.

*** "Wards" is a common fantasy term for "permanent magical protections", predating Harry Potter by decades. And that you should be able to protect your home in a way that lets you and your family/visitors enter without letting others in is pretty much self-evident, or people would steal from other wizard homes all the time. If you can't restrict your floo connection, things would fall apart unless you're fond of the stupid "no one ever thought of abusing that" trope.

Dumbledore isn't a tragic character. He's a plot device who acts and remains inactive in the exact way the plot needs him to so Harry can be the hero and the book's plot will be resolved at the end of the school year, and not before. Like every other adult, he is useless for the most parts of the early books so kids can have important adventures.

The likely origin of the godfather Snape thing is Narcissa asking Snape to Vow to protect Draco in HBP.

Also, I get the hate for magical cores and soul bonds, but what's wrong with wards? Wards are, in many fantasy series, simply protective enchantments.

Also, Dumbledore is manipulative in canon. He alone decided the life Harry would live up until and even after he entered Hogwarts, knowing beforehand (as per HBP) that he was condemning him to "ten dark years". He conveniently gave Harry the invisibility cloak, telling him to "make good use of it" and later said that he didn't care if scores of other people died so long as he kept Harry alive (though, apparently, "being alive" was as far as he was willing to manipulate Harry's circumstances). Now, we can debate the relative justification for those actions (and no, I don't think they were ill intentioned), but there is no argument supporting the idea that it wasn't a huge case of manipulation.

Wards are not a thing in Harry Potter. Wherever else they exist and whatever they are within those universes, they can stay there. I find them to be a lazy way for the author to just explain anything away. In the established universe, enchantments must be explained, anti-disapparition jinx, fidelis charm, anti-muggle charm, saying they're ‘wards' is a lazy way to make them do whatever you want without explanation.

You're right, I should've phrased that better. I should say, despite his manipulations, I don't think Dumbledore is an uncaring asshole. He may manipulate events but it's not his fault the prophecy was overheard. Harry's sentence was final on the day he received his scar, it's down to Dumbledore's manipulations that he's alive at all. And I do think he cares about Harry, whether or not he uses him doesn't mean he didn't love him.

***** How is the idea of wards lazy? Nearly all the time it's simply a term used to refer to what canon calls "protective enchantments", persistent defensive spells applied over a location. It's just easier to write, so I don't see any laziness, calling them wards doesn't even explain anything about them.

What I mean about Dumbledore is that he did literally the bare minimum where Harry's housing and well-being were concerned, and knew beforehand that he'd be in a dark place for more than a decade. And there was at least one other option, one that Dumbledore suggested before so we can't say the idea was unreasonable: Have someone cast Fidelius and make Dumbledore the secret keeper. The Fidelius didn't fail, they just picked someone untrustworthy.

This is more a commentary on where I think the story logic broke down. We start off with Harry being in an abusive home, placed there at Dumbledore's discretion. So later explanations couldn't do much more than say "Well you survived right?", which makes it pretty much impossible to put Dumbledore in a good light. It's not like he couldn't have checked in from time to time (2 flavors of Apparition or Portkeys). And since we aren't told of any threats getting stopped by the bond of blood magic before Hogwarts (Voldemort mentions he wouldn't be able to breach it in GoF), it's hard to completely accept that there was literaly no other option.

No. A location can have a fidelius charm, it can have an anti-disapparition jinx, it can have a muggle-repelling charm, it doesn't just have ‘wards,' in whatever vague, never-to-be-defined way the author wants to lazily throw on it.

In Dumbledore's letter to the Dursley's he asks them to raise him as their own and that's what he expected them to do. You're right that when he realizes they aren't, he could've found another way to protect him. Up until the point that Dumbledore takes Harry to the Dursley's, his blood connection to Lily's family had been the /only/ thing to successfully keep Harry safe, it's not unreasonable for Dumbledore to want to exploit that for Harry's safety. He also tells McGonagall that he's better off in the muggle world, the Dursley's are conveniently muggles. Leaving him with the Dursley's was a mistake, but I don't think one mistake makes him an ass. I think with or without Dumbledore's choices, Harry's life was never going to be easy and you can't lay all of the blame for that at Dumbledore's feet. Like I said, that sentence was final when he survived the first killing curse. The best that anyone can arguably do for Harry is keep him alive. He was always going to be hunted and suffer attempts on his life. Dumbledore definitely could've done more, but his failure doesn't mean he doesn't care about Harry or that he sees Harry as a disposable tool for his cause the way a lot of the fandom likes to paint him. It just makes him flawed, like al good characters.

This is what confuses me. Maybe I'm reading the wrong storiew, but I never see the notion that there's just this "ward" thing, but that there are wards, specific spells cast to stop the things you mentioned. Anti-Apparition wards, for instance. It's literally, usually, just a renaming of canon's "protective enchantments", which could easily be deemed vague under your criticism.

Come on, that's extremely silly. "Hey.people whose moral character I know nothing about. Take him and treat him good". But it's actually worse than that since in HBP he said he knew the Dursleys weren't good beforehand (hence the knowing he would have "ten dark years" comment). That's a pretty massive mistake, or rather purposeful action. It's much worse than being an ass, in nearly any court in the developed world that would probably make one an accessory to child abuse, or at the very least make most people disgusted at that person. My issue really comes to a head when we realize Dumbledore can teleport there (even disguised or invisible if needed) to check up on him occasionally. He picked nearly the worst possible option. A child with some arrogance is preferable to one getting abused for over a decade, I would think. (This is a bit off topic now i suppose, as I already said I thought Dumbledore wasn't ill intentioned, even if he was knowingly negligent).

I've tossed around the idea of magic being a force that doesn't reside within the bodies of the wizard but in the environment, with the limiter being the witch or wizard's efficiency at channeling such an energy. Manipulating too much of this ambient energy for ones skill level would obviously exhaust you, but it honestly seems like the same principle with a different skin slapped over it.

Is your problem with trying to explain magic in general or the concept of a 'magical core' not making sense?

**** My headcanon is that magic is a skill like any other, some people are just naturally more talented then others. However, wizards still need to go to school to perform it, so hard work and intelligence can make up for a lack of natural talent.

Overall, I think magic is a function of technical wand skill and understanding. Great wizards such as Dumbledore and Voldemort are very intelligent and have a great magical intuition - a deeper understanding of magic- which allows them to perform powerful magic.

Magical cores are a lazy way out and it makes magical power feel unearned. If Harry has a magical core of over 9000 and is naturally able to stomp everyone that's boring and lazy.

***** I like to think of the core/power vs skill debate in terms of wood and gunpowder. Wood has far more energy per pound than gunpowder does, but gunpowder can explosively release all its energy at once. Big Core = wood = massive reserve of energy. High skill = gunpowder = explosive and controlled release of energy.

Cores would thus be a function of biology (or whatever counts as biology in regards to magic) and/or endurance training, while actual potency - skill - is a function of one's magical education. They're not mutually exclusive.

And even the most arbitrary magical systems can always be quantified. Assuming you have people even the slightest bit curious about it, it inevitably will be quantified, at least in relative terms (i.e. "I can cast that fire spell for twice as long as you before exhaustion. I probably have twice the magical stamina.").

***** Appropriated First Nations culture, just to be clear, to adapt real world legends into the greater canon on Pottermore, right? It's all part of making it seem like the stories we hear are the leftover hearsay after the statute of secrecy, right?? The same has been done with Vodun, animism, mysticism of all sorts of types - /especially/ in fanfic, and people usually love it. You can think it insensitive, but calling her a shitty person for it is over the top. And let's face it, she was in a difficult position if she wanted to expand her lore to North America: either ignore First Nations culture, and get bashed for it, or include it, and get bashed for it. Please explain how you would have been inclusivist in your approach and how it would have been much better than what she did.

Knowing that nobody is a saint or perfect, how do you think this balances out with her objectively paying for the closing of orphanages and other institutions, taking thousands upon thousands of children out of hellhole environments to grow up in and placing them with host families? Is that something someone shitty would do? She has transformed their lives for the better.

Not only that, but she's paid for the advocates and lawyers who make sure that the practice of institutionalisation of children - something that has been researched as being undeniably bad for their development and can cause serious harm in the furure - is being combatted not only through charitable work, but legally. I work in this domain in Romania and I could not call the work Lumos does as shitty. They've had a tremendous impact, and have one of the most noble and important goals in child protection. It's insanely important stuff. And yes, I know she doesn't pay for all of it and people donate like they would to anything else.

This, along with "Dumbledore was gay" and "there's at least one Jewish student at Hogwarts", is an attempt to inject more diversity into the series than actually exists there. It's not an invalid reading of the text, but the text does nothing to support it. It's a hollow, hypocritical gesture toward representation, trying to gather both the people who would be afraid of representation and the people who are asking for it.

I believe it's the Percy Jackson series where the author started out in the same boat as Rowling, but made representation explicit later on. That's a compromise position that actually contains representation.

The story is absolutely littered with grammatical mistakes and/or typos. The author doesn't even attempt to make anything resembling consistency with either HP, ME, or reality as we know it.

The characters are puppets on strings that have no autonomy or motives, just fulfilling whatever role the author needs at the moment to accomplish whatever is necessary to show how cool and geth-like Harry is.

The tags aren't as useful as everybody pretends they are, and because of the mass of smut on the site it can be very hard to find anything worth reading when you go through them. For example, the tag "slytherin hermione granger" brings nothing to the table that you won't have already read on ffnet, especially using scryer. Or it's probably a HP/DM lemon with hermione as a useless side character.

People forget they were kids, and he was clueless about the world around him. It's only Hermione's bookish nature that meant she knew more about certain things or could find solutions. He was by all accounts a pretty traumatized, supershy boy who wasn't used to the attention he received, had forced himself to underperform so as not to draw attention to himself. I don't think protego and experliarimus are the only jinxes her learnt (there is a famous sectusempra once!) but I think he tended to stick to what he was good at.

Hermione should never have ended up with Ron Weasley.

They're a terrible match in every regards; have no hobbies in common; actively resent and hurt each other a lot; they seem to have only been paired because they fight / bicker constantly; and Rowling literally admitted that the only reason why they ended up a couple was because of her own "wish fulfillment". Rowling herself even expressed doubts over the relationship in the Wonderland interview, and it's strongly implied this is because she wrote it at a time in her life when she was still pining over her unhealthy relationship with her ex-husband.

In short, Hermione needed to end up with someone - anyone - who not only was a much better match for her, but at least shared some of her personality traits and interests. Ron briefly mentions Hermione "liking Cedric Diggory because he's handsome" in /Goblet of Fire/, but obviously, Cedric /died/, so...not exactly condusive to writing a canon-compliant fic.

I personally 'ship her with young Tom Riddle, which I've written several, long essays as to why. The tl;dnr of it is that I feel like, out of all of the /Harry Potter/ characters Hermione could've ended up with (including Harry himself), based on Hermione's book character, she'd be most attracted to Tom in-theory. (If he weren't a meglomaniacal Dark Lord, that is.) They actually share a /lot/ in common, in personality, background, and interests / hobbies, and...well, it's canon that Hermione actually copied at least one of Tom's tactics, as she admits openly to Harry in /Order of the Phoenix/. *

#+end_quote

Rowling has also written entire essays all but indirectly showing how she has compassion for Tom and his character, by delving into her horrific realization of what orphanages are /really/ like (and the negative effects they have on children) when doing "research trips". Specifically, when she visited orphanages to research for Tom's backstory in /Half-Blood Prince/.

You can read the full context and scope of Rowling's views [[https://www.quora.com/Was-Voldemort-a-psychopath-He-was-self-preserving-7-horcruxes-self-centred-He-killed-without-batting-an-eyelid-He-couldnt-love/answer/Amber-Goldsmith][here]] and [[https://www.quora.com/Is-Tom-Riddles-childhood-behaviour-personality-From-Harry-Potter-a-realistic-representation-of-how-a-future-psychopathic-acts-like/answer/Amber-Goldsmith][here]].

Also, from her essays and articles, it's quite clear that Rowling is very passionate about defending (and helping) the "child victims" of orphanages, Tom included. As Rowling has stated that Hermione is based off of herself many times, her reaction is basically the equivalent of how Hermione would react as well.

He not only doesn't love, he doesn't even want it. I personally feel compassion for Tom. His life is sad and he never had a real chance. Dumbledore himself feels compassion for Tom as well, and encourages Harry to try to do the same. That doesn't change what he became and by the time he dies his soul is so broken and shredded, finding love couldn't save him.

I actually agree with you on the latter half of your view, that Tom was "too far gone" by the time Harry tried to get him to feel remorse. He'd been far beyond the point of no return for decades. That's actually why I like the idea of young Tom Riddle and Hermione fostering a relationship: because I feel, quite strongly, that Hermione would try her best to help Tom become a better person. She would try everything in her power to get him to make different choices, and to not become the monster that he ultimately did.

I also feel like Tom would be, well...kind of an asshole to Hermione, at first. Yet Hermione is nothing, if not completely stubborn and iron-willed in her determination. I think he'd warm up to her eventually, simply based on her sheer persistance of presence, just like Harry and Ron did in PS/SS.

Their backgrounds are nothing alike, she's thoroughly middle-class with a cushty childhood whereas he's brought up in an working class orphanage during the war.

What interests do they have in common? Her only interests seem to be wanting to study, fighting for equality and boys. The only thing I could possibly think is that Riddle was a genius and Hermione likes to study?

*** Ron is the only human character is the series. Hermione is thoroughly unlikable and irritating. She is arrogant and stubborn while Ron is stubborn but relaxed. Hermione is driven Ron wants to enjoy life, Hermione grates on people and never showed the ability to make friends outside of those that saved her life from a troll. Ron has shown that when he needs he can make other friends to spend time with. The point is they're both flawed people but together as a couple they make one functioning person. Hermione keeps Ron on track and Ron keeps Hermione from burning out and puts out the fires she starts. Over the series we see Ron grow and accept playing second fiddle to Harry, he wouldn't mind being the less talented person in the relationship.

In conclusion they are two parts of a whole and so long as they appreciate what the other brings they are stronger together and all that mushy suit. That and alone their negative traits would hold them back in a professional environment.

** I've probably forgot some, but let's go with this.

- AO3 actually is a better site than FFN.

- Cursed Child is canon.

- While I wouldn't say that Luna is "certifiably insane", her father clearly is and she has actual problems and should have got help.

- Accusations of seeking fame aside, Snape's criticism of Harry is spot on.

- Hermione is an incredible hipocrite, and feels a need to always be right even when she clearly isn't.

- Hagrid is a menace and should never been given any position at Hogwarts.

- It's basically confirmed that Daphne is a blood supremacist.

- Charlus and Dorea weren't supposed to be Harry's grandparents.

- It's incredible how many fanfiction authors fail to comprehend children novels.

- It's also incredible how often changed elements in fics end up being more simplistic than the base children novels.

- Fanfiction shouldn't be held to lower standards than published literature.

- Rowling's plotting in the original series is terrible.

- Constantly recommending your own fics is in incredibly bad taste.

The "Writings by JK Rowling" are as the name suggests written by JK Rowling. JK Rowling is both a creator and an owner of the Harry Potter universe. Thus what she writes about Potterverse is canon. And obviously, later works trump earlier in matters of continuity.

Every regard.

Seriously.

Now, this isn't anywhere close to a perfect metric, or even a mostly reliable metric, but a statistician named Ben Blatt wrote a book called Nabokov's Favorite Word Is Mauve wherein he used statistical analysis to see if there were any patterns that could be detected that were correlated with good writing.

[[https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2017/03/31/521836700/nabokovs-favorite-word-is-mauve-crunches-the-literary-numbers]]

[[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/one-writer-used-statistics-reveal-secrets-what-makes-great-writing-180962515/]]

Stephen King famously admonishes excessive use of adverbs. It turns out that he uses about 105 of them per 10,000 words. Ernest Hemingway and Mark Twain used about 80 per 10,000, JK Rowling uses about 140, and EL James (the 50 Shades author) uses about 155.

#+begin_quote
  When Blatt combined several lists of the "Great Books" of the 20th century, he came up with 37 which were generally considered great. When comparing these to the same authors' other novels, the "Great Books" used significantly fewer adverbs. Of these authors' books that kept to a strict adverb rate (less than 50 per 10,000 words) 67% were considered "Great," whereas only 16% of their adverb-loaded books (containing more than 150 per 10,000 words) were ever considered "Great."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  In fact, there is a trend that authors like Hemingway, Morrison and Steinbeck, their best books, the ones that are held up and have the most attention on them now, are the books with the fewest amount of --ly adverbs. Also, if you compare amateur fiction writing and online writing that's unedited with bestsellers and Pulitzer Prize winners of recent times, there is a discrepancy, where less --ly adverbs are used by the published authors. I am not so one-sided that I think you can just take out the --ly adverbs from an okay book and it becomes a great book. That's obviously not how it works. But there is something to the fact that writers who are writing in a very direct manner do produce books that overall live the longest.
#+end_quote

Like I said, this one particular metric isn't definitive, but there's definitely a correlation.

HPMOR turns out to be on the upper end of that scale, at somewhere between 165 and 175 adverbs per 10,000 words (idk if Blatt included "only" and "really" and if not then that drops it significantly, down into the 150s).

Limpieza de Sangre, by [[/u/TE7][u/TE7]], who so adamantly insists HPMOR is poorly written, has about 260 adverbs per 10,000 words (though that drops down a bit to 235/10,000 if you remove "only" and "really").

The Unforgiving Minute, on this subreddit's "must reads" list in the wiki, is at 190/10,000 (176 if no "only" or "really").

Cauterize, widely and wildly recommended on this sub, is at 249/10,000, or 212/10,000 if no "only" or "really."

Back to [[/u/TE7][u/TE7]], they said "It is not clear from reading it if the author is even aware of such things as fragments or run-ons or has any real understanding of tense and agreement." Limpieza de Sangre's first chapter is positively littered with exactly the types of errors they falsely accuse HPMOR of.

#+begin_quote
  "I would prefer to not look like a rat," her tone was completely impassive.

  "She used nonverbal magic for every spell she'd used so far."
#+end_quote

And tons of fragments.

It's hard to quantify exactly what makes something "well-written," but you can certainly point to a long list of things that make something not "well-written." Summaries instead of scenes, dialogue that doesn't move the plot forward, excessive detail and description that doesn't move the plot forward and isn't particularly relevant to anything, scenes (or summaries if it's one of those) that don't move the plot forward, bad grasp of causality --

Like

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Instead of

#+begin_quote

-- using dialogue tags to tell emotions instead of actions/expressions to show emotions, excessive and unnecessary action where every character furrows their brow or twiddles their fingers every line, filtering (Bo felt a sinking feeling instead of Bo's stomach sank, or Bo saw the dragon flying instead of The dragon flew), repetitive sentence structure, word repetition, weak action --

Like

#+begin_quote
  Scrambling for higher ground, Bo grasped his gun.
#+end_quote

Instead of

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Almost every fic recommended by almost every person who denigrates the writing quality of HPMOR is guilty of making several of the errors listed here, whereas HPMOR is not. The most well-grounded criticisms are of the pacing (even though the author specifically points out in the author's notes that the pacing is purposefully written as being more like a serial of some sort, like a TV show) and of the didactic nature of some of the dialogue and prose (even though it isn't as substantial as some detractors make it out to be, and even though that's more a matter of taste than it is a technical/mechanical error).

So, in what regard is it not well-written? What technical/mechanical mistakes does it make? I can't show you an example of it not having run-on sentences or not having misalignment in verb tense agreement because it isn't possible to prove a negative, so if you want to claim that HPMOR isn't well-written because it makes technical/mechanical mistakes then the burden is on you to provide (legitimate) examples of those mistakes/errors.

**** I don't give much of a damn about writing quality, but on the metric of what fanfic did I learn the most from and changed the way I think, HPMOR is ludicrously off the scale. It is in the category with real books. HPMOR isn't written to be a fanfiction. It uses the world of Harry Potter (which provides a set cast that everyone is familiar with) to explore the question of how to analyze a world that can't be guaranteed to follow any existing rules you know.

This may not be what many people who read other HP fanfics are looking for so many people will go away unhappy. However, there is a concentrated audience (who don't necessarily read other HP fanfics) who really enjoy it. Look no further than the fact that [[/r/HPfanfiction]] has 18k subscribers discussing the whole fandom while [[/r/HPMOR]] has 10k subscribers about one fic.

******* Just some thoughts:

#+begin_quote
  ...he wondered if the Sorting Hat was genuinely conscious in the sense of being aware of its own awareness, and if so, whether it was satisfied with only getting to talk to eleven-year-olds once per year. Its song had implied so: Oh, I'm the Sorting Hat and I'm okay, I sleep all year and I work one day..
#+end_quote

Author is equivocating consciousness with self-consciousness. This is a common layman's misconception. Nothing necessarily wrong with this, but for somebody that knows the distinction, it's slightly annoying.

I do like the idea of contemplating how The Sorting Hat, an animated object, experiences consciousness. It's an interesting idea.

  What?

  "I seem to have become self-aware."
#+end_quote

The fact that The Sorting Hat used the pronoun "I" in the opening paragraph seems to conflict with it becoming self-aware for the first time here.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote
  If you're placed on the head of anyone who so much as thinks about the question of whether the Sorting Hat is aware of its own awareness -
#+end_quote

The author has doubled and tripled down hard on their (incorrect) usage of the term consciousness in this chapter, riffing it on repeatedly. I can excuse a minor passing mistake, but if you're going to really make a point of a complex concept such as consciousness, you should at least do a minimum of due diligence to ensure you're using the term correctly.

#+begin_quote
  But the vast majority of eleven-year-olds who arrive at Hogwarts haven't read Godel, Escher, Bach.
#+end_quote

If the author has read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach][Gödel, Escher, Bach]] and even the barest contemporary work on the subject, then they should be well versed enough to know the distinction between consciousness and self-consciousness.

For the love of Merlin, must you pull this sort of thing on everyone and everything that you meet up to and including items of clothing -"
#+end_quote

I like the interplay between narration and dialogue. Also, the hat is supposed to have Harry's vocabulary, so its using words like "Merlin" is inconsistent.

Ok, I've finished about half the chapter, enough I think to form an initial opinion.

The writing is good. Certainly unique in form. For that alone, I can see why it would be attractive to people. There are frequent problems with consistency in terms of usage of italics, proper nouns, punctuation. Minor issues with word usage, but nothing major.

There are a lot of things I like, some of the ideas are thought provoking. Stylistically, I like the interplay between Harry and The Sorting Hat.

The author goes out of his way to show how incredibly smart Harry is, which is annoying. It makes my dislike Harry, but that's not necessarily a problem with the writing. It's a design choice.

My biggest issue with this chapter, one that may not carry into other chapters, is the author's misuse of the word consciousness, equating it to self-consciousness. It seems like a simple mistake, and it is. I'd easily forgive it if it weren't such an important part of the chapter, and it wasn't shoved into the readers face over and over again. Seems like lazy writing to me. I'd have done some more research into the subject to check my facts before making such a point of it, especially if I were writing a fic in which my main character is supposed to know a lot on the topic.

Altogether, it's good. Perhaps /great/ if you really like the style. Based on the first half of the 10th chapter of HPMOR, it's probably not among the best fics ever written, but I can now see why somebody might think it is. I'll continue to withhold absolute judgement until I read a larger portion of the story.

Regardless, I'm /not/ an expert in this area, so as an expert, please explain 1) why self-awareness is required for consciousness, 2) there isn't any such implication 3) "consciousness" is a valid substitute or short-hand for self-consciousness in this case.

No, that's pretty egregious pedantry. Using it every other line becomes ridiculous, but there's a middle ground between never doing it and ridiculous booksaidism. It's much like "no adverb between /to/ and the verb" --- a good rule of thumb, but not a hard law by any means.

As for the discussion of the amount of adverb, I've seen it pointed out that the /canon books/ have an extremely large number of adverbs in dialogue too (Stephen King is quoted with something to the effect of "Madam Rowling never met an adverb that she did not like"), and it works quite well.

  Minato Arisato has never been normal. When he awakens to the power of Persona and joins SEES, he learns that he possesses the power of the Wild Card, access to the Velvet Room, and a second god watching over him. Includes new social links from other SMT games. Includes 'short' PQ story at 157X; knowledge of the main story is not required to enjoy it, but it does help a lot.

*** No way! If I'm reading real literature I can't read all of my super edgy "Harry Potter" stories where he's a genius who needs to escape the manipulative machinations of an "Old Man" in order protect his group of female friends (and Neville) */cough/* harem */cough/* while he enacts a super secret but unstoppable plan to kill Lord Dudders all while amazing his peers and teachers come to appreciate how much bigger his di---magical core is compared to Malfoy, Dumbledore, and Lord Dudders!

This is the kind of stuff I live for, and you can't find this stuff in "real" literature.

*** Reading fanfiction has never stopped me from reading literature, poetry, fantasy and scifi, fairy tales and folk lore, some British mysteries, monographs on art and certain eras of architecture, the history of silent film, the debate around Richard III - with the occasional children's book (like HP) thrown in.

So don't worry. If someone likes to read, believe me, they'll find a way to cram their interests in, no matter how little time they may have.
