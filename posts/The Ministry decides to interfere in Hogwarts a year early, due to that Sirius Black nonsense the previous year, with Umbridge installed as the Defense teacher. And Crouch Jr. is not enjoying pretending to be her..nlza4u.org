** In the end of the year Manopulative!Dumbledore (or Snape, or Moody, or whatever) obliviates Crouch Jr of his death eater memories, convinces him that he is a spy and sends him to pretend being Umbridge in the Ministry. Meanwhile they keep Umbridge in the chest

*** As a twist, Umbridge gets sent /back/ to Hogwarts again for fifth year (the first repeat professor), and Crouch Jr. keeps playing along on all sides, while the Twins joke that the reason she avoided the "supposed" curse is because didn't teach. The real trick is Umbridge in fact didn't teach, and still hasn't die to being in the chest.

** Crouch looked at himself in the mirror, well, /herself/ as he is an ugly toad now. "Just great" muttered Crouch, adjusting his /pink/ sleeves as the Dark Mark tingled a little. "I work my arse off for him and this is how he repays me..."

**** Crouch looked at the ugly-fetus-from-hell form of voldemort and contemplated wheter doing what he was about to do was worth the painful death he would receive.

"Yes, he did this to me, it is only fair if I return the favour..." thought Crouch with a smile, which looked more like a grimace. After Peter Pettigrew managed to brew the potion despite his horrible potioneering skills, Voldemort emerged, looking ready to kill Potter, /In a hot pink dress that looked very similar to Umbridge, including the wig and horrible make up that toad used/

    BREAKING NEWS!!!
#+end_example

The Boy-Who-Lived has (Ironically) died! The cause of his death remains un-known even though there were no marks on his body and there were no traces of any dark magic or the imfamous Avada-Kedavra spell!

Anyway, here is the breaking news! Severus Snape and Tom Riddle, A.K.A Lord Voldemort or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named have been voted as sexiest men alive!
