For Christ's sake, people have been putting Voldemort and Bellatrix through 'adaptational heroism'! Why aren't Umbridge and Filch ever given the same treatment? Is it because they are canonically described as ugly?

I can understand Umbridge -- a different type of evil, but why not Filch?


** To be honest, I think that the fact that both Tom Riddle and Bellatrix Lestrange were described as hot (at least in the past) play a big role into why they get such a goot treatment. "I fucked the MC and now I'm good" and "The Dark Side is sexy" are both pretty common tropes for these characters after all.

But I think that another reason is that neither Umbridge nor Filch really bring anything else to the table. If you take back the "Evilness" from Bellatrix, you still have a very talented witch who also happen to be beautifull and part of the Black Familly. If you take back the evilness from Umbridge you have . . . a middle aged/ bit old lady who really like cats?

Being awfull play such a big part with this character that any attempt of making them better would probably give you an OC with their name. So why not just create an OC and keep them for the comic and/or drama value?

When you look at her character and consider the fact that she most likely blackmailed, killed, and bribed her way into that position?

If you take away her evilness, she has no explainable way to have that position; thus becoming a non-entity.

The whole thing reminds me of those Marauders-era time travels where Professor Harry tells James to not pick on Snape. And then Snape or Sirius OR Remus end up with Lily instead.

** I actually /have/ seen fanfics where Umbridge was the good guy. Filch is mostly inconsequential and a gag character, so gets very little attention.. But since you mentioned him, I'm going to have to repost a prompt I posted elsewhere three years ago.

** I read one fic where Harry is sent to another dimension's past (after the Dementor's attack on OotP) and Filch is a better, if still bitter, person.

(Also, when he and Harry meet, people think Harry is a squib.)

But Umbridge only gets a cameo and she's still garbage.

This story is amazing in a lot of ways, too.
