** The reason you haven't seen any around is probably because ffn had a huge purge a couple of years back and got rid of most, if not all, of them. You're not really missing out on much tbh, they could be a fun way to kill time if you wanted something easy and with no stakes, but a lot of the time the character's commentary was just really really bad and lots of them ended up abandoned.

Quite a few did get saved on fictionhunt, so if you're still interested I did a quick google search and found this one [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/6635139/2]] I have no idea if the quality is any good but it might be a place to start you off! If you find that you don't particularly like it, you'll probably be able to easily find more by searching fictionhunt harry potter reading the books on google (I'm not particularly familiar with the fictionhunt website so I'm not entirely sure if it would just be easier or not to search on there) and I'm sure there's been a couple of people on here recently asking for these types of fics so you should be able to find some by searching on here.

** You don't see them because they were purged. Apparently, copy-pasting the entirety of a published novel into your fic and writing stuff around it is frowned upon.

Go look for "Under a Watchful Eye". It got around the copyright issue by not actually including the text from the books.

** Not /exactly/ what you're looking for, but I recall a H/Hr fic in which Rose is Harrys daughter and the backstory is that the Wizarding World is real and Rowling wrote the books based on material from interviews with Hermione. Hermione reading the books to Rose as bedtime stories and commenting on bits here and there then serves as a framing device for the fic itself.

I can't recall the title just now, but maybe someone else might be of assistance there.

** There's a Percy Jackson/Harry Potter crossover (Don't judge me!) where they both read each other's books, but I can't for the life of me remember the name!

*** I think it was called Demigod and Wizard's Memories.
