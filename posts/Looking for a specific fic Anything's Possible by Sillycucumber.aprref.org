I honestly tried to find it but couldn't. Help?


** The story link (which is gone) is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2689413/1/Anything-s-Possible]]

It appears to be in the archive and therefore can be downloaded at [[http://ff2ebook.com]] (just paste the link in as normal and don't select to Force Update)

Don't know how old the version is there, but that's what I found.

** I didn't know they took it down! That sucks. I may have a saved copy if you need it. I'll take a look. Did that ff2ebook site work?

Edit: oh man, for some reason I don't have it! I do have While You Were Sleeping and Getting to Know You though, if anyone is looking for those.
