  Ghouls are relatively harmless creatures who live on spiders and moths

It's the year 1997. 5 spider eggs' worth of baby spiders have hatched, intent on invading the burrow and destroying the quality of life of one Ron Weasley. Can the ghoul fend off such a powerful invading force? Will Ron Weasley be haunted forevermore by 1997? Find out in this fanfic, coming out this summer.
