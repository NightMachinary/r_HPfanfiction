** Hermione/Severus is the only pairing I ever really read... A lot of it sucks now, but back when I started reading it it was still pretty unknown.

The appeal, to me, is that Hermione and Severus are the only two characters I can think of that value their intelligence as a major part of themselves. I've always felt like she could do much better than Ron, and that she'd settle if she stayed with him- they're great as friends, but I feel like they'd fight a LOT over how to run a household and raise children.

Hermione and Severus, though, I can easily see them bonding over academics, or about a distrust of authority (by the end of the books, she questioned a lot more than originally, and I feel as though seeing how easily the Ministry could turn against people like her could certainly help there). She wouldn't be the first muggleborn friend of Potter with good grades to catch his eye...

Now, 95% of the time, I read stories based after graduation, or even five-ten years after graduation. I figure the age doesn't really matter much if you're living to 150 anyway; only an 18 year difference...

.

I've read a few very good Draco/Harry fics as well, but it's so rare to find them (due to the popularity) that I rarely try. For that, it's just the fact that I like the whole "getting over being enemies" thing, and Draco's always struck me as a bit of a ponce. But I'm mostly SSHG, so I dunno.

** I ship most of those you listed and although I'm not that eloquent I'll try and explain the appeal I find in them. (I can't speak for other people.)

- *Harry/Draco:* This one's pretty simple - it's the whole thin line between love and hate thing, enemies becoming lovers. It's about Draco changing and throwing off the Death Eater In Training stuff and being a better person. (Or, occasionally, about Harry turning dark.) This pairing was helped by HBP when Harry was pretty obsessed with Draco and it's easy to make that obsession about love rather than hate. I think this is a good pairing for the lighter fics, coming of age stories, discovering and learning about themselves and each other. (But that's not to say they can't do dark fics just as well; H/D is my OTP of the HP fandom, so I will read anything about them.)

- *Harry/Snape:* Age difference, for one. I enjoy that. But the big thing for me about this pairing is seeing Snape as someone that helps Harry. With this pairing I like fics that portray Harry as struggling with himself, with abusive Dursleys, with guilt of the people who died in the war, and then have Snape as the one to help him come to terms with it because as a spy and someone who's killed and dealt with the darkness inside himself, he knows how to help Harry. Also with this pairing I like the idea of dark, self-destructive, unhealthy relationships.

- *Harry/Riddle:* I only recently discovered a liking for this ship, but it's all about the power imbalance and the darkness. I like controlling Riddle being deceptively kind to Harry, treating him with all the love and affection that one should give a lover, and yet at the same time he's still very much Riddle, in that he's still a cold, dark person, /but/ Harry knows this and it's that undercurrent of darkness and power that makes him so attracted to Riddle. I will admit most of what I've read with this pairing is smut. (I don't ship Harry/Voldemort but admit the distinction is mostly aesthetic; the only instance in which I can ship H/V is violent non-con, because I absolutely cannot see Voldemort doing anything else, even in pretence.)

- *Harry/Lucius:* Once again, age difference kink. I've only actually read one fic with this pairing, but I intend to find more when I'm done with writing my own fic. I'm not entirely sure how to explain why I like it, really. I think as with Riddle, there's a possibility for Lucius drawing Harry to the dark side and Harry being attracted by it. On the other hand, there's the opposite of Harry drawing Lucius to the light side, but the author doing it in a way that Lucius doesn't lose any of what makes him /him/.

- *Hermione/Snape:* For me, this is very much an intellectual pairing. We all know Hermione's clever but I always saw Snape as very intelligent as well and I like seeing them being intelligent together. Hermione's tough and wouldn't put up with Snape's bullshit, and I think that would make her attractive to Snape.

I've only ever read one Draco/Hermione. While I'm not against the pairing (I'm an avid multishipper; there's very few pairings in this fandom that I'm against) it's not one I actively seek out. I suppose most of the appeal in it is probably similiar to what I said about Harry/Draco, only with a het pairing. As for Hermione/Remus, I've never read any with that pairing and again, it's not one I would actively seek out. I really couldn't say what the appeal in it might be.

*** With the Harry/Snape pairings, usually it's to go against Dumbledore. Especially when they write from the perspective that Dumbledore is evil or has other motives for Harry and that Snape's love for Lily and his inability to save her, transforms into protecting Harry from whatever plans Dumbledore has for him.

I think my problem is that I firmly see Harry as straight, and thus I cannot imagine him as at all gay (though I suppose I could see him Bi in the right circumstance)

Thank you very much for the intelligent response, it gives me something to think about instead of rejecting a story based only on pairing... if I see a "no slash" in the description I will give these a try.

Yaoi-Slash just isn't my thing I guess. Are you male or female? And do you think most Male Slash writers are female or bi/gay themselves?

**** I'm female and queer. I do think the vast majority of slash writers are female, with a good number of (male or female) slash writers being queer. Fanfiction is a good opportunity to give more attention to queer relationships and make up for the lack of them in mainstream media. Then of course there are those who simply fetishize gay pairings. I'm pretty sure there are people who've written extensive essays on the reason for why there's so much slash fanfiction, which can probably be found with a google search if you were interested.

** The relationships you mentioned that you can understand were all heterosexual, and several of the ones you said you did not get were slash -- I think this is clearly a pretty big factor. Slash is not for everyone, obviously, and if it's not for you then it makes sense you would have a hard time understanding its appeal! There's nothing wrong with that. I like slash, so I like most of the pairings you asked about. I also like fics that deal with power imbalances and age differences, so that's another reason I like several of the pairings you put, like Harry/Snape. That said, I also read plenty of het and canon pairings; truly the most important thing for me is the quality of the writing. I'll read almost any ship.

Edit: Had a few more stray thoughts, just about how strangely personal and particular people are when it comes to things that attract them. Hermione is one of my favorite characters, if not my actual favorite, in the series -- and yet for some reason I hardly ever enjoy reading fics with Hermione in the ship, whether it be R/Hr, H/Hr, D/Hr, or any other big ones. Also I personally do not understand the appeal of harems or threesomes whatsoever. Sexuality is a funny thing.

Edit2: Clearly this is an interesting topic to me, because I keep thinking of more things to say. About the relative popularity of slash in the fandom -- I may be wrong, but I have always assumed that the majority of people who read and write fanfiction are girls and women, most of them attracted to men. Now, it may not be as nearly universal as among straight men, but many straight women are turned on by the thought of two men together, just like so many straight men think lesbians are hot. So it makes perfect sense that slash pairings would be popular, if my assumptions about the ratio of men to women in the fandom are true.

** The way I explain my love of certain pairings (in this fandom and others), is usually about the quality of the fic I read.

If the relationship is canon, often (but obviously not always) the fanfiction archives are flooded with fic that isn't original at all. The dialogue or plot too closely resembles the source material to the point of straight up copying, or on the other side of the spectrum, the characters are completely OOC so I have no connection to them anymore.

If a relationship is not canon (which most same sex pairings are by default, unfortunately), there's so much more room for the author to play with the characters and the world and come up with something that has their own style and fun, but still makes me long for more of the original material.

Even with so called crack pairings, the fun is in finding a way to make those characters work together in a way that makes sense with the already established character traits. It's very bad when it fails, but when it works, it's magic.

** Re: Dr/Hr

A lot of people here are talking about the idea of S/Hr working because they both value intelligence. Something that seems to be a generally accepted idea in HPff is that Draco is very intelligent; there is the idea that he comes 2nd only to Hermione, and/or that he is the Hermione of Slytherin. Within this there can be a subplot that Lucius berates Draco for coming behind a mudblood, and this keeps Hermione constantly on Draco's mind, and this obsession can over time turn into infatuation which turns into lust/love/etc.

A second reason that it makes so much sense to me is the redemption. What a better end to the dichotomy that is Draco than for him to fall for the Gryffindor Princess?

Ron/Hermione always sat wrong with me, early on in the saga I hoped that Hermione would get over Ron, even if I didn't know who she would then fall for. He is not intelligent, or graceful, or observant, or ANYTHING that Hermione should be with. While I am in no way saying that JKR is not wonderful, I just think R/Hr was a huge miss. When I found fan fiction about 2 years ago, (through tumblr o/c lol), it just resounded so strongly with me, the different veins of Dramione.

I suppose it's quite romantic, in the end. The ultimate bad boy turns good for the girl, although I like to think that Draco wasn't all bad, only the product of a bad environment and less than stellar home life (not his parents, so much, as Voldy/followers). While I could go either way with Lucius, I really feel that Narcissa was good, and only following her husband because in the pureblood realm, it's a lot like, say, 1700's England where marriages are slightly arranged and to disagree with your husband is to face consequences such as losing your inheritance/allowance/dowry etc. Draco never had the positive influence of the light, of people who were not pureblood, that Hermione just completely changes his way of thinking--she shows him that what he has been taught his entire life is wrong, and wrong in a big way. Think of someone who has been heavily practicing Catholicism their entire life, goes off to school and meets this athiest/agnostic/Buddhist/Muslim who just completely upends the other person's idea of what that type of person is like from their religious education.

There's also the post DH AU where Hr/D go back to school and are made Head boy/girl, or similar stories/different timelines. The confinement of quartering together, fighting all the time, being forced to work together...can we say sexual tension? Perhaps you are not a fighter, but for someone like D/Hr (or me ha!) who enjoys fighting, you parlay that into some sort of sexual outlet, and when you continually argue with the same person you parlay that sexual outlet into that person. Think enemies who end up being lovers; the kids on the playground who pick fights because they have those "icky feelings" for a boy! or a girl!

Re: Hr/Remus

Honestly the only time I've seen this is as complete smut with very thinly veiled storylines. There are 2 ideas; the complete animalism of Remus being able to transform and unleash that beasty side in sex; and the other side being that something like Tonks dies, and Hermione becomes an almost replacement because of their similar temperaments.

I think a lot of Hermione/anyone is Hermione being so much wiser and mature than others her age, so her ability to mentally and conversationally be on a higher level makes her feasible as a love interest for older men.

And I'd also echo what someone else has said; it does seem that you don't understand the non-heterosexual stuff, which is probably just indicative of your own personal preference and not your inability to understand the ships.

*** Because I like Harry/Pansy or Daphne or Tracy, I can see the appeal of Hr/Draco. In fact I have read several stories where Dr/Hr is a secondary pairing and I really enjoyed it. I suppose my main issue is when this is the primary reason for the story.

But that is my personal bias, because I read HPFF for Harry and focusing on another character, especially one like Draco or Severus, doesn't appeal.

I agree that Remus/Hr is usually about Teacher/Student smut...unless it is way after Hogwarts.

** SilverCookieDust basically covered it.

Just a note about Dramione: It is, like you said, very similar to the Love/Hate relationship of Harry/Draco, but I would also add in that most of the Dramione I've read and enjoyed have made the two intellectual equals as well, varying in book and street smarts, but ultimately equal.

Also, some of it is Ron-hate, because nothing shows more hatred for a character than to make them suffer a James and Severus narrative.

Most of the older guy/Hermione (Snape, Remus, Sirius, etc.) pairings bank on her intellectualism and how her maturity far outstrips many of her peers. Also, on her proclivity to be passionate while clothed can give a writer the impression that she would either be A) Very shy or B) Very sensual in bed.

*** I can totally agree...as a secondary pairing I would almost rather Hermione redeem Draco than see her with Ron. About the only girl I'll pair Ron with in my writing long term, is Lav, Luna, Millie in that order. Mostly because those girls seem to have a much more compatible personality for him. Lav because she would be a great stay-at-home mum who loves everything about him. Luna because they have known each other (as neighbors) for possibly their whole lives, and Luna can be written to completely "get" him, or be patient enough to change him. Millie because so little is known about her other than her less than stellar looks (people tend to make her a female Goyle). I can see her being lovely except for her looks (and even her looks are just not that bad, so what if she's stocky and tomboyish). Milicent could redeem Ron from his idiotic house bias, and Ron could end up with a wonderful girl who other guys never looked at twice.

I think you mentioned that you understood a Hermione/Neville pairing in your OP; yeah, not a big fan of that one. I love Neville on his own and have read fantastic fics from his point-of-view, but that one never made much sense to me.

*** Vanilla - a good vanilla stands well on its own, with enough subtle flavor and richness that it doesn't require adjustment. Bad vanilla is a halfway decent platform for candy

Chocolate - more reliable than vanilla, it's the red wine to vanilla's white; the worst don't get quite so bad, but the best can't achieve the sublime subtlety of the finest vanilla.

Mint Chocolate Chip - the cold of ice cream enhanced with the fresh-flavoring of peppermint. With the chocolate enhancement it might keep away the little Dementors

Peanut Butter - Never seen pure peanut butter ice cream, but peanut butter cup is the best bribe for a pregnant wife- mine, at least

Coffee - it's not like it has caffeine, so this is really just for people that need to tamp back the sweet flavors with a bit of bitter. Works better with oreos, as it doesn't pretend to be a frozen cappuccino.

Orange Sherbert - How to trick the lactose intolerant; tell them you'll get sherbet and then offer this. The contrast of sweet cream and sweet-tart orange has an appeal , particularly on hot sticky days where you don't really want to make your mouth feel creamy

Cherry - premium replacement for the old-tyme strawberry standard combo of fruit + frozen cream. Cherries don't have as abrasive a feel when hard-frozen as strawberries.

** There are certain characters that I feel are interesting and dynamic to read. Any sort of pairing with the following: Harry, Hermione, Severus and Draco. They are interesting to read. We never get enough about all of them, and as for Harry, there are so many what-ifs, so much you can do with him just by changing one thing.

I'll read one story where Severus is Harrys dad, then another where they are together.

I find Hermione/Draco and Hermione/Severus has that "beauty and the beast" appeal. Looking past a persons flaws and scruffy outside and helping them become a better person. Also, Hermione is semi-similar to Lily (from what we can tell) so, yeah.

I love Ginny in canon, but I rarely find a fic where she shines. There is just not quite enough known about her to really build on it properly. It all seems repetitive.

I also noticed you are not a fan of slash. I know for me, I'm not purposely trying to read slash, but I find a lot of those fics have a great shipset.

I'll also read Hermione/Sirius, Hermione/Remus, and Albus Severus/Scorpius (or Rose/Scorpius).

Sometimes I'll read non ships. I tend to find most harem fics are just hardcore lime. That isnt what I am reading them for. Yes, if done properly, lemon and lime can add to a story, but if I wanted to read smut, I would.

Also [[/u/SilverCookieDust]] made a great list. I agree with it.

** Well, my favorite HP pairing has been Harry/Tom Riddle for a while now, and not being into any sort of age kink seems to give me a different perspective here. I think there are a lot of reasons I came to like the pairing, one of them being a more Slytherin Harry, another being a great love for AUs. I was also always fascinated with the prophecy and the link between the two of them, as well as the soul magic that seems to be at play. While I love the story JK gave us I felt like it could have been a lot more interesting when it came to those things. In conjunction with this, the concept of a soul bond that tends to come along with these stories really appeals to the K/S shipper in me.

The stories I tend to like with this pairing generally involve shenanigans with time. Sixth year Harry ends up in Riddle's sixth year or vice versa, do-over fics, that sort of thing. If involving Tom after he starts splitting up his soul, I tend to like it when stories involve fixing it to some degree, as he usually ends up a bit less nuts afterwards. I enjoy the power play between the two but I like for them to start on more equal footing than a more conforming to canon story can usually allow.

I also tend towards liking stories with a Harry who thinks for himself. This can mean a generally more independent Harry or a dark one, though obviously fics with this pairing tend towards the latter more than the former.

When it comes to the other pairings you've listed, I've enjoyed stories involving some of them, but I generally don't look for them myself. I love stories about Harry and Snape but if I'm looking for that I'm much more partial to relations of a platonic nature. Mentor fics, Severitus, adoption, that sort of thing. I'll read the occasional slash fic if it seems interesting. I like Harry/Draco and am a little more likely to look for it than Severus/Harry, but not by much. Severus/Hermione isn't something I search for but I did read a really god fic once.

For me, HP pairings tend to break down into categories of 'stuff I've enjoyed before', 'stuff I haven't read anything good for', and 'Harry/Ginny'. I would call the last one 'stuff I avoid if the story doesn't catch my interest otherwise', but I realized there was only one pairing that really fit in there. I'd be happy to explain why if anyone is interested in hearing, but it isn't really related to the original question at all.

** Hermione/Severus has always made sense to me. There is the intelligence thing obviously. I don't think Ron could ever satisfy that aspect of her personality and it is a big aspect. Another reason this ship usually works out is because Snape was actually a (mostly)good guy the entire time, and Hermione is always the character who saw the other side of whatever Harry and Ron were believing in at the time. She is the most open-minded. Also, she is generally considered mature for her age. And from Snape's perspective, she would be one of the few people who would stand up to him, argue with him, AND be able to prove him wrong once in a while, so that would be the appeal from his end. Also, he's not Alan Rickman-old like most people imagine.
