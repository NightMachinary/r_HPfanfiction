** "Yeh don' know...yeh don' know..." Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.

"Yeh don' know what yeh are?" he said finally.

Minerva McGonagall suddenly found her voice.

"Stop!" she commanded. "Stop right there, Mr. Hagrid! His mind is still confused from the anti-muggle wards, he won't understand you!"

A braver woman than Professor McGonagall would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave her; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage and sorrow.

"I shouldn't tell him? Never tell him what he did for us? For all of us? I was there! I saw him save us, McGonagall! An' you want to keep it from him?!"

"Kept what from me?" said Harry eagerly.

"STOP! I FORBID YOU!" yelled Minerva McGonagall in panic.

Hermione gave a gasp of horror.

"Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh," said Hagrid, sadly. "Harry--yer a wizard."
