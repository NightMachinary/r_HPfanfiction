Or: a universe in which Ageing Potions tell you ùò¶ùòπùò¢ùò§ùòµùò≠ùò∫ what you will look like.


** "Why aren't you changing, Hermione?" Ron asked in the middle of his transformation.

Harry nodded. "Are you sure you made the potion properly?" He asked.

Hermione glared at him." Of course I did, Harry! I went over each instruction thrice! I even plucked the bogswallop directly from a - " she stopped abruptly and stared at her two friends. Her eyes widened in horror and her lips parted in a vague, relaxing distress. Her hands started to tremble; the sight in front of her was horrendous.

Harry and Ron's transformation was complete and they looked like death warmed over in their 18 year old bodies. They were both covered in a multitude of scars, many still fresh and bleeding. Ron's left eye was squashed, so much that Hermione knew that he wouldn't be able to use the eye again even with the aid of magic.

Harry's left arm was bent in an odd angle and bruises were littered all across the exposed skin. His eyes had lost that mischievous glow that Hermione had grown used to, and was replaced with cold, flat and expressionless pupils. His eyes spoke of pain, of suffering and of a grim resolve.

But Harry's look was nothing compared to what was etched across Ron's face. If looks could kill, it would have been a massacre at Hogwarts. Hermione had never ever imagined that such rage and rightful anger existed, and seeing it on the face of her best friend who she secretly was in love with was heartbreaking.

Harry and Ron had rightfully interpreted Hermione's initially expression and were inspecting each other. A venomous silence filled the air for what felt like eternity.

And as soon as it had begun, it ended. The two boys reverted to their original, 16 year old bodies. It was a far cry from what Hermione had seen before, in a positive way.

"What does this mean, Hermione?" Harry asked silently, though Hermione knew such a thing was impossible. How could someone speak silently? The concept was absurd. But that was the best and probably only way to describe Harry's tone. Silent. Deadly. Fearful.

"I... I... " Words failed Hermione Granger for the first time in her life.

"The potion is supposed to transform us into /exactly/ how we will look in the future, right?" Ron asked. If it were a different circumstance, Hermione would have been impressed with Ron's smartness.

"Yes" she said.

"So that means... Sometime in the future, we'll end up like this?" Harry asked

"Yes" her voice trembled. She vaguely registered that tears were streaming down her cheeks and falling on the stone floor of the abandoned classroom.

Silence embraced them yet again. But this time, it was different. It was tense.

"Hermione didn't transform. What does that mean" Ron asked. His voice was as emotionless, or more, than Snape's face had ever been.

And the reality hit her like a herd of elephants, crashing into her as if she had been in the middle of a rampage. It felt like millions of gallons of water had suddenly been dumped on her. The tense silence seemed to have solidified and was crushing her from all sides. She felt it difficult to breath.

"I died" the voice which left her mouth was unrecognisable. In fact, she would have sworn that it wasn't hers if it hadn't been for the fact that she was the one that had spoken.

She felt two pairs of arms engulf her. Both of the arms were gripping at her and held her tightly as if she was their tether to this world, and not gravity. Perhaps she was.

Ron and Harry were sobbing. Harry kept saying "No, No" over and over again. Ron was hysterical. She didn't know what to do, or how to react. All three of them sunk to the hard, cold stone floor. It felt like an eternity before the sound of the sobs reduced to slight gasps here and there. In another few moments, the sounds ceased entirely. The two boys had fallen asleep, still clutching Hermione tightly. Not knowing what else to do, she too rested here head on the stone wall and fell asleep.

Her fate was sealed. All her hopes and dreams were crushed. But she would deal with the bitter truth tomorrow. For now, she was content with the present. She slept, unaware of the slow acting poison coursing through her body.

Hope you liked it. Sorry for the abrupt ending, had a dearth of free time.

What sets them apart is that one had friends, true, loyal friends, and the other did not. The story of a cold and calculating Harry. Slytherin!Harry. Grey!Harry. OC is the son of Sirius. No slash

**** How long will she live? My theory is a few years, until the day this battle takes place or another theory; she dies before then but those who attack take the credit.

Why slow acting? To avoid being caught. That way nobody knows who was responsible and if the plan is to use it as a distraction in the right moment (shortly before a fight to take your opponent off their game) it gives you a fighting advantage.

Also, why Hermione? If the target is Harry, it could be assumed that he is only as good as he is by the help of Hermione. She is the smartest in the class, everyone knows that. She is one of his best friends. It could even be mistakenly assumed they are closer in a relationship type of way, without it being known that Ron and Hermione like each other on this story.

Either way, if Harry is the mark, target his strongest ally. Kill her, use poison to make it slow and go unnoticed.

Another theory, women's choice of killing is poison, it's not usually a man's method. It would also be hard for someone she is suspicious of to get close enough to her to poison a drink or gift her something edible that she would accept. So, does this mean someone close enough was turned, or always has been? Maybe, maybe not. It could also have been a man who used the poison but that seems unlikely because they wouldn't have bothered using slow acting poison, since it would be almost automatically assumed to be a woman who did it because the method was poison. Not impossible, just unlikely. Another scenario for how she got poisoned was faking a gift from someone she did know and trust. Example: Malfoy sends her a box of poisoned chocolates from Luna. When Hermione thanks her she answers in her normal dreamy sort of odd way that nobody really fully understands and it's assumed to just be her being her normal self while she really did not give it to her.

Lots of questions. Lots of theory and guessing. It's a fun prompt of sorts for sure. I wish someone would write it, I cba to do it despite the many ways I can think of to write this murder mystery with the promise of an epic battle. It would be fun to do it tho, so someone really should.

***** Oh man all good thoughts. I have to wonder if someone was able to get close enough to kill Hermione, why not just take out Harry? Is it more about his suffering rather than advantage? It also makes me wonder if Hermione would have started to test all of their food that wasn't right from the kitchen or made themselves at some point during canon.

Then I wonder if Hermione would consider that she may be poisoned and would try and figure out what she may be dying of and if she could avoid it. If she figures it out and realizes there's nothing she can do, does she tell Ron and Harry or does she think it would only be a distraction from the greater purpose. I can definitely imagine symptoms showing at some point and she tries her best to hide them.

Man this could be so good. I love the prompts in this sub but man does it make me sad when there is a really good one with no actual full fic haha.

***** I think she will die right before like a day or so before the final battle or during it. If she was murdered way before the battle it would give the WW another person to martyr. She would be canonized by the wizarding press. Now if she was killed within days of the battle her death would distract Harry and company and maybe give Moldy an edge. Plus right before the battle everything would be bedlam so no real chance for her to become St. Hermione.

** The problem with a such an aging potion is that it means there is no free will. Things will happen no matter what you do. You are a train on a railroad track, no deviations allowed. This also means you can do anything you want, because if you succeed, then that is what fate ordained.
