I remember this one plot detail but nothing about the rest of the fic. Any idea which one it is?


** It might be linkao3(10181825), which is the third story in a series that starts with linkao3(9323225).

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
