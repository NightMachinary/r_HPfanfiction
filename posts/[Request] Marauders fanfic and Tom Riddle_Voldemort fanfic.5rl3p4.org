So after rewatching the movies for the umpteenth time I want to read a really good fanfic that covers the Marauders from year 1 to L/J death as well as a fanfic that goes through Tom Riddle/Voldemort from his birth to the L/J death. Any suggestions?

I would prefer one that takes Book 7 into account for both, but if it's a really good AU, I'd be open to it.


** The closest things I can think of for Tom Riddle just cover his childhood, unfortunately -- would you be interested? I figure it's because while that's around 20 years for the Marauders, that's more than 50 for Riddle, and 50 years of rising to power would probably be quite something to write indeed.

*** Hey thanks for replying. Sorry about my delay in getting back to this. I'm open to anything. It doesn't have to cover the entire period and I'm open to multiple story series's as well. Or even the best of each period (best TR childhood, best Marauder, best Voldy rising story, etc.
