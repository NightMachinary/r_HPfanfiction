Basically in the fanfic Ruby Rose comes to the realization that her fellow team leader Jaune Arc is prime husband material. So she basically straight up tells him that they are going to get married and have kids and he's going to be a house husband and it will be great.

He, wanting to remain a hunter and having just got away from his family of 2 parents and 7 sisters of course says no. So Ruby does everything in her adorable power to make him see the error of his ways. First it starts off innocent like commandeering a vacant room as their "home away from home" so they can relax away from their respective teams, giving him a kiss on the cheek if he upped his grade to a B-, and giving him back rubs when he trained too hard.

Then it gets progressively more...filthy and she begins to do everything that she can think of to convince him, and eventually He ends up retaliating by firing back just as dirty.

The fic is hilarious and I don't know why but the idea of this happening in a Harry Potter fic, is hilarious to me.

So the basic idea for this prompt i guess is basically Some girl (or guy if that floats your boat) comes to the realization that Harry is prime husband material and tries to do everything LEGAL in her/his power to make it so. It can start adorable and eventually devolve into smutty filth OR it can stay adorable that's entirely up to you.

*** To answer your question, RWBY (pronounced ruby, all caps because it's an acronym) is a western 3D animated show done in a similar style to Japanese anime. The premise is pretty cool, some of the fights are cool, the plot and characters kinda fall through. It's on Crunchyroll and the RoosterTeeth website I think.

I personally kinda like the music, others not so much.
