Anyone have any recommendations for Harry/ marvel and or dc crossover fics? I don't really know that much about marvel comics and the superheroes but I know the basic characters. What really interests me is if there are any sort of fics where tony is completely taken aback by Harry's magic and he experiments on him. Please let me know if there are any fics like this. Thank you


** linkffn(Kicking Gotham) Arguably the best long HP/DC crossover.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-32735/Datatroll+Four+people+with+horrible+luck+Vegas+WTF.htm][4 People with horrible luck + Vegas= WTF!?]] HP/DC/BtVS x-over. Bloody Brandy that actually makes sense for its acceptance, and it's a fun story with a good amount of action. No idea why it has an age rating that high though.

linkffn(Invincible by Kathryn518) Excellent but probably abandoned.

linkffn(Intervention by Clel65619)

linkao3(Surrey Meets Smallville) Abandoned right as it was rounding into the realm of "Holy crap this is cool! What's next!"

linkffn(Harry's Raven)

MARVEL: linkao3(On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads) A few years after the Battle of New York Loki has been serving probation as an Avengers member. Harry finds out his real name is Haraldr Lokison. See title for response.

linkao3(Heroes Assemble)

linkffn(Spider's Web by Merrick Mayfair)

  Vegas Marriage Challenge with a slight twist. Harry wakes up after one too many soco and cokes married to a beautiful blonde woman who has a computer for a brain, a connection to one of the richest men on the planet and a weird affinity for Nena and Remy Zero. Good thing he likes her, because this is definitely one of those til death do us part marriages.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.
