Body horror is "horror principally derived from the graphic destruction or degeneration of the body. Such works may deal with decay, disease, parasitism, mutation or mutilation." It doesn't have to be specifically focused on that, or even be the basis of the plot. I figured the wizarding world would be a veritable breeding ground for that kind of stuff. Hell, I'm sure there's some stuff in canon that I'm overlooking.

There's only one thing I'm asking:

- that it's *not* a 500k fic containing a paragraph within. Or, you know, a 150k fic with a quarter of a chapter dedicated to something like that.

Thanks!


** Hermione hadn't realized they meant earworm so literally and upon looking in the mirror, screamed. Her left ear had taken on the shape of a flatworm but had begun putrefying as she slept and black gunk was pouring down her body.

Fred and George laughed uproariously at the scream emanating from the girl's dorms.

**** It came to mind, it made me gag a bit, so I wrote it quick. Then tacked on it being a prank because the idea of earworms being real made me actually worry I was gonna vomit.

edit: and I love the name, it makes me think of a Fight Club/Fear and Loathing crossover.

**** I'm working on a story where there's a prison that was just going to be crystallized prisoners but now I kind of want to add a body horror element to it. It's only a very small element of the story though.

*** Man I really liked the start to this and thought it was building up to something good but by the end it's bogged down in the usual HPfanfic cliches. Shame because it started of real strong.

***** I didn't realise it was almost 11 years old wow. Even so, random relationship thrown in the served no purpose, Harry can do no wrong even though he let his 2 friends get tortured. I was really hoping it'd end with Harry being tricked and taken to hell by the cenobites but nope it ended with Harry suffering absolutely no repercussions for his actions. Also I can't stand the nickname 'Umbitch'.

  Harry thought he would die; had anticipated it, even. So now what will he do in this new world, one without magic? Not to say that there isn't power lurking here... With snakes calling him 'Lord', and everyone else saying 'Abomination', is it any surprise that he's not going to have an easy time settling down? Subtle HP AU. Eventual Naruto AU. Slow paced. Rated M; Dark Themes.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.
