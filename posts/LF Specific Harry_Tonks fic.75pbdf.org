I found this on reddit originally but now I can't find the post or the fic. The Battle at the Ministry goes bad, Hermione and Sirius die, probably others, I'm not sure, but Tonks accidentally time travels to the beginning of fifth year during the battle. She assumes a new identity to prevent the disaster that happened at the Ministry, ends up falling in love with Harry. And Hermione. She uses a different name, says she's from a coven, and original Tonks is still around. I ended up really liking this one and now I can't find it for a reread.

Edit - Thank you [[/u/RoboticWizardLizard]]


** I haven't read it yet, so I don't know about the coven bit, but just going by the summary it sure sounds like linkffn(Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass by Temporal Knight)

*** This is it! Thanks! I just could not remember the title and my google-fu failed me.

Edit - Also, you should read it when you get a chance. It's pretty good.
