  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

**** Some parts of this community really annoy me. Sure, they can hate on HPMOR as much as they want, but don't lie about it. Methods of Rationality is entirely earnest and takes itself quite seriously. Certainly not crack.

***** That's true, but then you get to the Chaos Legion and then pulling out swords out of nowhere. Whilst the author was taking themselves seriously, I couldn't. I loved it, btw. Not hating on it at all. It's one of my favourites but it was ridiculous in many parts whilst other parts were really clever.

****** It's 11/12 year olds playing cops and robbers and taking themselves way too seriously while doing it.

I thought it was extremely appropriate since I played similar games as a child with sticks as swords, but we didn't have magic at our disposal to make everything more awesome.

******* Fair enough. As I said, I couldn't take it completely seriously but I loved the fic. If we loved it for different reasons then there's no point in trying to argue over a difference which doesn't matter.
