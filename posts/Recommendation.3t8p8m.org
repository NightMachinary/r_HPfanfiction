** I'm looking for a fic with all of the following properties:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: im-looking-for-a-fic-with-all-of-the-following-properties
   :END:

- Harry/Hermione as a subplot-- not the main focus of the fic
- Time Travel (no earlier than Harry's birth, no later than 5th year)
- No Dumbledore or Weasley bashing
- Powerful, rational, emotionally mature Harry
- Complete-- or at least regularly updated
- Length > 100k words

Bonus points for a Voldemort that has been souped up in proportion with Harry.

Well written please?

** A second request:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: a-second-request
   :END:
I doubt this exists, but I would really like to see a fic that explains Dumbledore's plotting from the perspective that he is simultaneously benevolent and competent. I feel that cannon Dumbledore was written to be a shining example of benevolence and wisdom, but trying to square that view with the facts of his plotting is, in my view, extremely difficult.

I would love to see a fic that shows Dumbledore manipulating things behind the scenes in order to show:

- Why he never explained his plan to Harry or anyone other than Snape
- How he knew to leave Ron the deluminator (that worked out too conveniently)
- Why he allowed Snape to behave the way that he did
- Why he never trained/interacted with Harry

etc.

My favorite example I've seen of something like this is in HPMOR where [[/spoiler][Dumbledore listened to every prophesy in the department of mysteries, so that all of his strange behavior could be explained away. Since he was blindly manipulating events in order to avert catastrophe, he didn't even know why he was doing all the odd things he was.]] The problem with this explanation is that it isn't very satisfying. I feel that a truly satisfying explanation would necessarily involve a great deal of hidden plot.

Thanks in advance.


** *A Second Chance*, linkffn(5251301), sends Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Neville, and Luna back to their first year. The heroes are a little overpowered, Voldemort isn't that hard, but there is a twist.

  The war is over, however not all went to plan. Many died. Too many. Harry and his friends are some of the few survivors of the Order of the Phoenix, and after the war, attempt to live normal lifes. However, it seems fate doesn't want them to. Post-OOTP

** One possible explanation for Dumbledore's plotting, is that he isn't actually plotting all that much, but the prophecy itself is causing a bunch of bizarre coincidences to happen so that it is fulfilled and people are just attributing them to Dumbledore. This doesn't really explain why he doesn't rein in Snape or train Harry though.
