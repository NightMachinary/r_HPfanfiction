Im in the mood for fics where Harry finds out that there is a pamflet to muggleborns and that he never got one, i remember 1 or 2 i read some time ago where it was done on purpose, and so was obviously bashing fics. Tropes and cliches are okay too, no slash for MC please.


** I can't remember any off of the top of my head but I feel like I've read one or two where that was a very minor plot point.

Despite that you've given me the most wonderful idea. I enjoy writing in universe literature both short and medium in length, (history essays, newspaper articles etc) and I think an introduction pamphlet would be a great write, especially if I pepper it with wizarding misconceptions about what muggles are actually like and what they believe.

*** Sounds fun! Please give a link if you decide to write and post it.

I remember one fic where Hermione refers to the muggleborn introduction pamflet she got, and if questions if Harry didnt read his. Harry of cause havent gotten one, and they venture to find out why. Pretty sure it was a weasley and dumbledore bash fic.
