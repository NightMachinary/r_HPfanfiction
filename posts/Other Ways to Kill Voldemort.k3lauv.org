Besides the obvious have you read any good fanfic where Voldemort is killed in other ways besides destroying his horcruxes or his horcruxes are gathered differently.

Just curious cause most fics I read nowadays go about the horcrux method and I'm curious if there are other methods people came up with.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

** I've seen one or two fics where if any piece of your soul passes through the Veil, it drags the rest with it. In one, the Unspeakables deliberately make sure that information on Horcruxes remains available as a trap for would-be Dark Lords.

One rather contrived case had it that dying on a particular day of the year would automatically undo Horcruxes.

In one of my favorites, after his Horcruxes are destroyed Harry and company send him to the Fae Realm, right into the hands of a Fae Queen that has ample reason to hate him. She makes sure to have /fun/.

** Sometimes, letting him live is the best revenge

I've had his Horcruxes (Horcruxi?) placed into a teddybear:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9136440/1/Dodgers-Dresses-Teddy-Bears-and-Spot]])

I've made him into an immortal 14 year old, in permanent puberty:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7051218/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elder-Sect]])

I've had him placed into stasis for a few billion years:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4070610/33/Thrilling-Tales-of-the-Downright-Unusual]])

Chapter 33 if the bot doesn't go directly to it

I've had him destroyed by Dragon Flame:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7594305/1/Triwizard-Tales]])

And so many other ways. I for one, always found the whole Horcrux idea to be stupid, so I abused it whenever possible.

I've got a story in the planning stages called Dudley Dursley Saves the World... Or Possibly Dudley Dursley: Big Damned Hero, where in, rather than wait for 2nd year to use the Diary, Lucius presents it to Harry when he finds Draco talking to him in Madam Malkins.

Harry, being a typical 11 year old, has no need of a diary, and just drops it on the nearest convenient flat surface once he gets back to #4. Dudley, being the little bitch that he is, promptly yoinks it so that Harry doesn't have it.

So, after being de-tailed, Dudley heads off to Smeltings, where he promptly learns that (1 he isn't the big fish here that he had been at Little Whinging Primary, and (2 his daddy's name earns him no favors. So after he has his snack reserves stolen, gets beaten up a few times and earns himself a few dozen swirlys, he take to hiding in his dorm.

One day one of his dorm mates leaves a mimeographed Fanzine laying around and Dudley starts reading it, before deciding to give this 'fan fiction' thing a go. Searching through his desk, he finds the Tom's Diary. Non-Magical ink isn't absorbed by the pages, so Dudley goes to town on his A Team epic.

Diary Tom wakes up to a morass of misspellings, horrible grammar, what a sheltered (if pampered) 11 year old thinks sex is, and a just stupid plotline.

He tries to interject his will into the writing, but Dudley either just crosses it out or incorporates it into his 'story'.

Dudley's dorm mates, with all the taste that an 11 year old has, pronounces the results of Dudley's scribbles to be 'epic' and encourage him to keep going.

There ultimately comes a time where Diary!Tom just can't take it any more, and rather than try to parse the next ludicrous plot point into English, he manages to (somehow I haven't determined yet) kill himself.

This causes all the other Horcrux!Toms to 'move up one' with the 2nd (Cup!Tom?) to become Diary!Tom... just in time for Dudley's next epic, a Supercar story to start, and the suffering to start all over again. Another result of this is that Harry passes out in class when Scar!Tom is suddenly ripped away from him

End result, each of the Horcruxi are destroyed via bad fanfiction, Wraith!Tom dies when the last of his soul fragments commits suicide rather than read more of a Dudley story, and Dudley saves his Cousin (and the Magical World, and is utterly unaware of it.

** In linkffn(Lady Archimedes), Hermione devises a curse (the abstract kind, like cursing the DADA position) that would kill any magical being that was born in the British Isles on the date of Voldemort's birth. She goes to lengths to ensure that Voldemort will (probably) be the only casualty of this curse, and it works like a charm (once the Horcruxes have been destroyed).

** In A Wand For Skitter linkffn(13220537), Winky lock him in a time loop, left looping the shock at seeing the time turner being blasted right in the middle of The Great Hall (they can't move him, and it's left ambiguous if they even bother to cover the scene), the good guys spend five years to hunt the rest of the Horcruxes, Harry never managed to get rid of his Horcrux and died early after six centuries (Muggles and Wizards alike are practically immortal by then), the locked Voldemort then let go millions years later when Earth is about to be swallowed by the Sun, with enough time to watch a gloating video message from the MC before attempting to apparate away.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
