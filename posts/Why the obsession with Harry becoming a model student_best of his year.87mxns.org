I guess we all have come across the stories where Harry, for some reason or another, decides that he needs to stop "slacking off with Ron" and suddenly is the number 2 student behind either Hermione (if she is the love interest) or the love interest (if Hermione is getting bashed). But why is that a thing? Why do so many authors think that academic success equals battlefield skills?

The most common explanation you'll find is that the classes are somehow supposed to help Harry win against Voldemort/the Triwizard, because... well... at this point most explanations fall short. Charms and DADA are definitely useful in that regard, but Astronomy? Potions? Herbology? Short of carrying a greenhouse filled with lethal flora around, plants are useless in a fight and if confronted with one, you can simply burn it. In a similar vein, Potions can be bought and if you are in dire need of one to patch up a wound, then you are probably not in the shape to brew one in the first place. Shelf-life might be an issue, but that still doesn't explain the countless "Harry tires being nice to Snape" plots I've seen. Even if learning Potions is somehow vital in a fic, Snape would be the last person to teach competently.

Yet so many stories have grades tied to Harry "turning his life around". A select few argue with career chances, which is a sensible explanation, even if Harry having any sort of Ministerial ambitions after watching the Minister throw Hagrid into Azkaban seems off. But where does this fascination with being a model student come from? Judging by how both canon and most fanfictions handle magical fighting/problem solving, the majority of Hogwarts' classes are useless in that regard since brute force appears to be working quite well (and I doubt normal coursework teaches arcane arts to rival Voldemort of Dumbledore).

Why do so many authors, regardless of pairing, turn Harry into a model student?


** Because if you had lived your whole life in "reality" and then found out there was such a thing as magic and you could do literally anything with it if you found the right spell, you would NEVER skip class and going to the library would be the most kick-ass thing ever.

I.e. authors are projecting their fascination with magic on to Harry.

********** Astronomy is as old as human civilization. If wizards developed it in the middle ages they are very very late to the party.

Furthermore, the idea of a telescope, of systematically exploiting the material properties of glass and mirrors, is muggle at its very core. Wizards were far more likely to have relied on vision-enhancing spells until some adventurous muggle-fancier stumbled across such a "substitute for magic", found it interesting enough to enhance it with magic (which wouldn't have been all that difficult with early telescopes) and sold the result to the wizarding world as an easier/more convenient form of magic than the spells everybody had been using until then.

Astronomy is on the curriculum because a previous headmaster fancied it and convinced enough people that an academical subject about some vague influences on all manners of magic would benefit their dunderheaded spawn.

**** I think it's accurate that your average 11 year old is more likely to slack off in most circumstances, even with all of the possibilities of magic at their fingertips. However, I think most fic authors are in at least their late teens or older and have a greater appreciation for the sheer power of magic, as described in the HP universe.

I think you hit the nail on the head for why your average WIZARD doesn't spend all their time studying magic, because it's not unusual to them. As such, they go look up a spell or potion when they need it, but they aren't out there studying for the hell of it.

Honestly, it paints this incredibly depressing picture of the chilling effect that likely happens to Muggleborns as they become acclimated. Slowly they lose that sense of wonder, magic becomes commonplace and they become no different than your average wizard that buys their potions at the apothecary and their charms from WWW

  Why do so many authors think that academic success equals battlefield skills?
#+end_quote

Because in canon, there is literally not a single talented witch or wizard who wasn't at least above average when it came to academics.

Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Grindelwald? Academically successful and magically talented. The Marauders and Snape? Academically successful and magically talented. McGonagall? Academically successful and magically talented. Crouch Jr? Academically successful and magically talented.

There is no witch or wizard in the entire series who is a skilled duelist who actually sucks at magic at magic while being academically talented. Crabbe and Goyle failed academically and both are below average wizards. Because Crabbe and Goyle are dumb, they lack magical talent. By contrast, Snape was a genius (as were Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald, the Marauders, Lily, etc) who invented spells and improved Potions instructions better than the actual author of Advanced Potion Making. In other words, Snape is a talented wizard because of his intelligence. Same goes for every other talented witch and wizard in the series.

Even when looking at Harry himself in DH, he was academically above average and thus an above average wizard. He wasn't as good as an Auror, but he was still above average compared to the average wizard. Especially since the average wizard can't do Shield Charms and likely never even took their N.E.W.T.s or failed them. Harry would get slaughtered by the likes of Snape, Bellatrix, or anyone of comparable skill to them in an actual one-on-one duel. Harry was far beneath the Marauders, Snape, or Lily when it came to academic talent and actual skill at similar ages; Dumbledore and Voldemort in their Hogwarts years would stomp adult Harry with no difficulty. Despite all that, Harry's academic ability and magical talent were both above average when compared to the average, normal wizards.

Even Hermione, the character whose intelligence and magical skill are vastly overrated by the fandom, fits as she is an above average student and an above average witch. She's not as good at dueling as Harry (and arguably Ron at certain moments), but her magical talent correlates with her academic ability. Her academic ability is above average, therefore Hermione's magical talent is above average, even its nowhere near the geniuses of the series. If Hermione had above average intelligence but lacked magical talent (or vice-versa), it wouldn't even make logical sense.

*TL;DR: Canon has consistently proved that academic ability correlates with a wizard's magical talent. It is impossible for a wizard to be talented without also having a similar extent of academic intellect.*

*** I think we massively under-estimate canon!Harry as a whole on this sub. At 17, Harry is comfortable enough to go toe-to-toe with most Death Eaters, and is easily the best duelist of his age. In fact, the Snape/McGonagall/Shacklebolt bracket is where I place an adult Harry (who's the youngest head Auror in history, at 26).

I always thought the fandom's issue with Harry was that he just was never in the Dumbledore/Voldemort echelon, especially when you consider that the prophecy mentions that Harry would be Voldemort's equal.

Their grades are pretty much due to a lack of effort rather than a lack of intelligence. All the stuff Fred and George made were examples of their magical talent, and such items were made by understanding magical theory and by extension, their academic ability.

When it comes to wizards who don't completely ignore academic work to pursue some other interest, those with above average intellect are above average are also above average wizards. Hermione's talent with magic is due to her knowledge of magical theory and by example, her magical ability.

I think Harry did pretty well in canon, he got decent grades for his practical lessons, which means he has a decent understanding of magic.

The main reason i think, why Smart!Harry in fanfics gets excellent grades is that authors want Harry to be intelligent, so they tell their readers that hey, he gets good grades he must be so smart. Showing an intelligent characters requires the author to be at least equally intelligent, which is rarely the case.

***** Aside from Rookwood being an Unspeakable (and thus above average by default), Bellatrix and Dolohov can be implied to be academically talented based on their feats as adult. In the HP series, wizards who lack talent as students will lack talent as adults unless tutored by a particularly skilled wizard. This is due to the fact that most wizards don't bother learning more after Hogwarts since they learnt all they need there. So while the specifics of Bellatrix and Dolohov aren't known, its pretty easy to infer that they were above average students (i.e. at bare minimum comparable to either Harry, Ron, Hermione, or Draco).

In regards to the Death Eaters, there are some other examples that can be assumed based on events from the books:

- Wormtail was above average; he was just underrated by everyone else for not being as talented as James and Sirius. Even so, he was an Animagus by fifth year and contributed to the creation of the Marauders' Map. The only subject we know he was 'bad' at was DADA, but McGonagall was vague and never specified what year Wormtail was in when she made that comment. As a Death Eater, he was skilled enough to perform the magic to actually give Voldemort a body (albeit with Voldemort's backseat driving) and could cast the Killing Curse using Voldemort' wand despite Voldemort's wand still being loyal to him. So he's an above average wizard with above average magical talent.

- Lucius was in the Slug Club and was one of Slughorn's old favorites. At the very least, its likely Lucius was talented at Potions. Even if Lucius came from a rich pure-blood family, I doubt Slughorn would consider him one of his favorite students in the Slug Club if he was underperforming in Slughorn's Potions class. Lucius was a pretty high-ranking Death Eater in both the First and Second Wizarding Wars. He wasn't the best but he was clearly much more talented than the average wizard. So Lucius was an above average wizard with above average magical talent.

- Crouch Jr was implied to an even greater extent to have got Outstanding in his N.E.W.T.s based on Crouch Sr recalling it (albeit mind-broken by that point). Either way, Crouch Jr was mostly responsible for the entire plot of GoF, managed to infiltrate Hogwarts for an entire school year without Dumbledore knowing, and managing to curse the Goblet of Fire itself. Its unlikely he ever improved his skills between his trial and resisting his father's Imperius Curse 13 years later. Meaning his magical talent in GoF was not much different, if not completely identical to his talent as a seventh-year Hogwarts student.

**** It also looks like there needs to be an understanding here.

The books, by the end, are the archetypal Hero's Journey. They don't start that way though.

Harry Potter starts as a children's book about an otherworldly adventure. There are hints it's also the Hero's Journey but the first three really focus on the otherworldly adventure.

And a lot of readers (who turn into become writers) at such an age have a hard time reconciling the shift properly.

So they write what they think should have happened.

But here's the rub. JKR subverts the whole archetype by having Harry be the hero that things happen to. Not happen because of. Because let's face it. Throughout the books Harry isn't your typical cliched hero until the climax of the plot each book. Until the ending begins to happen things just sorta happen around Harry.

And they don't think it's how to tell the story. So by making Harry suddenly care and thus become a great wizard they get the hero they want. Because as was pointed out all of the best wizards are well educated.

  Hermione, the character whose intelligence and magical skill are vastly overrated by the fandom,
#+end_quote

Well...it's true that much of fandom worships Hermione (especially in comparison to Ron and Ginny), but IMO, much of this is from the movies. People do treat Hermione like a second Dumbledore, but I don't think she's /vastly/ overrated.

From the perspective of the books, in fact, I think Hermione is clearly on the level of McGonagall/Snape, just perhaps not specialized in any one subject. "Above average" witches and wizards don't get 112% in Charms tests. They don't get given Time Turners to take extra subjects in class. They don't make Polyjuice potions at the age of 12 in a bathroom. They don't get Os in every OWL except one while being part of not one but two secret groups fighting against Voldemort and Umbridge, respectively.

I would also like to give one counter-example about academics instantly meaning talented duelist or intelligent: Dawlish, who got Os in all his NEWTs, but otherwise appeared to be nothing more than comic relief. You could give him Dumbledore, as he's...Dumbledore, but after that, surely a competent wizard would realise his skills were diminished and not go charging into situations.

**** Re: Hermione, unlike Snape and McGonagall she doesn't really have any special magical accomplishments to her name such as inventing spells or becoming an animagus. She seems more like a Percy Weasley to me: highly competent in all areas, but lacks flair.

As for Dawlish, we only ever see him fight Dumbledore, so any impression of inadequacy has to be considered in that context.

***** Dawlish was in general confunded and knocked out several times, leading to his capacities being diminished to the point where people like Augusta Longbottom (who, remember, failed Charms!) outdueled him- but, as I argued, a competent wizard should realise that, right?

Hermione is too by-the-books to invent spells, but honestly, I imagine that if her spare time hadn't been taken up by defeating Voldemort, she probably would have tried to become an animagus if McGonagall had let her. We never see her fail a Transfiguration, I believe, unless you count the tortoise which looked more like a turtle.

*** I would say it suggests it, not necessarily proves it. Correlation and causation and limited sample size and all that fun stuff.

Also, to actually contribute, I think that it might not be academic ability that makes a good wizard, but the willingness to put /work/ into learning magic. Like, Harry's year was pretty average, but then in fifth year everyone in the DA learned the patronus even though supposedly it is difficult even for NEWT students. So this would actually be a perfect example of correlation not equalling causation; being hardworking increases academic ability and magical skill, though some like Dumbledore and Voldemort also have natural skill in magic, possibly because they are smarter, so academic ability correlates with magical ability but does not cause it.

Harry's job is to be a student.

It would be more reasonable and realistic for Harry to pare down his class schedule as much as possible. He's not a great student (albeit a decent one, in canon), and his primary mission is a better choice of where to show his primary competence. But in plenty of stories, he doesn't really start on the Voldemort project until relatively late in the story. So that's a bit awkward.

** There are 2 reasons.

Harry Potter is supposed to face the strongest Dark wizard of the time, one of the strongest smartest, and deadliest men to walk the earth, and he is skipping class. He learns literallly a grand total of 3 spells that he uses against Voldemort, and one of them in Second year. Fifth year comes and he can't even duel death eaters, yet we are supposed to believe he can kill Voldemort. Sixth year, he gets Destoryed by Snape, and we are supposed to believe he can kill Voldemort. He wins by a cosmic fluke not skill.

The simple way of fixing this is have him utilize the fact that he is in the greatest hub of magical knowledge found in the entire series. He literally lives there, and doesnt utilize it.

the second issue is the fact that not only does he feel unprepared, but if we make Harry stronger, he will preform stronger in his classes. If he is first in the class, if Hogwarts actually does that, it only means that he is stronger compared to his peers.

1) Author avatar. The author values those things so Harry must, too

2) To pair with Hermione, Harry must equal or exceed her. Alternatively, in pairings with others, by outdoing Hermione Harry establishes himself as academic alpha and thus more desirable, a jack of all trades, heroism, sport, and academics too, and also justifies Hermione being dismissed if Harry is able to outdo her.

3) To create a stick to beat Ron with for /not/ doing the same - may extend into general Weasley-bashing

**** Spells aren't bullets, though. The more you know about magic, the better you can use it against other people, and the more you can counteract spells sent at you. An advanced wizard duel isn't a gunfight, it's a chess match between two people with very large repertoires of spells that they know very well and understand completely. Only at lower levels do spells act like bullets, because those spells are easy to conceptualize and cast. However, they lose almost every single time to more advanced casters.

Plus, in order to gather so many spells and the right /kind/ of spells, you need to research on your own. You can't get someone to teach you every spell you'll ever need, it's just impractical.

For my own opinion, I don't care if Harry gets straight A's or flunks completely, but he /needs/ to have a hunger for knowledge, not just for his own sake but for the readers'. Otherwise we cannot delve into the wonderful world of magic alongside him.

Stunners have been done to death as far as their inefficiency goes, because unless you manage to stun all of your opponents at one time then they'll just be revived. The same with body bind.

Then you get bombarda's and other spell of similar caliber. Good for clearing crowds, or speedy and agile individuals. Not so necessary to take out somebody slow in a long hallway.

** Can't have a hero that's a slacker!

Sorry, but a hero's journey involves getting stronger and I bet you can't learn most super-super-super-advanced magic without knowing your basics well...can't run before you've learned to crawl and then walk!

There's also the fact that most of us would probably do ANYTHING to have magic and we would probably learn everything we could about it (damned, it's magic! It's the power to impose your will on the universe - "I want this thing to hover! Gravity be damned!") and that's without having Harry's background of abuse (yes: Abuse, the fandom glosses it over a lot, but what happened to Harry was abuse! The Dursleys might not have beaten him bloody regularly, but trying to hit him with a frying pan and him being uncomfortable being touched? Damned, that's telling us more than outright saying that he was abused IMHO!)...Harry should IMHO want to protect himself from harm and magic is the great equalizer! Even if you are weak in body you can be a titan at magic! Your size and weight don't matter at all with magic - so his uncle's bulk and strength? Meaningless! A simple stunner or petrification spell and he's helpless!

There's also the fact that with magic knowledge really is power! The more spells you know and the faster you can cast them the more powerful you are! Hell, you can kill with the first spell learned in the series, the levitation charm! Levitate someone high up and drop them!

Seems off? Come on canon Harry ends up becoming a ministry errand-boy (otherwise known as an auror!), despite the fact that he's seen the corruption in the ministry (Fudge locking up Hagrid, Sirius Black's imprisonment, Fudge's propaganda campaign against Harry and Dumbledore, Harry's underage magic trial in front of the full wizengamot etc. etc.)...then again: Too many things don't change in canon...hell, Mr. Worthless (my name for Harry, because I hate canon Harry with a passion!) isn't even angry that the Malfoys got off easy, despite the fact that they were in Voldemort's inner circle and should be thrown through the Veil IMHO!
