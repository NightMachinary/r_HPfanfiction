Filch was a Vietnam War vet. A hero, and leader of men. That gives you something more to work with than just 'Old Squib who dislikes kids.'

​

When the Potters die, who better to raise Harry, than the bravest man that Dumbledore knows?

​

Filch came to work for Hogwarts in '73, so say he was a General or some other form of commander, who was Honorably Discharged due to injury in the line of battle, and that would give him a lot to teach Harry. Weapons handling, dedication, how to follow orders, how to lead, confidence and strategy, survival and probably other things as well.

​

It also goes a long way towards explaining his bitterness in canon. To go from being someone so widely respected, and a life of structure and discipline, where his orders are obeyed, to being mocked and mistreated by schoolkids, many who probably wouldn't know a hard day if it bit them would be enough to make anyone cold.

​

As well as that, Harry would grow up in the safest place of all, and know Hogwarts as his home. It'd probably be good for both of them.

​

I don't know enough about Military stuff to do a good job with this myself. So, I release it unto you.


** Quick point reg. Filch's backstory here: Britain did not fight in the Vietnam War. However, many ex-British service members joined the Australian and New Zealand forces, which did fight with the Americans. Some quick Googling shows 40 British casualties in the Vietnam War.

Alternatively, Filch is old enough that he could possibly be a Korean War or even WWII vet, especially if Squibs get some or all of the extended Wizarding lifespan.

**** Oh god, imagine sneaking out at night to the forbidden forest and Filch straight up jumps down from a tree

***** Exactly. Who do you think has been keeping all the acromantulas away from the castle all this time?

** Its an interesting idea, but has to deal with the issue of Filch being an apparently willing and indeed enthusiastic collaborator with Umbridge (not sure if he was with the Death Eaters, I don't think we see enough to say for sure).

It could also really easily turn into just "guns are better than magic"/Muggle wank.

*** Well, you could explain him teaming up with Umbridge as a sort of veteran's revenge.

Would make an interesting footnote on the Battle of Hogwarts if he actually went and joined in in some sort of support role, sending out commands like a true General.

General Argus Filch of Her Majesty's Army sounds really nice.

*** Explanation: He is playing the long game, and wants to guarantee he's around to covertly help the kids when Voldy takes over.
