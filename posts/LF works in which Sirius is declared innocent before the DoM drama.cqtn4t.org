It can be a little bit or very canon divergent. I deally no Dumbledore/Weasley/Hermione bashing. No abandoned or on hiatus works - complete or regularly updated only.


** That happens in a number of my stories. All of them are complete and none of them bash Dumbledore, the Weasleys or Hermione.

*** Well, there's a little Dumbledore bashing back in Marriage Law Revolution, but that story is post-DH aka post-Dumbledore's-idiotic-plan-of-telling-nobody-about-Snape's-role.

That's like the one thing that Granger Principle!Magical-Universe!Dumbledore has done differently in the few lines he's gotten so far.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

**** Because there's no guarantee in this new timeline that Harry will survive. Now he's a prophecised kid, and a horcrux, and every little thing has to go perfectly again for it to work out once more. It "invalidates" his sacrifice.

Also, it's guilt. James should get the second chance, not him.

In both of the above, he's coming around to it slowly...

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. Heavy on Remus/Sirius friendship. Some Black family dynamic; Harry/Sirius family dynamic; Sirius PTSD exploration. Tonks is a major player but not til halfway through. No bashing. Harry is present but not primary; these adults prefer not to ask teenagers to save the world.
