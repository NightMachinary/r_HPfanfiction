:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where there is 7 parts. 1 for each year of the Marauders years at Hogwarts. I really wanted JK Rowling to make some kind of Marauders story, but I don't think she will ðŸ˜¢ So... if anyone knows a complete Marauders story, pls let me know, I'll be interested in trying it out! Thanks!


** It's not split into parts, but it covers all 7 years and beyond. I love it so much that I don't even read other marauders stories now.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!
