I'm sorry, but on the long list of problems I have with the Deathly Hallows, one of the smaller issues I have is that Moody and Voldemort apparently threw down, and we didn't get to see it! I know that Moody couldn't have won, since from a thematic point of view Harry had to be the one or else the story would have been much shorter (hence the reason it's only a minor gripe) but has anybody written that or similar fights without involving god mode?


** Linkffn(harry potter and the deus ex machina) has regulus black as the main character, and he duels voldemort. hermione Granger and the goblet of fire (it's on portkey, just google for it) has Hermione dueling Voldemort alone, even if only for a minute.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** I think in linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon), 'That Fucker' [[#s][(spoiler)]] fights him one on one, although I can't remember how much of it is described. It's more crack than anything, but I remember the duel between Harry & Sirius and Voldemort being very well-written and exciting.

  COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.
