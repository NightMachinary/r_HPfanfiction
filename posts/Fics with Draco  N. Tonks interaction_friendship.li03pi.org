Tonks and Draco are first cousins and yet they rarely if ever get to interact in stories. That's a shame since with the lack of any other magical family who is close in age to them they are the closet either will get to a sibling.

Are there any fics where they meet and actually get to know each other? Maybe Tonks is slightly younger and so is a 7th year when Draco begins Hogwarts, setting him up to meet the 'cool' Hufflepuff before finding out she's his cousin and maybe starting a big sister/little brother friendship.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/853760][Do It All Over Again Series]] I'm currently reading this series and it's a behemoth of a fic series. It's not centered around Draco and Tonks but they do have a good relationship in it.
