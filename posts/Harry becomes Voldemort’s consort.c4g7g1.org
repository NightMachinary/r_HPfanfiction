***** Even if all characters are of age? I happen to realize that anything otherwise will get removed from this site. Pedopilia is disgusting but I see no problem if all characters are of age. That being said real life relationships where people are old enough to marry but have a 30 year age gap is disturbing.

Next time ask for clarification

****** still fucked up, unless it's some AU where tom riddle was an awesome guy who lived a normal old life. but i'm guessing that isn't what you mean with using the term "consort". you want depraved, sick shit, because you have a sick mind too. so yeah. still judging.

****** the internet seems to just perpetuate this view in people that all the messed up shit they think and say is common and normal, like everyone else is just secretly thinking and saying the same things, but guess what? that isn't true. it's just you who has those messed up views, thoughts, and desires. if you didn't spend so much time with it you'd realize that it isn't normal or common. like how totally fucked up that watchpeopledie subreddit was to even exist. that's why it's fucking gone now.

** Please dont apologise for what you like... as long as you respect other people's choices of what they pike to read.. others MUST respect it.. and tbh, i ship some weird stuff sometimes and i will never apologize. . :)

Anyway, there is a fic exactly as you want.. Part one is complete, called "the courtesan "... The second part is a WIP that is constantly updated, called "the consort". By Drops of nightshade

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/620411/chapters/1119488]]

And btw.. it has an interesting system of what the wizarding society might be if Voldemort won in the first wizarding war.. it explores it.. and it shows a powerful harry btw Enjoy
