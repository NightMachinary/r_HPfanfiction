So, we're all familiar with HP and the Problem of Potions now. If you're not, v mild spoiler in this question, but probably not enough to ruin it for you...

The scene where Harry is attempting to replicate the potion that created "kitten" and Voldie, in his head, comes up with an academic theory. Almost like he's being helpful. Are there any fics out there where Voldemort is in Harry's head (either as the Horcrux or actually Voldemort via the Horcrux like canon) but he's genuinely helpful and OK? Not a Dark!Harry fic, not my thing. But a good or at least not evil Voldemort fic where they become sort of, well, a telapathic version of pen friends?


** I kept away from this one 'cause I wasn't sure, but as of the last chapter, I'm pretty sure Tom is good. :) Or at least, not evil towards Harry.

  Loneliness was something that Harry Potter was accustomed to. He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong. Someone had been listening, had been there with him through it all. But, just who was 'Tom?

**** Yeah, I love his stuff. This one I was leery of 'cause I really REALLY disliked the idea that Tom might be just playing Harry. :)

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.
