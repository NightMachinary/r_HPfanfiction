Interested in Romilda's motivations, was she smitten with Harry like Voldy's mum was with his dad? Or was she just interested in the prestige of having the most popular boy in school as her arm candy?


** Had a dark thought, what if Harry knocks up Romilda Vane while under the influence of Love potion, you can guess how the kid turns out.

***** Makes sense to me. Being a sociopath isn't gonna automatically make you a Dark Lord you have to have the extreme personal power, a nation sufficiently vulnerable, opportunity, and the drive. Just because you a sociopath doesn't mean you instantly want to conquer and destroy could easily see it as not worth the effort when you can have a super easy cushy life as a corrupt ministry official

*** A child born from a love potion induced infatuation doesn't just become a sociopath. Riddle is who he is because he was an orphan who was abused by his peers because he was different.

Had his mother survived he'd be a well adjusted wizard.

Harry, even if he wanted to murder romilda, would likely care for his child and probably press for sole custody to keep it away from a psycho like romilda.

Now that is highly debateable, she didn't seem all that well-adjusted herself. I'm not saying he wouldn't have been /better/, and probably not a Dark Lord, but I think well-adjusted might be shooting a little high.

**** What? Where do you get off calling Romilda a psycho while also claiming that Tom raised by his mother would be better off? She did the exact same thing the "psycho" did, only successfully.

*** This is an entirely unexpected crossover, but I'll give it a shot.

Edit: Not bad, but the drama isn't to my taste. Should have expected it from a reality tv crossover.

  Romilda's master plan to ensnare Harry Potter appears to work as planned. Or so she thinks. One shot.

** I don't have a specific rec, but I wonder if there are many characters bashed more than Romilda Vane who are also as satisfying to bash as her? She might be the easiest one who was not a Death Eater, and its always the same type of bashing where she fawns over Harry despite Harry being with Ginny or some other girl.
