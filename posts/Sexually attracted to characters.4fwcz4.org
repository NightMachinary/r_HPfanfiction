Over in the Harry Potter subreddit someone was asking who were ashamed of being attracted to in the series.

So I was wondering who is your crush from the series and do you read fan fiction surrounding them because of it or do you vary your reading?

** I definitely had a crush on Ginny reading the Half Blood Prince the first time. She was wish fulfillment for me at a time when I was hoping to find someone to fall in love with and failing.

I have re-read the series a lot this past year and find myself reading a lot of Harry/Ginny post Deathly Hallows fanfic. I don't know if it's because I have a crush on Ginny as a character or because I didn't want to say goodbye to her or Harry and felt the ending was abrupt and didn't give their relationship proper development and closure.

I will say that I have a non-sexual crush on Bonnie Wright. I'm happily married and while she is attractive, I just don't see her that way. I just think I want to be friends with her because she has a very fun and active NYC life (something I want) and is pursuing a career in the film industry that isn't about getting famous but just doing good work with other talented people, which I'd love to do.

I had a weird crush on him even before Alan Rickman portrayed Snape in the movies. I thoroughly enjoy fics with him either as a mentor or a romantic interest, but I also read about many other characters, plots, and pairings depending on what I'm in the mood for / things that are recommended.

HBPrince, their unfortunate priest (sage, but really, who's keeping track?). Together, they're the smallest of the top 10 teams on CoS Online, and probably the most dysfunctional as well... Eventual TMR/HP SLASH, pairings inside.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11341840/1/The-Angels-Envied-Every-Kiss]] In which Tom Riddle feels more than ready for his seventh year. Until, that is, he encounters the war refugee with an English accent and too bright green eyes; one Hariel Lillian Potter. FemHarry

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11408337/1/Reading-the-Signs]] !Non-Magic!Arcade!AU! It takes Tom four months to find out the kid's actually a famous rhythm game champion, another month to get his name, and (embarrassingly) another month to figure it out. Harry---with his green eyes and messy hair and round, clunky glasses---is completely, utterly mute. Oneshot, TMR/HP SLASH

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7735755/1/Ashes-to-Ashes]] Harry was blind to the dangerous fascination Tom Riddle - a mad, but genius, mass murderer - had with him. And to the deal made between Tom and Albus Dumbledore, the not so innocent director of Hogwarts Psychiatric Institution. AU TR/HP

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10933555/1/Father-of-Lies]] Tom Riddle leads a double life, famous politician by day and Lord Voldemort by night. Harry Potter is about to disrupt his life by convincing the world that he is Tom's mistake of a son, the by-product of one night the young Dark Lord was drunk and sixteen. Thus follows one of the biggest scandals of all time. Oh, Harry is going to enjoy messing things up for Riddle. AU.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10808355/1/Children-of-the-Revolution]] AU. In a world where Sybil Trelawney is never born, the prophecy remains, but goes unheard. How different will Harry Potter's life be, growing up in a world where Voldemort won? How long until a brilliant young man is noticed by the ever more brilliant Dark Lord? NEW STORY.

** Pretty much everyone from the marauder era.

Lily, James, Remus, Sirius.

And then Harry. I just want to give Harry a big hug and not let go. All the characters I like have been through a lot of shit and didn't come out bitter or insane (if they lived long enough to anyways, Sorry Lily/James).

If any of those characters were real would I be attracted to them? Yes, very much so. But unfortunately they aren't, so I'm left to live vicariously through fanfiction, which I'm sure is /very/ healthy. A psychologist would have a field day with me, but I suppose most of you are in the same place as me...

I suppose yes, it does influence what I read. I mostly read Harry-centric stories, and when I'm not it centers around Lily, James, Remus and or Sirius. It's all make believe, and I probably make believe a little harder than is considered healthy.

** When it comes to sexual attraction, very few. Rowling's characters, of both genders, are generally unattractive in my opinion - there's a clumsiness about most of them that usually overrides all other traits.
