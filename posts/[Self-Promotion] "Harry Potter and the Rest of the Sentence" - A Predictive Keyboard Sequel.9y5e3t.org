So what happened ot Harry /after/ he fell down the spiral staircase for the rest of the summer? Did he ever find his eyes in the Forbidden Forest? What exactly is that portrait of a Large Pile of Ash? Armed with Botnik's own online predictive keyboard, I have set out to answer these questions, and more, in /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13124020/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Rest-of-the-Sentence][Harry Potter and the Rest of the Sentence]]/!

Botnik Studios and Achille Talon are not to be held responsible for any faces eaten by Harry Potter with hot sauce, headmaster hair scooting next to you at breakfast, or ribs fractured in hysterical laughter.
