** *Easiest*

Dumbledore: not only have I written him a lot, his temperament is also quite similar to my own. Further, I find his character voice easy as, while it is not similar to how I speak, it is similar to how I write.

Pansy: I just channel the girls I went to school with (performing arts variety).

Daphne: I just channel the girls I went to school with (horse girl variety).

Voldemort: I have sympathy for the fear of death, his ability with magic is appealing, and the arrogance is a joy to write.

Hermione: I find her easy to write simply because I keep in mind all the terrible versions of her which fanon has gifted us and just stay away from all those.

Harry: his sarcastic wit is quite distinctive, and his traits of curiosity, stubborness and moral fibre are well-defined.

*Hardest*

Snape: it's very easy to end up writing him as a two dimensional bully (which, admittedly, he /was/ in canon until the end of GoF, with his saving Harry in PS being his sole aspect of compexity until it was revealed that he was a spy), or alternatively overly indulging his potential for good and making him too reasonable. Keeping both sides and balancing them just right is very hard.

Lupin: I feel like he's difficult to write because he lacks a distinctive voice in canon. He has a well-defined character, but not voice.

Fred and George: writing them as a unit is not so hard, though coming up with genuinely funny jokes can be tricky. But put one of them alone and suddenly they're much harder to write.

Hagrid: god damn that character voice. This would be a case of a voice being too unique! But it's not just his voice, it's also finding a use for him. TBH I think this is something JKR strugged with too, after CoS, because pretty much every plotline involving him from POA onwards is filler.

*** Wow, I find it funny how you and I are almost flipped :)

I find Dumbledore difficult, and I struggle to find a middle ground between Sue and just kind of boring with Harry and Hermione. Conversely, I find Snape and Lupin really easy, although that might be because I've spent the most time thinking about the Marauders' generation in general. I agree with you on Hagrid, though.

** Harry is definitely the easiest, if you keep him close to canon, because he just... reacts. He's an everyman, he can be a little sarcastic but he doesn't really have any stand-out-traits to worry about overdoing. He's the straight guy to run around your plot.

** This is going to seem dumb, but I find Ron hard. I can't figure out his role in the group. They say he's a good strategist but I can't find any examples of this beyond when they play chess. So when I try to develop his character in a realistic way, I kind of get stuck. I see it as this:

In a situation, Harry is the one who reacts first and usually the one who catches the enemy off guard. He's the leader and the one with good improvisation and instinct. Hemione is the one who usually keeps calm and puts thought into what is happening. She either knows or figures out what to do when Harry is stuck, and is also the one who is always prepared. Ron...saves the day when you least expect it?

I feel like Hermione usually figuring stuff out and being prepared ahead of time kind of contradicts what was set up with Ron being good at chess and don't know where to go from there.

I am definitely overthinking this.

*** Ron is the Common Sense guy. Hermione does not function well under stress and she's bad at improvising (which harry is good at). She's a planner and she stresses when things go off plan. Ron's more in tune with his environment because he enjoys outside sensations (eating, for example) so he's more likely to notice offhand things around him than internally-focused Harry or book-oriented Hermione.

After a self-esteem boost, Ron would be the guy to go in and casually chat someone up for information without them realizing that he's after it, for example.

**** There's a quote from PS that supports the idea of Ron being the common sense guy: /"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it likes the dark and the damp - " "So light a fire!" Harry choked. "Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!" Hermione cried, wringing her hands. "Have you gone mad?" Ron bellowed. "Are you a witch or not?"/ (Rowling 224)

** I find Fred and George easiest to write for, personally. That sounds probably because i've known a lot of people like Fred and George, and I sort of instinctively feel when they should finish each other's sentences.

Hardest is probably Harry, mostly because I don't want to just have him be a blank slate, and giving him a distinctive personality is a bit of a challenge.

** I find Sirius really difficult to write, especially when he is young. He struggles with his dark side, but is fun loving and loyal, but sometimes reckless and a bit off.

James on the other hand is much easier.

Somebody else that gave me problems was Lily Evans, especially before 6th year. I had to really make sense of her character first. She grows up in a war against people like her. She literally never saw the magical world not at war about her right to live, but she stays friends with someone that she knows tolerates that kind of ideology in his friends. We hear that in the evening after the lake incident she calls Snape out for calling others mudblood as well. Did she know about this the whole time and only cared now after he turned against her? Then she must be despised by other muggleborns. Or did she not know because she refused to listen to anyone telling her about Snape's behavior before that day? Was she used to people distancing themselves from her because she is muggleborn and that is the reason why she didn't care with Snape. But she had a group of friends that sat with before the lake incident. Who were those girls and how do they feel and react to Lily's friendship with Snape? We know that Lily made excuses for Snape to her friends for year. Did she really think that bullying is the same as agreeing with a murderous ideology that was killing people for 6 years at that time or was she just angry and embarrassed that she took side for someone that betrayed her?

I find Ron the most difficult, as I feel like there's not an awful lot to him. Not in a bashing sort of way, but maybe I've been colored by reading previous fics. If you have any points to make in Ron's favor, please let me hear them, I'd love to get better at writing him.

*** His inferiority complex with both his siblings and Harry. Being in everyone's shadow.

Exploring his loyalty to his friends from his point of view. Giving him that depth that is there but isn't touched on much in the books because of the point of view. Ron was loyal to a T and loved his friends, there's a reason he is Harry's first and best friend. Just think about how in first year, Ron told his mom that Harry wasnt going to get presents.

Dealing with being Harry's companion through all the dangerous and crazy stuff they did together. The department of mysteries. Being on the run in deathly hallows.

Living in a poor family, being ridiculed for being "Muggle lovers" even though they are a pure blood family.

Just some ideas :) I always find it sad that Ron is sold short but there is really so much love, loyalty, and friendship to him.

Those are all excellent points, and will help give me a lense to look through to see how and why he would react to certain situations. I think you really hit the nail on the head when you said he loves his friends. I'll have to work on it, but you've given me a starting place to better my version of him. Thanks!

*** Ron is the least developed of the trio, but that also means he's the character that has the most room to grow. There's a lot of options a writer can give Ron to step out of Harry and Hermione's shadows and find his own "niche" that it usually won't seem forced.

** I find Harry and Severus the easiest to write, but probably because I've thought about them a lot and I've read many great (non slash) fanfiction of them so I kind of have a good idea of how I envision their thoughts and dialogue. I frankly think Dumbledore would be the hardest, atleast writing a story from his own point of view. He kept many things to himself and we never got a real glimpse into the way he thinks. He was wise, but loving, but calculating (some would even say manipulative). It would be a very cool thing to delve into though.

** I mostly write about Sirius and I find him quite easy, but then of course it is my own headcanon. The only other canon character POV I use is Harry (adult Harry) and he's okay. He's a nice enough guy with a strong sense of duty, but he's a bit passive, and try as I might he doesn't inspire any sort of passion in me. As in canon he's a vehicle to hang the plot on, and that's what he was always for. I've never tried anyone else but I think it depends on how interesting you find the character to start with. It is possible to develop an interest in a character as you write though.

** Hermione is definitely one of the easiest characters for me to write, mostly because I share a lot of traits with her. Ron and Harry also aren't too bad.

Writing Snape is either super easy or impossible -- I have to get into the right mindset to write him, and if I am, his scenes will write themselves.

Dumbledore and Trelawney are a bit difficult for me to write well, and I've tried to write from Peter Pettigrew's point of view once, and it was terribly difficult.

** It depends on the story that I am writing. It's Severus Snape for me. One, I like his character so I have spent a lot of time thinking about his motivations and experiences. It's easier for me to write him in daily situations. I would get too emotional trying to write him in a 'during war' or 'dealing with trauma' centric stories.

The simple answer is Snape is onion-like, in layers, versatility and the ability to make you cry... [edit: and I like cooking with onions ]. My writing style and plots that I choose to spend my time on are rarely too heavy -- if they are heavier I prefer Hermione. I feel more comfortable with her thought processes. Harry and Luna are the best side characters to write though!

Luna is definitely the hardest, since I have to make sure that she doesn't come off as either too deranged, too spacey, or too normal. So many other authors get her wrong that I'm usually too intimidated to even try.

I find Dumbledore the hardest to write mostly because I'm not sure what shade of gray to write him as (not 50 lol). Did he purposely set up Harry to get the stone in the first book so he could force a Quirrel/Voldemort confrontation? Did he think of Harry as a lamb to slaughter, or did he really come to care for him in a grandfatherly kind of way?

Edit: And Hagrid's dialect is also really hard for me. I suspect British writers wouldn't struggle as much.

** *Easiest*

Voldemort: His arrogance and genius is fun to write. Plots within plots within plots. It helps that some of my most important and best scenes are with him.

Ron: For no apparent reason, I can easily get into his mind. He is simple with what he wants, but is dedicated and ever so lovable.

Bellatrix: It's pretty easy to do crazy.

Harry: As the whole novel is looking from his viewpoint, it's not that hard to find something to work with. Very moldable.

*Middle of the Line*

Hermione: I can do her voice quite well, but I struggle with her POV.

Dumbledore: It depends on the scene. I can write him well when it comes to teaching, but less so when it is about emotional topics between Harry/Dumbledore.

Luna: I don't think I could do a scene with her POV, but her character voice isn't that hard for me to write. She says very logical things within her illogical statements.

*Hardest*

Snape: He is just hard to write. Period.

Fred & George: Having them come as a unit is problematic. I agree with Taure.

Sirius: More so in my story, but I have yet to find his voice as a mentor who has been through a lot, and feels as if he has failed Harry yet again.

** Easiest:

Ron: I mean this character is pretty straight forward, and if you understand his character (which ins't that hard) he actually becomes a joy to write him.

The twins: Just keep it lighthearted, and funny and you got it. But i admit that if you want to go an extra mile, and be super on character they can be kind of difficult.

Young Draco: let me say first that he is supper easy to write when he is you, since it's easy to just make him to a prat, and make the readers hate him automatically.

Hardest

Older Draco: He honestly does a 360 turn when it comes to difficulty. I find it really difficult to keep him in charter, specially when we see hims struggling with the things he is expected to do as a Malfoy.

Dumbledore: For some reason he is really hard for me to write; his form of speech just gets me for some reason.

HAGRID: I think a couple of people already said this, and it's simply because due to his mannerism, and his form of speech that is just too unique.

Bellatrix: I know that a couple of people will say she is the easiest due to her insane nature, and how easy she is to predict. However, if you really want to write her in character, and write a really good Bellatrix, it's gonna be hard i'm just saying.

James Potter: if you do a fic where James is alive, you are into a big surprised, cause honestly we know very little about him. Sure we know that he was a bully back in the day, but how much do we know about him when he was an adult? not much really, and that is difficult to write.

** Nearly all of them are terribly hard. I am not good at writing in-character anything at all, which is one reason I generally trend toward uber-AU territory.

I think I have a decent handle on McGonagall, but she's just 'concerned/strict' which isn't a very detailed personality. Hagrid isn't too hard, because he's also quite simple and a lot of his uniqueness is his accent. Dursleys too, very flat characters, easy enough to mimic. Anyone else, and there's a good chance my attempts will scarcely resemble canon.
