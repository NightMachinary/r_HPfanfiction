** There was one on Portkey named Teacher's Pet, in which [[/spoiler][Hermione went to Beauxbatons and never met Harry until they were at a bar the night before she showed up for her first day of auror training to be taught by him.]] I thought it was an intriguing premise but I haven't been able to find a copy elsewhere.

  /After what both Harry Potter and Hermione Granger assume is only a one night stand, they are shocked to see each other at Auror Training- him as the instructor and her as the student. They decide to put what happened behind them and move forward, but will they be able to do that? Lavender Brown also struggles to show that she's not just a pretty face- but when Charlie Weasley shows up, will that put a stop to her plans? Ron Weasley deals with his long distance relationship with Luna Lovegood and pursuing a career path he's not sure will make him happy. Can everyone find a way to be happy, both in their personal and professional lives?/

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] really like this premise. For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11054843/1/Homecoming][Homecoming]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9537818/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nameless-Man][Harry Potter and the Nameless Man]], linkffn(11922116;11054843;9537818), all involve Harry and Ginny meeting post Hogwarts.

There are several more fics with post Hogwarts Harry/Ginny:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7768541/1/A-Cannon-s-Harpy][A Cannon's Harpy]], linkffn(7768541)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7630045/1/A-Set-Up-Gone-Wrong][A Set Up Gone Wrong]], linkffn(7630045)

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128465][Ginny Duty]]

--------------

Post Hogwarts fics involving other characters:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028), is extreme AU without Voldemort. Bellatrix and Hermione got together after she was about to graduate from Hogwarts. Most of the story happened after school.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is extreme AU. Ron and Hermione met post school and as enemies first. Their romance was central to the plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King][The Sea King]], linkffn(7502511), is only an one-shot, but a super bitter-sweet one in which Hermione finally found Harry after almost 20 years.

*** These sound intriguing! I'm reading Ginny Duty right now.

About Brennus, I checked and I actually have a couple of pieces from him called the "The List" and "The Oath". They actually fit with what I'm asking for in this thread. I can't find either novels in his FF.N page so I was wondering if this is the same guy. I have no idea how I got them. Anyway, I remember not liking the flow of dialogue between Harry and Ginny in "The List" and not continuing past a couple of chapters. But I"ve decided I'm going to give it another go, or maybe try his other novels.

Thanks alot for the recommendations!
