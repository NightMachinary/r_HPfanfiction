What do you think the outcome might be?


** She would probably think that Harry found a way to resist the potion since he is obviously still lying.

*** I reckon she doesn't care what the truth is. Like, she asks Harry where Sirius is hiding. If the Ministery is looking for Sirius because they believe him to be a Death Eater, then why woulld she believe that Harry of all people would know his whereabouts? I reckon she doesn't /really/ believe that Harry is lying, but is going along with that narrative for her own benefit.

While I don't think she'd try to convince herself that Harry was lying, I'm sure she would find a way to convince Fudge that he was, or else just not tell him everything Harry had said under the Veritiserum's influence. After all, what Fudge doesn't know, can't hurt him.

** I read a fic where that happened. When he didn't recant she was like "oh fuck."

There was also some stuff about how the horcux in his head let him subconsciously access the thoughts and memories of voldemort and when he was asked questions under veritaserum he would answer with the truth, regardless of whether he consciously knew it or not - so, you know, direct line to everything voldemort is doing and wants to hide.

** I think it depends on what questions she asks Harry. Also I imagine that is part of the reason the propaganda that called Harry crazy was spread. Since truth is subjective it means that veritaserum is just an aid; if you give truth potion to someone who believes the world is flat, they will still tell you the world is flat. For tho reason I think they wpuld not want people to think Harry was anything but delusional.
