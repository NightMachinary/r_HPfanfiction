I am looking for stories where Harry Potter learns an alternate magic system from another "story-verse." It can either be from an actual person or from books/literature. Some examples would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9586702/1/Fate-s-Gamble][Fate's Gamble]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10762306/1/Change-Of-Fate][Change Of Fate]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11150989/1/The-Mixed-Lineage-Mage][The Mixed Lineage Mage]], ...

One important thing is that the "normal" magic system remains the same. The new system is one not practiced (either because it is not possible, or because no-one knows it) among the general wizarding population.


** A Darker Shade of Light by st122 is a HP/WoT crossover where Harry learns to control the One Power. Seems like it might fit your request.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4532363/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sun-Source][Harry Potter and the Sun Source]] features a Harry with sufficient martial arts training that it's effectively magic. Jumping forty feet into the air to catch someone falling at terminal velocity and landing safely with them, using pressure points to make someone vomit or permanently paralyse their arms, that sort of thing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6995114/1/The-Wizard-of-the-Kaleidoscope][The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope]] imports a handful of magic systems practised by a tiny subset of mages each. Harry, for instance, has the Eyes of Misery, which is mostly lifted from Naruto. Another mage in the story has a facility with direct destruction not through any spells. Most of them are bloodline abilities.
