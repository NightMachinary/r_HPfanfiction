Sick of reading stories where people do terrible things to Harry and nothing ever comes out of it.

I want something satisfying to read in terms of revenge.


** This has Harry get revenge on Lily and James for neglecting him and his sister. linkffn(9057950)

And also, Holy fuck, you just reminded me of a different fic that pissed me right the hell off. MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD. Can't recall the name of the fic but seriously this triggered me so hard. It's a fic where Hermione studies the Hallows for the ministry because Dumbledore put a spell on the Beedle the Bard book.

Alright, so Hermione is studying the Hallows or some shit, and keeps trying to make Harry give her the Stone or something, and he keeps saying know cause he knows she's turning insane.

Long story short, Hermione Imperio's Ginny to get the stone, then kills Ginny and sacrifices Harry's unborn child to make her own Deathly Hallows. Harry comes to stop her, Ron gets killed trying to help Harry, and Harry practically one shots Hermione since he holds the real Hallows.

And you know what happens? Does Hermione get killed for going crazy and killing Ginny, Ron, and Harry's unborn child? Nah man, Harry sacrifices himself to bring Ron back to life, and Hermione goes back to eating breakfast with the Weasleys the next day.

I just...fuckin /why/.

*** I know that one since I recommended a couple times recently. It's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/][Hallows and Pathos]], linkffn(4889913). I had voiced the same complaint and the author explained that this fic was written as part of a challenge on SIYE. He almost got kicked off the site for killing off Harry and Ginny in that story.

*** I've read that story too. Yeah, that was annoying, but look at it this way. Hermione was supposedly spelled to do so, compulsion charmed or something, and now, she has to live with the guilt for the rest of her life. Still, I think Ron should have just fucked off and let Hermione go on alone. /That/ would have stung.

*** Uhm, if nothing happens to fix Hermione I understand your concerns, but from the way you sum it up it looks like Hermione was, well, /going insane/, possibly because of some curse of the Hallows. But even if it's /not/ a curse, if she's going /insane/, what she needs is a therapist at Saint Mungo's and to be kept away from sharp objects. Not to be executed like a criminal who knew what they were doing.

**** Well, when I say 'going insane' I don't mean that the Hallows were cursing her or anything. Harry kept telling her to just stop the research because the Hallows just cause Death, they can't necessarily /control/ it, and Hermione is just "fuck off Harry I'm gonna be the next Merlin."

So really she was just obsessed over figuring out the secret of the Hallows.

*** I couldn't finish it. Dumbledore and Hermione act far too much like cliches. Hermione had no problem with Parseltongue before but now suddenly it's super dark? And goodness, that whole "Dumbledore put on his grandfather face" thing is annoying.

Thank you for the recommendations though.
