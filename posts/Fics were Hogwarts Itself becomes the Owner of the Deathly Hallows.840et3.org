Like Dumbledore after he take the wand from Grindelawald doesn't want to keep it , so he ends up asking a house elf were he can hide something at Hogwarts and Gets told about the Room of requirement and when he uses the room to hide the wand, he is disarmed by humanoid personification of Hogwarts a bit like the Spirit of a dryads and Naiads. leading to Hogwarts taking possession of the first Deathly Hallow .

what do you think Hogwarts would do with the Deathly hallows?

Like would it use the Stone to create Magical Portraits with full knowledge of every person that has died that has walk there its hall?

and what do you think the effect of being master of death would have on Hogwarts? if the Hallows really are gifts from death


** I feel like History of Magic would get a lot less boring...

but really, I could see the School basically using the resurrection stone to acquire the singular best teacher of each subject who ever died?

The Cloak could be incorporated into the wards, ie Death will never find the school? So 0% death toll forever.

The wand could either become a Champion's weapon like the Sword, or also be incorporated into the wards and making them literally unbeatable.

*** It could use the stone to make a portrait of everyone that has stepped inside the school and then create a library portrait with every book that has ever been inside Hogwarts and then put the people in the portraits to use in sorting the Library portrait.

So that they can sort out all the out dated information and then have them write books that cover subjects from beginner all the way to the Highest level of a subject.

***** Hmm I was sure that you had to have meet the person you are trying to call up with the stone or is that a fanfiction thing?

If you don't have to know the person than hogwarts could take the names of all the smartes muggles and people of all Time and put them to work in her portrait libary.
