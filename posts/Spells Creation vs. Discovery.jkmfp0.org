I was reading a story where Harry can make a shield which can block the power of the Cruciatus Curse. Dumbledore describes it as a spell Harry “discovered” even though this is the first instance any of them have heard of it occurring. I know the wiki says “spell creation”, but since I doubt that some of the spells are exactly what the person wanted, do you think it is more a “discovery” of what works rather than something “created”?


** Discovery and invention are often used interchangeably. The discovery of a new medicine, for example. Granted, there is a distinction between the two terms but I find fanfiction to hardly be a place to expect perfect English. In addition, spellcasting in the books seems to be fairly theoretical, and discovery works well when it comes to referring to theory.

** I think it hugely depends on the magical system you're writing and how you think spells are found, divined, discovered or made

** With things like equations you can create one but if someone else was trying to do the same thing they'd probably end up with the same result, so it could also be seen as discovering an equation that was already part of the world. Spells could be similar.
