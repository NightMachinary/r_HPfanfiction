** I wouldn't mind seeing this either. [[/u/NedryOS]] is correct in that the sub isn't as active as most, but a bi-weekly/monthly sort of occasion couldn't hurt, right?

And who knows? It might be the catalyst to summon more lurkers from the shadows of FF.net and anywhere else that they might be hiding.

** I'd like that. We're too small to get something big going, but weekly/monthly AMA's could be fun.

** You don't sound stupid, and I wouldn't mind seeing an AMA. Perhaps with [[/u/Taure]] or with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3489773/murkybluematter][murkybluematter]].

*** Aww. I squealed when I saw murkybluematter and thought they had a reddit then found that the link went to their ffnet account. :/

**** Yeah, it would be nice if Violet got a Reddit account, but I don't think she will.

** I tried starting my own ama while bored one day, didn't go well but i write too much smut to be mainstream as an author.

** I don't think this sub is active enough to have a quality ama session, even if it's a general post questions for authors and anyone can answer sort of thing. There used to be a sticky occasionally for random questions like that.

*** Well if they were scheduled I think it could work. Knowing ahead of time would improve turnout and allow people to formulate good questions.

** As a writer, I'd love to do an AMA, if anyone actually wanted to ask me something.

** Yeah, it could be a group AMA even. Like, several authors could sign up/volunteer to answer questions several days before the AMA. Then people could post a bunch of questions in a designated thread and various authors could come in and go through and answer stuff.

There could be 'general' questions for any of the authors to answer, and author specific questions.

I'd be game for answering stuff if anyone actually gave a crap. Not sure anyone would.

*** Its pretty much how you said it. Its going to be a group AMA, and if you're still interested in being a part of it (Because I'd love to have you since your stories were actually one of the first I ever read on FFN), drop a comment on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5evxyt/author_ama_announcement/][this post]].

We have 2 more spots empty, and I'm taking submissions from that post.
