I always asked myself how it happened that the Weasleys had developed such a dislike about anything Slytherin. While the hate is exaggerated in the fandom, there is a clear dislike. The reason this made no sense in my opinion is because Arthurs Mother was most likely a Slytherin. She was a Black by birth and Sirius stated that everyone in his Family was in Slytherin. Also Mollys Aunt by marriage was in Slytherin too - as she also was a Black.

So isn't it weird that little eleven year old Ron Weasley is afraid of going to Slytherin when he has relatives - even close ones like his Grandma - who were in that house? Was there ever any explanation beside "most dark wizards come from there" - even if there are examples in their family that prove while most dark wizards come from Slytherin not every Slytherin becomes dark?

*** I would wager tons of the weasleys died in the war

we know they have a large extended family

so I would wager it used to be much larger and arthur lost most of his brothers in the war

Arthur has only two brothers - as Septimus and Cedrella had three sons - and Bilius Weasley only died after the war because Fred can actually remember him. But I agree that it is possible that other Weasleys - Cousins, Great-Cousins and so on could have died in the war. The Weasleys were called "the greatest bunch of bloodtraitors" - so they would have been hunted. And than we knew of the Prewetts.

I can imagine that that would have changed their few of Slytherin even if there were some "good Slytherins" in their own family. Even the Slytherins in their own family would probably hate their own house for being a breeding ground for the ideas that killed their family. Never thought about that, thank you.

** It might have something to do with the war that ended just a decade ago, where one side was recruited mostly from that particular House.

Or maybe Fred and George told Ron that Slytherins do satanic rituals in their Common Room on every weekend, or something like that. I mean, I wouldn't put it past them.

Hahaha okay, that is officially my new head canon - Harry ended up in Gryffindor because of Fred and Georges Pranks - because they told Ron Slytherin is really bad and he told it to Harry. Sure, Ron wasn't the only reason Harry said "Not Slytherin" - there were Hagrid and Draco too - but I really like that head canon.

** Arthur personally and vocally hates Lucius Malfoy, and does not shy away from this fact (the brawl in Flourish and Blotts in front of all his children for one, and upon first meeting Draco, Fred asks with disgust, "aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son?"). The Malfoys embody the most stereotypical Slytherin traits, and the Weasleys despise them. I feel like that dislike could have been extrapolated to the house they're tied to, and that could have shaped how Slytherin was discussed in the Burrow.

*** man I want to hear an average dinner table conversation after a long day at the ministry for arthur. after a while I bet he didn't even have to specify who he was talking about, he just walked right out the fireplace like "y'all will not BELIEVE what that asshole did today!"

We don't really know about her character, do we?

For all we know, she was an utter bitch.

Mother-in-law Tropes are very clich√© though.

But on a broader sense, do hate and prejudice make sense anyway?

** I have a sequal brewing for my current fic where an OC daughter of Ron and Hermione (not Rose) falls for a Slytherin girl. I anticipate I will have a lot of fun writing Ron's reaction to that...!

Are there any good fics out there that has Ron properly confront his prejudice?
