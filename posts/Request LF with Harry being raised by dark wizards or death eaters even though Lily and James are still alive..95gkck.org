Not necessarily looking for a dark/grey Harry fic, or at least not throughout the entire story. Stuff like /The Dark Prince Trilogy/ by Kurinoone if that helps narrows it down a bit. Would prefer no James, Lily, Weasley, Hermione, or Dumbledore bashing, but not required. Any help would be much appreciated!


** linkffn(Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7) fits what you want to a tee, it is appearing to be a better written Dark Prince thus far. Currently updating and well worth a read.

Edit: Ignore the cringe summary, it is a very poor description of the fic.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.
