  Remus is returning to Hogwarts for the first time since he graduated. Instead of a student, however, he is the professor, and instead of James Potter, it's Harry. This story shows the events of PoA from Remus Lupin's POV.

** So weird but the one I'm recommending is called Moonys Tale too and I'm pretty sure it's a different fic. It's wolfstar and part of a series that starts with [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/940338][Padfoots Tale]] . Linkao3(946711). This fic series is great, I highly recommend them.

  1993-94: Twelve years have passed and Remus still cannot forget, nor is he any closer to understanding why Sirius betrayed his friends and the man he loved. Now Sirius has escaped from prison, and Remus has come back to Hogwarts looking for answers. A retelling of Prisoner of Azkaban from Remus's point of view. Heavy in Marauders-era and First Wizarding War flashbacks.Warning: This story has not been edited yet, and may contain unintended problematic elements and tropes.
