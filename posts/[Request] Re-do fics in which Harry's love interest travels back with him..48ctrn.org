I love re-do fics, but the awkward "actually an adult who looks like a 10 year old is in love with an actual 10 year old who hasn't met him yet" business tends to ruin them a bit, imo.

  An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals? Assassinate Death Eaters, destroy Horcruxes, and deal with Voldemort's hidden contingency plan... by any means necessary. And maybe they'll fix a few other things along the way.

*** Very good story overall, but this ending was rather weak. He spent a lot of time building up Voldemort to be an ultimate evil, then ended up dealing with him too quickly and simply. After that much buildup, a story needs an adequate catharsis; without it, readers are left feeling disappointed.

Also, I was a bit disappointed at Hermione being reduced to a damsel in distress at the end - after spending so much time training and fighting, she deserved better. In his other story, The Last Casualties, she's given a more equal a role which I appreciate.

It is a well-written story overall, and I've re-read it myself several times. The ending is just...kind of a fizzle rather than a bang.

Muggledad wrote that he did it that way because he wanted readers to focus on the relationship between Harry and Hermione, which is fair. He does a good job with that part of the story. The value of "catharsis" in a story is not, however, to be underestimated. When you set up a character is a threat or as dangerous, you need a pay-off that is equal to your build-up.

  Angsty story based on Broomstick Flyers story 'Please Believe Me'. Heavy Hermione bashing to start, but will be H/Hr. Timetravel, AU, and limited soulbond. Please Read & Review Upping the rating due to language.

**** Well, the majority of multi-pairing fics with half the summary dedicated to tags, especially when time travel is involved, pretty much exist /to/ cruise through every obstacle like nothing. It's wish fulfillment. I don't find it engaging, but there are people (a lot of them, apparently) who just enjoy watching everything go right for the characters they like.

****** I just tried reading the first chapter. Thought it was a pretty boring, exposition-filled butchering of the English grammar (seriously, there were so many commas and semicolons in there, they legitimately warped the meanings of sentences). I commend you for seeing it through to completion.

**** I completely agree - there was an almost total lack of conflict that really undermined the quality. The story is still better than a lot of what gets published, but there is so much lost promise.

A good example is how the angels come along and solve some problems so quickly and easily, like getting the parents to understand the unique situation the kids are in. As a result, there's never any friction, never any misunderstandings, and so the characters never have to work at improving their relationships.

Which, of course, means the characters don't really develop.

***** As i said, I really really wanted it to be good. It's just the lack of any conflict that made it dull. The author missed some great oppritunities for conflict with their relationship, other students, death eaters, etc. they all quickly crumbled with no challenge

****** When it comes to dealing with the bad guys, sometimes it's enjoyable escapism to see the main characters just /do it right/.

But I agree that it was too easy to just have the angels tell the parents to just deal with it -- that was a missed opportunity for character conflict and development.

Sometimes they didn't necessarily double check their grammar, but it's still a good read.
