In my opinion, there's quite a bit wrong with Hogwarts as a school - architecture traps and tricks that slow down students, a student division system that is set up to pit students against each other and prevents them from fully developing all their character traits, no internet access...

Are there any fan fics where any characters get together and establish a new school from the ground up? If not, I might write one myself. It seems a pity that one wouldn't have been written already just because people are so comfortable with the familiar setting of Hogwarts.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

** In the series that starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10449375/1/The-Cupboard-Under-the-Stairs][The Cupboard Under the Stairs by Stargon1]] they create a new school. Just to warn you: The series sucks. Don't know why I bother to read them.

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.
