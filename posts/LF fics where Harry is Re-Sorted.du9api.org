I feel like there used to be this trope--not a big super popular trope, mind, just one that had quite a few good fics--where Harry was in Gryffindor as per canon, and then got re-sorted for whatever reason. The only ones I can now find are 'Other People's Choices' by Lomonaaeren and 'Evitave' by Vichan. Where are all these fun fics?

Like, I know I've read several. I seem to recall one in particular with Umbrage deciding the Hat wasn't impartial since it took the students ideas into account or something, and another one with the Sorting Hat itself deciding to go off the rails. Anyway, if anybody can find those or other fics of this type, that would be great (: Don't care what house he gets re-sorted into, don't care about relationships or anything, just... Re-sorting.

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13256350/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Scrambled-Sorting]]) features a rogue Sorting Hat. I particularly like this fic because it has the robust character interactions akin to that of best crack fics without actually being a crack fic itself.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

  After the defeat of Lord Voldemort, many of the students, among them Harry Potter, returned to Hogwarts for a repeat Seventh Year. With his girlfriend, Ginny, and his friends, Harry wants this year to be normal. Until it is announced that all returning students will be resorted. How will this effect Harry's relationship, and where does this blonde bombshell fit into the picture?

***** Yeah, I had the idea of being resorted ages ago. I started my own fic about it, but I stopped cause I felt like it wasn't good.

I want to start writing again, cause I have loads of ideas, but I can never get them down the way I imagine them.

The main idea of the Resorting though, was for whoever your preferred character is, have a chance to meet other characters in different houses as there wasn't much inter-house interaction. Plus any pairings you'd like to have in Hogwarts.

** linkffn( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4787480/chapters/10955036]])

Golden Age by zeitgeistic is a super fun 8th year fic where Harry is resorted into Hufflepuff. Turns out the Hufflepuffs are a much more complex house with traditions no one expected. Also all the magic is leaving Britain for some reason and Harry and his new housemates have to figure out why.

Good fic, but it's drarry so if you don't dig that ship you most likely won't enjoy the story.

EDIT - Bot linked the wrong one. Hopefully this one works
