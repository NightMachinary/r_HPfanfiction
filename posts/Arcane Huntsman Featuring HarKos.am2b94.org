A Harry Potter/RWBY What If? idea I've had since Pyhrra's death in Volume 3.

Basically, Jaune doesn't exist-*. Instead of our favorite blonde dolt, we have a black haired sorcerer. Harry Potter is killed by Voldemort at the battle of Hogwarts. He wakes up in a White Fang camp, having been reborn as a wolf Faunus (physically he is around 15-16). Over the next few weeks, he learns about the world of Remnant and how to fight. While there, he discovers that a young, red haired, human girl is being held prisoner. He helps her escape and gets her to her mother in Mistral. The young girl is Pyrrha and she lives with her mother Phaedra Nikos**.

Harry is soon introduced to Professor Ozpin and Qrow Branwen. Ozpin invites Harry to attend Beacon. A blacksmith forges a sword and shield for Harry who trains with Pyrrha in preparation for attending Beacon. During initiation, Harry teams up with Pyrrha as co-leader of team PHRN (Pyrrha, Harry, Ren, Nora)***.

* I do not hate Jaune. In fact, Jaune is the character I identify with the most. I just can't find a way to fit him in the story.

** I'm undecided whether to have her father still be around, or divorced, or separated.

*** At first, Harry and Pyrrha are paired with Russell Thrush and Cardin Winchester, respectively. Cardin wouldn't stop hitting on Pyrrha so Harry pushes Ozpin to switch them (Yes, Pyrrha can fight and could wipe the floor with Cardin, but she's gotta sleep sometime.)


** Great! There isn't many good RWBY-HP crossovers.

  weapon choice seems bad, think its going to be pretty hard for him to use magic when he is running around with both sword and shield. Unless you randomly make his sword magic conductive? Though that just seems awkward.

Like [[/u/luminphoenix][u/luminphoenix]] pointed out, weapon choice is a little bit gross. After seeing Crescent Rose, Ember Celica and Gambol Shroud; a simple sword and shield seems lame to me. I am expecting an original weapon. A weapon that makes Ruby go ballistic -/'So this is your weapon? So cool! What is its name?'/

*** He's able to use magic without a wand. What weapon would you suggest?

**** Something original, perhaps something that plays to his past as a wizard? Also depends on how you want him to fight, magic is midrange, do you want melee so he isnt overwhelmed? Or longranged sniper/bombarder? Something that changes between melee/ranged?

***** How about a broadsword that shifts into a rifle?
