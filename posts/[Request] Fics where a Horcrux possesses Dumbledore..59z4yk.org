** Oh boy, that sounds interesting. I could see it happening, the Ring Horcrux instead of placing a lethal curse on Dumbledore, leaves him alone when he slips it on his finger, discreetly pushing through his Occlumency shields until his mind is completely under its control.

Did you have a specific fic in mind that you were searching for, or were you just fishing for fics with the general idea?

*** I recently read a fiction where diary possessed Dumbledore. Dumbledore recognized TM Riddle name but out of curiosity, he wrote in it. There's a fault though. The fiction also assumed writing once is enough to possess someone based on a canon line completely ignoring Harry wrote too in the diary but not possessed. Unfortunately can't remember the name.

**** Maybe the diary horcrux recognized the scarcrux and didn't do anything because it assumed Harry was already being possessed.
