I feel like this is all i ever do here... Anyways, I require help in finding a fanfiction... Here is all I remember of the story, but not the title.

1. Harry goes to America
2. There is a hookup with Luna involved, i.e its a Harry/Luna story
3. Albus Dumbledore is evil/seriously misguided
4. Harry becomes like a warding expert in America
5. Its fairly long, if I remember. Not like over 100,000 words, but not a oneshot ; maybe between 20,000 and 50,000 words?
6. Harry puts his own name under the fidelious charm, so everyone forgets it.
7. He meets Luna at an American Muggle university, and his fake name is John?? or something starting with J i think....

Thanks, once again!


** The story you are looking for is very likely /Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia/ by /arekay/. It only just beats the 100k words limit too ;) linkffn(8257400)

*** You my friend, are a frickin genius. Tell me, how did you find it so quickly? Personal experience reading or it, or am I missing out on some secret google-fu technique?

Either way, thanks a whole lot!

**** No secret google-fu I'm afraid. I read the story last year and it was rather easy to find, because I save a local copy of whatever I read online (at least from ff.net and other such archives).

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.
