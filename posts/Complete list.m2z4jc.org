Is there a list of famous fics? I'm looking for the best, long, completed fics.

*** I personally sort by reviews to accomplish the same thing - it basically gives the same results, but tends to skew towards longer fics. And it probably works okay for famous, but the “/s” is pretty necessary if you're asking for best
