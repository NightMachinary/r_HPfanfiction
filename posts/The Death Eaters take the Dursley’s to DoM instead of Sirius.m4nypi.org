  Harry went alone to the Department of Mysteries. He expected to find Sirius a prisoner there... he hadn't expected the Death Eaters to have other hostages.

** I don't know the fic... but I seriously think Harry would have saved them anyway. I don't think he would have rushed into danger like he did with Sirius - but he would have tried to find Order members who save them. That's what he did in DH. Harry may not like them, he may even hate them... but he is too good of a person to let them die. He even saved Draco - after Draco tried to kill him.
