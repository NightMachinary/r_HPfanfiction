** Been puzzling this one for a bit. At first I was 'perhaps this is a pronunciation shift and they meant Gilderoy Rockhart, or Ginny or George Reasley', but then I was listening to the radio and it all made sense- Harry Potter/Gavin Rossdale.

Don't know any, but I bet there's a fandom if you write one.

As for Harry/Hermione adult stories...

HP and the Sword of Gryffindor comes to mind, though any harem story written before the last movie was released has an 80% chance of being Hermione-led. After that there was a shipping war backlash or something.
