Maybe he flinches when someone comes near, or when there are loud noises, etc. Just some negative side effects to being captured and tortured by Death Eaters and the long journey of trying to get better.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or new

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

NO Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.

Not looking for pairings, but I'm fine with het/slash/femslash, etc.

The first one that comes to mind for me. It is post war AU Snape redemption but extremely grudgingly. It is NOT Snape/Harry slash. It has quite the torture scenes so not for the squeamish.

  After killing Voldemort during seventh year, Harry vanished without a trace. But now, 8 years later, a deadly secret forces him to return and it seems that only Snape will be able to save him. SSHP, no slash

** Dark, very explicit, trio fic with eventual canon-compliant happy ending. Some chapters are over-the-top dramatic but a fairly compelling story of recovery overall
