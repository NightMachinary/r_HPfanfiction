Fics with lots of cameraderie in them. Generally the ones I've seen are peggy sue fics, and they're generally great as a couple of friends just arsing around and enjoying themselves while possibly actually achieving something. You all know what I'm talking about: linkffn(A Black Comedy), linkffn(Gryffindors Never Die), and from the Naruto side: linkffn(Reload by Case13) (the first chapters at least) and linkffn(I am Not Going Through Puberty Again!). Fanfictions from either fandom (and Worm as well) are what I'm looking for.

  They've been there. They've done that. And they didn't even get a shirt to prove it. Reload - because sometimes things are just as they seem to be, and at times they are even more.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

  Our heroes did not come from a future where everything has gone horribly wrong. They did not travel back in time to save the world from a bleak or miserable fate. As a matter of fact, all they want to do is find a way back home as soon as possible. [cracky, epilogue-compliant time travel fic] [Now has a TV Tropes page!]

*** I've read all those, and while I enjoyed all of them I'm more looking for the jovial, usually semi-drunk kind of cameraderie, the kind you'd find with your mates down the pub instead of super-serious war-forged bonds. Of course, that might be how they became friends but that's not really the tone of the fics I'm looking for.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** I'd recommend [[http://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_ginny/aon/a/0/An+Old+And+New+World/Lens%20of%20Sanity/37][An Old and New Wold by Lens of Sanity]]. It's been taken down from ffn for some reason but it's still available by that link. It has the kind of flying by the seat of his pants, crackish quality that I think lends to the type of thing you're looking for. With an ensemble cast of a Harry who has unjustly been thrown into azkaban and is not giving anymore shits, a Tom Riddle stuck inside a young girls body, a psychotic Bellatrix Lestrange who has been hand wavingly redeemed, a time traveling Luna Lovegood here to save us all from a horrifying future, plus all the others we know and love we join the crew on a magical zeppelin (extorted from magical Britain) cruising around to take down a pretty badass Voldemort.
