I absolutely /love/ Slughorn. I don't why exactly, but whenever he makes an appearance in a fic I'm reading, I get absurdly excited. There isn't a whole lot of great fic about him. Mostly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2955254/1/A-Black-Christmas][this]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3469424/1/Chance-Meetings][this]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3833863/1/Nocturnal-missions][this]].


** Percy, although I'm not totally sure why. Perhaps it's just because he's rarely paid the slightest bit of attention in most fics (up to the point that it's actually possible to forget that he exists at all).

But out of the Weasley family, he's the oddball. Most the Weasleys seem to be the adventurous sort, so what made Percy such a stickler for the rules when none of his siblings are? As a middle brother, it's easy to be overlooked, but his character is practically invisible, despite not being 'out of the country' for the majority of the series like his older brothers are. His relationship with his family is very distant: his mother seems to think him too ambitious; you rarely see him interact with his older brothers, but when you do it involves them trying to annoy him and teasing him; his younger brothers think he has a stick wedged up his behind and, in the twins case, actively make his life as difficult as possible; and his father never seems to comment about him at all, as if he's forgotten he's there, or is ashamed of him for some reason.

Then, what did he go through in the war? He was one of the only Weasleys to actively work in the Ministry whilst it was under the Dark Lord's control, and in very close proximity to the Minister himself (if he managed to hold onto the position he had under the previous Minister).

How difficult is it to admit to your family that you were wrong, and to reconcile with them? How do you rebuild a relationship with the family you abandoned in their greatest time of need?

Anyway, my point is that Percy's character has a lot of potential that is never realised, and barely anyone bothers with him in fics even though it's a great opportunity to write a character with real flaws and depth, who can see the whole series from a totally unique perspective. There aren't enough good stories with him as a proper character.

I might actually be nervous to meet her myself now because for the first time it was impressed upon me that THIS IS THE QUEEN and not just some ... local celebrity or something.

** I love reading/writing Lavender and Cho. I didn't like them growing up, but writing fics for them showed me how strong they both are. They're the best portrayals of "normal" people in war and both end up scarred by it (physically and/or emotionally). And we actually see them quite a bit in canon, so their personality isn't a huge mystery.

** I would love to write and read stories centred around unused characters such as Dennis Creevey, Kevin Entwhistle, Theodore Nott, Rodolphus Lestrange, etc. I think they would be great exercises in character creation, and since both Creevey and Entwhistle are muggle-born, show us the wonder of discovering magic.

** Gellert Grindelwald. I think that the Grindelwald/Dumbledore relationship when they were young (romantic or not) is really interesting and I'm surprised there aren't more fics about it. War-era Grindelwald sounds interesting too, but I'd especially love to see a "Grindelwald escapes Nurmengard" story set during the events of the books.

** I'm fascinated by characters that seemed to be introduced just to fit a role, but had some interesting but underdeveloped hints as to their depth. A few examples, none of which will be surprising if you've read the story I'm working on :)

Cedric Diggory - didn't get much development in canon, but seemed to be propped up to be kind of an idealized Hogwarts student (good-looking, good at Quidditch, charismatic) so it would be extra-tragic when he died. How did he get that good? What kind of pressure, external or internal, made him that way? How did he handle his popularity? What did he want to do with his life? All questions I'm interested in.

You can apply this same reasoning to characters like Viktor Krum, Cho Chang, and Fleur Delacour - all characters who were shown to excel in one way or another. Characters who shine like that, but you never get a PoV from, I always wonder - how did they get that way, and how do they deal with the consequences of standing out, both good and bad?

*** Several good points about Cedric. In keeping with your theme of canon casting him a Mary-Sue, I think Amos' strange attempts to bait Harry Potter fit in with that very well.

In GoF none of Ced's actions seemed to fit with JKR's exotlment of his virtues. It may be cruel to say, but I didn't really feel anything when he died other than 'maybe this will finally shut up his dad.'

** Hedwig (as an owl, not an animagus). I think she's really hard to do well, though, as there are certainly an awful lot of poor efforts that have Hedwig doing a lot more than giving reproachful looks.

Thanks for your links to the Slughorn fics. He's an interesting character and I wish he would have had more exposition on his backstory in canon.

*** I try desperately to include as much Hedwig as possible. I like to make female leads jealous of her, and if possible highlight the link between Harry and Hedwig to the point that other people think they must be mentally linked.

Hedwig as a true Familiar instead of as a Pet is always awesome, though actual mental communication pushes it sometimes. I imagine her to be like Archimedes from 'Sword and the Stone' but unable to talk.

*** I hadn't really thought about Hedwig. The only fics I've read about her are those hagwiggle ones that pair her with Hagrid, so... yeah.

Believe it or not, I found a NSFW Slughorn fic that's very in-character but I think it's slightly squicky. He features heavily in some of these Snape/Lily schooldays fics I've read, but he usually isn't portrayed in such a great light.

** Not necessarily read, but I have a huge list of stories that I need to write just piling up like a to-do list. Can't write nearly as fast as I have story ideas, and I have sooooo many plot bunnies. Let's see, after my story about Ginny, I have:

1. story about Percy in the war
2. a two-part/possible trilogy about Dumbledore's childhood heavily featuring his siblings and Gellert Grindewald
3. Black sisters - no idea what, just Black sisters
4. Regulus Black
5. the original Order of Phoenix

Ugh, I'm highly motivated to write stories but never to finish them, so I'm not starting another until I finish the one I'm currently working on. It's tough.

** I would say Ginny. Canon has an outline of a personality for her, but doesn't really give her much importance in the narrative. I love stories like /Backwards with a Purpose/ and /Strangers of Drakeshaugh/ that show more of her personality.

The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567446/1/The-Ring-of-Gold][Death Gate trilogy]] is a really underrated Ginny-centric mystery fanfic. I would love to see more stories like that one.

** Gabby is probably the most minor character I enjoy writing / reading.

Xeno Lovegood ... because he is odd and fun, but also kinda sad. More sad than Luna who I don't consider "minor".

Daphne or Pansy are both very fun to read/write... I think Pansy ended up being my favorite scenes and favorite female lead in 'Searching for the Power' while Daphne was almost too good not to include in the harem.

After reading so much fanfiction, I'm not sure there are many "minor" characters left.
