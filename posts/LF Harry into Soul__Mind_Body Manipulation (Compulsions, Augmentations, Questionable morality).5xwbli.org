So I'm looking for fics in which Harry actively looks into or practices magic manipulating the soul/mind/body. Something more permanent than a continuously cast Imperius or temporary transfigurations, more like the dark marks and horcruxes. Obviously it would involve a lot of experimentation and questionable morality depending on who he practices on even if it's only on himself and death eaters. What I'm looking for are fics in which Harry already has or is on the brink of abandoning his humanity.

.

Examples of magic would be:

Soul - splitting it, trading it, sacrificing his or that of others, manipulating/anchoring it to another item/body (Sorting hat?), using it as a means of hiding a secret/items/space, astral projection, posession

Mind - erasing, replacing, splitting into multiple identities, altering, quickening, combining with another's, swapping

Body - shapeshifting, race change, sex change, creating a hybrid by mixing species, augmentation with prosthetics like Moody, shapeless slime, elasticity, indestructibility, uhm... a lack of physical body?, being a pet, being a sofa (Slughorn's got that covered)

.

Of course Harry isn't supposed to practice all of that at once but any fics that feature a combination or facet of soul/mind/body altering magic in which Harry delves into are welcome.


** Linkffn(for love of magic by noodlehammer). Definitely lots of experimentation and questionable ethics.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror

** There are a couple that come to mind. Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat). In which Harry is blind but can see magic. He starts out with more conventional magical experimentation, but the project he's tackling in the latest chapters, starts delving heavily into soul magic.

and

Linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning by Lomonaaeren). In which Harry is not the BWL. He ends up being overlooked, and turns to Transfiguration as a means to protect himself from the Dursley's. Lots of body experimentation.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
