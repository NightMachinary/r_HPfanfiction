I was in the DLP library the other day and came across a not to rare story. Back again Harry by Jedi Buttercup

I was wondering if any one could recommend some other similar fics to this? I've already read most of the time travel fics in the DLP library so if anyone knows of some others that aren't already common knowledge it would be appreciated.

Preferably no slash please.

Thanks


** [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterPeggySue]] This might not be what you mean, but it might help. Most of those are about people's minds going back in time and inhabiting their past selves' bodies, but some of them have (erroneously categorized) full-body time travel, and a few have both.

** I haven't read the story you mentioned, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11289525/1/A-Good-Teacher][A Good Teacher]] has a Harry who goes back in time to be his own teacher on his muggle primary school... I thought you might enjoy it?

  Terrible things happen to wizards who meddle with time. When that wizard is Harry Potter, the terrible things tend to happen to other people instead. Fourth Year. Time Travel.
