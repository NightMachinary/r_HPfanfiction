What i mean by that is: No one will be argue that they cant be together/fuck each other because its incest. Lets say Ginny sleeps with her Brother/s (doesnt matter if she is still with Harry or not) or the Next Gen children with each other or their Parent family members, they wont argue with the Incest Term, but accept it for "Its ok, you love each other (doesnt have to be REAL love, can also be just sexual attractivity) so live your Love and Sexlife."

As an example: Family Event, Weasley Christmas Celebration: Ron asks Teddy how his Life is going and he responses "Oh, its good. I recently slept with Ginny, it was pretty good" and Ron (and Harry) smiles because he is glad that his Godnephew liked it and Proud of his Sister that she could be a great Experience for him. Ok, Teddy is no Blood relative by i guess, the idea is clear.

To be honest, i havent thought about the Spouse reaction to this, just the others, so to make everyone happy it would be some sort of "Open marriage for certain circumstances"


** You're... uh... probably not going to find that here. Even the few people here that do read incest probably haven't come across many (if any) fics like that.

** There is some in linkffn(Lily Potter and the Witches of Salem) though the whole story is just porn, There´s also a lot of cousin fucking in linkffn(The Long Game), but that´s by far not the main point of the story, sometimes I think, I chose a bad username, because I can just feel being judged for knowing the first story.

#+begin_quote
  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)

*** Ehm. The Long Game has more than cousin fucking. I do believe the Gaunt twins frequently get freaky with each other.

**** Well, in that story [[/spoiler][It's pretty much masturbation, though it is the closest to direct incest we get I believe.]]
