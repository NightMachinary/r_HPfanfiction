Easily bypassing Dumbledore's Age Line, Peeves decides to toss more names into the Goblet.

At the feast, Dumbledore is increasingly flustered as once every thirty seconds, a new piece of parchment flies out of the Goblet. Among said names: Myrtle Warren, Cornelius Fudge, Pomona Sprout, Merlin, Your Mom, Argus Filch, Percy Weasley, Wee Potty, Peeves The Prestigious Poltergeist, and Sirius Black. Each of these is now entered into a binding magical contract to complete the tournament.


** "Harry Potter!"

It was as if the Great Hall had gone completely silent at once, and, suddenly every set of eyes there was turning to Harry. Eventually, he stood up, but a new burst of flame distracted him.

"Pomona Sprout!" Dumbledore yelled now,

The alluded professor jumped on her place, after a questioning look from McGonagall, "I- I didn't-" she managed.

Then new flames threw Percy's name in the air, who was gobsmacked by it, to say the least. The twins' names came next, and everyone was suspecting them already when a the name of "Moaning Myrtle"

"He can't mean..."

"The ghost?"

The whispers grew to a loud mumbling as Dumbledore read the name of Peeves out of a parchment. The silence long forgotten.

"Argus Filch," the headmaster said next, causing the caretaker to pale and almost fell on his face in shock.

Igor Karkaroff rushed to the front, "Is this some sort of joke to you?" the headmaster of DUrmstrang said, when the flames threw anew piece of parchment.

"Your Mom." Dumbledore read, looking at Karkaroff.

Karkaroff caught a paper himself, this time reading "Sirius Black." and he almost toppled over.

"Enough! What's the meaning of this? Dumbledore?" asked the minister.

A new name flew to them, "Cornelius Fudge" read Dumbledore.

"You can't expect me to..."

Then the flame burst out last time before shutting off, and Dumbledore caught the last name, "Voldemort" he read.

*** "You can't really expect my mother to take any part on this!" thundered Karkaroff half an hour later. "She's 90."

"It is a binding contract. She'll have to do it, or risk losing her magic."

"But Sirius Black... can't appear, can he? We would arrest him." said Fudge.

"Maybe he doesn't find and loses his magic."

"He will find out, after all, this will be front page on the news tomorrow."

"Myrtle can't leave her bathroom, can she?" Harry asked.

"It won't matter, the contract can't do anything against her, she's already dead."

"At least we don't have to worry about this ghost, or You-Know-Who. The ghost is already dead, and the other... you know... gone." said Fudge

** I'd enjoy this, but mostly if the only thing Peeves put in was the 'yo mama' and we had an entire story where Kendra Dumbledore (since Dumbledore took the parchment from the cup, he'd semantically be the 'your' of the paper) rises from the dead and participates in the Tournament.

  Harry and Hermione decide to help Fred and George to enter their names into the Goblet of Fire. Then, they enter some more names. Chaos ensues... A story that combines humour, logic, canon concepts, and some unique plot bunnies into a 4th-year tale that's hopefully different. COMPLETE
