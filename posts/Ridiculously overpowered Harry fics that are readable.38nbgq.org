** Define "ridiculously" <edit, after being snarked at by a bot>... In terms of how overwhelming powerful Harry has to be

Harry is fairly overpowered in a number of fics where he's come out the other side of canon as the MoD and then wandered off to another world via cross-over/dimensional jaunts, or reincarnation. How much this matters depends on where he ends up due to the power of some of the natives:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to put your galleons where your mouth is]] Harry as Sirius's older brother but with all his memories kinda bulldozes the first war rather handily seeing as he lacks proper competition from normal wizards. A fun read tho.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] Harry crossed with the Avengers movies, Harry is ridiculously overpowered... but so are the natives like the Hulk... so it works.

For Harry/Avengers there's also a X-men/Fantastic Four centric (but with the avengers going on around them) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327/1/A-Third-Path-to-the-Future][Third Path to the Future]] in which Harry is certainly Overpowered (though Magneto is equally OP... not unexpectedly) but I'd say it's slightly less "readable" than the others listed here... in a needs another pass by the editor sense to weed out some auto-correct issues sort of way. I mention it primarily because IF it passes muster for your definition of readable it IS almost a million words and still ongoing and I suspect that the higher incidence of typos is due to the author putting out chapters nearly the size of Sorcerer's Stone almost monthly on average.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6451035/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Second-Life][Harry Potter and the second life]] originally a silver aegis rewrite / continuation that went in it's own direction. But you don't read this one for the OP Harry, you read it to see a sports!Hermione punch purebloods repeatedly. /violent, that one is/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][Havoc Side of the Force]] are Harry potter crossed with Star Wars... on both counts Harry's use of magic baffle and upset the Jedi. Along for the ride are either an OP assassin droid (HK-47 from the KOTOR games) or an OP mechanic (Dobby as a ship's 'mechanic' really ought to be self explanatory.)

Also, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][The Black Prince]] which is set in Game of Thrones... and Harry isn't truly overpowered /yet/ but given what he's managed to accomplish thus far /without/ a bloody wand, I can't fathom him not being a force to be reckoned with once he manages to put one together.

** Depending on what you call readable, "Where in the World is Harry Potter?" is a good one. It has Harry acting... Marauder-ish, I guess would be the best way to describe it, on a massive scale, with a power level to match. On mobile, linking is a pain. I'll try and remember to edit this comment when it's not nearly 2am for me.

**** I had never read slash before but I read this recently and it was fucking amazing. If you watch GoT or Spartacus there is slash in there that's usually how bad it gets in this fic but you can often easily skip those parts if you want. So don't hold slash against enjoying a good fic imo.

********* Yes, it is.

However, personal preference is that a character's canon sexuality is unchanged.

Additionally, I do not have good experience with fics where the main character is gay. They tend, in my experience, to focus on the sex more than the relationship and any social/emotional consequences for the characters, and that is a major NOPE for me for the same reason anal is a major NOPE in my eyes.

EDIT: if a character is gay in canon, I will likewise refuse to read fics where that character is anything but gay. I'll just avoid fics where that character is a main character, for the above reasons.

******* I agree with this. Harry's sexuality is not central to his character in the books. In fact I think if ginny was a Johnny harry might've still ended up with them because he fell in love with her personality. Yea looks helped but Ginny had a nice fiery personality that Harry was attracted to.
