** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/][Ruthless]] might qualify. It's very much focused on plot, so might not be quite as smutty as you'd like. It's Harry/Hermione, and also Hermione/Theo.

*** Wait... Harry Hermione, then Hermione Theo? And the description says Harry/Hermione/Theo. A 3 way relationship or?...

Count me confused as to how this stories pairings work.

Unlike the other stories that were recommended, I feel like this one has TOO much smut. Haha. The smut overtakes the plot quite often in this story, I've found (which was extremely disappointing to me, personally, but it sounds like it's exactly what you're looking for). However, it's starring a "Grey" Harry that's only in it for himself and for advancing his own knowledge and power. It's written pretty well, but the pacing at times slogs when the author decides to dedicate a substantial amount of time to the smut rather than advancing the plot. Clocks in at almost 700k words currently.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
