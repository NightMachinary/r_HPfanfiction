Hi guys. After reading a LOT of fanfiction related to Harry Potter, I'd like to ask for your help, because I have come to the point where I don't know what to read and I still want to read HP fanfics.

So I am looking for works where Harry is sent to Azkaban (not required) and receives an inheritance, like in Earl of the North or King of Atlatis (19 chapters)...it can be unusual powers though I tend to lean mostly towards him becoming a ruler (king etc.). It should contain an unusual or more controversial pairing (any of the Black sisters, doesn't matter if only 1 or multiple, Nymphadora, Fleur, Apolline, maybe even Lily (controversial), or lesser used ones or even from other universes, like Star Wars, but PLEASE, NO LUNA, that girl is obviously not close to this f*cking universe, even after somebody dies you don't act like that, been there, done that). Should/could contain bashing of Dumbing-the-door, the Redhead animal family, the 'mudblood' (sorry for offending anyone, but she's just that infuriating with her attitude) and other bashings...and there is a work where the death sissies follow Harry and he breaks from the wizarding Alcatraz and Sirius with a few others finds his godson in bed with Bella....can you remind me what is it's name? I liked it but can't find it...

Next, CROSSOVERS!!! (that was meant as a bad joke)...Heavily leaning towards marrying/being a fiancee/boyfriend with Natasha Romanoff (can do the actress, Scarlett) or Maria Hill (I don't think I ever read anything with her in a romantic light, except in that one where they fight a bunch of aliens that infiltrate the ministry or Sif...any sexy female (not being sexist) from The Avengers universe, maybe even multiple at the same time...I haven't actually found anything Harry/fem Xenomorph or Hary/fem Predator (I can't remember the race name beyond a confusing Yuitja) or both, so feel free to suggest them...I'd like Harry/Azula (yes, that one, I remember even now, some 8 years later the fun I had watching Avatar as a kid) or or any decent looking female from that universe (or multiple, can't hurt a guy with that :) ) Also, multiple (may be single) Sith Ladies or/and Jedis would be appreciated. Harems with other Universes' females or even native universe ones are not discouraged, but please, get rid of your ideea that LongSquib is a good friend of Harry and gets Hannah and/or Susan, it doesn't sound believable, for a FF, not even close....more MILFs in his harem, the better...any other crossovers you can think...and I'd also like black females/the quidditch team females (best multiple) or muggles somehow squeezed in there...

PS: No slash please, like Snivellous Parasitus Retardatus....I RESPECT his actor, but can't stand his character....I am str8 as the Dodge, so any male > female...I did like fem Tommy Tom Tom (if you can't guess his name then go read some more HP books, pls) PPS: If you can find, do include some Harry + real actress PPPS: Really any Scarlett/Natasha like character is welcome...you can also include Hogwash teachers in there, except Trelawney.... Oh, and the quantity of smut doesn't mater, doesn't phase me...


** Bump, I was asking for suggestions, not for you to completely write it...
