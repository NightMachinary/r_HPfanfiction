Anyone got a Harry/fleur fic that starts out kinda basic but actually turns out pretty good, like Harry meets fleur before hogwarts at the quidditch World Cup, or harry isn't really interested in fleur and she confronts him about it or a fic where Harry tells fleur that he's Harry Potter and she doesn't believe him(see example below). Good examples would be his angel, a cadmean Victory, and maybe the lie I've lived or letters. I'm just tryna read some good fanfic with that couple, or possibly Harry/daphne [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bmjtne/would_love_to_see_a_harryfleur_scene_like_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app]]

*** yeah, this should be the standard that all H/F fics are measured against. Anything worse is average at best, and anything better can objectively be labeled as pretty good.
