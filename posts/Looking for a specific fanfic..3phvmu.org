Solved! (I think). It was Stick by AbstractConcept.

I think it was on ff.net. I'm not 100% sure about the characters but it involved Snape becoming a tree. Harry (or another character, I don't remember), stumble upon him in this form at some point.

Snape in his tree form has an ugly wound on the bark - it represents the Dark Mark he has on his arm.

*** Dangit, you beat me to it. I was ready to drop a tree pun as well. You know like /I'm just going to leaf this here.../ or maybe /after rooting around I found it!/. Bahhumbug

Hmm...not bad, I've read worse. Here, let me try again

- /Going Against the Grain/: A new fic where Snape rejects the natural phloem of things and gets a new leaf of life. Hold on to your petioles (and/or your clingstones) folks, this journey back to his roots drives Snape to deciduous acts of phytoremediation and self-pollination within the hardiness zone! Coniferous fun for the whole family!

...that went wrong somewhere
