I need your help to find decent LOTR crossover fanfics.

I have read some fanfics that are crossover with LOTR (Lord of the Rings) and I enjoyed it. Two of my favourite are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5425827/1/Ring-Child][Ring Child]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1954999/1/Heir-of-Elessar][Heir of Eleesar]].

I prefer long story (>50k) and without slash (Sorry, just is not my cup of coffee). Harry must be a primary character.

I know it is hard to find decent fanfics that has crossover with LOTR and not slash, and this is why I'm asking [[/r/HPfanfiction]] if you know any good fanfics.

Also have to be completed, or WIP that are not abandoned.

Many thanks!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9982446/1/Aphelion][Aphelion]] - master of death Harry, he is pretty snarky in this one

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8250381/1/Forging-A-King][Forging a king]] - actually first harry lotr crossover i read, it says harry/Aragorn but from the top of my head I can't remember any of it actually showing up

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9227948/1/A-Second-Hope][A second hope]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9159286/1/Bae-que][Bae Que]] - warning is sad

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9674362/1/And-In-The-Darkness-Bind-Them][And in the darkness bind them]] - more immortal!harry

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6335808/1/The_Wizard_in_the_Shadows][The Wizard in the Shadows]] I have read this a long while ago, so I don't remember much. Harry is sent on a "vacation" ,turns up in Middle-Earth, turns slightly mad and fights orcs. Man, I think I'll reread that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2899679/1/To_Face_the_Wolf][To Face the Wolf]] This is a crossover not with LotR, but with the Silmarillion, but it's too good not to recommend here. A werewolf appears in Hogwarts, all are puzzled, Lupin is sympathetic, Snape doesn't trust the whole situation, and Hermione has to figure it out.

Edit: Just wanted to add that I found both of those fics via [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotter][TVTropes]]. I quite like the big list of recs.
