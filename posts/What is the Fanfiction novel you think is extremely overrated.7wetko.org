I'm going to get a million and a half flames for this, but a fic I found highly overrated was 'The Lie I Lived', by JBern.

I'll give you a second for the shock to sink in, but I do indeed have reasons why.

First is the writing. Maybe it's just me, but I find JBern's writing, in any way shape or form, lacking in the immersion factor. I can't envision the events or dialogue playing out as they supposedly do in JBern's work - which is really a shame, because some of the dialogue is witty, but not realistic.

Secondly is a stickling point for me, and that's his tense choice. I'm sorry, but to me, if you choose to write in first person (much less first person present tense), I'm expecting to see some deeper insights about the lead character, something a little deeper. Admittedly, there doesn't seem to be much room for reflection on such things about Harry blended character within the story - and that's a damn shame, because there's a ton of potential threads he could have tugged, and didn't.

I guess that reflects considerably upon my next major critique of the fic, and that's HJ. I'm sorry, but that character is as shallow as a fucking eggcup, and that hugely disappointed me. I never felt myself empathizing or connecting with HJ at all, and that killed a lot of my enjoyment with the story.

The biggest complaint I'm going to throw out is how rushed the story felt to me, particularly in the later chapters. Everything came to a head too fucking quickly, with no dramatic timing, and that pretty much left me - the reader - exceptionally frustrated. The pace was wonky, and that really hurt the story.

Now I'm not going to say that the story's not good, 'cause it is. It's got good ideas, some great moments, and can be generally entertaining. But it's not the best fic in the fandom (like some fans trumpet) and I find it more and more irritating when people say it is. It's good, but it's not the best.

Those just get tiring since everything happens for laughs and nothing happens in a remotely believable or satisfying way. Just in the first 2 chapters, Molly forgets that she doesn't have a son named Harry, Snape wilingly tells Harry all about his mother and everyone seems to not be able to tell the difference between Ron and Harry.

**** I read it thinking that Harry was supposed to be a precocious little asshat. It wasn't supposed to feel like Harry Potter, it was supposed to be an exploration of the rules of the universe with a protagonist that isn't really likable, but I was expecting him to get some redeeming qualities by the end. Some stuff did feel forced, but I was able to accept it as Harry thinking highly of himself rather than the author shoving stuff down our throats, which is I think why it worked for me. But then it turned into a convoluted soap opera plot, trying to make Harry into the Best Most Important Person in the Universe.

I loved the beginning, it was a lot of fun seeing a protagonist with a concrete understanding of muggle science go into the HP world, and it made sense that doing that would turn Harry into a prodigy and it /also/ made sense that he would be pretentious as a result, but it felt like the author didn't have a plot when he started writing and so he tried to shoehorn one in halfway through.

It did introduce me to Worm though, so I can't even say I regret reading it.

*** Eh I liked it for quite a bit. Really, despite all the flaws many people have pointed out about harry, the writing, etc, the only part I really disliked was the last few chapters.\\
Hermione's death and it's fallout was pretty much the last part I enjoyed. The whole Voldemort/Harry politics after that, Hermione the unicorn magical girl, etc, that was just... ugh.\\
Maybe it was just that there was a rather long hiatus around then, and I got exposed to better fiction. But yeah.

IIRC, Hermione's body disappears. Dumbledor suspects Harry stole it to try and resurrect her, thinking he might have transfigured the body into the stone in his ring, which suspiciously changed to look like Hermione's eyes. Asks Harry to give him the stone, and finites it. It's just a really big rock as it was before.\\
For the whole hiatus, I was certain Harry was misleading Dumbledore, an obvious stone that has the same color as hermione's eyes. Hermione's body is actual transfigured into the RING that holds the stone.\\
But no, Voldie stole it and stuff.

I would have loved a story that continued in the track of the first half, Harry abusing the fuck out of science and logic to break magic. And of course find a way to resurrect Harmione, possibly make both of them immortal yes, in the long run. With Voldemort as a sort of "Tutor" who has already accomplished all that, and decided ruling the world was after all not worth the effort. Possibly even manipulating Harry into doing it for him, to make sure the world doesn't get wiped out by idiots while he does his own thing.

I think that would have been way more interesting, Tom Riddle being a logical and intelligent person, realized that ruling the world was too much work. How can you enjoy eternity, when you have to make sure a couple billion imbeciles don't kill each other somewhere along the line? Obvious answer, find someone to do the babysitting for you. It's not even contrary to early Harry's own plans, all Voldie had to do was make sure Harry didn't get distracted along the way, and mentor him so he didn't accidentally kill himself and/or everyone else before he had enough actual understanding of magic.

This is such a weird compliment. I've seen it before with claims that the grammar is perfect, and so it is well-written. All that means is it's on a par with any fic that has a competent proof-reader: that doesn't tell you whether it's good or shit. It's like a guy saying he bathes and doesn't hit women: well woop-de-doo for you.

It's not exactly a /compliment/, though. My point is that a story with this sort of decent craftsmanship cannot be considered "sh¨t"; it is recognizably a work of literature, on which the author spent some effort. It may or may not be "bad", but I would limit a term as strong as "sh¨t" to something that is genuinely terrible in every way and an insult to writing. Something /Thirty Hs/- or /Harry and his sphinx/-bad.

***** I said /shipping/, not /romance/. "Shipping", to me, entails a story that is written to push for a pairing that the author desperately wants to be true about the canon universe. A story where /the pairing/ (more than the emotions and characters as such) is the point. A story that has a romance for its own sake could indeed be quite good, but a story that forces two characters together because shipping is equivalent to a bashing fic (a story that has no interest of its own, where the reader and author's impression of the character relies solely on canon).

Getting back to /HPMOR/, any romance /or/ shipping it might have included would probably have been cringeworthy and uncomfortable, since the characters are eleven/twelve throughout. It is made explicitly clear that Harry is simply not old enough to be interested in girls in that way.

That whole facet of the story still isn't giving enough of a payout outside it's own tangent. At this point it feels like two separate Fanfic.

-

One is what the story originally was, and is meant to be:

A story of an underdog overcoming the hurdles in front of her, with all the classic story elements of a girl-in-guy-disguise and the moral or/and character implications. The entire world building toward this Voldemort is by far some of the best yet, and don't get me started on how much I love the dichotomy of her liking Potions but minoring in healing and thus coming to terms that she likes it and how it influences her word views and such. And every Scene with Snape has me on the edge of my seat, I usually hate Snape.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section
   :END:
And the other story is a mediocer/bad attempt at worldbuilding with OP OC Leo who just so happen to end up crushing on to protagonist who is naive so the bad boy shows her tor world. (Que Aladin song) Like the only good thing that ever came out of that entire story was the Dueling Championship itself, not the lead up since that was terrible, but the event itself. It has yet to influence the actual story other that giving it unnecessary drama, only thing she's gotten from that whole ideal is some fighting ability that she might as well have gotten from her family, teachers or Snape TBH.

TL,DR: If you want to read Pureblood Pretense. Don't read any of the Leo/In Alley chapters. Just view all that mediocre trash as a summer job, and pay little attention to it.

***** I haven't read the Alanna the Lionness stories, but I think the Leo section is supposed to be based off something from that universe, so it might be a weakness of the "original" material. Not that the author is required to include that part, but if they're a fan of the series, they may view it more fondly than those of us unfamiliar with it.

I'm not a huge fan of Leo's (implausible) crush on Harriet, but I do enjoy the worldbuilding of the back alleys. And I like that it's forcing Harriet to take on yet ANOTHER identity that needs to be kept seperate from the others. You start to see the toll of maintaining all these secrets and keeping stories straight on Harry/Harriet/Rigel and I suspect it's pushing towards a breaking point where it's unsustainable. The more conflicting identities Harry has when that happens, the more dramatic tension.

TL;DR: Do read the sections at least once, then decide if you don't want to reread them on future readings ;)

I think it sort of looks like it's totally unrelated because, being the story kind of long, the two plot points still haven't come in contact yet? Like she's preparing it for further down the road? I don't know, that's my impression tho.

Totally agree about the Snape scenes. I don't generally like him. That is to say, I don't particularly like how him in the books. But I've found some really neat ones by reading ff.

**** It has been a while since I read pureblood pretense, but I remember stopping reading it at a certain point. Mostly, I think it was because Harry was just portrayed as being so amazing at everything that I just lost interest. At age 11, she is this master at politics, she is juggling multiple identities, she runs a successful side potions business in knockdown alley all while doing school work. She comes up with a cure for some disease or something at age 11 and is a master potions brewer. Maybe it's just because I don't generally like OP main characters, but it was just too unbelievable. There is no point in reading something for me when the main character is just so amazing at magic that there is no struggle or realistic problems.

I do like fics like Seventh Horcrux where the OP character has fun internal dialogue that pokes fun at everything, but more serious fics with main character who is skilled in all kinds of magic, politics and who knows what else at age 11 with no reason at all is just kind of frustrating and annoying.

*** How much of it did you read?

I fully understand why you would find the characters annoying and the plot boring, although I have to disagree on both counts.

But unless we read different fanfictions, I don't really understand how you could miss the abundant foreshadowing throughout the series. I could write a paragraph just on the use of names as foreshadowing. Even the very first chapter foreshadows stuff that doesn't happen until the fourth book, 800,000+ words later.

And if the Alexandra Quick series lacks vision, then I would love to know what parallel universe you've been getting your fanfiction from, because I've yet to find another Harry Potter fanfic with a similar level of ambition. Even in the first book, there's more effort put into the world building than in some published fantasy novels I've read. And the scope of both the world and the story only grows over the course of the series.

I don't know, maybe you were distracted by your distaste for the characters and plot that you missed out on some of details in the text.

**** SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER

Okay, so what the author does is in this alternate universe, harry potter dies along with his godfather defending him. Neville is then protected as the chosen one by prophecy, which is leaked. People send him tons of gifts and give him lots of support. At age 8, Neville disappears, even though he never left the wards and the fidelius charm was still up. At the same time, a shadowy figure masked starts fighting voldemort, and drags the whole blood war into the shadows, relegating the DE and Voldie to terrorists. This mysterious figure stalls it for a long time. Enter Harry and Sirius.

Eventually, it's revealed that this mysterious figure is actually Tom Riddle, the diary that was sent to Neville. Tom is actually a "good guy", due to seeing where his path would have led (voldemort is everything he said he wouldn't be as a villain, and because he's half a soul, he's much more sane). He still wants to take over, but decides to go the route of dumbledore instead.

I love A Black Comedy for it's world building and fights. It's got cool magic, and adds another pretty unique concept (defeating a dark lord is different than a dark wizard, and requires something to maintain balance, is kept pretty vague, but is really really interesting to me).

** Black Luminary

I've only read a few chapters until I dropped it. I saw it recommended several times and was prepared to like it, but I didn't.

From what happens in the chapters I've read, I started to dislike Daphne a lot, but she's treated as this good and relatable character by the narrative. Harry's phobia is downplayed a lot while he's among family, to the point where it's treated as normal teenager awkwardness. Only when someone else unknowingly and unintentionally triggers Harry, there's suddenly this big problem and it's completely appropriate for Daphne to threaten the culprit who doesn't even know what they did wrong.

Maybe I'd have an easier time reading it if Harry's issue was explained at some point and the narration was firmly from a Black family perspective. However, since a lot of background information and the size of his issue are intentionally left out of the first few chapters, I read everything from an outsider perspective. From that perspective, the Blacks have a massive overreaction and expect others to bow to their unspoken wishes. That should be a source of conflict, but it isn't and that's what irks me.

** I've literally written a 4,000 word review on why The Lie I've Live is terrible. Shitting over that fic is one of my favorite pastimes.

It pretty much boils down to that once you get rid of the Hat, the story honestly has nothing going for it, and that Hat itself really only works once because it catches you by surprise. The rest of the story is just a bunch of nonsense that is just him experimenting with ideas and concepts for his published works (which are also not very good).

The one thing I like is having an additional champion compete in the tournament to make it even, but not actually having them bound by a magical contract. But other than that, I'd have to dig really deep to find anything else that I actually like about the story.

Didn't lionize the twins like they normally are in fanfiction. Ron is way more interesting of a character than normal. I think you're a bit off.

It's not poorly written from a technical perspective. The action scenes aren't poorly done. People act in logically consistent ways to their character. That alone makes it better than like 98 percent of all fics. Plus it's old as shit.

*** As a fan of it, partly because it is so well written compared to a lot of others out there, and partly because it's one of the few stories (to me at least) where the crazy length didn't hinder it- some stories drag on, and this kept me engaged the entire time, even on a reread. Her characterizations are very easy to love, and it used the time turner trope for more than just 'oops can't change anything.'

It's definitely not for everyone, but for fans of the genre it's at least worth a shot. I can see why someone might think it's overrated, but, eh, some people also love stories I couldn't get more than a chapter into!

** 893 by Yanagi-Wa.

The fanfic premise is interesting, where Harry is adopted by prominent Japanese family and grows up to be powerful. That, I am fine with. He comes off a little Mary-Sue, but hey, he grew up in a very powerful assassin family, so why not try? After all, my own fanfic also has Harry who's adopted by a Japanese family.

However, what really turned me off was the random spouting of Japanese phrases that don't fit in the conversation at all. It's like the author picked cool-sounding Japanese phrases from animes and threw it in his fic. If you have any grasp of real conversational Japanese, you will see that no one actually speaks like that. The constant use of "-chan" and "-kun" suffix annoys the hell out of me, too.

Also, the fact Neville knows Japanese made me frown. I mean, British wizards don't even know what a telephone is! Do you really think they even heard of any Asian countries aside India?(Patils are there so I m sure they know India). The fic plot is interesting, I have to admit, but it feels like it's written by a weeb.

Lastly, the fic bashes Korea for no reason. It has zero bearing in neither the main plot nor the side plot. Makes me think even more that the author is a weeb.

And a lack of sleep and eighty ounces of coffee so far this morning(literally) has me pretty wired. And she is on my mind so it's all I could think of that's good about me right now.
