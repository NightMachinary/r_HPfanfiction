I'm just curious how authors in fanfic judge the popularity of their stories. I feel like story followers/favorites would be best. But I also enjoy watching the traffic stats whenever I release a new chapter. Before publishing I thought reviews were a good indicator but I've noticed that while I might get a lot of followers/favorites the reviews are rather rare.

So how do you judge if people are actually enjoying your story?


** Yes, favorites/follows determine popularity. Reviews may not all be positive.

Sometimes I think certain authors promote their fics heavily on social media, hence getting lots of popularity for otherwise mediocre stories.

** I base it on review feedback, I don't like to get bogged down in numbers too much. Obviously they play a part - 40 reviews for my one shot makes it clear that story is more popular, proportionally, than my WIP which gets about 10 reviews per chapter. But I would rather focus on the content of the reviews themselves to see if I've done a good job.

*** I always love reading reviews but I feel like a lot of the time they're usually short platitudes like, "great chapter looking forward to the next one." Which is nice, but I much prefer the ones that ask questions or even mention what parts they liked and didn't like. I'd actually like a hate message at this point because those at least spur questions and insight into my own writing.

**** They are super annoying, but I think they still count for something. When I uploaded my Aunt Marge fic, most of the reviews were along the lines of "OMG! So funny!!!", but the fact that they came in such an explosion of activity (my phone buzzed with emails from ff.net. all night) was a good indication that I'd done something right. Meanwhile, my WIP will never get a reaction like that, and that's OK, because it's more likely to get in depth, detailed reviews that give me insight, and I can ignore the rest of the noise.

***** My WIP has been like that as well, I'm a slow updater and there haven't been any big cliffhangers to garner responses (except one but most people saw right through it, which I expected). I'm hoping that when I get to the big reveal of what's motivating my villain (its post Hogwarts AU so not Voldemort) that people will respond to let me know whether it's stupid or if I'm as clever as I hope I am.

***** Some authors love all reviews! It's nice when our writing inspires someone to take a few moments and type out something. To me its like leaving a kudos, favourite or like. I'm always a little sad when authors complain about short reviews... maybe it's because I get so few * that I'm excited to hear from readers.

*I participate in a lot of review games and trades for concrit so my review count is technically high, but not from people who are just reading for pleasure. I always love hearing from people just causally reading the story since they are the target audience.

***** I will never say no to a review and even the short ones are nice to get. I was just saying that the ones that ask questions and take an interest are a lot more interesting. But if I'm just getting the short "good chapter" ones I begin to wonder if maybe the story is boring

** I tend to look at long-term trends for my stories. When something is first updated I anticipate a spike in views and a review or two. It's more when stories are still getting a lot of views and the occasional review months later that I consider it more popular.

*** I was a little surprised when after a long break between chapters (several months) I went to add the new chapter and the story had still been getting on average 20 views a day. Considering by this point it should have been buried I was a little proud to see that.

**** That's how I feel too. Things get buried so quick in HP, so it's always nice to see older stories still get some attention.

** This is the thing... I have no idea.

For me at least, each chapter release inevitably attracts a few follows/favourites with the odd surge in reviews, but until very, very recently, actual feedback outside of DLP was pretty scarce.

Of course, popularity is very subjective. I remember telling someone else how stoked I was when my fic reached 100K in views. As a fellow writer and recent reader of said story, they thought it was odd that it took so long (about 2 years).

So beyond Traffic Stats, there's no cut-and-dry way to tell apart from word of mouth. People don't review for all sorts of reasons, while faves and follows require a person to log in, and I'd wager that the majority of traffic to FFN is generated by users who either don't have accounts or can't be bothered to sign in to them.

So yeah, word of mouth has to be the closest thing to a litmus test that we have. If you see someone recommend your fic somewhere else, then you can be assured that at least a small handful of people out there are enjoying something about it.

Whether that's a /My Immortal/, /HPMoR/ or /Alexandra Quick/ sort of enjoyment is another story :D

** I have no idea. I guess I'm not big nor popular enough as a writer to form an educated opinion about that.

But if I have to I'd judge by overall review feedback, follows and favorites. The views list seems to be a bit deceiving as it doesn't actually tell you how people think of your story.

** I judge by how many favorites a story has and by how often it is favorited after it's completion. Like, one fic I have gets about one or two favorites a month, so I know it's being read often and enjoyed even though it was completed a few years ago now.

** If we go by favorites on FFn, my HP/STTNG is the seventh most popular xover in that genre. If we go by follows, it's the sixth most popular. If we go by reviews, it's the seventh most popular.

Of course, that's out of 37 stories in total.

** I base the quality assessment (HA!) of my writing on the kudos to hits ratio on AO3. Since my stories are definitely an acquired taste (unpopular pairing, distasteful tropes), I consider anything above 5% to be a successful story. That's, like, two of them. :-)

** Reviews, favourites and alerts all help on FFnet, but "popularity" is subjective. The number of alerts mean people who want to keep reading, which is the stat I pay most attention to.

Review numbers don't mean much to me - 90% of the time the reviews I reveive personally are pretty useless in terms of allowing me to improve, and given that reviews can be good, bad, or just plain stupid, their numbers aren't necessarily a good hint of popularity.

On Ao3, my concern is kudos. Generally on an average non-explicit fic for a fandom like Supernatural, I want kudos to be about 10% of the hit count for me to judge it a success. Harry Potter being a much smaller fandom on Ao3 though, I normally look at 5-7% as a success rate - dividing by the number of chapters in a work as you go, obviously.

Ao3's better judge of popularity is in their bookmarks: how many people have bookmarked a fic and publicly recced it? I look at bookmarks because they're the most obvious judge of how much people really liked it, as people are far more discerning with bookmarks than kudos.

Comments are of the same general worth as those on FFnet. I actually delete the most stupid comments because I care so little about their numbers as a statistic.

But most important of ALL to see whether my fic is popular is whether anyone recs it. If your fic is mentioned on here or on another sub, or in a forum, that's a great sign.

** The gold star is derivative work. If one of your readers liked what you wrote enough to make a drawing of a character, or write a snippet of omake, you have done a genuinely good job.
