I found this short story where Harry learns Tom Riddle is his father (some magic blah blah that made him, Lily, and James Harry's parents), anyways its new and doesn't do much past that. And now I'm in the mood for stories where Harry is related to Tom. I want one's where Harry's already at Hogwarts or just started, so he knows Voldemort is bad guy. I also want Tom taking Harry in.

If you don't know any blood related ones, Adoption or through magic (horcrux) is okay. Also if he raises/adopts Harry before Hogwarts is ok but only if Harry learns the truth at some point and has to struggle with accepting his parent killed his parents haha.

Pairings: I prefer slash. But Gen is good too. Just please no Tom/Bella. Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ron. Totally love Dark/gray Harry, Bad Dumbledore, and Long complete stories, unless they are currently being written and updated regularly.


** On ao3 there's also "A Shift In Perspective" by nobodyzhuman which i quite like. It's a wip so there isn't that much interaction between Voldemort and Harry yet

** You can find a bunch of such stories on ao3 under the tag Voldemort is Harry's parent. I would recommend Benefits of Old Laws by ulktante. You can find it on both ao3 and fanfiction.net.
