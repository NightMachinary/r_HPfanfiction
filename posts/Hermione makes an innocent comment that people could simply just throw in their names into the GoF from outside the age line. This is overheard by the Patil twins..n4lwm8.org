The Goblet chose Harry for real as the Hogwarts champion, and it was actually Amos Diggory that tampered with it to get his son chosen. The idea was that Voldemort wanted to sort of test if Harry is a worthy enemy or not.

******** All right, here's my review. All in all it's not that bad. Sure it has its weak spots - like any story does - but all in all it's pretty good. No blatant cliches that cringe the brain, no plot lines that feel overly forced, and they actually do a pretty good job of showing Harry is a normal school kid going through life. For example, there's a few chapters where he decides to ask out Lavender Brown simply cuz she's a cute girl at school, and they eventually decided it's not working out so they split on good terms. The Harry in this fic feels a lot more human than the other fics I've been reading lately. The one downside is that it is desperately begging for a sequel to be written because it only goes through fourth year.

I'd say probably about a 6.5-7/10, simply because there's always room for some improvement, and it feels very sequel-baity with no actual sequel looking like it's going to be published.

But yes, the fact that a magically binding contract with unspecified penalties can be entered into ON SOMEONE ELSE'S BEHALF, and without their knowledge and consent, opens up a massive and horrific bag of worms in the HP-verse. Probably a larger one than the prevalence and apparent cutsieness of date-rape potions and spells like Amortentia, Obliviate, Imperius, etc. Hell, the Weasley Twins sold love potions like they were condoms and the girls all thought it was absolutely adorable and awesome, even though those could be used to literally take away their will and agency.

I'm not saying that the girl who had to be reminded that she could use magic as a direct, logical solution to the problem of "how do I make light to stop this Devil's Snare?" is unqualified to do so, but there are plenty of instances where other wizards puzzle problems out logically faster and more thoroughly than Hermione does.

***** According to Muggle standards, wizards do lack logic. I already wrote a long-ish comment on this about a month or so ago, but a wizard's brain will develop very differently because the laws of physics work very differently for them, so they will note different kinds of contingencies and just reason very differently in genral.

Like, remember Ron being amazed that Muggle cars aren't bigger on the inside? For a Muggle it's "logic" that they're not, but for Ron there's no reason why something would be the same size both outside and inside.

So for Muggle standards, wizards do "lack logic", and it's the same in reverse (Hermione forgetting to take magic into consideration and other people constantly going WTF how could you forget that is an excellent example). But that's just because wizards work with different premises on, well, the basic physical laws of the world, so they seem incoherent to an outsider. They do have their own internal logic.

Those fanfic tropes didn't just pop out of thing air, they do have some degree of justification (though almost all fanfics that have them overdo it way too much).

It is not just specific people doing specific dumb things though, it's also wizarding society as a whole that at times seems devoid of logic. This is not necessarily a bad thing and at least in the first books it was absolutely great. But it does lead one to wonder whether there is some negative correlation between having magic and having common sense.

More and more names continue to pop out of the goblet. It will later be calculated that approximately 37% of all underaged students at Hogwarts are competing in the tournament.

** Probably absolutely nothing will ensue. Just because they can enter their names doesn't mean the goblet will select them. That Cedric was selected over all the 7th-years is already quite a coup.

Mind you, if the goblet glitches, sums up the candidate ratings of the underage students, and attributes the score to Hermione (since it was her idea), that could be hilarious.

"I did not put my name in! Honestly, Ronald, I think Harry and I are the only ones in Hogwarts who didn't!"

  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.

Now that I'm thinking about it I'm pretty sure that Harry and George both got picked, and even more people couldn't believe Harry didn't put his name in because he had told people how they could get it in. Also, pretty sure Harry was a shadow panther animagus and could move through shadows in that form, I can't for the life of me remember what the name of the fic was, anyone knows give me a holler!
