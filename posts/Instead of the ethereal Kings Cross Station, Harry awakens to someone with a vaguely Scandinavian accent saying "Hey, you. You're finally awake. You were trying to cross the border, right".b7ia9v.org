Harry was initially nude before he thought of clothes. So he would probably wake up on that cart buck naked.

  Harry Potter was lost, but now is found. The Arch-Mage isn't happy. Harry isn't happy. And they're just the first two people who are going to find The Boy Who Lived's destiny one immense headache... Completed. It's my "Winnie the Pooh" to my A.A. Milne. (That's NOT a complementary comparison, by the way.)
