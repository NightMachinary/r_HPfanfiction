I've read a lot of Hermione or Ginny pairings with Harry and I've stopped enjoying them.

Started reading Harry/Daphne then, liked them a lot. Can someone recommend some other not so common pairings?

Preferably longer stories (> 40k). I have a week to burn before uni starts.

Thanks in advance


** Try Disorder of the Phoenix by JacobApples. It starts 7 years after the war with Harry raising Teddy. Then Harry, Teddy, and Andromeda get pulled back to Harry's 5th year. Young Harry is gone and older Harry replaces him. It becomes a Harry/Tonks story.

You can then try White Knight, Grey Queen by Jeconais. It has Harry being rescued from the Dursleys by Pansy and her family. Where they are neutrals who pretend to support the dark but when the situation changes the decide to support Harry (but not Dumbledore).

  Seven years after defeating Voldemort, Harry Potter has been raising his godson, Teddy Lupin with the help of Teddy's grandmother, Andromeda Tonks. What will happen when Fawkes the Phoenix pulls this happy, war-weary family back in time for a chance at a better future. Set before the breakout from Azkaban in OOTP. No paradox.*What We Lost* is the sister fic without time-travel.
