Basically, if lockhart had the exactly the same skillset but was dedicated and competent (competent at lying, not competent at magic) enough to successfully take down voldy, prevent everyone from dying, put harry in a good home, and redeem both dudley and the child snakes.

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

**** Like most of Sarah1281's fics, it's not exactly /good/, but it's funny. Everyone is a caricature of himself or herself, and things just seem to 'work out,' but it's fairly entertaining.

** It would be great if instead of finding out how to destroy a horcrux he just Obliviates all of them. Extinguishing Voldemorts mind from existence works just as well as killing him. At the end of it all Voldemort's wraith becomes a Hogwarts ghost who remembers nothing of his past.

** I'm sure I read about a Lockhart that got possessed by Voldemort's spirit but managed to banish the spirit out of his body because he didn't want to become an ugly rotting being. So it was his vanity that helped him deal with Voldemort here. Will try to remember the title.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part 1 of the "Perfectly Normal" series.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.
