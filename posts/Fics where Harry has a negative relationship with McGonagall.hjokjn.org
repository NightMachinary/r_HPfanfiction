Looking for fics where Harrys relationship with McGonagall is not friendly at all, maybe Harry holds a grudge after the she doesn't believe them about the stone in 1st year or maybe he gets pissed that as his head of house and deputy headmistress she does nothing about the school wide bully he faced in 2nd and 4th years or perhaps he goes to her about the blood quill and when she blows him off he's just like "well fuck you then".


** I've been craving something along these lines myself. I don't know about OP but it's not so much an antagonistic relationship between Harry and Minerva that as has been pointed out is pretty common in !SlytherinHarry stories, it's more about Harry reacting accordingly to the dismissiveness that Minerva shows repeatedly all the while enforcing rules that are pretty trivial in context.

From memory, the only 2 positive interventions that she has towards Harry are when she puts him on the Quidditch team and when she defends him from Umbridge in the career meeting and to my mind, the first was self-serving and the second out of spite to Umbridge not care for Harry.

I've found many stories in which post canon Harry has an apparent fondness for Minerva and I just don't see from where that comes from. That and naming his kid Severus because yes Snape might have been brave and maybe a war hero, maybe, but he was still an abusive piece of human waste, not something one wants for one's child.

*** I don't really understand this interpretation and I'd like to hear more about it.

For me, it's clear why Harry has so much love and respect for her. She's strict, but she's very fair and probably the only reasonable authority figure by a real world standard. (The only teacher besides perhaps Flitwick who's not putting her students in mortal danger on the regular, who strenuously objects to the idea of using Harry as a pawn or letting him get wrapped up in violence, who enforces the rules equally...) And she shows compassion and care for Harry many times in small moments like in Prisoner of Azkaban when she makes it clear she won't tolerate risks to his safety or in Goblet of Fire when she pushes him harder in class to get him ready for the trials. To me, she epitomizes a good and stern teacher who I would trust with my life as a child and who I have immense respect for as an adult educator myself.

And Harry expresses how much he respects her when he Crucios someone for spitting at her. He loves her dearly, since he couldn't even summon up a Crucio immediately after Sirius died (though I suspect that was shock and grief).

***** I concede the Forbidden Forest thing was really fucked up, but we're also not sure that she's the one who set that detention. It sounds like the system for detention is that a student is ‚Äògiven' to a teacher to help them with a task, so it seems like they were given to Hagrid and it was up to him to decide where they went. (And let's be real, ‚Äòeleven-year-olds can totally handle the Forbidden Forest' sounds more like a Hagrid thought than a McGonagall thought.)

**** The problem is that reasonable!McGonagall frequently has to take a backseat to AdvanceThePlot!McGonagall.

Reasonable!McGonagall would at least listen to the concerns of her students, even if she trusts her colleagues to much to believe they'd steal the stone (I mean, Dumbledore /was/ gone). Reasonable!McGonagall would not take an absurd amount of points and then send four first years into the Forbidden Forest, just for breaking curfew. Reasonable!McGonagall would attempt to stop the bullying in books 2 and 4. Etc.

***** I want you to imagine for a second being a teacher. You're responsible for children ages eleven through seventeen. You've been working with a guy for over ten years, and while he's kind of a jerk, he's been a part of the faculty. Now one year, a few eleven-year-olds come to you with info they shouldn't have, claiming your coworker of over a decade is planning to steal an object you know he helped hide.

I'd do the same thing as her, and to be fair to her, she was completely right. Snape wasn't trying to steal the stone.

As for breaking curfew, the loss of points makes sense there too. In a boarding school, curfew is law. Teachers need to know where students are at all times, and when students break curfew, not only are teachers not sure where they are but they're very likely to be up to things that would get them and the school in a lot of trouble. My boarding school historically had classes on Saturdays to limit the number of nights students might break curfew, and many boarding schools install silent alarms on their dorm doors to alert them if students try to break curfew. It's very serious in the boarding school community.

The Forbidden Forest, I grant you, was fucked up. But to be fair, we don't know if McGonagall was the one who set that detention or if she just assigned the detention to Hagrid to figure out himself.

As for the bullying, this goes into the heart of both British boarding school culture and the struggle of being a teacher. A, with British boarding school culture, especially in the 90s, hazing and bullying is rampant and considered part of growing up. B, as a teacher, it's harder to see bullying than people realize. Most students won't speak up about bullying, and most students won't be obvious about bullying in the class or within eyesight of the teacher. So it's easy not only to not realize that bullying is happening, but if you do realize it's happening, to be unable to get the context or know the extent because sometimes kids won't speak up, pretend they don't know anything, or outright lie about who's the aggressor. And trying to investigate and intervene at all runs the risk of making the victim a bigger target.

So I can see how a British boarding school faculty could not know the extent of the bullying Harry goes through, and when they get an inkling, figure it's part of the growing process and there's nothing they can do without making it worse. Bullying isn't accepted in popular culture anymore these days and yet it's still notoriously difficult to deal with in schools.

****** In all honesty, I don't disagree with you, the issue I have is not that she is a bad person or teacher is that her actions don't fit into what I imagine Harry would like/love in an adult. Now if someone points McGonagall as Hermione's favorite teacher that makes perfect sense.

Harry usually feels connected to adults/older people that make him feel connected to his parents and/or while I can't think of anyone of the top of my head with people who acknowledge that despite his age he is neither incapable nor‚Äùuseless‚Äù (maybe Sirius?).

******* Well, I think that's a little more subjective. Who would Harry Potter theoretically like?

I think Harry feels more connected to adults who make him feel connected with his parents, but I think that the absence of a connection to his parents doesn't mean that he wouldn't like a given adult. Children that grow up in abusive households on average tend to prefer the presence of adults who behave consistently, but most children everywhere like consistent behavior from adults. Someone like Hagrid is consistent even if he isn't always reliable; he's an honest person who's earnest and openly cares about people. Someone like McGonagall is also consistent even if she isn't always on Harry's side, as it were; she cares a lot about rules and holds her students to high standards, but her standards aren't unreasonable and the safety of her students clearly matters a lot to her. Adults like Hagrid or McGonagall are predictable for children because they are honest and consistent about what matters to them, and their reactions in novel situations are predictable.

Plus, I think it's clear that she loves Harry. This is more of a teacher-specific thing, but when you're in charge of a dorm and have kids in your class for seven years, you love them like they're yours. Their safety is your responsibility, their growth is your responsibility, and any good teacher takes that very seriously. McGonagall doesn't have to be demonstrative about her love for her students to respect that she always has their best interests at heart, and she was the one who screamed when she saw Harry's body. I think Harry always understood that McGonagall always had his safety and growth foremost in her mind even if she got in his way, and he responded to that.

****** For a FIRST OFFENSE breaking curfew, something that is ALWAYS happening at a boarding school, she takes 50 points each, and gives them a soul-crushing setdown, saying that it was the worst offense she had ever seen and that she had never been so ashamed of students before.

******* You make it sound like she whipped out a cane to beat them where they stood.

The house point system is a system of class management (and a pretty shitty one at that but that's another conversation). You have imaginary points represented by pretty hourglasses with jewels, you have your class invested in a largely ceremonial reward for points, and you use them as rewards and punishments. The entire purpose of a class-wide point system is to use the power of peer pressure to get students to behave. McGonagall used the system exactly as intended---five points here or there for talking in class, and a swathe of points for a major rule violation which prompted Neville to try preventing the rule break again.

You'll notice that mentions of house points wane as the book series goes on. It's probably because points are used less to manage older students because points don't have as much an effect on teens as on preteens, and it's easier to talk to a teen on an individual level and reason them into behaving a certain way for their own benefit. It makes sense that she would come down on younger student like that, because not only do you want to nip that behavior in the bud immediately, but it's also easier to scare them into managing each other. And I repeat, breaking curfew is very serious in a boarding school, especially a boarding school with a whole lot of dangerous things a student could get into.

It's not the strategy I would have used in her shoes, but it's a legitimate strategy and she got exactly the effect she was aiming for, which was prompting the trio's peers to keep an eye on them so they don't break curfew and possibly get into something dangerous again. (They petrified Neville and did it anyway, but still.)

********* Breaking curfew is /absolutely/ a major offense. It's one of the worst things kids in a boarding school can do, short of drugs and getting pregnant. If a student breaks curfew, that means that the teachers don't know where they are and may not know to look for them until morning. A lot of bad things can happen between a student sneaking out and morning, and it's happened in the past where a student sneaked out, something happened, and they were seriously injured or worse because no one knew to look for them until it was too late. And that's in boarding schools without vicious three-headed dogs hanging around.

Speaking as someone whose been to multiple boarding schools, they take this very seriously. They install silent alarms on doors, have morning classes on weekends, do regular patrols, and put the fear of God into people who break curfew.

Like I said, it's not the strategy I would have used, but McGonagall's strategy for making sure the trio would be terrified of breaking curfew again would generally be considered acceptable in a boarding school environment.

According to my teachers, the boarding school scene in the area I attended went through a minor revolution in the 80s and 90s because there was a rash of student/teacher relationships, pregnancies, and drug abuse that were threatening to close schools. There was a massive overhaul of accepted practice, a lot of teachers were purged and new ones with clearer boundaries and stricter dispositions were brought on, and schools cracked down on rule violations among students. I don't know if you attended school in an area affected by this change in culture, but any overnight educational space I've worked at takes curfew violations really seriously both because of the practical need and the legacy of this culture shift.

  The stern teacher paused for a moment, as though gathering her thoughts. ‚ÄúMister Potter, I get the feeling that you do not expect anything to come of this meeting.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúAfter what happened last year, is that such a surprise? I was shunned for months, and you did nothing. Odd behavior for a Head of House,‚Äù Harry responded coldly.

  ‚ÄúMister Potter, you were caught fighting, and were appropriately punished. I cannot control how the other students react.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúNo, I was found defending myself from an unprovoked attack. There is a very large difference,‚Äù came the quick reply. ‚ÄúYou punished me without bothering to find out the circumstances. Which makes you a hypocrite of the highest order.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúMister Potter, just because someone disagrees with you does not make them a hypocrite,‚Äù McGonagall replied angrily.

  ‚ÄúIt is my understanding that you were a member of Dumbledore's vigilante group, the Order of the Phoenix. Is that correct?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúIt was not a vigilante group, but yes, I was a member of the Order. Where did you learn about that?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúWhere I learned about it is irrelevant,‚Äù Harry countered. ‚ÄúAs a member of the Order of the Phoenix, did you ever leave Hogwarts to help defend against Death Eater attacks?‚Äù

  McGonagall pursed her lips, clearly seeing where his questions were leading. ‚ÄúYes, I did. And I will point out that the situation was very different from your circumstances.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúYou defended against Death Eaters and would have protested if you had been arrested for fighting them. And yet you punished me for defending myself. As I said, you are a hypocrite.‚Äù

  The teacher said nothing for moment, before finally asking coldly, ‚ÄúWhy are you here, Mister Potter? You clearly don't think that this meeting will accomplish anything.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúI am here because I was advised to protest and appeal any unjust punishment through official channels. First is a meeting with the Head of House. If I am not satisfied at the conclusion of this meeting, I will proceed to send written notice of my concerns to the deputy headmistress, and then, the headmaster, and finally, the board of governors.‚Äù Harry paused for a moment to look at his teacher. ‚ÄúIn this particular instance, it seems a bit redundant to send a written notice to you since you are both my Head of House and the deputy headmistress, but I was advised to follow the established procedure exactly.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúAnd what do you hope to accomplish with this course of action?‚Äù

  Harry chuckled bitterly. ‚ÄúWell, I hope that you'll actually do your job, but I realize that's pretty unlikely. No, I'm doing this so that in the future when I tell people about my time in Hogwarts, the faculty will have no excuses. I'll be keeping a record, and someday, I'll find someone who will listen.‚Äù

  McGonagall sat back, a startled, and rather unnerved expression on her face. The expression faded however, replaced by a look of determination. ‚ÄúRegardless of your opinions on the matter, Mister Potter, Hogwarts discipline must be enforced. While I will speak with Professor Snape, for the time being, the punishment will stand.‚Äù

  Harry smiled coldly. ‚ÄúWell then, I'll put this one down on the list of undeserved punishments. Expect my formal, written protest in a day or two,‚Äù he said as he stood and exited her office.

** I've really been searching for some proper McGonagall bashing stories (where I include stories that hold her to account for her canon failures not just warp her personality) and I sadly haven't had much success.

The two that I can think of (other than Slytherin stories which I typically can't stomach due to Drarry or somehow Snape not being terrible):

- Something like Family: linkffn(6655313) - This is slightly more to the warped personality
- The Centaur was Late: linkffn(9676179) - I only really read the first few chapters, but she gets in trouble for the Forbidden Forest detention

Linkffn(Time Turned Back) has a McGonagall that's biased towards Gryffindor(i.e. not punishing them; giving points for nothing ect, basically like Snape towards slytherin) and Harry/Gabe is done with it. It's also just a good fic in general.
