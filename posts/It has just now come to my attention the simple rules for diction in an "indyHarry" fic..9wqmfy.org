1. "After all" about every third paragraph. After all, one must always set himself above the common rabble.

2. "However" starts every 6th paragraph and makes an appearance at least every 4 paragraphs. However, you cannot use any other word for conflicting opinions.

3. "Of course" The staple of a thievering Dumblegoat. His actions, of course, should be plainly obvious.

Bonus: Basically repeat the same paragraph over and over again with the only difference being the subject.

Write the same chapter five times from "different" PoVs by changing the pronouns a little and add anatomic references accordingly.

**** It can be a very compelling plot device when used well, though it is an uncommon one and probably not what these authors were going for.

I just can't recall the name or author right now, but there was some sci-fi novel that did this really well, set on a spaceship and revolving around the meeting of 3 characters, but that introduced all new plots and meanings attached to the very same actions each time when looked at by different perspectives. I really need to find that one again.

I've also seen it done badly, in the Demonata series by Darren Shan, where he literally writes about the same events in 3 different perspectives... But each was an entire book and dragged on way too long for my liking.

***** Hmm, maybe I just haven't read enough original fiction. My only exposure to multiple-POV has been when the perspectives are significantly different. It still seems odd to me just how prolific it is in bad fanfiction, though.

******* I'll freely admit I didn't make it through ASOIAF, just wasn't for me, but from what I remember it was more along the lines of presenting multiple stories that intersect than presenting multiple views of the same story. I guess it's possible that fanfic authors are misinterpreting that same process, but it seems like they'll often cut to the perspective of somewhat tangential characters just for another view of the same scene.

Then again, I've heard GRRM does minor character perspectives too, so that might still be part of where it comes from.

******** Some were completely "unrelated" (the connection came after 4 books). Some were the same event (eg a battle) but showing different sides (eg the different flanks or fractions). It was definitely far from what you'll see in a Harem story.

**** To expand on [[/u/A2i9][u/A2i9]]'s point, it's fantastic /if and only if/ the author uses it to add details each time. For example, if character 1 knows A, 2 knows B, and 3 knows C, but none of them know the other two thing (i.e. 1 doesn't know B or C) and it colors their opinions correspondingly, then the audience will know more than any of the characters do or could know. It can really enrich a story if done well. It's just hard to do well.

**** Bungle in the Jungle is a classic, he goes cursebreaking with Bill. Some people are put off by the narrative voice, but you get used to it within a few chapters, especially if you think of it as a call-back to the old Choose Your Own Adventures books. Skip the first chapter prologue for sure, though.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".
