Very specifically being able to preceive other people's emotions and how other people feel about him/her and therefore be able to use that to minipulate them ( at least theoretically). Bonus points if they can also keep a check on their own emotions. They dont necessarily need to have a Tom Riddle type personality but they need to have this Tom Riddle quality.

Ive seem quite a few fics where Hermione is like this. But book Hermione is really bad at being aware of others feelings /bad at taking it into account in her decision making.

For example she doesn't consider that the majority of House elves considered being free insulting and that to free them she'd first have to change their association to the concept of being free. And that by trying to force that freedom via trickery without changing that assiciation would be putting her at odds with the people she's trying to help.

Or when she wants to help Lavender understand that her rabbit's death wasn't predicted by Trelawney and how she shouldn't buy into this Divination stuff. But doesn't realize that her message won't come across well when Lavender is crying about said rabbit.

So I started wondering who canonically ( book canon) would be this type/have this skill.

The only three I could think of was Snape being a spy and all, and Remus who was able to do something similar in his interaction with Snape after Snape caught Harry sneaking back into the castle and Dumbledore who seems to be very aware of other people's feelings and how to approach them with that context.

You guys know any others?

Canonically? Grindelwald. Pre-CoG retconnery, JKR said that the relationship was one-sided. He liked the idea of manipulating Dumbledore more than actually liking him in a romantic sense.

#+begin_quote
  "Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution."
#+end_quote

/Inflamed/ is an odd word choice there. Also recall that in the book, Grindelwald preferred to endure torture and die in prison than tell Voldemort about where the Elder Wand went.

Other manipulative characters who know how to play the social game well are Rita Skeeter, Gilderoy Lockhart, and Barty Crouch Jr.

*** Oh shit i totally forgot about Barty Jr.

He was pretty much perfect at it. Especially during the trial.

** Harry maybe. When he and Ron are caught by McGonagall in the corridors and he lies to get out of it. Hermione kinda does that, too, with Lockhart. Does the stuff with Kreacher in DH count? And i know he had help with Felix Felicis, but I think he does it with Slughorn to get the memory.

*** Mmh I guess sorta? Lying doesn't necessarily count. Just making up a believable story is one thing. But making up a story to specifically appeal to one peeson is another.

I would say Slughorn is like the perfect example except he had the Felix Felicis so it makes me wonder if that would have been his approach if he hadn't taken it. Its phrased like it gives him the confidence to use his ideal approach which if thats true and he could have perceived those emotions without the potion and could even to a degree say things to get a specific reaction based on his understanding of said emotions then ya absolutely Harry counts.

Kreacher...is debatable since Harry had alot of control over him. But he is sure to phrase his request in the end as a choice Kreacher has and tell him that he's trying to finish what Regulus started to appeal to Kreacher's own motivations. Though its only after Hermione points out Kreacher as a houseelf is loyal to people not causes. Whether this is insight on Kreachers feelings for her or a observation based on her interest in house elves is debatable. But it makes it hard to say if this should count
