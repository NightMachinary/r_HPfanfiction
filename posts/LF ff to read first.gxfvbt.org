*** Seconding The Arithmancer, but putting a caution on The Changeling. I liked it a lot, but it's written in present tense, which is something I'd shy away from for someone new to fanfic since a lot of people really hate that.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4308630?view_adult=true]])

This one is my favorite from the Boy with a Scar series, but the whole thing is golden. They're one shots, so they're short enough to fully explore and not have to get into a whole series til they find what they like. The whole series is a bunch of vignettes about what would happen if one thing changed in the series (this one is about if Voldemort won the first war). Beautiful and melancholic, and the author has such a strong voice; the exception to the rule that you should show rather than tell. Never get tired of them.

Also shouting out to their In Defense Of series, which gives a human perspective on girls and women the fandom shits on, like Cho, Lavender, and Pansy. A cross between fanfic and an essay, so they're easy for new fic readers. All of those are worth a read. Here's the one for Pansy, which surprised me the most: Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2330390]])

#+begin_quote
  What if Voldemort went after Harry and Neville, and gave no one a chance to die for them? What if both Chosen Ones died as children?--There was no prophesied boy, but there was still this--dozens of shadowed young faces refusing to run, even at the very end of the world. Dumbledore looked out at his chess pieces, pawns and queens; his children and his friends; his collateral damage. He had the beginnings of a plan swelling in his chest. It would take them decades to get their hands, quietly, on every Horcrux. Tom Riddle had to think they were secret. He had to think he was safe. It would take them almost decades, but one day he would be mortal again. These dozens of faces--they were mortal now. Alastor Moody could feel mortality in the aches of old broken bones; Andromeda rewrote her own last name. Remus and Sirius felt empty, gaping holes in the seats around them, and they made crude, expansive, joyous toasts to friends' memories. When Molly first reached over and held Arthur's hand, they knew this was something that could not last. That was why they held hands, held on, held tight.

  “Why are you here?” Parvati asked Pansy once. People asked her a lot, when they found her in Flourish and Blotts, or at work on the Prophet. Their eyes raked her, looking for green, for silver, for venom. Sometimes she'd smile back and let them see the danger. "Because I'm not fifteen anymore," said Pansy. "God, do you know what precious Potter Sr. got up to at school, the bully? But boys get to grow up to be men, you see, and us girls just grow up to be bitches."
