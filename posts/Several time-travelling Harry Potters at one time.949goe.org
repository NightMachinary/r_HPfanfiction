For example, one Harry was an adult, the war never finished, everybody died, he decided to travel in time to 1991 and apply for DADA job. Classic (btw, looking for such fics).

Another was a 15 year old Harry who followed Sirius to the Arc of Death and appeared on the Sorting ceremony.

The third one is a very old man who has to work as Death since his victory over Voldemort. Out of boredom he travels in time to find someone else to fulfill his duties.

The fourth one actually got a companion(s) (Ron&Hermione, Neville, Ginny, Draco, Severus, Albus...)

Imagine their surprise when they realize there are far more Harry Potters in there

** - While not exactly what you ask, I think I remember reading a small crack one shot not long ago. The trio at the night of buckbeak's escape, repeatedly use the time turner and multiple versions of them are running around that night in parallel. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12825374/1/Never-give-Harry-Potter-a-Time-Turner]])
- Another was a crack too. But it was some attack and like 8 stages where Harry travels with Bella, Ginny Mort, Albus Dumbledore? ( [[https://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_ginny/aon/a/1/An+Old+And+New+World/Lens%20of%20Sanity/37][An Old and New World by Lens of Sanity]] )
- Then there is also another one where Harry frequently uses the time turner and there was a elaborate prank which Albus helps him. Something with Lily Potter(Bessy?) carrying a demon baby. 3 part series, prank is in the 3rd one. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2477165/1/The-Untitled-Cheekquel-Project]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2630300/1/You-Did-What]])

Give me like 10 mins, I'll look through my history and link it all up.

Edit: Linked the stories of 2. Damn, I miss the ffbot.

Edit: Found the other one, too.

*** That 'Where in the world is Harry Potter' trilogy is some of my favorite fanfic, regardless of genre. Third one is a little weird for me, but I wish I could read the first one for the first time again.

Here's one with several different Harry Potters. There's even a fem!Harry in it. Unfortunately, there's only 1 chapter out.

** I don't know about that specific idea, but there was definitely been one fic where multiple characters from separate timelines all travel back (i.e. Ron from a normal future who died of old age, Hermione from a war-torn future where Ron actually was a Death Eater, Dumbledore from after his death, Draco from a world where he turned good), but Harry is normal.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

**** Possibly, but I could've sworn it was one where time travel Hermione hated Ron.

Still, I could be misremembering it or mixing it up with a Naruto fanfic that did something similar.

Edit: just read through it, it's definitely not this one.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU
