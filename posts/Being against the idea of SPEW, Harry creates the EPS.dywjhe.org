The Elf Preservation Society. Culminating in a finale of Dobby + Winky + Other Elves breaking into Gringotts when they steal the Cup instead of Harry doing it, and driving out in Mini Coopers and taking Gold too to make it look like the Horcrux wasn't targeted specifically. The Elf Preservation Society being an organisation that takes in out of work Elves, ones that got given clothes, unwanted extra Elves and the like, and gives them jobs, mostly heist related (Gotta have Rich Harry without him being Lord Everything)


** This sounds like a start of a revolution. A good place to start off a spin off fanfic.

I can see it as SPEW veiwing it as exploitation group while Harry believes in the culture of elves Spew promotes liberation and equal rights but goes against the 'culture' that Elfs know.

Somehow EPS can cause further restrictions on Elfs due to elf based crimes. Or possibly an elf vs. goblin war. Can you imagine the chaos it does. Heck this can be set after Voldemort's death. A fanfic where wizards aren't the main players but we get to see a different world building.

That Elfs never had to worry about bonds since instead of being bonded to a family, they are bonded to serve a government and follow the charter.

*** Harry the Mobster could be interesting. He then recruits other downtrodden groups, such as the werewolves, the Squibs, and the half-giants.

** This sounds like something that could dovetail very well with SPEW rather than antagonize it

**** Hermione is a "get things done" kinda person. If giving the elves heist jobs is the best way to do something, then that is what will be done. Also

  It is highly possible that the organisation was named after the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women (SPEW). The organisation is one of the earliest British women's organisations.

***** I think that's less ‘highly possible' and more ‘there's no way on god's green earth two separate people came up with such a wonkily phrased organization with the same terrible acronym'.

****** Honestly yeah, it could work well. Mainly I was just arguing against the points given by OP.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione would be against using Elves to commit Heists. Plus SPEW is a ridiculous acronym.
#+end_quote

While I personally would rather see Harry and Hermione work together to improve the rights of/free the elves, having the two trying to go about it in two separate ways could make for a interesting fic. It's just that I prefer them working together in some sort of /Harmony/ or something.

******* I get why you'd like it, but still.

SPEW actually had decent goals and great timelines before Hermione decided to ignore that.

Frankly I think it would have a been a great character arc for her if she was to look at why her activism and sneaking was ineffective.

But really, the fact is that a competing organization would be unique. I always enjoy fresh ideas in fanfics.

******** Agreed for the most part. Cutting away from that for a sec though; I only know of two fics where they /do/ work together to achieve that result, mostly it is just Hermione doing it. So them working together is already a bit unique.

Yeah, Hermione's stated goals and actual behavior are vastly different in that situation. Honestly I agree with what you are saying, it's just that them working together on this is also really rare from what I have seen.

** One of the elves, a particularly undersized elf named Tiny, goes missing after the Gringotts heist. Dobby, Winky, and the others search high and low, but given that there aren't any arrest reports, they're reluctantly forced to conclude that Tiny had tripped one of Gringott's anti-theft devices and perished.

They're elated but chastened when it turns out he was accidentally scooped into one of the bags, and he patiently informs them that EPS Tiny would never kill himself like that.
