The plot is as follows insofar as I remember it: Hermione finds a way to destroy horcruxes before they think of retrieving the sword of gryffindor, and her way requires a freshly married couple. Bill and Fleur have already been married too long, so Harry marries Hermione, only for the both of them to learn that marriage in the wizarding world requires couples to hold hand continuously for a month. Shenanigans ensue.


** Hold hands for a whole month? That sounds horrible.

**** Vanishing spell from 5th-year transfiguration would do the trick. Just aim carefully.
