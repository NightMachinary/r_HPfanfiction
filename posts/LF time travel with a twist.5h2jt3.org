Looking for a fic where an older Harry goes back in time to his 16-17 year old self and just causes mayhem and sleeps with all the young pretty witches. Most time travel fics are focused on saving people and killing voldemort. I'd like a fic where Harry just says fuck it and screws with everyone.


** linlffn(A Black Comedy) has Harry and Sirius sleeping with like everyone

** It's like every single time travel story has to have a twist. I'd like one where the twist was that there was no twist! Harry travels back to his younger self, has a plan, follows it through and to his (and the readers surprise) everything works out, not only that but works out even better than he expected!

*** Pretty sure that linkffn(Harry-Potter-and-the-Quantum-Leap) went like that, though I didn't finish it because they talk more than twilight.
