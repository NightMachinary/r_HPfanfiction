I'm pretty sure that I remember this author from Live Journal. I thought I was subscribed but I can't find it and the account may be deleted. She had a series of fanfics which from what I remember were all Harry/Ron with different things different about Harry's life. I'm hoping all of the fics from this author are still around or someone has copies.

For example there was one where Harry was a Slytherin and he met Ron like usual on the train but Ron didn't want to be his friend once he was sorted into Slytherin. Harry was outcast from the school because he was in Slytherin and his own housemates didn't really like him either. I think he ends up giving Ron a cat at one point? I'm not sure it was a long time ago.

There was another fic where I think Harry was a Hufflepuff and Ron may have been Slytherin but I'm not positive about that. Harry's parents were alive but I don't think they were actually married. All of the Marauders were Unspeakables, including Peter, and traveled around working. Harry grew up in a coven and sometimes traveled around with his dad. I'm pretty sure there was no Voldermort in this story. One story had Ron spending part of the summer with Harry and they end up getting lost and staying with a different coven for while.

Thanks in advance!

  That very first day on the Hogwarts Express, Harry shook Draco Malfoy's hand and became a Slytherin. Ron has hated him ever since. But Harry doesn't hate Ron ...
