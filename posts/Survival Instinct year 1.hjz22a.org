If you continue to escalate past a point then not only do you lose the support of others, you become the villain.

*********** With the escalation, who escalated first? Thats the question. In the event of the blood war, the death eaters were firing killing curses, an act thats an automatic life sentence in azkaban. Do you fire stunners, and tripping jinxes? No, you fight deadly force with deadly force. You might not fire the killing curse, but you would fight with deadlier spells.

In regard to the disagreement with how op handled the events, thats fair enough. The thing I love about fanfiction is how there are a hundred thousand different ways someone could respond to something, and all it takes is someone to write/type it out. If you disagree then ask op if you can use the idea and type how you see it.

The difference there, imo, is the scale of the act. If someone is actively and knowingly trying to kill you and anyone you love, then you have the right to escalate to lethal force (knowing, of course, the mental strain it may put you through).

The acceptable levels of escalation are different based on the intention of the other. If they simply wanted to make fun of you, you make fun of them and maybe cause physical harm if they also try to harm you.

It's one thing retaliating against bullies and an entirely different thing against killers in a war.

************* Fair enough, but both situations deals with escalation. We dont actually know why Ron was thrown from the tower, but its obvious that it was probably something physical. If he pushed someone down the stairs because that person, successfully or not, tripped him down the stairs, then its fairly obvious, imo, that he responds with violence to violence, physical to physical, and verbal to verbal.

**** Is your Harry prescient? Because the first time Ron ever "turned his back on Harry" was in fourth year. Also, why would this version of Harry lose all those points to begin with? In canon, it's to save Hagrid from himself, but I don't for a second believe that the character you described would risk his neck to smuggle a dragon out of the school to help someone else.

** The idea of Harry making a magical vow unknowingly is pretty cool. I don't know if you can base an entire story based on that single idea, but you could definitely use it for a very good one-shot or a series of vingettes.

It would also be interesting to see this vow backfire on him- as sometimes forgiveness could be the better option. Of course, it's all depending on how you interpret the vow (does he have the free will to go against his vow; he can go against the vow but there are consequences etc.)
