#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** There was one dimensional travel story where Harry original to this new dimension had at least red hair I think. Can't remember the name of the story though.

*** I think that was Sacrificial Second Chance by NaruandHarrHaremFan. I'm on mobile and don't know how to link, but the story is a little weird with the incest vibes.
