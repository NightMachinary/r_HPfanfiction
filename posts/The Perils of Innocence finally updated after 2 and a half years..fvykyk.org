  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

**** The only problem I have with the story that whenever I see it my first association is “Justine, or The Misfortunes of Virtue” and “Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded”. Yes, I have to always pull my mind out of gutter.

*** This was explained in the story, back when the kids got their wands. As long as they use wandless (accidental) magic, the sensors at the ministry don't pick up anything.

** Found it in my followed fics, reread it and remembered why I dropped it in the first place... its okay I guess.

Don't want to blast your recommendation with an essay, but one thing I about it I found extremely annoying is the "muggles are so great" tint of it, I guess? Theres a whole thing about them wanting to go to university and not being able to do that because theres no science and math at hogwarts. Bitch, there is magic. The whole story for me takes the excitement out of magic and fantasy and just turns it into a problem the kids have to maneuver around to get a normal life.

*** Muggles /are/ great. Some of my favourite people are muggles. Not every story needs to be about that, of course, but it's nice that some are.

Yeah, that was pretty much what put me off, too. Sure, Muggles are great and everything, but /Magic/.
