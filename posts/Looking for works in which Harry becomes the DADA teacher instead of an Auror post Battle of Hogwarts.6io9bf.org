A headcanon of Harry as the DADA teacher was posted yesterday on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] and now I'm dying to read a fanfic where that actually happens. Preferred pairings identical to canon.


** I remember reading an amazing fic on AO3. (linkao3(Hogwarts, to welcome you home))

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I don't even have my O.W.L.s. Between everything I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.” “Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said dryly. Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

** Well, noting the obvious, “Seventh Horcrux” (linkffn(10677106)) has it ... kind of.

Then it does happen in nonjon's “Where in the World is Harry Potter?” (linkffn(2354771)) series, comprised of the aforementioned fic, “The Untitled Cheekquel Project”, and “You Did What!”, albeit it doesn't exactly happen right after graduation.

That's all I have, I'm afraid, for I don't tend to collect post-graduation fics.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** I'm pretty sure there's a fic out there called linkffn(Professor Potter) or linkffn(A Potter Professor) that might do it. There's also linkffn(Wind Shear) which is good but in progress. And this community: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/community/A-Potter-Professor/76802/]]

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
