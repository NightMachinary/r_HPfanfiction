So my friend was a big fan of Lord of the Rings and said that he wouldn't like Harry Potter(pretty dumb but whatever) 2 weeks ago I got him the first book and told him that I would pay him to read it. So we went without talking for 2 weeks and today I find that he read all of the book. Of course I pay him and he says he wishes that there was more. I just say fanfiction and walked away. He is now 100% addicted to Harry Potter, and HP fanfiction.


** Don't let him read HPMOR.

don't down vote this either

*** Whilst I sympathise with the first sentence you're really making me struggle not to down vote you because of the second.

***** Ah. Fair enough, sorry, my innately contrary nature makes me want to down vote anything which tells me not to (though I don't know if I'd feel like up voting anything which told me to down vote it, I think I'd probably down vote it because I'd expect the person to be trying to use reverse psychology on me).
