Hey,

I read a fanfic that I'm pretty sure was a oneshot where Harry , post DH, used the resurrection stone to talk to Voldemort. It was dark and I've been looking for it recently but it is really hard to sift through the endless amounts of HPLV slash that I have no interest in reading

Any help?


** Was it linkffn(The Last Enemy by Luolang)?

  The Hallows were not an ending. Harry returns to the Forbidden Forest after the Battle and finds the Stone -- the start of his salvation and the path to his damnation.
