I think I like writing reviews. I may even make this a regular thing. This time I'd like to review a slash fic, which came highly recommended over on [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]. I only finished it a couple of months ago, but it left an impression on me, which fanfiction doesn't often do. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Link here]].

*The Premise*

The story is loosely based on the concept of the movie ‘The Family Man'. It opens with a 37-year-old Harry picking up his children for the Christmas break, a few months after the end of the epilogue. Harry learns on the car ride home that Draco's marriage has officially fallen apart. Later that night, weary with his life and job and strained relationship with Ginny, he wanders down to his village's local pub, where he encounters a strange old man. The old man gets Harry extremely drunk and offers Harry a ‘glimpse' into the life he could have had if he had changed one decision when he was younger. Harry stumbles home to bed, and wakes up the next morning in Grimmauld Place, next to one 37-year-old Draco Malfoy.

So begins the story of Harry trying to adjust into this ‘glimpse'; a universe in which during the events of Half-Blood Prince, Harry had chosen to reach out to Draco when he was in crisis and try to help him. The universe in the glimpse is not wildly different from canon, but it is different in some very poignant ways, and it sets Harry on an introspective journey of discovering a life lived more authentically. It is a highly emotionally intelligent story, more slice-of-life than plot-driven, and it works very well as what it is. If you prefer touch-and-go plot with a lot of life-threatening situations then this story probably isn't for you, but it is likely to resonate with a lot of people.

​

*The Writing*

Turn is a long fic, and it's all written in the present tense. On the first chapter this felt like something that was going to put me off. I'm used to third person past tense in almost everything I read, so there's an adjustment period to the shift, and in my experience most present tense stories are generally not very good. This is not true of Turn, which is fantastically written and made me completely forget about the tense and get deeply drawn in to the story.

Sara's Girl's strength is definitely her interpersonal writings. The characters all feel like real people, and the connections between them are written with care and consideration. There are no character bashings in this story, not even Ginny. Special mention for how well she writes children, who play a fairly large part in the story. The writing makes Harry very easy to empathise with and pulls on your heartstrings in ways that feel authentic and do not rely on contrived drama and literary tropes. Bonus, she doesn't rely on flowery descriptions at all; it is very down to earth.

The story is not a comedy, but the author has a good, light-hearted sense of humour woven into most of Harry's thoughts, which is reminiscent of the general attitude of Gryffindor and the Weasley household and gives the story a rather buoyant feeling. It's uplifting and philosophical without being lofty; one of those stories which makes you contemplative of your own life choices. It drew tears from me, which is not a common occurrence.

​

*Characterisation*

Post epilogue characterisation is bound to be a difficult task, because much changes in a person's personality in nineteen years. Saras Girl does an excellent job of maturing our favourite characters, and especially at showing who they are as parents.

Hermione is very responsible but highly career driven, Ron is much more chill, Ginny is quite playful still, but all have a gravity that they did not possess as teenagers, and it feels right. Harry feels familiar but not entirely like himself. He still has a bit of his obtuseness, but all of his hotheadedness is gone in this fic. I can certainly envision an adult Harry who is much more patient and loves being a dad (and in this story he absolutely does), but it's harder to imagine that he became such a low key, empathetic person at times. I don't think the differences in the Harry we see in this fic take away from the enjoyment of reading it, but in retrospect some of the choices he made didn't feel like the choices canon Harry would have made.

Draco in this version is much more humanised as well -- no leather pants, Slytherin-prince-sex-god here. He's actually a relatively anxious person, and it's a take on him that I haven't seen before but gels rather well in the story. He has some tics that would require quite a patient person to live with him, which is why Harry seems like an odd choice in some ways, but as I said this is a more patient version of Harry than we're used to.

I'll add my thoughts about the romance briefly in this section too, because despite it being a love story, I feel like the romance takes a back seat to Harry's personal journey. It's not a spicy romance, it's much calmer, occasionally punctuated with sex, but largely told through the quiet of domestic life, and it's really quite charming. It's one of the better romances I've read, and of course it's a lot of fun reading Harry's discomfort at his growing realisation of his attraction to the same sex.

​

*The Tone*

Turn is a story of personal change, and personal connection. It is very sweet, very respectful, even nostalgic since we're following the characters after their lives have settled down. The children are relatively central characters, and it all feels very family friendly and safe for work.

I have a criticism of the story around the tone, and that is that amongst all the family friendly themes are a smattering of graphic sex scenes throughout. It is clearly not a smut story primarily, and the sex scenes are not a central feature, nor do they take up a large amount of the text. I have no issues with good smut (and her smut IS good), but the very detailed sex between Harry and Draco can be a jarring tonal change, since it just doesn't seem so much like that kind of story.

Sara's Girl is good at writing the feel-good family story that is most of Turn, and she's good at writing heavy Drarry smut, but putting them together in the same text feels like the wrong fit. Turn feels like any sex should be portrayed through the textual equivalent of softened candlelight scenes or a Fade to Black, though if I'm honest it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the story at all.

I have one other criticism related to tone, and this is more of an overarching one. Turn is a heavily emotional story rather than plot-centric as I've said, but it suffers from a lack of consequences in a similar manner to what occurs in most YA literature. In YA we come to know fairly quickly that nothing bad will ever happen to the characters we're supposed to like, because even though they're often surrounded by life-threatening situations with huge risks, none of them ever eventuate. A similar problem occurs with the emotional stakes in Turn. Everyone is so mature and understanding of everyone else that there is no conflict in the story whatsoever, which makes it feel rather as though upending your life the way that Harry does has no real consequences. And the reality is that no matter how empathetically and respectfully you come at certain problems, you can't always stop people getting hurt.

​

*Overall*

Criticisms aside, I enjoyed this story immensely. It is immersive and compelling and definitely relatable if you're over thirty. I think it will resonate most with middle-aged adults but is appropriate for all ages over 18. I've read some very good Drarry stories, but this one still stood out amongst them. The quality is that of a published novel, and it's better than some. If you've ever thought of giving Drarry a try but really like canon, this would probably be an excellent story to ease yourself in. Highly recommended.


** Thank you for writing this! I've seen this fic recc'd before, but when the summary was so simple and didn't explain what it was about, I just kept passing it over for fics I was more excited about.

​

But you've convinced me to give it a try now. Cheers!
