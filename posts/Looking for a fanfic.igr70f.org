:END:
From what I remember the old pureblood families started working with muggle drug dealers because they started running out of money. Tom Riddle Jr. was the head of this pureblood organization. Werewolves are kept in these camps as soldiers. The Potters die but Sirius isn't incriminated so he doesn't go to jail. That's all I remember so I hope that's enough information for someone to recognize it.
