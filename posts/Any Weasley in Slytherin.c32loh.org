** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/][The Changeling]] is one of my absolute favorites.

i've been trying to type out something coherent on my thoughts on the fic's characterization of Ginny, its lack of kid politicians, its portrayal of boarding school culture... having trouble articulating myself rn, but it's a very good read and one i often revisit.

there are hints of the "secret Slytherin society" trope, but it's done quite well and not cringeworthy at all.

i also like that there's no real romance until later; the endgame is Harry/Ginny, but the buildup to it is realistic.

** Been reading Linkao3(rose petal red) recently and its one of my favourite stories featuring slytherin politics. The Weasley in this fic is an oc, Ginnys twin but she actks like a proper Weasley and is close to her family.

  I'm a little upset with the creativity of my and my twin's names. I get that it's because our father's name is Arthur, and I was an unexpected --- though pleasant --- surprise. But Guinevere is just the English version of Ginevra! That's so- Wait. What do I even care about that?I'm the eighth Weasley. In the Harry Potter universe. Ginny is my twin sister.Oh god.(Well, at least magic is super cool. Right?)

*** Just be warned that the author is rehashing almost every canon station despite a live Lily and Harry & Ginny in Slytherin.

Is it really that difficult to develop some original plots?

WTH is the point in regurgitating the same stuffs over and over again?

**** You know, that is a good point. I suppose some things are rather unavoidable, but others could have been significantly altered or avoided altogether. However, it is not my story. I cannot decide how it is written, only whether to read it or not. Honestly, I read it for the characterization, because the author does a pretty good job of developing the characters and I hope to learn from their example.

****** I feel like the author might be trying to make a point of how often Harry and Ginny keep getting fucked over, and no matter what they do, they can't seem to escape from fate's clutches. It gives the reader (or at least, me,) that feeling of dramatic irony, because you can tell where the scene is going, the character(s) are completely oblivious, and you're helpless to stop them. Kinda like a horror movie.

  A pre-Hogwarts tale that will be the first of eight books retelling the tale of Harry Potter. An exploration of the Many World's theory where changing one thing changes everything and at the same time changes nothing. HPMD sets the stage for a different Harry as he embarks on the journey of a lifetime. Rated M for language and later content.
