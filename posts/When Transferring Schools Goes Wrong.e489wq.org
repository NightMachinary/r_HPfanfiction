Indy!Harry gets frustrated with the "incompetent" school that "Manipulative" Dumbledore is running and manages to run off to America to be free of Albus' supposed machinations and to get a /real/ magical education. Unfortunately for him, he transfers to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFoX0i4Sm_0][Clortho]].

 

Alternatively, Dolores Umbridge manages to flee Britain after the fall of Voldemort. Trying to advantage of the lack of knowledge that each side of the pond has on each other (and the inherited authority the more prim and posh British accents have in the States), she uses her resume as being a reformer and (according to her) the defacto head of /the/ Hogwarts in order to get a position at Clortho, a school desperate for anyone with even the reputation of success.


** Upvote for introducing me to Clortho. Also it would be hilarious to read of a school more dysfunctional than Hogwarts!

** Harry didn't know what to expect of America. All of his understanding of Yank culture came from television shows and movies he'd managed to catch snippets of, either behind the backs of the Dursleys or when Mrs. Figg had set the telly and given Harry the remote while "babysitting." Harry attempted his own research, of course, but aside from snippets of history and the constant stream of popular culture exported from the former colonies, he figured he was only going to get along by jumping in headfirst. Besides, the media was all Muggle anyway, so there was no way everyone in the States was a gangster or cowboy copper, right?

Harry knew that Britain was a death sentence, though, and he had to get out. While his next best option for an education was Beauxbatons, /Voldemort/ sounded a little too French for Harry's taste, and the school was not nearly far enough away from his problems.

Harry had heard of Ilvermorny, which had a reputation as the 'American Hogwarts,' even down to its house system and castle-like visage, nestled somewhere in the Smoky Mountains. That sounded nice.

Harry found himself somewhere near downtown Baltimore, though, in front of a squat, cement building, supported by brown brick at its lower levels and lifeless grays intermixed at the top, if one ignored the explicit graffiti covering nearly every face. The windows were all barred like a prison's, and all manner of detritus littered streets and sidewalks and areas Harry guessed were supposed to be grassed; spent cigarettes were /everywhere/, as well as plastic and paper takeout bags, boxes, and even abandoned shopping trolleys. The only clue that he was in the right place was a tall, barbed-wire fence that had "Vincent Clortho's" spelled out in the twisted iron above a twin gate into the complex.

"Watch out, fugly four eyes!"

Harry snapped out of his observational aura as he abruptly met the sidewalk. It didn't help that all of Harry's worldly possessions collapsed with him, save for Hedwig, who was still making her trip across the Atlantic.

"Bloody hell!" Harry had his wand out in a snap with one hand, while pushing his glasses up with the other, and sized his attacker up.

Scratch that. Plural. Attackers.

It was a small mob of racially diverse teens, aged thirteen to... what might as well have been thirty. These kids were huge!

"Marcus! Jermaine! Helga! Sledge!" A commanding voice boomed over the smattering of back-packed students littering the sidewalks and general industrial noise of the city traffic around them. "By all that is unholy, get inside before I call aunty Slappy!" A black, bearded man sporting a tweed suit, accentuated by bits of golden filigree-like jewelry marched up the sidewalk from the gates. Harry's assailants held that telltale debate of risking the ire of an authority figure and ruined fun, or taking the delayed gratification route. Logic eventually prevailed, and they skipped past the gates.

Was one of them really called 'Sledge?'

"Sorry about that," the suited man offered a hand to help Harry up, and Harry took it. "Parnabus Jackson, Principal of our illustrious Clortho's school of you know what."

Harry wretched himself up to his feet and returned the man's firm grip. "Harry Potter, sir, I erm, think I'm in the right place?"

"Oh yes! The one and only boy wonder! Dumbledore sent word."

Harry shrunk a bit at that. He hated having a reputation.

"Don't worry, don't worry, whatever your past, I'm sure it's nothing compared to what these kids have done."

"Really?"

"Absolutely! You'll fit right in, I'm sure. That is, Headmaster Dumbledore speaks very highly of your combat talents..." Mr. Jackson trailed off with a worried look in his eyes.

"Defense was my best subject, sir."

"Ha ha! That little fall notwithstanding, am I right?" Mr. Jackson seemed to nod to Harry's wand with his eyebrows. Harry looked back and forth from his wand to Mr. Jackson and tried to piece something together.

"I'm sorry, sir, I'm not sure what sort of protocols are in place here. I just arrived today."

"That's quite all right, Harry. You see, it's illegal for under-aged wizards to carry wands outside of school in America, but I'm sure you didn't know that." Harry was taken aback. He looked around, and sure enough, all the kids, mostly teenagers around Harry's age or above were slowly, almost idly, making their way into the grounds, but no one had a wand out. Some of them were clearly loitering, sharing listening to music or smoking or just conversing in tight circles, but they all had backpacks hanging off of them in various shoulder-positions, baggy clothing in disparate shades of black, gray, or hideously 'Dumbledorish,' hiding mostly skinny bodies, no wand or magic in sight. It was a stark contrast to Hogwarts' strict uniforms and almost care-free displays of prestidigitation.

Some of these kids, they looked straight out of the dramas on the telly. Harry half expected them to be all sipping from red plastic cups and quoting poetry while admonishing "clique" culture, all-the-while participating in it. It was surreal.

"This isn't a private boarding school," Mr. Jackson laughed, following Harry's eyes. A bell rang that seemed to spur everyone around into action. "Welcome to Clortho's, Harry Potter. Follow me to your home room, and we'll get you situated."

*** Home Room, it turned out, was just a classroom that some people gathered in to get their schedules. Not a Great Hall, not a dorm, not a tower, just a bare, white, concrete classroom, and it wasn't anything like a home. This was after Harry submitted his trunk to a search for contraband.

"Oh ho ho!" Lester Bigglesby, the school's head of security eyed Harry's possessions with a device not unlike "Mad-Eye" Moody's. "Invisibility cloak huh? Got something to hide, King Harry, sur?!" Lester said in a terrible British accent.

"That's a family heirloom!" Harry spat, then immediately realized his folly.

"All the way from England? Think you're a right and posh noble, then?"

"Lester..." Mr. Jackson interrupted, tilting his head and winking.

"Oh, yeah. Sure thing your lordship. Just don't let Aunty Slappy see that! Or not see that. Whatever the circumstance. Neeeeeext!"

Harry gathered his things as quickly as he could and was silently thankful for Mr. Jackson's help. Harry had an independent streak for the last few years, but he felt completely out of his element here in a foreign nation, especially one that seemed to screen its students' belongings as part of regular protocol, and whose reputation for violence might have even been /under/represented in the media, given just how.... everyone seemed to act: there were pregnant girls amidst the security screenings, and they were the scary ones, it seemed, hiding all sorts of contraband that mister Bigglesby found. It was like everyone was ready to cast hexes at a moment's notice, and... well it was a bit overwhelming!

Clortho's was minuscule compared to Hogwarts, and yet the halls and tiny classrooms seemed packed with activity. Everyone in Harry's Home Room lounged about as disruptively as if they were outside prior to the bells ringing. The middle-aged, scrawny witch with long gray hair seemed rather earnest in her efforts to quell the twenty-some-odd students in the room before the Principal walked in with Harry.

"Shut your gods-forsaken traps or I'll call Slappy I swear!" she screamed as Mr. Jackson awkwardly righted himself next to her at the front of the classroom, Harry in tow. The students mostly calmed down, some sliding into tiny desks and others awkwardly hanging off of them or tables in the back of the classroom, but mostly silent.

"Mhm. Yes, well, I'd like to introduce to you our newest exchange student. From Hogwarts," Mr. Jackson announced. There was a dribble of snickering throughout the small room. Harry felt smaller than ever.

"Yo, Prince Jackson, Hogwarts aint got shit on you!" announced a tall boy with curly black hair at the back of the room. The rest of the class erupted in giggles.

"Thank you, Carl," Mr. Jackson said while putting up his hands, "but this isn't a competition. In fact, we are all here to learn, as is our newcomer, and, well, I thought he'd be rather helpful for our school and all of us. Would you like to tell us your story, Harry?"

Harry gulped. He was a tiny, pale, now admittedly posh in an off-handed, snarky sort of way that would not at all translate to these kids, he knew, little boy who happened to be good at surviving the Killing Curse and flying on a broomstick.

"Errm. Hullo." Harry began. More snickers. "Yeah, so, my name is Harry Potter and I decided to come to America."

Silence.

It was worse than the giggling, half-phased malaise attitude that seemed to pervade everyone at the school at all times. It was a silent, rapturous attention that even school's Principal couldn't garner.

"Bitch, you ain't Harry Potter."

Suddenly, the spell was broken. The class erupted in laughter. A slightly heavy-set... girl, we'll say girl, because she definitely doesn't look old enough to qualify as a woman, sitting on a pile of pillows in the back of the room with an obviously round belly had called Harry out and everyone went nuts. The professor, or teacher, or whatever, was trying to yell the students down. Mr. Jackson seemed to be trying to use gravitas and dark threats to qualm the students.

"Harry Potter killed a basilisk! You scrawny piece barely big enough to hold his own--"

"I swear on my magic I'll strike you and I don't care what your mother--"

"I take bigger shits than Harry Potter!"

"Darkness envelope yee! I will TURN you into a spider if you say one more motherf--"

"/Silencio!/"

Harry's wand was out. First, silencing charms; then, binding charms; then, jinxes; finally, curses. Once he had the classroom fully quelled, he pointed his eleven inches of holly and phoenix feather at the group, including the teachers.

"That is but a fraction of the control I can enter upon you sorry lot." Someone erupted in a bout of laughter.

"Sorry," the relatively small boy said. "It's just, the accent, and holy shit. You're Harry fucking Potter! But you're like... toy sized?"

Harry hated his reputation. The boy who lived. The savior of the whatever. A burden placed on him from birth when by all rights he should just have been a normal kid growing up in the countryside with a magical family and some magical friends. He rarely got grief from his physically small stature in the wizarding world in Britain...

And then, he felt like a complete ass. He was acting like Malfoy. He was being a fucking bully, the thing he hated more than anything.

"Harry? I uh, would threaten you, but I'm not sure--"

"Sorry, Principal Jackson." Harry lifted the various magics he had been concentrating on and found a corner of the room to meld into, just slightly away from anyone who might want to associate with the weird British kid who just started magicking the world around them.

"No no no, I think I misunderstood you, Harry." Parnabus Jackson was standing tall at the head of the classroom. "I think you're exactly correct for this school, but for reasons Dumbledore didn't understand."

"Dumbledore?"

"Yes." Mr. Jackson nodded and drew the attention of everyone in the room, as if he was some simulacrum of the Grand Magus himself. "I follow Dumbledore's discretion in matters of upmost importance, which involves, well, you, and..."

"Stop." Harry held out a hand but pushed no magic. The classroom grew silent again.

"Fuck Dumbledore," Harry said.

The class seemed to agree by way of applause. It was rather nice to be so uncouth for a change.

"The power he knows not..." Harry whispered to himself, and just let the raucous of the classroom envelope him for a while, wondering why it felt so good and so easy so right.

Thanks! I had a few too many beers and just couldn't stop writing (or drinking), so hopefully it made some sort of sense. By the end I was thoroughly sloshed :/ I wanted to include the onerous house elf Aunty Slappy showing up and kicking Harry's ass, but I ran out of steam (and booze).

Slappy is the /real/ power behind Clortho's!

** ~only reads the title~

Whilst attempting to transfer between Hogwarts and Beauxbatons, the travel spell that Harry attempts doesn't transfer him from Hogwarts to Beauxbatons; it transfers Hogwarts from Harry to Beauxbatons.\\
Some glitch with the castle's emergency-escape spells, apparently. Now Britain/Scotland have no magical school, and France has a total of two, one of which is filled with very confused students.

*** I feel france would feel nervous

as a castle filled with british people just teleported into france

The french wizards would assume the british wizards are invading and the british wizards will think the french stole there castle

Wizarding britian declares war against wizarding france to restore its castle and rescue its Citizens.

Voldemort sensing an opportunity pivots the death eaters into being a group for the 'best' of wizarding britian and launchs a horrible campaign against the french wizard

Much to the horror of the french ministry and the delight of the average British wizard who do not believe the french when they say we have no idea why your castle teleported to France.

Dumbledore grows tired and stressed, having to run a school at a country his goverment is at war while protecting it at the same time

and dealing with an increasingly obnoxious harry who suggests he planned the castle teleporting to france for some reason.

Ron takes every chance he gets to remind malfoy that his last name is french as ron might be a blood traitor but at least he aint french

Hogwarts spends years under siege. Dumbledore is very confused and decides he needs to retire when voldemort shows up and he is like thank fuck its voldemort this I understand, only for voldemort to break the siege and then leave before saying hello.

-edit-

Voldemort discovers he quite enjoys being actually cheered by the people and is shocked when after the war he discovers he is voted minister of magic. Dumbledore is even more Shocked when he gets invited to become the first head of the education department.

Dumbledore spends the rest of his life slowly waiting for the other shoe to drop, he dies of old age at 230 and then voldemort promptly retires as minister of magic.

when asked why, he said he only stayed on as minister so long to mess with dumbledore but now that dumbledore is dead he is going to study magic in peace.

Ronald weasley becomes a famous wizarding chess player and ''Auror'' famously had a 60 year win streak after which voldemort personally asked ronald to retire from chess as the ministry was spending too much time on from stoping ron being assassinated by every other wizarding chess player.

Harry goes on to become headmaster of hogwarts, he still claims every education law dumbledore passed was specifically designed to annoy him, harry was wrong only 20 percent of the laws dumbledore passed where designed to annoy harry.

Hermione refused to learn french shocking all of hogwarts at hermione not wanting to learn something she had a long successful career at the ministry in several departments, it is rumoured she asked the minister to push her husband into retiring from chess after she moved deparments to become head of the ministry budgetary committee.

Hagrid became famous for his training of creatues to defend hogwarts during the siege and surprisingly married madam olympe after the war, it became a very famous love story.

Luna married harry potter, due to sharing his belief that dumbledore was behind every plot they had a very happy marriage dumbledore was quite shocked to be invited to the wedding but luna replied, we wanted to save you the cost on polyjuice.

The malfoys got mocked for having a french name, Draco malfoy decided to become an auror to combat the mockery his boss is noted as having said 'Malfoy is a damn fine auror shame about the frenchness though'

Wizarding australia annexed Wizarding new Zealand, in what the muggleborns called a pro gamer move.

Sirius black had a very happy life having cleared his name during the war against france, he was very fond of his godson though he wished harry would stop blaming dumbledore for everything even more so after dumbledore died.

Arthur weasley rose very high at the ministry much to his own surprise finding himself as head of a new department designed to plan muggleborn intergration into the wizarding world.

future wizard historians are very confused about how wizard hitler turned into one of the greatest ministers of magics in wizarding history and completely reformed its society for the better

Harry potter died at age 600 of a heart attack after beating his friend Ron in a chess match Ron also died in shock of losing to harry for the first time in his life.

Voldemort gave a very heartfelt speech at the funeral and said it sucks ron died, as voldemort had yet to beat him at chess.

Albus Dumbledore Potter was known to be a great wizard though he wondered why his father named him after a man he was meant to hate, he also wondered why is father exchanged Christmas and birthday gifts with the man he was meant to hate

Nargle snorkack Potter belived albus potter complained too much about his name not making sense at least he was named after a real thing.

Nevile longbottom decapitated a snake with a sword. Minister for magic Voldemort described the event as pretty fine example of British values.

Nevile started drinking heavily to deal with the fact belatrix lestrange started hitting on him after said event.

Dean Thomas died an old man having introduced soccer to the wizarding world The British wizarding celebs verus us wizard celebs was a well loved game, though people admited while the british team was filled with A-list celebs only Albus dumbledore was any good at the game
