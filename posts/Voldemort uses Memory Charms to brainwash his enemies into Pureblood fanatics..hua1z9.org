** Not Voldemort, but Lucius Malfoy did exactly that to Muggleborn children in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7945354/chapters/18164602][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkao3(7945354). Upon detecting their accidental magic, he sent out Obliviators to murder their parents, obliviated their childhood memories, and used the old fashioned indoctrination to brainwash them. As result, he created a very effective fighting force out of these children who were at same time unconditionally loyal to him, like [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janissaries][the Ottoman Janissaries]] in the past.

His manipulations were so perfect that even after Hermione uncovered his scheme, she dared not to inform her fellow Muggleborns.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Dear Christ, that's an even more horrifying idea than the /Imperius/ curse, IMO.
