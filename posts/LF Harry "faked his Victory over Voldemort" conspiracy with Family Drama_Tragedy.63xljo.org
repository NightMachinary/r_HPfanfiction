Ok, i didnt know, how to keep the Title short enough to deliver the content, that im looking for. As we all know, Voldemort "disintegrated" into Ashes in the Movie, instead of fall over dead like in the Book. And Anyone in the Castle seems to forget to gratulate Harry for his great Deed and seem to think its a matter of course that he would Defeat the greatest Dark Wizard 100%, unlike the Book. I want to know if there are Fics that make one of Harrys Children (i had thought about James) challenge at some point Harrys Victory. Since Voldemorts Body "vanished" there is no proof that he is actually dead and since he and Voldy fighted outside of the Castle Halls, there were no Witness at all. Harrys Kid/s take notice of his "I shall not tell lies" Scars on his Hand and make their own ideas of the great ideal Father...to make this Challenging complete/perfect, there are some Reports (maybe from Rita Skeeter) that also Question Harrys Victory, but since she is a conspirating reporter, her reportings are more like "entertainment" than serious, but James (or whoever else) believe those Reports. Also there are "Hints" that practically show that it could be right (in the Kids view) that Harry just make an arrangement with Voldy to disappear and paid the whole gouvernment to make him a Super Hero, In the Kids View through this "Evidences" s/he believe that Harry is an imposter, while in reality Voldys defeat was real.

Family Drama/Tragedy because Harry possibly has enough of a "stuborn Child, who dont believe his Father" and force him/her to leave the House. Maybe Years Later Hermione (or someone else) find James, who found a Flat and try to convince him that The Defeat wasnt faked. To be honest, i dont know myself how it should end. I just had the idea by watching Voldemorts death and all seems to be honkey dory

** OK, going to take a stab at translating this.

The big change you want is Harry fought Voldemort alone, with no witnesses. The body disintegrates like in the movies, evidently (I haven't watched them). Rita (or someone else) pulls a scandal piece saying Harry didn't kill Tom, Harry's kids are rebellious and sees the scars on his hands and thinks he is lying. James Sirius buggers off, and and becomes a destitute teen who rents a flat.

This is a fairly specific request I doubt anyone has ever done.
