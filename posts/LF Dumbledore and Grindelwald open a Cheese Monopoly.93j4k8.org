Instead of trying to take over the world, Grindelwald has much less evil ambitions, he wants to control the world's Cheese supply. It's all for the Grater Good, of course. Dumbledore, seeing no harm in this, decides to help his childhood friend. Bonus points if Wallace and Gromit get involved due to their supply of Wensleydale being cut off.


** More like the Grater Gouda...ha! I'll just show myself out.

** There is no soft cheese or hard cheese. There is only Stilton and those to weak to eat it.
