** I wanna say Master of Death. Only because I presume Death would call you Master regardless of your sex since it doesn't really have a gender... Plus it's your fic, call it what you will :)

*** Oh, it was just curiosity that made me ask this question. But I suppose you're right. It's mastering death after all. There's no mistressing death, unless we're talking about a smut fic.

**** See... Now THAT... would be an interesting yet weird yet interesting read. I've only read a few MoD fics where it's Harry/Death

** Matron of Mortality; the Dread Voice of Finality; Sorceress of Souls; Thief of Heartbeats; her most ineluctable presence at the Borderlands; the undying woman.

Mostly, they just say. "You?! Aghk!"

** Lady of Death does sound interesting, but i dont think the Death part means an actual being. Master means you have mastered some skill or academic concept originally. It's not necessarily gender specific, it's just that back in the day women weren't given any sort of education sooo only males had the title of Master.

Master/mistress is more slaveownerish or a way to refer to a noble you are subordinate to.

So Master of Death is if death is a concept and you have accepted it(canonwise) and Mistress if your the female ruler of some personification of death.

** Eh. If you don't like "master" for a girl, go with one of the canonical gender-neutral terms, "conqueror" or "vanquisher." No need to invent a new term that makes the uniter of the Deathly Hallows seem more super-special-awesome than (s)he really is.

*** Well, Mistress is kind of the female version of Master, is it not? So Conqueror or Vanquisher would even be more "making something up" than Mistress.

**** No, because "conqueror" and "vanquisher" are terms that were used in canon, by Xenophilius Lovegood, the first one to introduce the concept.

  "When you say 'master of Death' -"said Ron.

  "Master," said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. "Conqueror. Vanquisher. Whichever term you prefer."
