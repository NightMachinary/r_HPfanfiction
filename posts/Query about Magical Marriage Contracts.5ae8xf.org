I've only been reading fanfiction for a few months, and I keep coming across this plot device - the Marriage Contract. It is usually used to show how archaic pure blood society is, and/or to give our graduating heroes something to rebel against...

How did this fanfiction trope start?


** It's a cop out mechanism. We enjoy instant gratification, so people want the semblance of romance without having to trudge through all the boring build up.

TL:DR, people want Harry boning Fleur or Daphne as quick as possible.

** Arranged marriages are a huge romance trope. Marriage law docs are this trope with a wizarding twist.

Honestly, look at how many Harlequin books feature an arranged marriage even in modern day settings. It's very common.

** Arranged marriages are a romance trope, like [[/u/mergirl007]] mentioned.

Even Shakespeare used it. In "All's Well That Ends Well," Helena, the daughter of a doctor offers her services as a healer to the sick King. Except with a catch. If the King dies, she'll be put to death, if he lives, she gets to choose a husband from the court. She cures the King, chooses Bertram, who doesn't want to marry her, and the King forces him to marry her anyway. So on and so forth with the rest of the plot. [[/spoiler][She gets him in the end.]]

** One thing that never made sense in the triwiazard tournament was why Harry even participates at all. It's obviously a trap and he doesn't want to be in it so why not just concede from the start? The best answer is to introduce a form of binding magical contract with some sort of penalty for breaking it. Putting a name in the goblet then would make the person so named a party to the contract. I used this concept in my fourth Tamblin story.

I have no idea if similar thoughts motivated a marriage contract but it could be.

*** You realise that this is canon, right? That entry into the tournament is a binding magical contract?

**** They mention it being a contract but they don't ever explain the enforcement mechanism, without which it really can't be binding...

***** Well, they mention that the enforcement mechanism is magical. We don't know the wording of the contract, this is true, but apparently it was worded such that Harry had to actively participate, not just formally be part of the tournament.

****** Are there any non-crack fics where Harry does the sensible thing and just throws the tournament? As far as I understood he had to participate, but nothing said he had to try his best.

******* I think we can extrapolate from the fact that he didn't throw the tournament that he did have to try. After all there were numerous powerful and knowledgeable people who didn't want him to participate. I think between Dumbledore, Karkaroff, Maxime and Crouch Sr they would have hit upon the idea of formal but inactive participation, had it been possible.

As a matter of contract law, this is not unusual. It is extremely common in contractual terms to require that the contracting party apply their "best endeavours" or "reasonable endeavours" (a lesser obligation than best endeavours) to secure some result.

** I will be honest and say that I have a bit of a soft spot for a marriage contract fic. Not the truly horrible ones where the contract is produced and everything suddenly becomes sunshine and daisies, but rather the ones where perhaps two characters who usually would not get along are put into a situation where they have to at least try to get along. Then maybe we are treated to a gradual progression from hate to neutral, to friends, to romantic feelings maybe.
