It can be any character or OC, learning on their own or apprenticed to a master, who makes quality magical items such as broomsticks, wands, magical jewelry, weaponry, etc. Emphasis on learning the craft and producing exceptionally fine quality items (sorry Gred, no mass produced or joke products).


** Hmm, closest I've got is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone), but in that it is a little more desperation than a "learning to do this for a living" kind of thing.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  Char. Ooc, AU/AR, still within JK's world - Harry is apprenticed to a Diagon Alley businessman at the tender age of seven. From there the story changes... very mild bashing of some regulars.

** "The Ollivanders" linkffn(12723602). It follows two apprentices of Ollivander's Wand Shop and has a multitude of scenes going into the wand-making process.

  Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming clearer and clearer that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War. (For those who like to skip around to get a sense of a fic, in Chapter One I suggest which chapters I think are my best.)
