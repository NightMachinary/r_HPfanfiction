Title makes it pretty obvious what I'm looking for. I, stupidly, decided to read this fic after someone else came here looking for it, instantly fell in love, and now I really want to read the sequel, but I can't find it. I seriously just binged the last 15 chapters in less than 3 hours, including breaks. I'm gonna go to sleep now, as it is past midnight for me, but I would really appreciate if someone could help me find the sequel!!

Please, thanks, g'night!

P.S. G'night = night-time version of Australian G'day


** I'm pretty sure it was never completed. I found a download link but I'm on my phone so I'm unsure if it works. [[https://www.perusingtheshelves.com/fanfiction/harry-potter-fanfiction/340/]]
