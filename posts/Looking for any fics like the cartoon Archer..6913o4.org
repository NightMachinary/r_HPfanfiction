So as the title says looking for any Harry Potter fics that are like Archer. For reference have already read Midnight Blues. Sassy Harry spying it up, sleeping around taking the piss out of everyone. Would love it.


** I would pay to see a fic with Krieger!Snape experimenting with crazy potions in the dungeons, accompanied by his holographic Lily waifu.

** Have you read A Black Comedy? It's essentially all sass, spying, and sleeping around.

*** By Zeitgeist84, one of my favourite fics of all time. I really hope it gets finished off.

***** Honestly, as Dexter sputtered to a finish, I really couldn't stand looking at either of those fics. I kept the other around because it was a weird and interesting alternate universe thing, but Weird Fishes just kept reminding me of how shit the tv series was and how little inspiration I had to finish it. If I could go back, I would probably leave it up, but hindsight is 20/20.

****** Understandable. The last couple of seasons were completely retarded, and while I loved the Dex/Deb stuff cause of the massive taboo, it made literally no sense and pretty much massacred Deb's character. Anybody would be irritated if the base material became that bad that quickly.

** You'll never find a harry like archer story because archer is accidentally!competent and most people write harry as, at closest, a chaos magnet while being competent on purpose.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.
