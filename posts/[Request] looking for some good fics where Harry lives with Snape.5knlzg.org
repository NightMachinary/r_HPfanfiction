**** Well alright then lol.

Here's the slash fics: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/304714][Chrysalis]]: Set after the Dark Lord's death. Not quite living together, but Harry spends a lot of time at Snape's house. Very realistic view of PTSD, and one of my favourite SS/HP fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8878397/][Until the Time is Right]]: Soul Bond fic, but don't let that scare you off. Several years after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry is an Auror and need's Snape's help with a case. The Infinity Bond used in the story is very well explained, but the short of it is that it's a bond/vow invoked at a wedding that lasts through all of your lives. The author even wrote a short story about the first creation of the vow, and a few other related shorts as well. One of my all-time favourite fics.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1648583/chapters/3495599][Safe House]]: Snape's role as a spy is revealed, and he and Harry get stuck in a safe house together for a summer. It's honestly been a while since I've read it, but I remember enjoying it, lol.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/569077][Forget Me Not]]: Something is making Harry lose his memory. He lives with Snape while they figure out what's wrong with Harry. That's a really crappy description, but it's a very cute fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5706309][The Fifth Act]]: Set right after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry takes Snape home with him to heal from Nagini's bite. Quite an amusing fic, but I don't know how to explain it better without spoiling some of my favourite bits.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2457953/chapters/5448869][The Most Powerful Magic]]: Takes place I think 20 years after the Battle of Hogwarts? Snape has been in a coma that whole time, and we get to see James, Albus, Scorpius, Rose, and etc. Harry and Ginny are divorced but still friends (hard to stay married when you're gay) and Harry offers to let Snape use his spare bedroom while he's recovering from the coma. The kids really add to the story.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/610909][With Eyes Wide Open]]: A surprisingly enjoyable "marriage law"esk fic. Not actual marriage law, but Narcissa calls in her life debt and asks Harry to marry Severus because of some inheritance laws. Really, it's better than I'm making it sound lol.

Ok on to the Severitus fics. Fair warning, I tend to like Dumbledore bashing in my Severitus fics, and I think most of them have an abused Harry. Also, not as many of them, because most of the ones I read take place at Hogwarts:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10101403/1/Fixing-Past-Mistakes][Fixing Past Mistakes]]: Probably my favourite, but the writing style takes some getting used to. It starts out /really/ dark, but it gets much better. Lots of Dumbledore bashing, but it really becomes a side story once the story gets moving. Bascally, Harry doesn't show up to Hogwarts, they find out the boy actually died, so Severus goes back in time to "kidnap" Harry, and ends up raising him in another country. I love the world building in this story, since Harry doesn't go to Hogwarts at all, and there are a lot of OCs. Like I said, the writing style itself could use some work, it's a bit awkward at times, but totally worth it. Still in progress, and the author is active (she has several WIPs, so the updates are slow)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7104654/1/A-New-Place-To-Stay][A New Place to Stay]]: Same author as Fixing Past Mistakes. Starts right after the return of the Dark Lord, standard Snape thinks Harry is an arrogant idiot and slowly realises that he really had a shitty childhood. Been a while since I read this one, so I can't give you a better description.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983170/1/Never-Say-Remember][Never Say Remember]]: A really interesting take on things. The oficial summary describes it better than I can so: 13-year-old Harry is dragged into another world where he was adopted by Snape. Where his mother is still alive. Where he can't stop feeling like a stranger. And Snape discovers that a new Potter has appeared. One who won't leave him alone. Who knows Snape's deepest secret. As both Harrys search for a way home, they begin to question what home really is.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4547552/3/Arms-of-A-Dark-Angel][Arms of a Dark Angel]]: Ok, I honestly don't remember if Harry lives with Snape in this one... At the begining, Harry lives with the Dursleys and Severus just brings Harry to his house when he's sick or hurt or something. But I think they end up living together later on? Another fic that I remember enjoying, but haven't read in a while.

I know I'm forgetting some, but that's all I can think of at the moment... lol. Enjoy!
