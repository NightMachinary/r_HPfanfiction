I already have a WIP, and I'm not planning to write anything until it is done. But... what if Harry goes back in time, gets sorted into Slytherin, and basically his family hates him?

Would anyone be interested in reading that?


** It would be fresh and interesting to read for sure. When you say family, are you talking about the whole family or just a few members, like James. Also why would they hate him? James might hate him cause new kid, gathers attention, quidditch star, but why would harry's grandparents hate him?

*** sorry-I wasn't clear üòÖ

I meant that James (maybe Lily) and the Marauders would hate him, his grandparents probably wouldn't make an appearance.

**** Well that's still cool. I'd read it. A change from Lily worshipping is always nice. So would Harry be friends with Regulus, Snape and Crouch? That's the trend I've seen in Time travel fics. Not really a Snape fan. The guy is just bad in my opinion, but others are entitled to theirs. Generally when Snape is written they make him misunderstood and OOC, when in reality he wasn't a very nice person to begin with.

***** We share the same hate for Snape lol so he would hate Harry, too. As for who is gonna be friends with him, I'm not really sure. Like I said, this is just an idea that I might write sometime in the future.

  Harry accidentally time travels to 1979, where he gets captured by the Order of the Phoenix. There's a catch --- from the moment they set eyes on Harry's forced Dark Mark, they despise him.* ‚ÄúFinally awake... Death Eater?‚Äù the man spat spitefully. Harry never would have imagined meeting like this. The words ‚ÄúI can explain‚Äù were stuck on the tip of his tongue. But all that came out was a soft, strangled, ‚ÄúSirius.‚Äù

** Not Exactly hate but there is defined a rivalry between them because Lily is attracted to Harry. It's also not Lily worship. Jame gets better towards the end but it's mostly just pranking

  Harry was sick of it all. So when he catches Draco in Snape's private stores, he decides that he isn't going to stand back and let Draco lie about it. During the fight, a rare and unusual herb is hit, and Harry gets splashed with the concoction...and wakes up in his parent's fourth year! Determined not to be used again, he befriends a younger Snape and changes his name.

** It's not an uncommon premise in fics where the Slytherins (mainly Snape, usually) are the protagonists, besides Harry himself that is. It's also one of the few tropes where Lily-bash is far more common than usual.

*** There wouldn't really be any bashing (because I love Lily) but they definitely won't be 100% perfect as they are usually portrayed. And the Slytherins aren't going to be protagonists. Harry would have to disguise himself as muggleborn and I just don't see any Slytherins being friends with him. That being said, I still have plenty of stuff to work out.

** It would be interesting to read. A rivalry could develop naturally, a new slytherin talented both at quidditch and in class with a strong dislike for Peter would probably offend the marauders sensibilities.

** I've just came across this one and remembered this post. It's literally brand new.

Basically, after Harry was killed in the Forbidden Forest, he's sent 22 years in the past and has taken the body from a student called Hadrianus Burke. Apparently, old-Hadrianus didn't get along with Lily/Marauders, so, now, Harry will have a long path until he warms them up.

I don't know how to use the bot, but here is the link:
