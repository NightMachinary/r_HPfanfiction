:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm looking for a fic where Ginny leaves, heads to New York and gets hired by Tony Stark as an assistant. She's given up magic basically and doesn't use her wand - I think the pairing is Pietro x Ginny and they have a really hot and cold relationship, as opposed to her and Wanda who are pretty friendly.

At one point she accidentally shatters the lights with the hallway with wandless/ accidental magic and soon after she gets exposed and is recruited to work for SHIELD as an agent.

If anyone knows this particular fic or has the link please let me know!
