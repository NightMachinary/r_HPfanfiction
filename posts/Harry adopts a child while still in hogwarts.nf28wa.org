If anyone has some suggestions, please let me know. I'd like it if Harry has a romantic pairing with someone. NO slash!. It doesn't have to be adoption straight away but maybe childcare? Thanks

  Harry comes home after finishing his fifth year, the happenings at the department of mysteries and Sirius death heavy on his mind. He finds the Dursley household in chaos and learns that sometimes great gifts come in small packages. As usual no slash!

  What if Hermione had accidently Disapparated along with Ron during the hunt while trying to stop him? How would Harry have managed to defeat Voldemort alone? Watch as Harry takes a bold step forward with determination and new allies. This is canon compliant until the scene where Harry and Ron fight in Book 7. Two shot -- COMPLETE
