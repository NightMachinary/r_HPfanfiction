The Riddle Twins linkffn(13381792) is a very high quality story, featuring Tom and his twin sister, Mary. She was adopted from the orphanage at the age of three, but the siblings reunite at Hogwarts, altering the known timeline to a unique direction. There is some great character development in this story, and it is written so well it is a delight to read it. The story is work in progress and apparently in a very early stage, but there are already almost 100,000 words and it updates frequently. I'm sure this story will be remembered as one of the best Harry Potter fanfictions started in 2019. Check it out!


** It certainly looks like a very good start. Let's just hope the author finishes it.

** I don't know if I have he heart to start another story just for it to be abandoned....I might have to wait until it's complete to read it but it looks really good.

  "Tom, after his father..." Merope Gaunt woefully rasped, aware of the fact she was dying, "and Mary - Mary Riddle, after her grandmother." Eleven years later, Mary, who was adopted at the age of three by a wealthy, adoring family, is to reconcile with her twin brother at Hogwarts.
