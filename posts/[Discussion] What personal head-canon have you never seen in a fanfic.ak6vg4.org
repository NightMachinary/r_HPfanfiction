Having read a lot of fanfic in my time, as well the canon more times than I can count, slowly head canons form. Sometimes my headcanons developed from what I read in a fanfic, but other times, I have headcanons that I have never seen before.


** Magical Ireland is part of Magical Britain, because the magical and muggle governments seperated 300 years ago when the Statute of Secrecy was enacted, and Magical Ireland didn't have any reason to secede when the muggle Irish did.

**** My headcanon is that Magical America is separate from Britain and other European governments, but not because of the American revolution--it was always separate, Magical Britain and other European countries never had colonies, Magical societies in the New World were formed by immigrants who wanted to get away from stodgy European governments controlled by wealthy purebloods.

Don't really have a headcanon for Germany, it never really comes up in canon or fanfiction.

***** The entire HRE would still be a thing since there is no Napoleon or 30 year war to overthrow it. And the low countries should still be a member. Although the HRE should be closer to the EU than a sovereign, unified nation.

America is also interesting because there is no reason for the magical colonial powers to sell off their parts of NA, since they were not involved in the Muggle wars. Or maybe Norway rules all of Canada.

** Demelza Robins is the Daughter of Bellatrix Lestrange, who had been found abandoned by the Muggle Authorities after the Lestranges were thrown into Azkaban. The timeline fits if she was born between September 1st and October 31st 1981. And unlike her parents, Mel is perfectly adjusted and has no desire for magical fascism. She has been adopted and raised by a pair of Muggles and considers them her parents.

"I will bring the clothes on my back and my wand, good enough - right?" Seriously, at that age I could plan things better! I would have raided muggle warehouses for food (or bought it, if I had enough funds!), especially the canned and non-perishable kind! I'd have had the tent (instead of Hermione! Hell, I might have done away with the tent and would have gone with a Fidelius instead on a property or hell, a small patch of land to set up the tent permanently!), I'd have had each of the trio carry one of those super-bags, I'd have purchased books for learning (you can't hunt day in and day out and some defense or potions learning is a good idea!) and potions ingrediants etc....seriously, Harry is such a moron in that book!

****** Harry is worse in DH, but Hermione and Ginny are reduced to annoyance and sporty girl in HBP. I mean, in CoS Hermione comes up with Polyjuice on a mere hunch but when there are really suspicious circumstances around Malfoy, a simple stunner from behind and pulling up his sleeve is too much? Or a severing charm in the Great Hall? Of course, brewing Veritasserum is always an option as well. And Ginny loses all agency. She goes from "I will go with you" to "let's do this incredibly transparent ruse and you go off to win the war".

** It's not strictly fanfic-based, but I do have this personal headcanon based on the uniform design for the Hogwarts robes from the movies - which I believe is based on a pretty stock school uniform design, with robes added.

This came about one time when I was rewatching /Sorceror's Stone/ and I noticed that during the Sorting, every single first-year is wearing exactly the same uniform, including a plain black tie with the Hogwarts crest, and it's not until the first classroom scene that you see them wearing their House colors IIRC.

So I developed the headcanon that the robes sold to first-year students are all plain, but that they carry a temporary enchantment that allows them to change colors to reflect the student's assigned House once he or she has been Sorted.

Obviously, robes sold to second-years and up are sold already in their House colors, since they already know it. But I find this is a good magical solution for First-years who don't know their House yet. Of course, it doesn't address the question of secondhand robes, I'll concede that.

**** That's true. Though I've noticed that the "wizards can't dress like Muggles to save their skins" aspect(which I always felt was rather silly) does seem to be severely downplayed in the movies.

I think if I had to think about it, the novel "robes" are probably meant to be traditional robes that are worn /as/ regular clothing or, in the case of students, their uniform, rather than what the movie does which is to have them wear light robes /over/ a more normal uniform.

** I'm sure that these are in some fanfictions, but these are just things I've come up with.

People are able to Apparate or use the Floo way of travel to different places around the world.

It takes more magic to Apparate, but you can still do it; if you concentrate hard enough on the location outside of Britain (Or wherever you live).

So you could visit America, France, German, Italy et cetra just by Apparation or Floo.

There are houses inside Hogsmeade, that are hidden. (I don't know if I remember reading this or not, but I've thought of this idea).

Using different languages make the spell more powerful. Say French, Italian, German, even Parseltongue makes the spell more powerful.
