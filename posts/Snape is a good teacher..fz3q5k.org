  When a young Auror recruit badmouths a certain Potions Professor, he learns exactly why the Aurors thought that the man was practically the greatest thing since sliced bread despite his character flaws which were too numerous to count. To them, Snape's "Winning" personality was a gift that kept on giving (and not in the venereal disease sense of the phrase).

***** Firstly, he's Neville's boggart. Snape scared a 13-year-old so badly that he became the kid's worst fear. A kid who knew his parents had been tortured into insanity and suffered from at least the emotional abuse of his family was more afraid of Snape than anything else. That came from somewhere.

Secondly, he told Hermione, when she was hit by a spell which caused her front teeth to grow, that he "saw no difference." He made fun of a 14-yead-old's appearance.

Sure, that's something a bully might say. Malfoy would, and had, said worse things than that. Maybe Snape's not as cruel as other children could be/are. He's not cruel in the same way Umbridge is. But that is not the standard teachers should be held to.

He's a good character, he's really interesting to play with in fics, and he's might even be redeemable, depending on how an author spins him. The harsher critics exaggerate. But he is definitely cruel to his students.

(That being said, I highly recommend Pureblood Pretense. It's very good.)

******* Yeah...they're /kids./ Which means it doesn't matter if Snape's comment about Hermione is witty; he's mocking the appearance of a young teenager, who's in one of the phases during which people have the most issues with self-confidence. Adults, especially adults in positions of authority like teachers, /should not do that/.

You have a point that, at 13, Neville might not fear his parents' torturers as much as the more immediate threat of academics/teachers. But I still disagree with what you're implying. You use the phrase "harshest critic", which I find strange, because Snape didn't seem like he was "criticizing" to me. Criticism should be constructive. Snape's comments were mockery. Again, the fact that Neville is a kid should make Snape's behavior even more unacceptable.

As other people have said, part of being a good teacher is treating your students well. Part of being a mediocre teacher is not treating your students awfully.

I never got this. Like, did he go to Voldemort and tell him "I've been such an unlikable person that I've alienated entire generations of wizards, thereby preventing me from gaining any inside knowledge into various aurors, hit wizards, key members in the Ministry, etc"?

*** While I hate Snape and think he's a despicable shithead, I don't subscribe to the idea that he's the worst teacher that can possibly exist like a lot of people claim.

Having said that, to call him a good teacher is being extremely generous as well. If I had to rate Snape with the same standards that I do with the teachers that I've had across school and university, he'd come somewhere in the middle, slightly below average.

I'd rate him 2-2.5/5.

EDIT: If you include his actions in Book 7, then his rating goes into the negatives. When he was headmaster, the Cruciatus curse became an acceptable form of punishment for eleven year olds, and dozens of students are in hiding inside the Room of Requirement out of fear of torture. Book 7 Snape deserved to be lynched.

**** Interesting, I have basically the opposing view on his teaching 1-6th year vs 7th year -- because I don't think he could have improved things. If he tried, Voldemort would just replace him with someone worse. On the other hand, I've never seen a worse teacher during the other years. That being said, I never really had any bad teachers during my upbringing, so that might be why.

This is probably it. I've had all kinds of teachers, and have heard about ones that inadvertently caused student deaths with their punishments in the news. Compared to all that, Snape from Book 1-5/6 is useless as a teacher, but far from the worst.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Voldemort replacing him doesn't actually lead to anything different. Students under Snape's "care" are tortured and maimed, so what is worse?

There are no muggleborns in the school in Book 7 thanks to the Muggleborn Registration Committee, and the regime seems to be taking care not to kill purebloods or halfbloods.

Arthur Weasley, who Voldemort himself knows to be part of the Order, goes to work in the Ministry, as does his son Bill at Gringotts.

Andromeda Tonks, who gave her house as a safe point to the Order, isn't killed - tortured during "interrogation", yes, but not killed. Her daughter who married a werewolf is also safe.

Xenophilius, who openly wrote propaganda against the Death Eaters, isn't killed.

Even Hagrid, a half-giant, is living on Hogwarts grounds.

So even if Snape is replaced, nothing changes.

Besides, Voldemort considers Snape his right hand, and gives him a lot of leeway in several other things in the past. I'd even go so far as to say that Voldemort respects Snape's abilities, as much as Voldemort can anyway. It wouldn't be a stretch to think that Voldemort would more or less accept Snape's request for more lenient punishments.

***** By keeping his "cover", students get tortured and maimed inside a school.

So, getting his cover blown leads to what, exactly?

There are no muggleborns inside the school in Book 7, thanks to the Muggleborn Registration Committee. They're not killing halfbloods or purebloods, even those who the Death Eaters know are in the Order, like Arthur Weasley - the trio see Arthur working at the Ministry and going about his work like normal, even though Voldemort knows first hand that Arthur is in the Order - or Mrs Tonks, who gave her house to the Order as a safe point in the Seven Potters chapter. Even Hagrid, a half-giant, is alive and well at Hogwarts.

If they're not doing any killing, getting his cover blown will have no effect at all. They'd still be continuing the torture, same as before.

#+begin_quote
  sent Ginny to Hagrid for detention
#+end_quote

You mean when he sent a minor into a forest that has a known colony of giant, man-eating spiders that listen to no one but themselves? With Hagrid, who doesn't even have a wand to defend himself? Ron is right, Harry tends to downplay the severity of dangerous situations a lot.

Discounting even that, the cheer that the students make when McGonagall says Snape ran off make it quite clear exactly what they thought of him and his methods.

Besides, Voldemort considers Snape his right hand - the Carrows answer to Snape, not the other way around. He's shown to give Snape leeway in a lot of things - there's no reason to suspect that Voldemort wouldn't accept Snape's proposal of no unforgivables on students.

  it's much better than detention with the Carrows. Of course, he'd have to make it seem like a real punishment to any Voldemort sympathizers,
#+end_quote

Neville and Ginny are part of the crowd that cheer. They clearly don't see it the same way.

Besides, between one case of a more lenient punishment vs dozens of students hiding away from the rest of the school out of fear of torture...it's pretty clear what kind of punishments happened.

Also, on the premise of "keeping appearances", Snape too would have had to cast the Cruciatus himself on students. Torture in a public setting to enforce discipline isn't unheard of in prisons that violate HR.

#+begin_quote
  You're ignoring the fact that Snape blowing his cover reduces the chance of Voldemort being killed
#+end_quote

You mean the portrait of Dumbledore can't get the info to any of the other teachers in the Order inside the school? He's a portrait, he can move between frames inside the castle...he can tell McGonagall, he can tell Flitwick, he can tell anyone.

The only reason this doesn't happen is because plot.

Snape passing on the info is one of the most contrived, coincidental pieces of the story as it is. If Voldemort decided to give Snape a quicker death, it would end then and there. If Harry decides to trash the memories, it would end then and there. If Harry is anywhere else at the time, it ends there.

#+begin_quote
  And Voldemort's leeway for Snape can only go so far.
#+end_quote

It goes very far. Voldemort holds Snape in higher regard than even Bellatrix by the beginning of Book 7.

  it seems like you are choosing a more negative interpretation of Snape

True. Making excuses for Snape isn't something I'm interested in.
