So I'm pretty sure I'm not crazy and I've read a fic like this sometime ago. I don't remember much but I'll list what I can: - Harry Potter gets sent back to a time before the civilization of humanity has started and grows up with a group of early homo sapiens. He doesn't fit in with them and becomes an outcast of sorts until he grows up. He realizes he doesn't age and leaves the group and starts traveling around.( By this point I think he's started to use magic) He becomes uber-powerful over the ages passing his teachings to others around the world and becoming a wandering mage of sorts. - At some point I think he raises a true apprentice but leaves them behind and the apprentice lives just as long as him and they become enemies? I don't know. That's where it becomes foggy for me.

I'd really appreciate some help with this because I'm like 90% sure I'm not making this up!


** Well there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2651376/1/Voldemort-s-Last-Spell][Voldemort's Last Spell]], but I'm not sure it fits the part about the apprentice.

  Voldemort intended to kill the whole Potter family, but something unexpected happened. Now, the Dark Lord must face the result of a severely twisted Prophecy as well as a very old... thing. What history can Harry have after this? What history can he make?

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

** I'm pretty sure that this is the one where Death or something accepts Lily's sacrifice, or answers her call, sending Harry back in time. And then it ends up with a little bit of an X-Men crossover and then he becomes a professor at Hogwarts. I think it's something like that. I'll try finding it for you, but I may have gotten the details wrong, and I'm quite sure that I didn't bookmark it, because I didn't particularly enjoy it. But if it helps, you can probably find it off of Reddit, since I choose most of my stories from here or Author's favorites.

Edit: Does it involve him being the first Wizard, mating with people until his offspring (which I think all have green eyes) are magical, and become elves (not house elves)? And that all modern wizards and witches are his descendants.

*** To the edit: Yes! The green eyes thing definitely was in it, but I'm not to sure of the elves thing.. not saying it's not, but I don't recall.

**** What I was referring to does seem to be Voldemort's Last Spell. In the story, he is sent back in time as a baby, and wanders Earth, teaching tribes and eventually he becomes Merlin, loses his memories, then later the X-Men part of the story happens.

** I've read The Wizard From Earth, and while it is a good fic, it's not the one I was looking for. As far as A Long Journey Home, the Harry in the fic I'm looking for is definitely male.
