It serves no purpose, other than to pigeonhole eleven-year-olds into certain personality archetypes. Too many like-minded kids are hanging out with each other; why? This serves to only foster negative/detrimental viewpoints and attitudes, e.g. blood purism.

Instead, maybe mix-and-match the kids, so that they can learn from each other as they grow up. What do you think?


** Lets put all the ambitious, cunning kids together

that will not turn them into little assholes

the house system was formed a thousand years ago, I imagine the houses where just a way for the founders to know which students they personally mentored

but the founders died and the system stayed the same

for a thousand years

the voldemort corrupted slytherin and was stuck that way for generations

*** I won't whitewash Slytherin but how many Slytherins do we actually see though. Also I've always been a fan of the stories that take into account the idea of who are you going to side with, the people that hate you because of your house/family or the people who you have to deal with constantly not to mention the fear of what might happen to your family if you go against them. Money is power and Voldemort had a lot of money and power. Lucious had a lot of power and influence and I'd bet he's not the only one. I do agree with the idea that the house system was a good way to tell which kids were mentored by and therefore whose charge they primarily were.

** Kids shouldn't go to Hogwarts where they are supervised by an understaffed, underqualified faculty, which includes a ghost, a half-giant who never got his OWLs, the yearly DADA teacher, a former terrorist, an alcoholic charlatan fortune teller, and a centaur who came out of the forest last week. They should all go to a mixed Muggle comprehensive day school under modern teaching standards, where they can learn about modern technology, study STEM subjects, OSHA, and go to sensitivity training.

...

The truth is that trying to make Hogwarts and the wizarding world fit modern standards of life ruins all the magic. The appeal of Hogwarts is that it's fantastical, and /not/ realistic.

*** Have you read The Well-Groomed Mind? It's pretty much, well, a less extreme example of what you described. Hogwarts is an awful school, and someone finally steps up to help Harry be a genuinely good student. I appreciate that it didn't just go "oh, Muggle subjects are superior, the magical world is in the dark ages and needs to be forcefully modernized" but melds them together fairly well, and immerses Harry more thoroughly in magic and the casual use of magic on a daily basis. It's an interesting read, even if it started out more as a takedown of plotholes. Sadly, the author updates very infrequently due to health issues.

The consequences are what separate The Magicians or A Song of Ice and Fire series from children's fantasy like Magic Treehouse or Artemis Fowl, where they have /time travel/ but everything turns out okay in the end, and the kids learn a cool life lesson.

** I think you're overstating the extent to which the sorting actually divides kids up by personality. This is mostly a fanon thing. In canon, Slytherin is not a hotbed of scheming political masterminds. Ravenclaw is not full of geniuses. And so on.

The variety of personalities within any given house is already as varied as the variety of personalities across the school. If the hat started sorting kids randomly, I don't think anyone would even notice the difference.

According to [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/596635888446218240?lang=en][this JK Rowling tweet]], Slytherin is a hotbed of racial supremacists.

**** I didn't really have these feelings in the books (character like Zacharias Smith looked like really proud of their blood), but even if it was the case I think it's because the Hat can follow a child wish.

Slytherin was the founder who didn't trust Muggleborn (though I'm surprised he was the only one considering their time) so his house had a reputation of blood purist from the start. Add at that Lord Voldemort who advertised his link to Slytherin, and you have all the blood purist who teach their children that Slytherin is the best house.\\
When you see people like Crabbe and Goyle going into Slytherin, you know it's because they asked to and not because they were cunning.

***** In canon, it was Ernie McMillan who was proud of his pure blood during the Chamber of Secrets petrifications

#+begin_quote
  "It was a very near miss," said Ernie. "And in case you're getting ideas,' he added hastily, ‘I might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood's as pure as anyone's..."
#+end_quote

This is an example of a Hufflepuff with blood supremacy leanings.

The issue with Rowling's tweets and commentary is that it directly contradicts what she wrote in the books. That's why the fandom hates them so much, and the reason why you thought it was weird -- you're 100% correct in saying that it doesn't fit the canon material, because it doesn't.

Just take this from GoF:

#+begin_quote
  "Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities which distinguish Hufflepuff house," Dumbledore continued. "He was a good and loyal friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play.... Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right, and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory."
#+end_quote

And this is what happened to Cedric in Cursed Child, with JKR's full approval and support:

....

*ACT III, SCENE V*

#+begin_quote
  *SCORPIUS:* He wasn't supposed to do it alone. Cedric was supposed to win it with him. But we humiliated him out of the tournament. And as a result of that humiliation he became a Death Eater. I can't work out what he did in the Battle of Hogwarts --- whether he killed someone or --- but he did something and it changed everything.

  *SNAPE:* Cedric Diggory killed only one wizard and not a significant one --- Neville Longbottom.

  *SCORPIUS:* Humiliating Cedric turned him into a very angry young man, and then he became a Death Eater and --- and --- it all went wrong. Really wrong.

Kids apparently go into Hogwarts knowing Slytherin is for evil people, and only Death Eaters go there. Expect no one is the same at 17 as 11, unless it's beaten into their heads that they HAVE TO BE, unless they want to risk literally everyone else in their house turning on them.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

** I think the personalities are different. I don't remember how the hate is said to sort but I don't think it's what you are but what you value most. The house system lets you have the competition which is for bragging rights as a way to help police the school and giving each student a primary person in charge of them. It's who is selected as heads that's the problem I think. Personally I think the heads shouldn't be core subject teachers considering they teach the most classes and not be ones like snape who is majorly biased and bought and paid for by the blood purists on dumbledores orders, mcgonagal who dosent seem to listen or help her house, dumbledore for his hands off second chances leadership.

TLDR the houses aren't really the problem, it's the people in charge.

** i've read a few stories where they somewhat addressed this by changing the head of house position to one held by a non-teacher. along with one that basically stated that the only competent head of house was Sprout (who's barely mentioned in cannon). for example, Flitwick did nothing to stop bullying (Luna, for instance), Snape just being his usual asshole self, favoring slytherins and bullying the other students, or McGonagall, who did absolutely nothing to actually help the gryffindors.

​

iirc, in the story, the board/government (particulars are rather fuzzy, at this point), gave her the choice of staying on as the transfiguration professor or leaving the school altogether, since she clearly wasn't qualified to be deputy headmistress or head of house.
