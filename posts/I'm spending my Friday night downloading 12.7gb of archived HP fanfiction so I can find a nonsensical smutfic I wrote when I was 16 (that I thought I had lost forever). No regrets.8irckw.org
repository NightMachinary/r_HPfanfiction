Just found out about a redditor who saved literally every ff.net story from about a 2 year period 2013-15 and has uploaded the file. Awesome (if a little problematic re: the author's 'right to be forgotten').

I've also been retracing my emails from ff bot to laugh at just what a clusterfuck I was at releasing chapters for a later fic I still have.

***** If you're looking for anything in particular I can search the index I downloaded, it'll save you downloading it (800mb) and trying to find a program that can handle opening a text file that size (I found one called glogg or something like that).

Edit: The archive I'm using is in this post:

******** Oh, cool, I only did a perfunctory Google and went onto the first result to find the 2013 archive, but I think I wrote most of the fic I'm trying to find in the latter half of 2012. If it's not complete in this one I'm downloading I'll try that one, thanks

********** They've not saved the state of ff.net from 2016 though, they talk about having had a script running for eighteen months prior to that. In my tired and limited understanding, anyway. The inventory does list a couple of fics from 2014 that might be what I'm looking for anyway, yippee. They may be the whole story, they may not.

I don't know when I deleted tbh, my emails don't go back that far. Prior to today the only evidence I had for this story was an automated Ficforums RSS post.

** I recently found my old story that I wrote to troll a livejournal community that sporked Mary Sues back in 2006... it was two chapters of a girl with jewel-colored hair rescuing a baby unicorn from an acromantula. I hope you find yours, it's hilarious seeing your oldest stuff sometimes.

** Interesting, I wonder if there are any archives that saved everything from like 2009-2010 onward?

Some dude hacked my email and ended up deleting every single story I had on ff.net off of my account(literally just to be a dick I guess...), some of which were unrecoverable. They were probably garbage since I was like 14, but it would be cool to have a way to get them back.

*** If you still want a laugh, here's a bit of chapter 2 of a 2013 release (I essentially finished what had become a long, rambling story full of OCs and DRAMA, thought /even by my standards this is really embarrassingly shit/ and deleted everything except a few edited porn chapters).

Come for the OOC nicknames never used in the real series, stay for the Wave Metaphors For Female Orgasms!

** I have kept every single page of my early work, which started when I was about 14-15. Sometimes I go back to them (they're not HP) because the premise was good, but the writing - especially smut - makes me want to tear my eyeballs out. And still, I cannot bring myself to delete them.

*** The writing's actually surprisingly tight in the version of my story I found! The concept and the sex is awful, obviously, but the rhythm of the writing is quite dialled-in. Mind you, the big asterisk is that the version I've got atm (while the rest of the archive is still extracting) is a release from 2 years after I originally wrote it, so it's been edited to within an inch of its life by 18 y.o. me.

What I'm really waiting to cringe over when I find it is the stuff 16 y.o. me was churning out. I did that horrible thing where you just ... keep ... the smut ... going ... until it becomes a /super-serious/ drama that's really important and meaningful, guys. OCs, alternate viewpoints to the year of DH, chapters jumping further and further desperately forward because I really just wanted to get it finished...

**** Ohhhh yeah, I never went back and edited mine. I used to publish first drafts. 1,000-word chapters, one chapter in a night. The smut makes you cringe and the rest of the writing is overly dramatic. Some of the later ones are better, but they still suck. These days, I have an editor and we edit over and over until it's perfect, then we spelling/grammar/punctuation check and off it goes.

** I wish I knew someone that had an archive of my old fic. It was posted on one of those random pairing archives which has since been stricken from the internet. I can't find it anywhere and I'm so sad.
