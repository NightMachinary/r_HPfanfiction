*** 50% the designer who conceptualized that wig, 50% Jason Isaacs for his Lucius is a Proud Peacock interpretation of the character.

** Once he realised Draco was going to be an inevitable disappointment, he set about maintaining a perfectly coiffed, slick mane such as befitting a pureblood of his stature and standing. All so he could sincerely look his dear 'Cissy in the eye, and tell her how much he loved their hair. Let her misinterpret him if she so desired.

*** I understand that he also kept all the hair that was cut off when he went for a trim. If the unthinkable happened, he had enough to craft a very lifelike wig. Oh, yes, he paid very close attention to his father's teachings. His first duty to his family was to procure the hair and a spare.

*** What most don't know is that he has a secret, dark job, even shadier than being a DE, where his codename is Luscious and he does testing for Loreal Paris.

Its actually where the "Malfoy Fortune" comes from.

** I think from his physical appearance in the movies mixed with extrapolation from personal experience.

As someone with long, high maintenance hair... you /really/ have to like your hair in order to keep it that length. Even with magic it would be a hassle. I debate shaving my head bald most mornings and I genuinely adore my hair.

I am suddenly struck by how precious and domestic it would be to see a Death Eater with their hair wrapped up in a protective scarf before bed so it doesn't snag or tangle while he sleeps ‚ù§ His enemies absolutely wouldn't be able to take him seriously

** I'd imagine from COS movie onwards.

Iirc JK didn't initially envisage Lucius with /long/ blonde hair, it was a decision of the actor. Then naturally if you're an author, your character with waist length hair that no-one else in the universe has, must have that hair for a reason and that reason is likely to be a personal preference.

Altho now I want to read an AU where Lucius has long hair for some other legal or magical reason and it isn't a personal choice at all. Draco turns 17 and is magically bound to keep growing his hair out and enlists Hermione to find a way to break the magical contract bc he just doesn't think it goes with his image :')
