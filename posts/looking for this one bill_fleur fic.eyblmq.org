:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
i read this one fic about bill/fleur 4 years ago but can't seem to find it now. the only thing i remember is that fleur's house burned down at one point, and she and her sister go to bill's place as a result. fleur has a breakdown in the bathroom, and bill comforts her. if anyone knows of it/can help a fellow hp fan out, that'd be really appreciated! :")
