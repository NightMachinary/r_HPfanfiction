:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can remember a fic where in the first task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament Harry (fem!Harry?) transfigures the dragon into a kitten to get past it. For the life of me I can't remember what the fic was, anyone know the fic?

*** I'll never understand making Harry female and just... not changing the name. Why go through all that trouble and not change that last detail, too?
