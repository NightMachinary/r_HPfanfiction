just what it says on the tin. Fics where Harry gets tired of the being snide about Fleur behind her back


** I know it's a request but I think Bill should be the one calling out his family. Harry's the one who should call out Hermione, /after Ron calls her out but she ignores him/.

** It's not a major part but in linkffn(the best man's job by Scott the Wanderer) its mentioned that Harry read molly the riot act about it. Sadly an incomplete tale but it's fun a couple skippable smut scenes but no one underaged.

** What about Hermione? She's just as mean to Fleur as the other two women, if more so behind her back:

  “It's her,” said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harry's bed. “She's driving me mad.”

  “What's she done now?” asked Hermione sympathetically.

  “It's the way she talks to me --- you'd think I was about three!”

  “I know,” said Hermione, dropping her voice. “She's so full of herself.”

  “Don't you get used to her if she's staying in the same house?” Harry asked.

  “Well, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then . . .”

  “It's pathetic,” said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall.

If you guys want to shit on Molly and Ginny for being mean to Fleur, please include Hermione too. This fandom is suffering from enough double standards.

In defense of all three women, and Harry, they *didn't know Fleur's true character* at this point! Unlike us readers, they couldn't possibly know what transpired after the Battle of Astronomy Tower. Fleur, on the other hand, behaved like an arrogant dizzy airhead until then, who put down Hogwarts to the others's chagrins, who treated Ginny and Hermione like little children, and who kept calling Harry "Leetle Boy" or "Silly Boy". Harry himself was fuming about being called that way and took great satisfaction seeing Ginny mocking her.

Why should only Molly and Ginny be called out at all?

**** Unfortunately, I haven't found such fics.

Besides, Fleur's behavior up to that point deserved animosity from all three women and Harry. Teenagers hate being called "leetle boy" and "silly boy", they hate being treated like little children

***** I feel like part of the issue between Fleur and Ginny is that Fleur's only experience with a younger sibling is one who is still very much a child as opposed to Ginny, who is 15 and obviously doesn't want to be treated like she's 9. Fleur is trying to treat Ginny like she would treat her younger sister, not realizing that that won't work. I do wonder how Ginny and Fleur's initial relationship would be if Gabrielle was closer to Ginny's age.

*** Totally. Hermione was the first to criticise Fleur too, practically the moment she arrived at Hogwarts in GOF
