Make Barney a Muggleborn (His Magic is way too good for him to be a regular Muggle) and have him raise Harry, train him in the ways of the Bro and Awesome, and have Harry sleep with every hot female at Hogwarts. Barney would use the "I defeated Voldemort" fame to get laid, so he'll teach Harry how to do exactly that.

Bonus points if Harry wears a Suit under his Robes, or finds a glamour that makes the Teachers see robes, but he's actually wearing a Suit. Suits are cool.

**** I was actually thinking that wizards/witches get their letter and start school at 11. Sure, He might get some super fangirls naked with the I Killed Lord Voldermort thing when he's older. But i doubt anyone over the age of 14 would seriously find that attractive in a boy of similar age.

That is my take on it anyway, Kinda suggest that if harry is going to sleep with every "Hot" female at hogwarts, Only young and stupid people would sleep with them for that kind of reason.

*** Barney advocated a child losing their virginity at 13, not 11. 13 year olds quite often do that. You don't even need to actively show the lemon, just the after effects of Harry waking up in the Hufflepuff Dorm with Susan and Hannah naked in his bed, and the next day, him wearing the Championship belt.

**** This could be also done by making the age of admission 12 and spending the first two years establishing his 'bro' image with stuff like the Weasley twins being impressed and taking him under their wing, maybe even with a have you met Fred moment and other plays from the playbook establishes his suave image and that time being used to change the Canon characters to something resembling the cast of himym

Fred's the wrong personality for that. I'd say use Theodore Nott, who has the correct name, but that's also a bit awkward unless you want Slytherin Harry.

****** More along a mutual exchange, Harry teaching the bro code and them renewing the marauder legacy, bonus a scene where it is revealed that Harry is prongs jr and the Weasley twins go crazy over it, I imagine the Harry barney relationship to be similar to the Harry Sirius one in the classic linkffn(a black comedy by nonjon) but with the barney touch
