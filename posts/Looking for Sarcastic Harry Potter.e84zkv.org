I really love Harry's sarcastic remarks, rather they're towards his family, Umbridge, Malfoy or Snape, they're such fun to read, but yet it feels like fanfiction seems to forget that he was rather sarcastic, or under plays it.

What are some of your favorite sarcastic Harry type of fanfiction out there? Can be as canon as possible or as AU as possible.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather not have too many last names/vaults, et cetra.

Would rather not have Harem Harry stories.

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

Edit: Heck Snape, and Hermione, Ron, and the Weasley twins were also rather sarcastic too, so bonus points if they have sarcastic remarks as well.

Doesn't have to be the main part, but more sarcastic then he tends to be in fanfiction would be great.

Edit Not wanting Harry and the Methods of Rationality.

*** Yeah, I'd say there is a pretty big difference between witty/ sarcastic and being an annoying little shit. And Harry falls hard in the second category- he's read a few science books so he just goes and lectures everybody about everything always thinking he is right and adults with decades more experience are wrong.

*** I do like MoR for a variety of reasons, including the humor, but that doesn't usually come from what Harry says; it's more from the narrative. So I wouldn't recommend it in this thread.

  My take on Harry's first year starting with him getting his letters. Add a lot of sarcasm, stir, and serve cold.
