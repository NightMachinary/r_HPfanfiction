I've always been interested in fics that explore more into the lore of the HP universe. Especially if the world is larger, magic is more potent. Or there are larger and grander lands where magic is supreme that may be hidden from even wizards.

A couple of examples that I've read that have done this (though most of them are on hiatus)

Partially Kissed Hero - Perfect Lionheart [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771/1/Partially-Kissed-Hero]]

This does a LOT of exposition about lore and history about the magical world. Though it is largely a crack fic. Personally I like it but I know it's a bit disjointed for many people.

Breath of the Inferno - Primordial Vortex [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11502532/1/Breath-of-the-Inferno]]

This story is short and sadly abandoned by the author after getting through the first year. However, in this story, many wizards, particularly those from wizarding families have 'Family Magic' that is incredibly potent. Magic is grand and potent. Harry himself is basically Smaug from LotR and even then he isn't all powerful.


** Accidental animagus linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus]]). It's sequel is ongoing. It is the only time I have seen some of Dumbledore's inaction due to being legitimately busy with ICW work. Also, while Dumbledore and Voldemort at a weight class of their own in the UK, they have peers internationally who join both sides.

If you are looking for a 'family magic' story try linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]]).
