I started reading fan fics back around GoF and OoTP and I'm feeling nostalgic so I'm looking for something where HBP and DH are completely thrown out the window. Bonus points if there are no horcruxes. I'm open to any ship, prefer Harry centric and no slash. Completed fics are preferred. Thanks!

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter inspired by "Spyboy".

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this..

***** I don't think so, the name doesn't ring any bells. Is their stuff still around? I took a really long break around the time HBP came out and didn't really start back until last year. A lot of what I read back in the day(that I can remember) was from authors on [[https://www.fanficauthors.net/]] along with some of the big names on ff.net like nonjon, Ruskbyte and Rorschach's Blot. Jeconais is probably my favorite author to this day and I really wish he was still writing.
