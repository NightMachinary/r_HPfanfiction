Travelling back to the Marauders era is common. What time era would you like to see? What situations? What characters would you like to see Harry interact with?


** Short term Peggy Sue. We've all read the fics where Harry goes back a decade or more into his younger body and has a massive advantage with his retained knowledge. I want to see a fic where the time travel is measured in months not years.

The one I particularly like is GoF, post-Graveyard, just as Harry is taking the Portkey back to Hogwarts. A spell hits him and combines with the Portkey in an unpredictable way, throwing him back into his younger self just after he's been picked for the Triwizard (vague rationale: that's when the Portkey in question was created).

Harry knows enough information to be wary - he knows that Voldemort is going to try to resurrect by kidnapping him - but he doesn't know everything. Crucially, both he and Dumbledore still trust the fake Mad-Eye Moody, meaning that whatever changes they make, Voldemort will know about and be able to (attempt to) counter.

Makes for a relatively contained, tightly plotted action adventure fic.

Another important aspect is that Harry also knows enough information, both in terms of what the tasks are, and in terms of the relatively significant magical growth he has experienced over the year, that you can still have the fun, wish-fulfillment part of the time travel experience, without making him too much of a Gary Stu or removing conflict. The Mad-Eye aspect is vital here, in that it is the mechanism by which conflict is maintained.

** I'd like to see time travel to Voldemorts first rise to power that isn't about Hogwarts or the young James/Lily/Sirius and such.

Harry(or whomever) doesn't know where the Horcruxes are at this time so there is actual work to be done. The ministry is stronger, Dumbledore is younger, Voldemort is a name people haven't heard yet. The protagonist isn't a child, we see highly skilled magics, politics of the time, the formation of the Order of the Phoenix.

** I want to see a time travel fic where the time traveller is like... some third party? Not anyone's kid or anything, not even a "fan" from the future/present. Just /someone/ whose understanding of the events of the books is second or third hand, thrust into the craziest parts and trying to survive while not being seen and/or altering as little as possible.

Imagine: random person from 2020 finds themselves in the 90s when all this shit happened, and paid zero attention in wizard history.

"I mean, this guy was famous for /something/..."

"Why should I know who the PMoM was then? That was like thirty years ago."

"Wait, wasn't he a spy or something?"

It would be a great way to explore the Skeeter-style second and third hand understandings of society. What does she get wrong? What does she get right?

  Hermione's tone was laced with a kind of reluctant disbelief, as though she knew she should know better than to not believe that Harry was capable of doing something like this.

  Harry attempted to smile sheepishly, but instead his lips curled up in some sort of resigned grimace.

** I would love a time travel fic that has Harry being thrown from time period to time period without him being in control. He's only a student when it starts so he doesn't know how to fix it and he is just trying to survive. As he gets older and learns more (teachers, books, mentors, etc) he finally finds the cure/solution for the involuntary time travel and returns to his time to resume the fight with Voldemort. But during all of that he's being drafted in wars, struggling to survive natural disasters, witnessing important events in history, and trying to hide from muggles and wizards alike that he is from the future.

I think it would be really fun.

** The one thing that turns me off most time travel stories is the often immediate dip into angst, and while it would be a traumatic experience possibly not seeing anyone you love ever again, I really would love the protagonist to just to roll with it, and enjoy the perks of whatever time period they are in. Even if it is just to the beginning of their time in school, rigidly conforming to the same canon plot over and over again is just tedious and overdone at the best of times. One of my favourites is linkffn(The Second Time Around by ZilchNil), no explanation as to how Harry got there or how old he was or what had happened to him, just dump him back in time and see what he does with a ton of experience and little respect for authority.

** I actually have a challenge for this!

/Nymphadora Tonks and the Dark Lord's Soul/

Basically Future!Harry goes back in time to the moment before his Sorting, resulting in a magical shockwave activating or displacing the Horcruxes amongst other things. The Sorting Hat is kind of tired of Dumbledore ignoring him for the rest of the year or something (not evil!Dumbledore) and gets its revenge by Sorting Harry into the position of Headmaster. Harry is mildly amused and rolls with it, almost out-Dumbledore-ing Dumbledore himself. Harry teams up with a promising young student (cue Tonks) and they basically go after the Horcruxes while claiming 'extracurriculars are important' and 'its /technically/ a research project'.

- Quirrelmort is now Turbanmort. Voldemort literally is the turban.
- Harry's Scar exploded or something. Its no longer an issue.
- The Ring is basically a massive ghost hivemind
- The Diadem becomes a massive golem made of things that would give Filch an aneurism.
- The Cup infiltrates the wizarding economic system.
- The Locket turns Grimmauld Place into Monster House.
- Diary becomes Paper Mache Voldemort. This one is the 'final boss voldemort', having been ressurected out of tomes of dark magic in the Malfoy's library.

Oh, and Harry also has to deal with the Board of Governors trying to sack him, /and/ finding new DADA professors. Ever since he showed up, they've been going through them monthly instead of yearly. This is why he breaks Sirius out of Azkaban.

** A big no-no for me is following canon completely as if they don't want to write an original plot or story. No matter what situation or era, I don't want to see Harry or anybody else try to 'keep things the same so they know what's going to happen'. I mean the idea is logical but in my opinion, it's quite boring to read.

Also be careful about too much wish fulfillment. Sure I believe it makes sense for him to be able to do lots of good with the future knowledge, but when the bad guys are completely destroyed with minimum effort, it makes the story seem dull.

Finally, I have confidence that with what fanfiction you've written so far you won't do this, but please don't use time travel to bash characters. I've counted three fics where Harry finds out about Dumbledore's 'manipulations' and Ron's 'betrayal' and then travel back in time to hate him.

Now for the actual question of what I do like. Well, I'd be interested in time travel of a somewhat minor character. It would be nice to see something different after all the Harry time travel I've seen. Imagine you're somebody of no importance like Lily Moon who just wants to keep her head down. However you've got invaluable information about the future which you want to use to help Harry, and you have to deal with being in severe danger and being one of the main opposers to Voldemort.

Time travel can be about traveling to the future as well. I'm quite intrigued by the possibility of a character in the past going into the future and then finding out what's happened. By going to the future, I don't like to see the post-war ones because they always seem to be some sort of Hurt/Comfort which I don't really enjoy reading. However I would love to see a badass witch like Lily secretly helping out the war effort in the second Wizarding World while shocking everyone who sees her.

Ex: ancient Egypt, Medieval England, ancient America, the Renaissance etc. Done right those fics are so, so good! I'd love to read more of them. But alas I can't find that many.

I don't really have a preference with who he interacts with. Most do-over/time travel fic i read mostly deals with getting another chance(which i'm sick of), or rescuing people, defying family, or falling in luv with Voldiepants. I've read so much of it i've had to move on for a change of pace so i don't get burnt out on fic.
