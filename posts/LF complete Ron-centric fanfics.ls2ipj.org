Anyone know any decent length fics with Ron as either the protagonist or at least a very important character? He's my favorite of the Golden Trio so anything with Ron-bashing is an automatic no for me (showcasing his canon flaws is fine, I'm just so sick of the Asshole! Ron trope)


** I don't have many where Ron is the main character, but I have plenty where he's able to show why he's the best:

- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5421695][Actions Speak Louder Than Words]] by SSAerial) a short comedy fic where Ron gets sorted into Slytherin along with Harry. Hijinks ensue.\\
  Personal Score: 5/10
- linkffn([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/][Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay]] by Saphroneth) gives Ron and pretty much every character their time to shine. In the most recent update on SpaceBattles; Ron just came back from being the first wizard to step on the moon. And is now likely going to be more famous than Harry.\\
  Personal Score: 8/10
- [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]] by Viridian is a classic. Nothing specific, Ron is just great in general. There is a moment at the end of third year which is really cool, that I don't want to spoil.\\
  Personal Score: 7/10
- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24597805][Kaleidoscopic Grangers]] by AdmiralPegasus) is a TransFem!Harry/Ariadne story where Ron is a great ally and friend. There's also something that the tags spoil where Ron becomes a werewolf which he takes pretty well all things considered, and while it affects a few things about his character, it makes an already great character better.\\
  Personal Score: 8/10
- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/Like-a-Red-Headed-Stepchild][Like A Red Headed Stepchild]] by mugglesftw) is more about the Weasley family than just Ron himself, but it's a fun romp all the same.\\
  Personal Score: 6/10
- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298][Magical Metamorphosis]] by Eon_The_Dragon_Mage) was what inspired Kaleidoscopic Grangers. It's another TransFem!Harry/Holly story, with Ron being a great ally and friend.\\
  Personal Score: 7/10
- [[https://www.siye.co.uk/viewuser.php?uid=214553][Path Diverged]] by hp_fangal has more Ron being a great friend to an especially PTSD afflicted Harry.\\
  Personal Score: 8/10
- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18710152][Relentless, We Survive]] by Araceil) is an Assassin's Creed crossover, where they discover Pensieve memories of all the past assassins in the Room of Requirement. You don't need to know much about AC to enjoy it. A Harry/Ron/Hermione poly fic. It's less about Ron or any other character, but more about the three of them as a team.\\
  Personal Score: 6/10
- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/270848][Session Transcripts]] by lastcrazyhorn) has another great friend and ally in Ron, only to a TransMasc!Hermione/Hermes and an Autistic!Harry. The structure of this particular fic means you don't get to see much of it, but you do get to see him stand up for them.\\
  Personal Score: 7/10
- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/519887][Strange Visitors From Another Century]] by Izzyaro) has the trio sent to the Founder's era. All three get the time to shine and Ron has some great development.\\
  Personal Score: 8/10
- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23364187][The Foundations of Family]] by waitingondaisies), in where Harry gets de-aged and loses his memories up to during the Horcrux Hunt. He's being taken care of by an older Ron and Hermione. Domestic trio fluff at its best. Ron being a not quite dad is also great.\\
  Personal Score: 6/10
- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8326928/1/Three-s-The-Charm][Three's The Charm]] by MissCHSparkles) is a trio Peggy Sue where there's some great Ron/Hermione, along with Ron making promises to be better than he was during the Horcrux Hunt. It's really sweet.\\
  Personal Score: 7/10
- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/241642][Weasley Girl]] by Hyaroo) in which Ron was born a girl, Veronica "Ron" Weasley. This one change leads to a bunch more changes and has the amount of Ron focus you're looking for.\\
  Personal Score: 6/10

Aside from those I also have a couple of fics that /have/ Ron as the main character, but I haven't read them yet:

- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24897403][Ron Weasley and the Philosopher's Stone]] by JonRiptide)
- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10842981][Sense of the Soul]] by totalnovaktrash, UmbraeCalamitas)

  If blindness wasn't enough for Ariadne Granger to deal with upon attending Hogwarts, being the transgender Girl Who Lived didn't help matters.Blind trans girl Harry Potter fic to spite JK Rowling's TERF ass. Starts before Ariadne has even figured out she's a girl and before she is rescued from the Dursleys.Since this fic is gonna be quite long, I'm adding a key here. Note, some things might lack context if you skip.Chapters 1-6: Pre-Philosopher's Stone.Chapters 7-33: Philosopher's Stone. Minimal plot divergence.Chapters 34-75: Chamber of Secrets. Moderate plot divergence.Chapters 76-109: Prisoner of Azkaban. Major plot divergence.Chapters 110-148: Goblet of Fire. Major plot divergence.Chapters 149-Current: Order of the Phoenix.

  We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. A place to practice... somewhere they can't find us... “...A place to fight the Ministry...” Hermione's voice whispered. A place to learn how to protect people... Ron's lips mouthed. A heavy wooden door appeared, the ageing wood so ancient it appeared almost black -- if not for the single bright unaged golden design embossed upon its surface. A strangely stylised A without the middle bar, the base of the letter spiking out in only to curl in again like a pair of tongs, beneath it an almost bow shaped underline with three notches spiking out along its length, all contained within a circle. Three different desires blended into one open a different door to a new future, new possibilities, a new war, and the revival of a forgotten Chapter of the Brotherhood. It's about time the Wizarding World got a little freedom forced into it.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild.
