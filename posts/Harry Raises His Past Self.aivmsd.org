I'm looking for a rather old harry potter goes back in time to raise himself. He gets into a relationship with Severus Snape. he has a limp and uses a cane because a snake basically destroyed his leg. In Harry's 5th year he goes to the Ministry to save Harry but he gets hit by the killing curse. I can't remember if i read further than that. Could someone please find that fanfiction? And if not that one a similar one with the same concept to the title?


** Not the specific one you are looking for at all, but I'm about 85% sure that not yet revealed Potter Regency Council in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12979337/1/Harry-Potter-et-al-and-the-Keystone-Council][Harry-Potter-et-al-and-the-Keystone-Council]] is essentially this. In this fic there are five AU versions of Harry that can communicate telepathically with each other across dimensions. There's also a mysterious Regency Council that is doing stuff behind the scenes, and I'm pretty sure it is made up of yet more AU Harrys, but older ones whose timestreams are not synced with the five main characters of the fic, who have already defeated their Voldemort. I could be wrong, but there are hints indicating this imo. So not really raising Harry, but they are effecting the lives of the various Harrys, at least a little.
