This is something I've always wondered about, is non-consenual human transfiguration assault?

If you turn someones head into a fish and then they die from not being able to breathe, that I would think is murder, but what if you turn someones head into a dog's head against their consent and then after a while change it back?


** Wizards in general seem to not take non-permanent physical violence very seriously at all. I mean, their most popular sport, which they comfortable allow children to play, involves two half-foot diameter balls of iron flying around slamming into the players.

*** That doesn't mean it's perfectly legal for someone to walk up to a stranger and smack a bludger into their face.

Just like it's not legal to randomly tackle someone in real life.

**** Sure, but the legal consequences would be significantly less than the equivalent in the muggle world.

** It happens in canon through trickery. Canary creams. No one gets put off by it.

*** Schoolyard stuff often gets a /lot/ of slack in real life.

Could easily be the same at Hogwarts if not more, considering how isolated it is from the the rest of society.

**** Yes.

I suppose it's also not intentionally humilating (canaries are nice birds), not targeted at a specific individual and reasonably harmless (although a minute isn't a trivial amount of time). It's not like they turned someone into a fish.

** I doubt turning someone's head into a fish would kill them. See for example the mice into snuffboxes transfiguration: the mice would spend a fair amount of time semi-transformed, with much of their bodies being snuffboxes and therefore missing a good number of their organs, but didn't die.

** From a muggle perspective, I imagine it would be treated roughly like battery. Possibly worse, given that it takes serious skills and fucking up could easily kill the person.

However, wizards seem to have a very "eh, fuck it" attitude towards danger sometimes. So long as nobody important was involved either as the caster or the victim, it didn't last way too long, and there was no permanent damage.. well. I doubt anything would come of it.

** I think, it depends on the relationship with the person that persons status in society and how long the head was a dog for

if you did it to dumbledore for five minutes, he might find it amusing and laugh it off

If you did it to Lucius malfoy for an hour, expect a trip to azakban then against you might get a knife in your gut first

** Gwenog Jones turns anybody who disagrees with her into a woodlouse

Sounds fun and whimsicail and /aren't wizards wacky/, But if it was anywhere close to reality she'd be an abusive psycho nightmare who others avoid as much as possible. And whose quidditch team would soon enter a death-spiral becaise who in their right mind would want to share a locker-room with her?
