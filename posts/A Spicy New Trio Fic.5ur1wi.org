Hey y'all!

I feel like romantic "Golden Trio" fics are a bit hard to come by, so I wanted to highlight one I found the other day. Fair warning, it's rated M for a reason.

** Romantic is quite possibly the last definition I would use.

As far as porn-without-plot goes I would give it a 6 or 7 out of 10. There are some punctuation and capitalization errors. Wandless magic of the caliber that Hermione uses is known to be outside of her skill in canon. There could be a bit more descriptiveness overall to improve the pace and immersion.

*** I completely agree. The fic just drops you right when things change for Ron when it could have taken the time to give at least some more background or exposition of their current relationship and activities. It's very evidently a PWP. I only skimmed it when I realized that (nothing against PWP, just not in the mood currently). So perhaps it's good if you're in the mood for a PWP featuring the trio, but it's definitely not the best.

*** Yeah, I was using romantic as distinguished from friendship. I'm aware that there isn't really much of a plot here. I think it's alright in terms of quality - loads better than what I normally find when looking around the site.

As far that being outside of Hermione's skill level in canon is concerned, well in canon Ruin would never be ok with this, so it doesn't bother me that much. Honestly, bumps in skill don't bother me much at all unless it's an unrealistic level.
