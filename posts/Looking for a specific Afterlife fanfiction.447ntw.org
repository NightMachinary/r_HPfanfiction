Hello, I've lost a fanfic, so to speak. It was written very recently after DH came out, because that's when I remember reading it. It was about every character's afterlife, set in King's Cross, the train to Hogwarts was 'the train to the afterlife' metaphorically, everybody was waiting for someone or meeting someone, and time had no more meaning... So for example, Snape turned 11 again, boarding the train to Hogwarts with Lily. Remus was young again too, boarding with James and Sirius. But Remus was also a wolf, and boarding with Tonks... Fred was waiting for George. It was well-written and quite moving.

Please help?


** Edit: 99.7% sure it's End Of the Line by shewhogaurds. I just reread it.
