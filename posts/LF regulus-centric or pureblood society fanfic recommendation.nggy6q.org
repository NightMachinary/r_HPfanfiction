i just read linkffn(Oblivion by nautical paramour) and i absolutely loved the high society aspect of it all. i'm okay with any pairing as long as the fanfc is good, to be honest. so, i'm looking for either regulus-centric fanfics with time travel, or just pureblood society fanfics.

  Kreacher sends Hermione back in time with the hopes that she will save Regulus an destroy the locket. Hermione figures she will have an ally to help her destroy the other horcruxes, too. But, Regulus Black doesn't turn out to be anything like she expected he would. Regulus x Hermione. Time Travel. COMPLETE!

Is my favourite and I'm rereading it right now. It's more Sirius focused but Regulus is the catalyst and Walburga and Orion feature a lot. It's not got the typical Harry Potter tropes of pureblood society and time travel, but to me it makes the story stronger.

*** i started and the writing is quite impressive, but the whole “trying to redeem sirius' parents” is terribly annoying to me. still, i might just finish because, despite that, it's a good one.

** /Renascentia/ series and /Neither lost nor found/ are the best I've read. There's also a bunch of one-shots within the universe too. Amazing world-building and characterisation.

In both stories, Regulus survives the cave. In Renascentia, he escaped to France and returns to England after GoF, and in Neither lost nor found, Regulus survives the cave and stays in England.

The stories are set in the same universe (/Neither lost nor found/ is basically AU of AU).

  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

  In the thick of the first war with Voldemort, Regulus steals the locket Horcrux; and pulled from the grip of its trials, he survives the cave. What follows is a tale of espionage, blood politics, and accidental vigilantism. Welcome to 1979.
