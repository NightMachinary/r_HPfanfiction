I just read [[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/230787/why-was-snape-so-concerned-with-exams-if-he-wanted-to-join-the-death-eaters][this HNQ]] about why Snape still study hard for exam even though he's essentially planning to join terrorist group, and one of the answer quoted this

  “The walls were completely covered in books, most of them bound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare sofa, an old armchair and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp hung from the ceiling.”

~ HBP, Chapter 2 (Spinner's End)

A house with minimal creature's comfort and he probably spend all his money on books. When I first read that paragraph I was jarred with the non-standard PoV, and upon re-reading, I was still so angry for the killing. Sure, his last words on DH touched me so deeply, but it framed him as an unrequited lover of Lily, not as a lover of knowledge. Even reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]], while bringing massive respect for his character, still failed to impart his bookworm trait in my mind.

Plenty of fics loves to emphasize the (canon) bookworm trait of Hermione, and it's clear Dumbledore is also one. But while it's easy to imagine Hermione's home filled to brim with books, and we're all aware of how the Headmaster's office looks, it's rare to see Snape's love of knowledge is emphasized. Maybe using his shared trait to open a connection with Hermione, or perhaps Dumbledore discussing a rare text that he expected Snape would've already read. Tom top-grades-in-every-examination-he-had-taken Riddle might even talk about books with Snape, as crazy and power-obsessed Riddle was, Snape is one of the few Death Eaters who are not a complete dunderhead.

Now I wonder how much of fic writers out there gain massive sympathy for Snape not from his "Always" moment, but from reading his house description then look at around their very own room, or at least imagining their dream room.


** I think he truly was a book worm, but I'm not sure that wanting to join a terrorist group means you can stop studying, regardless of what some idiot Slytherins say in the later books. Independent of what you want to be, there'll always be those who love studying, reading, knowledge, are duteous, or just like to be good at something (and Slytherins are ambitious). In every profession you'll have those who study a lot and those who get by on minimal effort. I also doubt that Voldemort paid his followers. For rich purebloods, yes, joining Voldemort might have been a full time job, but all others had to earn a living somehow. And if you want to join Voldemort and actually want to become one of his favorites, you have to have some value. You are either rich and support his endeavors, or you have to be in a useful position (as a spy or a ministry employee, etc) or you have to be powerful and good at magic. Snape wasn't going to stand out with his popularity/charisma/wealth/... He had little going for him but his intelligence. If he wanted to rise above his station, his mind was his only chance.

But I'm not even sure I'm entirely sold on his only desire being to join Voldemort at that point in time. He might have as well thought it a plan B. Something like “I'll marry Lily, but if that doesn't work out and she leaves me (low self esteem and all that) I am completely and utterly alone, then I'll join the Death Eaters.” He might have been playing it safe by keeping both Lily and his DE buddys happy, and when Lily truly did leave him (maybe even a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy), he had another option.

Ah, yes. Being dirt poor does force one to actually work for a living. It's a shame Slughorn didn't manage to find something better for Snape, or perhaps despite all his connection, Snape's social awkwardness and the social stigma means replacing Slughorn is the best he could achieve.

If I fell in love with a childhood friend who shares the thirst of knowledge, yet still lose her to a foreign jock who won't even know the first thing about my country, I too would be rocking greasy hair and brooding my entire life. Joining a terrorist group that specifically targets her race is a wee bit much tho.

I would consider the Death Eaters more like a cult, not just a political movement. Snape had shitty friends and it was one way for him to fit in with this crowd, whether it made sense intellectually or not.

Many intelligent people join cults and quite a few struggle with mental disconnect. Especially members of violent terrorist groups don't really allow themselves to think about what they are doing, bc if they did, they would realise that their choosen path is wrong. A good example of this mental disconnect are the testaments of some of the 9/11 terrorists who flew the airplanes into the World Trade Center.

** I just realized that while Snape would've never been a Gryffindor and Lily would've had a terrible time in Slytherin, both might have been able to convince the Hat to put them into Ravenclaw if they had coordinated it.

** His bookworm persona made him very relatable to me. In his memories in OotP you see him writing more than the others, which I automatically connected to Hermione who did the same. This might be the reason, why I enjoy FF that come up with a Hermione/Snape mentorship. While Canon Snape surely prefered to spend his time in solitude, I like the image of two likeminded people, striving for knowledge together. Prof. Snape was an amazing wizard, creating own spells, revising his textbook. Surely he did some "light" background reading in order to accomplish this. James or Sirius said, he knew more curses in first year than anybody in 7th year. Given the fact that he is halfblood and neglected by his parents, books would need to be the ones that taught him.

**** In "Camerado" by Millie Joan Hermione takes Occlumency lessons from Snape because she wants to try teach Harry. There's one in which he taught her critical thinking above all but I forgot the title. Then there's "Bound to Him" by georgesgurl117, which I would not recommend easily, as a crucial plot point is rape. But Snape teaches Hermione combative and defensive skills as they are bound to fight together. A very harmless but lovely one is "Pet Project" by Caeria, though the focus is not on Snape teaching Hermione, they end up developing an original solution in how to kill Voldemort. Most stories I recall containing mentoring start post-war but I personally prefer the ones that build up to save Snape. Camerado is extremely compatible with all the books and still manages to twist it, telling the story Harry just didn't witness.

Hermione finally produced a photograph. "I had a friend take this picture, of a spread in a book. I'm trying to find the original owner of the book."

"Er, this is from the N.E.W.T.-level Potions text. There are thousands of these around. But someone has written tips in it. That's a bit different. Huh, cat's claw oil, I knew that one!"

"Did Professor Snape teach it to you?"

Liz narrowed her eyes, but didn't take them off the photo.

"Is that his handwriting?"

Liz swallowed hard. The scrawl was a bit neater than what she was used to, but the sharp points of the S-curves and the sparse connectors in the script-type hybrid were unmistakable to her now. So, the answer was probably yes, but she said, "Maybe." Looking up, she added her own question, "Why do you need to know this?"

"If he wasn't such a total git to us Gryffindors, I'd be asking him for an apprenticeship toward Mastery."

This response was obviously rehearsed to death, but there wasn't much Liz could do if Hermione was determined to lie about it. It's not like she was being entirely truthful, herself. Lips quirking, she replied with a joking lilt, "A dunderhead notion if I ever heard one." She handed the photo back and put on a more serious tone. "Sorry, Hermione, but I've never seen this book, and believe me I have seen a lot of his books. But he is even more a bookworm than you --" Hermione scoffed, but Liz just smiled and continued, "-- so it's possible I simply haven't yet."

I'll be looking for 4 kinds of beta: grammar nazi, continuity & canon-compliance checker, playlist maker, and brit-picker. Feel free to DM me if that sounds like something you'd care to work on. Otherwise, cheers on your insight to Snape's character, and thanks for the kind words on my tease :)

*** Ah, not at all. The HNQ was talking about why Snape bothered with exam if he's just going to become the wizard equivalent of bomb-maker and perhaps medic. Reading the answer instead put the "this guy got a wall of books!" front and center in my mind. That was never my impression of Snape before. Tragic, sure, asshole, that too, yeah yeah smart to be extremely good at potion and invent several spells without dying at young age. But, books! Everyone in the canon seems to joke about Hermione being a bookworm (despite having a House full of nerds and their Headmaster displaying exquisite collection in his office), but this is a guy who fill his simple home with books.
