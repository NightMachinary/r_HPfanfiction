I was reminded of Fanfictions tropes by [[/u/NedryOS]] today, both wonderful and dreadful.

Nedry's example was, "scared, Potter?" as a sexual tension phrase between Draco and Harry. This one never bothers me but maybe it bothers you or maybe you love it.

My example: there is always a mishap in Potions class. Depending on the consequences and story, I don't usually mind it but maaaaaaan a lot of Drarry fics use this trope. Seriously, couldn't a mishap happen in another class? I know potions is the easiest but effort people, come on.

Now for your examples. :D


** To be honest, the first few Dumbledore!bashing fics I read I quite enjoyed, but then I realized that, apparently, one in every ten fanfics involved bashing in some respects. It's just /routine/, at this point- Harry finds out about Dumbledore's manipulations and the love potions- suddenly becomes vastly powerful- starts shouting at everyone (er... more so than canon) and attacks Snape and most of the Weasleys, except the twins. I'm just... tired of it all.

And I don't like it when he becomes Lord of twelve different families, or finds out that he is Heir of Gryffindor or something. I just get the feeling that if he suddenly becomes massively powerful because of his ancestry that sort of goes against the whole "Muggleborns are just as good as Purebloods" theme of the books.

I also dislike:

- Bound Magical Cores

- Harry is a Metamorph

- Harry leaves Britain because it is too dangerous.

- Ron/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

- Harry/Voldemort

I like Dumbledore!bashing if it's done subtly, but most fics just go so over the top and turn him into the second coming of Hitler.

As for soul bonds, I prefer it when the soul bond is a problem to be dealt with rather than just a magical starry-eyed indication of True Love For Ever and Ever. For instance, I've got a fic in progress in which Hermione went back in time ten or fifteen years, but her bondmate didn't. This is an obvious problem -- when you're 25, you don't want to date someone who's 11 years old, so she can either try her hand at [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry][Wife Husbandry]], which is super creepy, or just avoid the person entirely and cry a lot.

** *Likes*

Accidental bonds. Ok, so I have a thing for hatesex leading to true love.

Harry being rescued from the Dursleys.

Snapes billowing robes.

When shit happens and everyones like "It could only happen to you Harry!"

*Dislikes*

Any reference to Dumbledore & lemon drops, especially Snape anticipating an offer of lemon drops and saying something like "... and no! I don't want one of your blasted lemon drops!" I've just seen it so much and Dumbledore does eat other sweets ya know.

ActuallyGood!Lucius. I'm not really a fan of evil-character-is-really-good anyway, but IMO Lucius is the worst character morally in the whole series and I couldn't believe for a second that he was one of the good guys.

Snape talking in a really archaic manner or like a vampire. Especially excessive use of the word child.

OTT descriptions of peoples eyes. Stuff like "Harry's emerald orbs gazed into Snapes onyx globes". Especially when it's in a really sad emotional scene, like "Harry looked up, his emerald eyes glistening with tears like crystals." Are we supposed to be feeling sad for him or envious of his gorgeous eyes?

Harry not wanting to wear green because it's a Slytherin colour, or favouring red because it's Gryffindor.

Constantly having characters attribute character traits to houses.

Constantly referring to Harry as The Boy Who Lived or The Chosen One or The Saviour of The Wizarding World or some other title. Or having him refer to himself that way as part of some emo pitywank. "Oh I must be strong at all times, I can't be just Harry I have to be The Chosen One."

** Disliked:

- Fred and George finishing each other's sentences.

- Harry lecturing Hermione about how books can't be trusted the moment he meets her.

- Harry immediately seeing Neville's potential and telling Neville to have confidence in himself the moment he meets him.

- Harry the action man, Hermione the researcher, Ron the strategist.

- Dan and Emma Granger.

- Lily actively casting a spell to give Harry protection.

- The prophecy having magical ability to ensure its own result, rather than being a prediction of the choices people will make.

- Obscure, rare magic like the Fidelius, Horcruxes and Occlumency being treated as relatively common knowledge.

- Magical Britain being portrayed as socially or magically backwards relative to the rest of the world.

- Dumbledore justifying anything with the phrase "greater good".

- The Dursleys' dining room table.

Liked:

Can't think of any right now. If I've seen something in one fanfic, I generally roll my eyes if I see it repeated in another. I value novelty quite highly. Of course there are general themes I enjoy, such as proactive Harry, but in terms of tropes (specific events, dialogue, jokes, characters etc.) I feel like authors should be original.

***** I agree that she's more critical of what she reads than people give her credit for, but it's not until she befriends Ron/Harry and starts getting into trouble with them that she really starts questioning authority figures.

By the later books, she's pretty much on board, but we do see her using authority as a last resort (e.g., with the firebolt in PoA). And she's by far the most likely to encourage other characters to ask an professor/authority figure for help.

Hermione lying to McGonagall and then setting Snape's robes on fire is arguably part of her character development, and not really something she arrived at Hogwarts with.

It's mentioned multiple times when Marge and the Masons visit.

This passage makes it pretty clear that the dining room and the kitchen are separate rooms:

  He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking around for Dobby.

  From *the dining room* he heard Uncle Vernon saying, "... tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. She's been dying to hear..."

  Harry *ran up the hall into the kitchen* and felt his stomach disappear. Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby.

  The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack like a whip, Dobby vanished.

  There *were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen* to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia's pudding. [...] [Vernon] *shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room,* promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop.

If it wasn't able to enforce itself, people as [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSfXdNIolQA#t=3m8s][frustrator agents]] would almost always be able to change the future based on the given predictions. For Voldemort to so catastrophically shoot himself in the leg with baby-Harry, their prophecy had to be at least self-fulfilling. And considering how unlikely it was for Voldemort to continuously either get defeated by a kid or let it escape, I think making prophecies have magical power in addition to being self-fulfilling isn't /that/ bad.

It's either that or the Doylist explanation that JKR was being really lazy with her plot armors.

**** The prophecy is self-fulfilling through human choices and actions in response to being aware of it, not through magical enforcement. Dumbledore told us in HBP that most prophecies don't even come true. They're just predictions of the future, predictions that can be wrong just like all the rest of Divination. If someone had hit Harry with a Killing Curse, he would have died just like anyone else. The prophecy didn't give him immunity to non-Voldemort-caused death, it predicted that no one would kill him before a confrontation with Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  What's wrong with portraying it as socially backwards?
#+end_quote

It doesn't work practically or thematically.

On a practical level, much of the books don't make any sense if Britain is backwards: Dumbledore being the head of the ICW, no intervention in the war with Voldemort from the international community, the Statute being precipitated by largely British political events, Hogwarts having an equal showing as Beauxbatons and Durmstrang in the Triwizard.

On a thematic level, a big part of the HP books is that magical society is just as prejudiced and unjust as the Muggle world, it's just they have different prejudices: blood and species instead of race, gender, sexuality. Magic doesn't fix human nature. If you make Britain an outlier in terms of prejudice, you're saying that the magical societies of other countries are in fact significantly morally superior to the Muggle societies they are supposed to mirror. E.g. Muggle America has huge problems with prejudice and inequality; magical America should have correspondingly large but different social problems.

****** Voldemort's regime is nowhere near representative of magical Britain. It's a small group of radicals who, because of the particular dynamics of magical power (and in particular the imperius curse) are able to impose their will on the majority.

In normal times, prejudice in magical Britain very much mirrors the level of prejudice in the real world. The word "mudblood" is considered shocking and offensive by virtually everyone, in a clear parallel to "nigger" and "Paki". The first Muggleborn British Minister for Magic took office in the latter half of the 20th century, a clear parallel to the first female Prime Minister (Margaret Thatcher). There is no evidence that Muggleborns face any kind of direct discrimination politically or in the workplace, but there are hints as to indirect or structural discrimination.

A small group of radicals with enough power and/or knowledge that, if not for Dumbledore and Potter, would've managed to become the de facto rulers of the country not once, but twice. A terrorist group that can afford its members to be revealed and yet not get imprisoned --- not even ostracised --- because of the wealth and power they have accumulated in this society. Lucius alone pretty much controlled the Minister for at least several years and was also the chairman of the Hogwarts' Board of Governors (would've kept it past 1993 too if not for acting like an idiot), effectively also being able to restrict or dictate Hogwarts' administration's actions.

** Favourite Tropes:

- Training and studying sequences --- if done right;

- Exploration of the magical theory --- though mostly not when it feels like a large exposition dump on you, the reader;

- Exploration of the world --- protagonists travelling across the world, leaving England, switching schools, etc;

- Slow but steady growth in power/knowledge throughout the story in a way that 1. has noticeable positive consequences, 2. doesn't make the heroes unrealistically OPed, 3. doesn't make their power growth spurt a unique thing among other wizards. I.e. if Harry manages something by age 12-16, then it should be expected that more powerful, wise, or experienced wizards are capable of the same thing too.

Least favourites:

- OoC actions and dialogue styles;

  - Any character older than 16 constantly rolling their eyes. This one is /really/ annoying for me.

- When despite the /major/ changes to the canon the main plotline remains the same;

  - Same with making a charismatic bad guy from canon join the protagonists' side and almost immediately introducing an “original” character to do all the bad things that the charismatic bad guy was supposed to do. E.g. if Draco switches sides, some unknown schmuck will let the DEs inside instead;
  - Same with “timeline is a lake and your changes on it are only ripples” nonsense and “I've sold my soul to devil to get back in time but I must be careful to not change anything really important”.

- Actually, /all/ the stories where the main plotline is mostly copied from the original. Unless, of course, their initial goal was to tell the story from someone else's point of view (e.g. /Ender's Game/ v.s. /Ender's Shadow/ kind of thing);

- Poor sexual innuendos or off-color humour in general as means of trying to make the story “funny”.

*** I'm not sure if these are tropes as such... they're not specific enough. I think OP was thinking of tropes in terms of something very narrow which can then be replicated in the exact same form in multiple works, like the specific line of dialogue OP mentioned.

**** Tropes always meant the [[http://tvtropes.org/][Tvtropes.org]] kind to me. So in this sense, I think almost anything that can be used in different stories and potentially become popularly used, can be considered a trope (e.g. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia][No Ontological Inertia]], [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod][Status Quo Is God]], [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage][Training Montage]], [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkMontage][Hard Work Montage]], etc).

** Harry/Hermione makes me stay away from any fic that features it. Also, any kind of bashing. Also, anyone trying to portray Severus Snape as any kind of good guy.

Any fic centered around Remus raising Harry, as long as it doesn't turn into a cliche super powered Harry, gets my love.

** Likes:

- When shit happens and everyone's like "It could only happen to you Harry!"
- Gred/Forge hivemind.
- Originality
- Well-written OCs
- Sensible character progression and slow build of power in a reasonable and understandable way.
- Well balanced story - good balance of romance, angst, adventure, drama and humour. Or attempts at that.

Those last three aren't really tropes, but they're what I like to find in stories. I give them bonus points if they're included.

Dislikes:

- Dumbledore justifying anything with the phrase "greater good".
- Super OP characters for no reason
- Random bullshit events that make the main characters OP
- Soul bonds
- Forced marriages
- Physical or sexual abuse by the Dursley's (too many people go overboard, he was forced to live in a cupboard and punished slightly more than the average kid. He *wasn't* given the belt every day for nothing and he *certainly* wasn't abused sexually)
- Harems
- Slash smut (I'm fine with slash I just don't wanna read pure smut)
- Pedophilic slash (No offence people who ship it, but 9 times out of 10 Snape/Harry and Harry/Voldemort fics are of this type. I'm not a fan)
- When characters use phrases that they really wouldn't use. (For example Dumbledore calling Ron 'a dumbass')
- Made up magical artifacts that make very little sense and seem ridiculous even given the world it's used in.
- Needless and constant bashing of several main characters, who helped Harry become the hero he was canonically.
- The idea that Ginny and Mrs Weasley fed Harry and Hermione love potions so that they'd fall for Ginny and Ron respectively.

Blah, long list. But you asked. Lol

*** I hate it when the prologue is just "chapter 1". As in: it contains vital information that is absolutely necessary for the story to begin and for the actual chapter 1 (chapter 2 in this case) to make sense. Some authors go as far as to make the first chapter a direct continuation of the prologue.

No, that is not what a prologue is. That's just your first chapter. So call it "chapter 1" already instead of trying to be edgy by having a prologue.

** Dislikes;

- `Slash (not anything i want to see Harry doing, side characters being gay is fine)

- Becoming a Lord/Head of House while in school (I mean, the age of Majority exists for a reason)

- Marraige Law (Any forced relationship is Taboo to me)

- Arbitrary Soul Bonds (Ones that occur after the characters have been in a relationship for a while are fine, see previous comment)

- Extremely OOC Characters (OP Harry is fine though, basically Canon, just doe not apply himself as he should)

- Heir of the Founders (Don't you think James would have known this, and lorded it over everyone during his school years, as arrogant as he was?)

- FemHarry (Because it's a bit squicky...)

- Wrong BWL (This is core to who i think HP is, and I realy don't enjoy things that AU.

- Lemons for the sake of Lemons (Seriously people, make a plot.)

- Harry/Ginny (Not only did JKR state that she made a mistake with this, it's way too Oedipus Complexy for my tastes)

- MPREG (gack! ugh! /ulp/)

- Evil!Dumbledore (It gets old after a while. Dude's a manipulative dillhole, but he's not evil.)

LIKES

- NotAGriffindor!Harry (Nice to explore how harry would develop if the other aspects of his personality were brought to the forefront)

- Harry and his Harem (Because, c'mon, if anyone deserves to have a few different wives, and could treat them all equally and properly, it's Harry. Hard to do this (more than a threesome at least), without stepping on one of the other tropes I listed above)

- Old Magic (Maybe it's because I'm heavily into old Occult traditions myself, but I love to see things like this blended into the HP world)

- Magical Cores (It's a nice, simple explanation for differences in power. Easy to overdo, though)

- Runes and Warding (I can easily see this being a thing, but again, too easy to make OP. Needs to be handled with care.)

- Ron Bashing (Ron is a Jackass, and a horrible friend. I like the rest of the Weasley's though. Any fic I write will dump Ron as soon as possible. And if you pair him with Hermione, I will immediately drop your fic. He doesn't deserve her, at all. He's the worst kind of male.)

I suppose I could go on, but this list is pretty long already. I know many will not agree with me, but that's ok. Different strokes for different folks!

*** Strongly disagree with you regarding Ron, I would encourage you to reread. The films and fanfiction tend to be really harsh, while making Hermione into this flawless character. I would guess that most peoples' negative view of Ron (and Ginny) is heavily influenced by the films.

Also red hair doesn't mean he has an oedipus complex. Those quotes were hugely taken out of context as well.

Ron might, at times, might be jealous and self-centered, but he's not a /bad person./ On the whole, he's incredibly brave - and stupid, but no less brave. He has his own issues to work through, and when things come to head, he's incredibly loyal to Harry and Hermione.

********* Yeah again look at my comments, I was defending him not anyone else. If I had to explain everyone's actions as well as his it would take 5 times as long and 80% of that would be irrelevant because I was only talking about Rons actions in context of events not the reasons behind them. Hermione doesn't get a pass because she's eleven because that is irrelevant, Ron is also eleven so he doesn't have to accept that as a reason to let it slide. Because they are the same age. Now to /us/ of course we forgive her because she's 11 and sad. But to him she's just a girl being mean and he reacts appropriately to his age. And that is all I was discussing, Rons reaction. Nothing else.

To put it another way Hermione was a bitch, Ron was mean in return. I mention this in a thread where someone has said this event is an example of Ron being a horrible person. Thus I defend his action.

- Pureblood Hermione
- Dark Hemione
- Dramione, tomione, harmony, snamione
- Marriage law (the resulting drama is like a drug)
- Soul bonds - I like them in theory, because of the whole 'meant-to-be' aspect, but in general most are horribly done (or have guns)
- MMF triads (both with a link between the guys and without)
- Female OCs/Self inserts, haven't found many good ones yet unfortunately
- Magic!!! (I'm reading HP fanfiction instead of random romance novels/smut because I want to see magic involved, yet it's amazing how many fics involve the characters 'going muggle' or losing their magic)
- Extensive happy epilogues ending with the main character dying of old age surrounded by family... they make me cry but I love 'm. I'd link my favourite of this but I think it would be a spoiler in this context.
- Magical pregnancies - Funky magic turning the mom's hair into spaghetti (literally) or providing shields for the mother (like in Charmed)
- Magic that isn't bound to spells.
- Main character becoming animagus

Dislikes:

- Guns
- Harems (not more than 1 woman in a relationship for me, I'm possessive and I want the character to be as well)
- Main character slash (especially femslash)
- Ron-Hermione, even if the main character isn't Hermione I just hate reading about it. In some fics even them having had a previous relationship is too much for me
- Childree advocating (I don't need every story to end with kids, but I dislike the author ranting (repeatedly) on how horrible kids are)
