** On the various perches in the Owlery of Hogwarts, many owls were hooting.

Two in particular, Snowy Owls both, were hooting back-and-forth, each having a letter tied to its talon. If anyone were there, they'd notice that the owls almost seemed to be in conversation. A particularly observant viewer would notice that one of the owls had round, glasses-like markings around its eyes, and it had a distinctive lightning-bolt shaped mark on its forehead.

One of those owls was, in fact, Harry James Potter. Harry had just gotten the hang of flying, and was now being taught by his faithful companion how to use the seventh-sense that magically-bred owls had to always find the recipient of their letters.

"No, Harry. That's your hunting instincts telling you there's a nest of mice at that spot in the grounds. The castle is to the west, not the south, remember?"

Hedwig nipped Harry's head gently, in the spot where his ears would be if he were human. She'd always done that, as a way of showing affection. Harry suspected Hedwig's mothering instincts had always seen the potential for Harry's animagus form, hence why she'd accepted him as if he were her own young - which, at this moment, looked as if it could have actually been the case.

Harry re-focused, tuning out the vague pang of hunger he felt - it was almost dinnertime, students were expected to flock to the Great Hall in little over an hour. He focused on the letter on his talon, bearing the name "Ginny Weasley" - Ginny had just gone through a bad, somewhat-public breakup with Michael Corner and wasn't talking to anyone much, so Harry had written her a letter to cheer her up.

Slowly, his head turned in the direction of Hogwarts Castle. He had a vague sense that it wasn't time yet, that whomever needed this letter wasn't free to get it. His feathers ruffled a bit.

"I see you're getting it. Good, young Padawan. You may have an owl-treat."

Harry didn't know where Hedwig had picked that one up. Must have caught Dudley watching a movie he wasn't supposed to. Dutifully, he flew to the bowl of owl-treats that the House-Elves always kept available to returning owls and snatched up a treat - they were surprisingly delicious in owl-form, and Harry could see why Hedwig liked them so much.

Waiting this way for an hour more, Harry felt his neck-feathers crawl and his wings starting to get ready for a flight. Beside him, Hedwig seemed much calmer, but Harry knew she'd felt the same thing - she was due to deliver a letter to Professor McGonagall, explaining that the Animagus transformation Harry had been working on for extra credit was complete and asking her for a time in which to show it in action.

Together, they flew off towards the castle. Letters to deliver, adventures to have - whether rain, wind, sleet or Snowy Owls.

--------------

This was /fun/. In my head, Harry's Animagus form has always been an owl - a stealthy, usually-nocturnal bird of prey with keen instincts and something of a territorial streak (or a temper). This prompt let me explore that a little, as well as Hedwig's motherly relationship with Harry, so thanks for that.

EDIT1: Owls have talons, not paws.

EDIT2: Snowy owl males have fewer black feathers than females, but Animagi tend to have distinctive markings. I'm making it a little more ambiguous what the scar-marking looks like so the reader is more free to imagine things.

**** I am kind of toying with the idea of writing a full-length fic along these lines - Harry being an owl animagus, lighthearted tone a la Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay (I plan on part of the conflict centering around leftover Death Eaters and dark artifacts, but Voldemort himself having permanently died the first time), and a lot of interaction of this kind between Harry and Hedwig. I have some very, /very/ rough notes ready.

I'm surprised I don't see more of this. Presumably it was more popular before the horcrux reveal, but it's such an obvious way to make room for telling your own story.

Even fics that largely do their own thing will still end with a few "oh yeah and lemme take care of those horcruxes real quick" chapters.

***** There was a very short, unfortunately long abandoned fic about James giving Harry some sort of animagus potion before the attack and as a result shortly after being dropped off he turns into an owl. It'd be neat to see another one in that direction. Except of course chances are until he turned 11 he'd have no idea he was a human, but that could be interesting as well.

With Nagini in crimes of Grindelwald being shown having the maledictus blood curse when I read this it just popped in my head. Plus provides potential plot with Harry slowly getting stuck as an owl as well or eventually breaking the curse and now Lily is back.

Edit: realized after posting that the curse passes from mother to daughter. But its fanfic so that can be adjusted

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.

One thing that would be funny with a snow owl form would be if the feathers forming the thunderbolt shape were prone to getting ruffled or caught on others, breaking up the shape and getting lost in whites and blacks, though unfortunately males usually are pure white, with fewer and fewer black spots as they age.

** When he's avoiding problems or is bored, Harry just decides to go through with delivering the stuff people give to him. He also finds out that being a post owl is a pretty good way to get information. Turns out people don't watch what they say around the delivery owls, much less the ones who immediately "fall asleep" after finishing their initial job.

*** I am officially adopting this idea for my first full-length fic. I'm currently in the outlining phase, planning out OwlAnimagus!Harry's early childhood (he gets his Animagus form via accidental magic. I plan on addressing the normal "potion" method and having Harry's accidental magic latch onto the effects of that potion).

... Debating whether I should have Harry deliver the response to his Hogwarts letter himself, in owl form. I reckon James would think that's a hilarious inside-joke and he's alive in the outline I have (Lily sacrifices her magic instead of her life, James just gets KO'ed and heavily wounded but survives).

EDIT: James would probably follow Harry under the guise of "training the new post owl" if I decide to go through with it.

**** Unless you going for a crack story - be careful about making a kid too smart or too powerful. Becoming animagi is said to be very complex and dangerous process. While there are few unregistered animagi around - I think the fact that only 7 are officially registered speaks volumes to the difficulty. In canon, people have died or ended horribly disfigured attempting the transformation.

And no decent parent would let a 10yo boy fly off hundreds of miles from home without supervision.

Also please don't cheapen Lily's sacrifice into some parody. Not saying giving away magic can't work, but ... if you want to write a quality story - consider very carefully what that means, how it works. And how exactly is her magic worth more than Harry's life?

As for James - I think it would be out of character for Voldemort to let him live. So to make it canonically more believable - have James visiting Dumbledore that evening or something.

Good luck with your story!

***** - I'm going for mostly fluffy and light-hearted, bordering on crack at times. Think "Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay" (or the snippet above) in terms of tone, but it's "Harry Is An Owl Animagus, And That's Okay".
- Harry's situation will be rare, but not-unheard-of in children of known Animagi throughout history. I plan on it being a bit of a side-plot where Harry finds out about that, and what makes it work.
- The point about "no decent parent..." is fair. That's why I'm debating it, I haven't decided quite yet. I might just mention the idea and have Lily talk Harry out of it, or have James follow him on a broom (the image I have is of a parent teaching their child to ride a bicycle - eventually you'll have to let go).
- My plan is to give them more forewarning about the Halloween attack, so Lily and James have time to plan ahead and start a complex protective enchantment that would have taken her, James, and Dumbledore to fuel without consequences.\\
- There are consequences long-term - Lily ends up re-upheaving her entire lifestyle (and possibly having mild health issues), she's a pariah in proud-pureblood circles (giving up your magic is a /big/ no-no, but she's a mother first dammit), and James gets fired from the Auror Office through a combination of injury and political reasons. They end up living a mostly-Muggle lifestyle.\\
  As for "how exactly is her magic worth more than Harry's life"... Does it need to be? There's no real concept of equivalent-exchange in canon magic. I could also 'justify' it as a /metaphorical/ life (magical lifestyle, future career etc) for a /literal/ life.
- James does get heavily wounded, if that helps - heavily enough that at the time, Voldemort basically thinks he's inches away from dying and he doesn't need to make sure. I could also have James be fetching Dumbledore at the moment of attack - the story's still in the planning stages for a reason.

**** Hell yeah, go for it. Rowling didn't exactly establish any rules for her magic system expect for Gamp's law, so this is plausible enough. Plus, the animagus transformation is holding a mandrake leaf in the mouth for a month and taking a fiddly potion, so accidental magic could reasonably do so. Plus it'll be fun and if he's a kid it's super in character!

*** (assuming you're talking to me - I wrote the snippet but you responded to the prompt itself)

I've responded with little snippets like this to various prompts on here, and I'm currently outlining a full-length fic based on the same "Harry is an owl animagus and a wholesome nugget" concept that this prompt uses. That one isn't actually written yet but I'll probably be posting it to AO3 if I ever get around to writing it.

Other prompts I've responded to, or started out with little fic-lets:

** It's nice to see this as an idea. I remember another fic in which Harry gets drunk to become an owl animagus, then Hedwig basically rapes and gets knocked up by him.

Naturally it was abandoned after 2 chapters. Thankfully.
