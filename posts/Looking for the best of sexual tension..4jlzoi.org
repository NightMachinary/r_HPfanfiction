I'm looking to get some inspiration for a fic I'm writing (and read some good romance/smut in the process), and I'd like some recommendations for the best sexual tension you've seen in fanfiction. I'd prefer the recs not to be slash but if they're so good that you can't dream of suggesting anything else, feel free and I'll give it a shot.

^{Lucius, older Draco, or Snape would be a bonus cough cough}


** Here's one of the best "sexual tension" fanfictions I've certainly read, through I've got other issues with the writing and execution. The pairing is Tom Riddle/Hermione Granger.

  COMPLETE: A broken time turner shouldn't have sent me back so far. It was unprecedented. Stepping on it-smashing it-nothing should have happened. At most, I should have lost a week. At worst, I should have disappeared altogether. I shouldn't have traveled back fifty-two years; half a bloody century. This should not have happened. HG/TR.

***** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11739841/1/][*/The Truth About Death/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7464870/Avalon-Sunset][/Avalon Sunset/]]

#+begin_quote
  When Death sends Hermione back to 1938, he leaves many questions unanswered. How do you cope when everything you know has been taken away? Join Hermione on a journey from bitterness to acceptance -- and eventually, discover the truth about Death. [Canon-compliant until DH forest scene].
