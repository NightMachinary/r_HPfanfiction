An interesting question may be if it influences your writing in some way.


** Generally speaking, I like to listen to downtempo stuff when writing: Bonobo, Emancipator, Nujabes, etc. It's good, calming music to keep you focused on writing.

Usually with my HP fics, however, I find myself listening to quite a bit of British music: lots of David Bowie, Joy Division/New Order, Echo and the Bunnymen, Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac, The Smiths, The Cure, Radiohead, even Pet Shop Boys and Depeche Mode sometimes. I don't know why so many of these are from the 80s, but I guess good music is timeless?

** I turn pandora onto a station like Sabaton or Dark Tranquillity. Perhaps that's why so many of my stories end up with titles of songs that don't actually have anything to do with the story itself.

** I'm a musician and sound technician, so while listening to music I always analyze it in my head, which can get very distracting when writing. I suppose that's why I prefer albums that I know in-and-out. I'm very fond of the HBP soundtrack when writing HP, and Neo-Folk bands like Rome or Von Thronstahl.

** The music I listen to doesn't really effect my writing. I'll be writing a really sad scene while listening to Ariana Grande's new hit single, or or a happy one while listening to Evanescence.

** I'll often start out listening to something I know so thoroughly that it acts as background music, but half the time I end up turning it off anyway because I need silence to "hear" the words and sentences in my head.

Long fics (well, long for me, which is less than epic) are the exception. The longer the fic, the more satisfying it is to assemble a soundtrack that develops as the story does, keeping a record of where the fic is going, the kind of emotional ups and downs I want to achieve. The songs reflect how I feel about the main characters and mirror the plot's emotional trajectory. Once the soundtrack takes shape, I listen to it obsessively while writing; it becomes a kind of shorthand for re-establishing the creative connection.

Examples: one playlist included Radiohead, Damien Rice, Sweeney Todd (/not/ Tim Burton's version), Okkervil River, Patty Griffin, and Muse. Another had Frank Turner, David Ford, Frightened Rabbit, 16 Horsepower, Dark Sanctuary, and Lucinda Williams, among others. (Also more Okkervil River and Sondheim). How the tracks fit together and flow into each other is as important as the individual songs. And they're interesting to revisit long after I've finished and posted the fic, because the echoes of my immersion in that world remain.

** I don't listen to anything while I'm writing, but if I feel stuck or uninspired I'll go and listen to something I think fits the tone of what I'm trying to write. At the moment, lots of Lorde, Sia, Lana Del Ray, Florence and the Machine...

** For my main fic, the Dragon Quest Symphonic Suites I-VII on shuffle. Highly recommended for fantasy-heavy stuff.

Everything else I write is either crack or a topical one-shot, so it depends on the mood for that piece. 80s J-pop, New Romantic, trap, etc.

** Whatever I think matches the scene I am trying to write. But generally instrumentals, so as to not let the lyrics influence the writing.

** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voIw0tcmok&ab_channel=FireyPast][Anti-Nightcore]], and not to be a hipster but I doubt you have heard of it;) It's a branch of Nightcore that originaly was a type of Trance the went its own way. And Trance to be clear is a remix sub genre of Techno.

** I tend to pick a small list of songs for a fic, with one devoted to each major character and a handful for thematic feeling. Because the songs have to match the writing and I'm best with angst, the music tends to be sad, dramatic or tense.
