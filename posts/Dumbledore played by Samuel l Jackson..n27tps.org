** "As we all know, last year ended with the tragic death of our beloved Cedric Diggory-"

"/hem-hem/" came a tiny cough, though Dumbledore continued on as if he had not been interrupted.

"-He was a mentor to many, a friend to more, yes, even a loved one-"

"/Hem-Hem/" came another cough, slightly more insistent.

"-to some. He was taken from us by murder most foul. Cedric was murdered by none other than the Dark Lord-"

"/HEM-HEM/" came the cough a third time, clearly interrupting the headmaster.

Unable to take it anymore, Dumbledore whipped his head around. "*AND I DON'T RECALL ASKING YOU A GOD DAMNED THING!*"

***** Duuuude. If you knew, you'd KNOW. And that you don't KNOW? Dude. This is kinda wild, but I guess I get to be the one to tell someone about it, which is awesome.

Alright.

Ok. So, this was a reference to a work of Harry Potter fan fiction titled 'My Immortal.' It's the worst-written piece of fan fiction of all time, a mystery of the internet, and famous for it. There is no way I could do it justice before my phone battery dies, so, bare bones. Everyone was emo, the entire cast shopped at hot topic, and that particular line was Dumbledore reacting to catching the main character, Enoby Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way (depending on how the author was spelling it this sentance), and vampire Draco Malfoy, as, "he put his thingie into my you-know-what and we did it."

You don't need to read it, for your sake, don't, but you should absolutely read about it. [[https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/16021349-my-immortal][here, have some quotes]], and enjoy this train wreck for the first time, you lucky dude.

"I recognize the council has made a decision. But given that it's a stupid ass decision, I've elected to ignore it" Dumbledore replied, to a standing ovation as he cut out the legs from underneath Fudge's attempt to seize control of Harry Potter's fame.

"You don't share anything with me, yet you expect my trust Dumbledore?" asked Snape, infuriated by the older man's secrecy.

"You're wrong about me" replied Dumbledore as he stood up from his chair, placing his hands on his desk as he leaned over to look Snape in the eye.

"I do share" Dumbledore said "I'm nice like that".
