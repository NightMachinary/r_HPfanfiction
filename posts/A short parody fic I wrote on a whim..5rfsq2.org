** Damn you, now I want to read the actual parody this guide would produce. Except for the goblin orgasms, that kinda made me uncomfortable. And the name thing is played out even for parody by now. Maybe instead Harry is just incredibly good at rapping. So much so that high-ranking snoopdog immediately becomes his account manager and works with the goblin king fiftyknuts to amass new fortunes for him. And of course they help him overcome the dark lord, the tall thin one, the slim shady.

^{I don't even like rap, I just giggled at a goblin being called snoopdog and my mind went places} ^{^{I'm}} ^{^{sorry}}

*** You know what the funny thing is? Believe it or not I've already been PMed by half a dozen people who want to write a serious story based on it. If any of those crazy people end up writing one I'll let you know. xD

*** Well, after saying his name a few times it's a given that he's good at rapping.
