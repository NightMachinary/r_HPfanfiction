Would be interesting. Someone quite opposite of Voldemort who wants to end the isolationalism of wizards and destroy the statue of secrecy to integrate muggle and magic societies and cultures. Recruits muggle borns and halfbloods to his cause and wants to combine the two worlds entirely and thereby destroy the wizard culture of sorts. Not looking for discussion - only recommendations. Perhaps taking up the cause after something along the lines of being a disgruntled muggleborn who lost his parents or close relatives to some disease or perhaps material conditions that they later came to know was easily curable by magic or some muggle born struck by the cavalier obliviation of muggles and widespread crime and exploitation of them by wizards that is virtually unchecked. So not just a cackling villain like Voldemort but someone who makes a case for himself where it makes sense for muggleborns and halfbloods who personally know other muggles to join them.
