It is a Harty/Draco story I think it was 2 or 3 stories total. Harry and Draco were together and Ron's family chases Draco away. He becomes a model and they get back together years later. I believe Draco ended up having MS part way through. All I can remember from the name is it have "Rain" in it some where. Please help.
