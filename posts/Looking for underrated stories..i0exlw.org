I find myself looking through reddit for recommendations, especially now that I have the time to read stories because of quarantine. But the more time I spend on here the more I realize the same stories are recommended often. This of course is because some of these stories are interesting, long and memorable and are very much good recommendations. However, there are hidden gems that may not have a lot of reviews which people haven't seen before.

I just came across Blackpool by The Devine Comedian linkffn(12948481) which I read a while ago, and I was wondering how this story had so little reviews when from what I remember it was a decent story. It is not even my usual kind of read but it was really good.

I know this happens often as this fandoms is chalk full hidden gems and I was wondering what your hidden gem stories are. I know reviews and follows are quick ways to evaluate whether a story is worth reading but I'm in the mood for a good story and I can't seem to find one.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

** One of my "Least favorited" favorites is /The Son of Prongs and the Snitch and Stone/ by Stellar Magic, though I can't remember how good it actually is(it's been an exceptionally long time since I last read it).
