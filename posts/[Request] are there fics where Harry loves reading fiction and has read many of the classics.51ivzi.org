I imagine he'd be rather fond of Dickens since his life with the Dursleys would be rather similar to some of Dickens' protagonists. A fic along these lines, with Harry being interested in literature and his character perhaps influenced by it, would also have a lot of potential for metafiction.


** There're a few, usually by older authors. Check out rorschach's blot and his list of favorite authors. Most of them are into the classics.

** If you've read and enjoyed linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time), you should check out Joe Ducie's original fiction series, /The Reminiscent Exile,/ that was derived from that fic. The entire premise of the magic is based upon the reading of fiction novels.

** There's nothing truly overt in any of Stanrick's work, but the dialogue between Harry and Hermione is almost always filled with tonnes of references to British literature.
