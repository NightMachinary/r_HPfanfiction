** My favorite competent father figure but still having trouble with nightmares from Azkaban Sirius is in linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7).

Basically Sirius escapes Azkaban a few years earlier when Harry is eight, then he shows up at Privet Drive and decides to take Harry from the Dursleys. The entire wizarding world then panics and starts hunting the Azkaban escapee and kidnapper of the Boy-Who-Lived, while Sirius raises Harry under a Fidelius at Grimmauld. Lupin, Tonks, Malfoy, Moody, Dumbledore and Marlene McKinnon are important players in the hunt for Sirius, and Greyback, Voldemort and the Serpent Sworn are additional antagonists.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
