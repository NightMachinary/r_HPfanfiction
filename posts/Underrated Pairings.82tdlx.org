Are there any great romance stories featuring Harry? I'm kind of looking for underrated pairings, het, pls. I know the popular pairings are usually with Ginny, Hermione, Daphne, or even Fleur. I'd prefer none of those. I just don't see the chemistry in any of those pairings. I'd kinda like to read a story that's similar to Dramione and Tomione, where there's conflict and angst between Harry and his love interest. I don't know if that exists or not... But I'm hoping? Thanks in advance!

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

** There's a harry/gabrielle story where her veela!magic makes harry turn eight and keeps him eight while she remains eight because she wants to be his friend forever and it's such a sad story. Not really a romance tho.
