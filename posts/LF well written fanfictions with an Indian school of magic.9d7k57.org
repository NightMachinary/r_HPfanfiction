*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/][*/Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4788805/The-Sinister-Man][/The Sinister Man/]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** I would read up to it, otherwise you won't understand a lot of the issues that characters have, but its heavily focused on in ch. 85-87, and sprinkled in afterward. Also, it's not a formal school, it's in a city where they learn magic. I was thinking of school like "this is fire magic, or water magic, or indian magic."

** When you say "Indian" do you mean Native American, or literally from the Indian Sub-continent?
