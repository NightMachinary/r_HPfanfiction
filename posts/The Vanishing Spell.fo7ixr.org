I just realized the vanishing spell I the the most OP spell in any fight. Any physical attack whatsoever they send at you, you can just vanish. Swords being thrown at you? Vanish them. Animals attacking you? Vanish them. Flames being shot at you? Vanish them. A bunch of bullets being fired at you? Vanish them. (if your fast enough). The only thing you can't stop with a vanishing spell, would be other spells, which shields take care of pretty well.


** If it were area based and could be used on fast-moving objects, I'd agree with you. What we've seen of it, however, is that it takes concentration and time to take effect. If you accept the movies as informing canon (not overriding it, but fills in the blanks where the books aren't explicit) Snape had to use a purpose-made Vanishing spell to eliminate Draco's conjured snake. Also from the movies, Dumbledore used some sort of deconstituting shield spell to reduce all the flying glass aimed by Voldemort to turn it into relatively benign sand (though anyone who's been in a sandstorm can attest that the effect wouldn't make the missiles harmless, just less dangerous). If Evanesco were readily cast-able as a shield, I'm sure Albus would have chosen that as a defense.

In the books, Bill takes a moment to Vanish the blueprints left behind during an Order meeting. Since these were relevant intel, we might assume that this form of Vanishing was meant to be un-Vanishable, and may require extra preparation in order to track the vanished items.

*** I'm more with OP on this one - it's a pretty crazy spell that sees a lot of different and varied use in the books, but never really used in combat. There's no canonical reason it isn't used, it just... isn't. JKR's selective memory strikes again!

** Where does it go though?

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11619134/1/Harry-Potter-s-most-excellent-adventure][Harry Potter's Most Excellent Adventure]], everything he vanishes ends up in the yard at Mark Wahlberg's house.

Hermione's was in some swamp somewhere.

*** It's said in the books that they go into “Non-Being”. So they just cease to exist.

**** It's said they go “Into Non-Being, which is to say, everything.” I think when an item is vanished, it is broken down into individual atoms that are then dispersed into the environment.

** But what are the limits, because surely there has to be some?

Can a person be vanished? If not, why? Does the size of something have an effect (can you vanish a wall? The floor below someone?)?

** In [[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Healing_Harry/Healing_Harry/][Healing Harry]], the spell sends the items into the magma chamber under Mt. Etna. Harry does use this in battle.

** I'm pretty sure that it just vanishes things, it doesn't make them disappear. Just because you can't see the bullet doesn't mean it isn't there. I could be wrong though.

*** You are. Snape vanishes Harry's potion and the cauldron was left empty.

**** Do vanished objects deatomized or is it essentially a long range banishing charm though?
