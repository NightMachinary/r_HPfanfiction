I'm looking for a specific fic. Harry leaves the wizarding world and hides his identity, he gets married to a muggle, and they have a daughter. She goes to Hogwarts where she gets a project about him, so she writes him letters, and he responds. That's pretty much all that I can remember about it unfortunately.


** It's called Betrayed. I can't link on my phone but you should find it easily with a quick google search.

** I recognize this one. Harry leaves his name behind and hides his magical abilities from his wife/family, and when his daughter goes to Hogwarts, she gets a project on Harry Potter that is done every year by first years, and she talks about Harry to his canon friends, and then writes letters home.

And then gets exposed during some sort of parent conference thingy??

Crap, I don't have this bookmarked.

*** I think so? I'm sure that the first bit is correct, but I think I remember something later on about the ministry sort of covering up what the war was about or something.

** Oh god, I enjoyed the fic, but the ending was very frustrating.
