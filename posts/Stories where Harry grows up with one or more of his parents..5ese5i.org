I am looking for good stories where Harry grows up with his family and neither he nor his parents are assholes. Too many of the ones I have read they neglect him for some reason or Harry goes evil for some reason or they are just not good people. BWL/wrong BWL/No BWL/whatever.


** Here's a relatively new one and a classic.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  The night that Lily and James Potter died is well known. What no one suspected, or even imagined, was that their spirits remained with their son. Lots of OOC-ness!

** In my story "Ilvermorny Champion", Harry grows up with his mother, though they are outside of Britain after the attack on Halloween of 1981, up until October of 1994 where the story starts.

  Instead of Durmstrang Academy, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was invited to take part in the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. This has certainly thrown a wrench in his plans!
