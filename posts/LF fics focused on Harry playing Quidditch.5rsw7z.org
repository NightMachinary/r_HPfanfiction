Hey guys, I'm looking for Quidditch focused fics, it can be during Hogwarts, or after the War, or even an AU in which Voldemort never existed. It seems strange to me that not many "popular" fics care for this sport, since we know from canon that it's one of the few passions Harry has. Anyway, I've already read linkffn(6862426) and I liked it, even if it is focused on Harry's past, and not so much on Quidditch. Thank you!


** I don't find it that strange that most people don't care for quidditch. As a whole it's really a stupid game that would never exist in any sort of world. There is no feasible way that the society would be able to sell tickets, advertising, rights, and what not, knowing full well that a match might take fifteen seconds. Setting it up as aerial hockey or soccer would have made far more sense from a game building standpoint.

That and, if I'm honest, I highly doubt that the vast majority of fanfiction writers are that interested in sports. Organized competitive sports of any kind seem rare in general in fanfiction.

Quidditch is also very difficult to write and keep it entertaining. And most people freely admit 'I skipped until who caught the snitch' which is annoying as a writer, but it is what it is. Still, it discourages people from actually writing quidditch.

There's a ton of quidditch, but not a ton of 'game action' in linkffn(Vitam Paramus)

*** Ah, but the beauty of quidditch fics is it doesn't have to focus on the game that much at all. If I were to write one (Which is unlikely as my writing is atrocious) I would look towards sports anime as a muse. The game itself isn't actually that important, the History of the game, the passion of the players, the strategies, the training, the rivalries, and the friendship with team mates are what is important.

The stress and pressure of winning make compelling storylines. Not only do fans of the sport want you to win, but also everyone in your house. Other compelling stories are bonding over a shared passion, summer camp, study groups to make sure that the team isn't dissolved due to poor grades, inter team romance, and the drama of drifting away from your other friends because you have something you are committing all of your time to.

** I don't know about popular opinion but I find quidditch just not enjoyable as a fan. How are you supposed to make us invested in the game when 90% of the game doesn't matter unless one team is ahead by more than 150? Even in that case it's still uninteresting because then the seekers don't matter.

** Ron instead of Harry, but I like this one: linkffn(5987922).

Also... Gravity by hgfan1111 (if you can find it somewhere online) is decent, but a bit more romancy. Shame Andi took down all her work.
