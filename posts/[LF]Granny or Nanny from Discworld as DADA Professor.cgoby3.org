  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

  Maybe the insanity of the wizarding world isn't best countered with logic and rationality but by a more resilient sort of insanity. Alt Upbringing in which Harry ends up in the hands of the Wyrd Sisters and is excited to become the very best witch he can be.

*** I liked it a lot, except it felt like it wants to dip deeply into Dumbledore-bashing. Especially chapter 6.

Beyond that the word play was exquisite and I enjoyed it a lot.
