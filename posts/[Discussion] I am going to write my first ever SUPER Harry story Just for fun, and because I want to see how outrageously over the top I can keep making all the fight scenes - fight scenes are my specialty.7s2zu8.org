Yes please, the super long title says what you need to know! :) I am going to write a SUPER Harry story for the first time ever, just to have lots of fun with it and see how crazy ridiculous I can make the fight scenes. :) I LOVE writing action sequences, so I want to see what I can do when I am let loose with absolute free reign, no restrictions, no rules to the magic, no limits to anything!!! :) :) :) :)
