So, I'm new to writing in general and recently posted my first ever fic.

It's called "Can I ask you something?" - a Haphne story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13749023/1/Can-I-ask-you-something]]

​

*Now my problem:*

One of my reviews said " You reduced a lot of what could be important scenes to explain those plot divergences to a few sentences, like the scene where Sirius tells Harry of his parents. There could be actual speach, even a few stories told by Sirius, to build his character and how your Harry diverges from canon. " -A review from Chapter 6.

I understand that more speech for a character would build this character. But how would that in my case affect Harry if Sirius is the one with speech time about his time with Harry's parents at school.

I don't understand what this reviewer means with "how your Harry diverges from canon." in relation to the topic he describes.

​

I would appreciate any thought you would have on this. Thank you.


** I imagine they're getting at the idea that it takes at least two to have a conversation. Sure, Sirius is sharing his stories and experiences and there's character building and development for him there, but Harry can make responses, share his views and opinions on the stories, ask questions, etc. as well. And Harry's part of the conversation can show things about his character and maybe make him think about any flaws or mistakes or things he doesn't know that you might want to highlight.

To give a basic-ish example, if your Harry was, say, a Ravenclaw!Harry and was more academic and rational than canon Harry and his Gryffindor Bravery, you might have Harry tilt his head curiously and question how a complicated spell worked, or criticise a plan Sirius was telling him about, pointing out how they could've done it better. "What, so you just... charged up and attacked him? Why didn't you just ambush him, instead of making all that noise?"

A big part of Harry in canon is his interest in his parents. He soaks up anything people tell him with delight and interest. So, him having a different reaction would show something about his character that's different.
