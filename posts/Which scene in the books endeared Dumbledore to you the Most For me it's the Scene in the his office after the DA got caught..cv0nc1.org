** I remember cringing at this when I read it as a kid, but in retrospect, I think it's the scene at the end of OotP where Harry goes hog wild and destroys everything and Dumbledore just calmly lets it be. I think that's the moment where you really see how much Dumbledore cares, because up until then, he'd only ever had to deal with Harry when Harry was too exhausted to do anything or was trying to be really respectful.

In this moment, Dumbledore sees how much pain Harry is in, and he's decided that it's okay for Harry to take it out on him, because Dumbledore is partially responsible for all that pain and Harry's just a kid who really needs a target right now. And then after Harry has finished, Dumbledore knows it's time to treat him like an adult even if he's not ready, and he explains everything to him like he's an equal.

The scene affects me much more now because I've worked with a lot of kids, and I know what it's like to see them go off the rails and just... let it happen, because it needs to happen, and it's your responsibility to put up with it because you can and they need you. I really believe it when Dumbledore says that he loves Harry in that moment.

  “The /Prophet/ is bound to report the truth occasionally,” said Dumbledore, “if only accidentally. Yes, that was why we argued. Well, it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last.”

  “He accused me of being ‘Dumbledore's man through and through.' ”

  “How very rude of him.”

  “I told him I was.”

  Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry's intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized that Dumbledore's bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at his own knees. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady.

  “I am very touched, Harry.”

** I started to like him when he came to Harry when Harry was gazing to the mirror of Erised and told about his wish for woollen socks. Yes, I know, I'm easy. I was also like 12 and thought he really really wanted those socks.
