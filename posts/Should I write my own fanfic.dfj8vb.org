So I think I've come up with a good idea for one, but I'm not sure if I should give it to a author with more experience or if i should write a probably worse one myself. What do you think?


** My thoughts:

1. It's very unlikely that anyone is going to write your idea. Ideas are a dime a dozen, and writers tend to have way more ideas than time. You might be able to commission someone if you have the money, or maybe convince someone to write a one-shot or a drabble, but anything beyond that is unlikely.
2. Even if you do get someone else to write it, you will probably be disappointed in the outcome. The way it looks and sounds in your head is not the way it will look and sound in the writer's head.

** Write it yourself, you will never see your exact idea unless you do it yourself. Besides, you will grow as a writer while working on it! Every mountain climbed is started from the bottom.

** Write it. You improve through writing, and it's always better to write your idea rather than see it get written (and changed) by someone else.

** Do it. I've never written one myself because I haven't ever come up with an idea but if I had one I would want to write it myself.

** Write it. I was nervous to write mine as well. I had never written anything before and I didn't feel that I could do it justice. I got a good beta and I work really hard. My writing has improved so much over the years writing this fic and I'm at over 650000 words and it's what lead me to realize how much I love writing. It's not something that comes over night but it's so fun. It's okay to not do well at something, sometimes it's just nice to do it for yourself.

** Do it. Believe in yourself. If you have an idea then put it on paper. Most important ff rule: write what you want to read. So go ahead and write! :)

** I want to write one too, but I'm not sure If people will like the Idea. Basically, Lily divorces James before the attack and marries Snape. James goes into hiding with Harry abroad. Eventually, they end up in greece and meet Herpo, the foul ( or another mythical powerful guy from pottermore ) and become their apprentices or something like that.

** Go like a Gryffindor and do it. Even if it's bad, even if it's good, you'll get the answer to the question of "What do people think about this Idea".

** Only way to get good at something is to start off bad at it. But a word of advice- if you want critique or feedback, I do recommend posting it- or links to it- in places other than FFN. It's the next best thing to impossible to get anything other than "Good story, keep it coming" or just flames on that site, and without real, specific, constructive criticism it's very hard to improve, if that's your goal.

** Do you have a story in your heart? Do you know how to use spellcheck, or maybe be fancy and use grammarly? Do you have an ao3 or ff.net account, or know how to sign up for one?

If the answer to one or more of these questions is yes; you should go for it.

The point with fanfiction is that it's written by people who don't have experience in the beginning and is a tool to get better. And if you years down the road read your brilliant idea story, and realize you were a terrible writer, you can always rewrite it.

** it depends.

As an fanfic author I can honestly say that I wouldn't give ideas from random people the time of day unless I was blown away by them. I have a document with all of my ideas for future fics and I belive the idea count is somewhere in the low thirties and I've only had that doc up since last December.

My point being that authors have plenty of ideas themselves, and it is human nature to favour your own ideas.

Final point, an author probably won't write your idea the way you want it to be written, even if is “better” in terms of mechanics.
