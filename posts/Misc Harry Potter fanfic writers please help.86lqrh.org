Hi, I'm a huge nerd and reader of fanfiction so I decided to combine the two for my senior research project.... So if anyone wants to talk about creating fan content about Harry Potter and their experience this is my survey, it's really quick and I would appreciate the help and I'll post results later on!

** Finished. I'll be interested to see the results.

It may also be useful to post this survey on [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]. I may be wrong, but from what I've seen the writers in this subreddit are generally male and against slash fics. The other subreddit seems to have more female and LGBT people.

And one comment on the survey itself: with sexual orientation you can tick all the boxes that apply for your characters, but with gender identity you can only choose one. Since I'm writing several fanfics, I would have chosen both cisgender male and cisgender female as the answers, but instead had to choose one.

*** Thanks for the suggestion! Sorry about the gender boxes, the re-formatting on that one must have slipped past my final checks.

*** Looking for a lot of things, this area is not very studied in academics. I'm mostly looking to complete my degree so I appreciate you taking the survey.
