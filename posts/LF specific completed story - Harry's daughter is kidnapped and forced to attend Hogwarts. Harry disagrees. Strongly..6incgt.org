It's a post Hogwarts and post Voldemort story. Harry left for America and got married to I believe a Native American woman who had some sort of tribal Magic. Back in Britain laws were passed forcing muggle-born Wizards and witches to attend Hogwarts while making their parents forget all about them. Hermione and Ron were married and Ron went to kidnap Harry's daughter in America and was injured. They believed Harry and his wife were Muggles hence the kidnapping. Harry was out of the country for some reason and his wife was injured in the kidnapping also. Harry was allowed originally to leave Britain under the promise that Britain would leave his family alone and Harry would never step foot on British soil again. I'm pretty sure he gets the British Muggle Armed Forces to help him take over the Wizarding World.

You have to have an account there to read it, but it's easy to do and worth it

** I've read this and for the life of me I can't remember title/author.

If I remember correctly, there's some sort of "guardian spirit" watching over her at Hogwarts and elsewhere? Something like that.
