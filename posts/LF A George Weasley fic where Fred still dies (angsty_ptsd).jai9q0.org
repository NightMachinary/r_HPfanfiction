Hi, I'm new to this sub so I thought I'd give it a shot. I really love George so much and believe he deserves much more than being second fiddle to Fred. I'm not picky about who George is paired with (NO INCEST) as long as there is an interesting dynamic to play off of. I've been partial to George/Hermione, but I really don't mind what sexual preference or character. I just want the love interest to see George as his own man instead of "Fred and George". Thanks so much, let me know if I formatted anything wrong! (I normally read M or E fics on ao3 but I'll do any platform and even t rated) <3 I'm desperate lol
