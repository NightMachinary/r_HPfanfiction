Does anyone know any good Harry raised by Sirius and Remus fics. Any pairings except for snarry or romione. Preferably no bashing but I'm fine if there is some


** These are the best two that ive read. Both are Wolfstar if thats ok?

linkao3(Stealing Harry) - This is probably the best one? It's a whole universe where the two rescue/adopt Harry from the Dursleys. It's adorable. There are a lot of side stories that go with it as well which makes it much bigger. I think the series is called Laocoons Children.

linkao3(The Dogfather) is also adorable. Goes right through till PS which is nice. Harry is adopted by a nice couple and they end up with a dog and it's overall a great feel good story where everything is just happy you know!!

  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.

  Sirius promised Harry a home. Problem is, he doesn't have one, so he convinces his friend Remus to let them live with him. But when the ministry catches wind of it, a certain pink-haired Auror comes to investigate... Set after PoA. AU: Voldemort was defeated after the first war.
