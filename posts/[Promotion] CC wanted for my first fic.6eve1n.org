[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11890175/1/The-Complexities-of-Human-Nature][The Complexities of Human Nature]] by VivikaThemis (WIP)

SHORT SUMMARY

After the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione Granger and the wizarding world are recovering from war. As reconstruction of the school comes to an end and people move on to rebuild their lives, Hermione is presented with a photograph of a woman from the 70s who looks shockingly like herself. From there, things rapidly progress. She finds herself in a whirlwind of chaos, featuring time-turners, Death Eaters, romance, and enough mental instability to fill a psychiatric hospital.

INTRODUCTION

It is generally accepted that nurture plays a significant role in the development of human beings. It is highly unlikely that a person be born with inherently evil nature. All creatures are capable of both good and bad, yet most remain somewhere in the gray areas. This is demonstrated by the ruthless Hermione Granger, a generally accepted 'good' person, who sacrifices Umbridge to the centaurs, no doubt knowing their brutal folklore, who holds Rita Skeeter captive in a jar, then subsequently blackmails the journalist into doing her bidding, and who permanently disfigures a sixteen year old girl for reporting rule-breaking activity. Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore also work in the shades of gray, though whether they were, in the end, 'good' men is still a matter of controversy. With that established, we must ask ourselves, what has happened to the villains in our story to make them, in our eyes, evil? Was Tom Riddle a sociopath? Did the effects of a parent under the influence of Amortentia during conception make him incapable of feeling love? Or was he a product of abandonment, social outcasting, and racism? Was the insanity of Bellatrix Black due to inbreeding, Azkaban, or something else? What circumstances drove Peter Pettigrew to taking the Dark Mark? This tale will take us down an emotional rollercoaster, full of betrayals, domestic abuse, genetic instability, neglect, bullying, and ignorance. We will explore the childhood of Severus Snape, the paradoxes of time travel, the connotations of bigotry, and the medieval mindset of the 1970s pureblood movement. And we will observe human nature vs. societal nurture.


** Honestly that introduction just reads like something from [[/r/iamverysmart]] or maybe even [[/r/delusionalartists]] . At this point before proving to me that you're actually capable of such depth in your writing it just sounds pretentious as hell. I've lost any interest in your Fic after that.

*** I'm really glad that you picked up on that, actually.

This fanfiction starts off pretentious, and it'll continue on that way for some time. The early chapters are intended to come off as supercilious, and even disdainful. It's a character element that I want to establish early on, seeing as it's from Hermione Granger's POV. The tone will be intersected by paranoia and anxiety, and a certain level of narcissism. Eventually that will evolve into a short period of self-flagellation and low self-esteem, until a more healthy level of confidence and personal awareness are developed.

However, to be 100% honest, I wrote the introduction while also working on particularly pompous and condescending content, and I didn't even notice that I'd drafted it in that same attitude. I'll discuss changing it or scrapping it with my Alpha and Beta readers.

I appreciate you pointing that out. If you have any other comments or criticisms, they're very welcome!

I've actually skimmed a bit over further chapters and noped right out of the whole Fic again when Hermione discovered how nice and beautiful pureblood dogma actually is and how she was just ignorant of the beautiful subtleties of Magical Britan and now, now that she read some books (that she for some reason or another couldn't read in the future) she's totally understanding and sympathetic. I hate that trope.

***** I'm going to message you because this is long lol. But I'm really enjoying your input, so I'd love to hear more! I have a reason for that trope, and the fact that you dislike it makes you the perfect person to talk to about whether or not my explanation (which will come into play later in my fanfiction) is rational.

** I would get rid of the introduction It seems very out of place and doesn't add anything to the fic. Some of the descriptions are a bit much, maybe cut down on them? For example, describing Hermione as petite brunette and Mcgonagall as tartan clad witch and all the other descriptions every other sentence is distracting and can get confusing (There are places where I had to re-read because I had no idea what was going on due to too much description).

Sometimes simpler is better, there is nothing wrong with using Hermione's name repetitively or using she/her instead of coming up with a silly sounding description of her every paragraph. Oh, and please please do not use the word orb to describe eyes (especially not in regards to Snape), it sounds cringy, terrible and is one of the most cliche terms generally found in bad writing that I can think of.

I do like where the storyline is going though. I would have to read more chapters to see how it progresses, but what you have so far is good. I am not a fan of all the pureblood etiquette stuff since I have always thought that giving purebloods custom rules to follow sounded ridiculous. I would rather read about death eaters being and acting just like normal people without any added crap about where they sit/how they talk and all that, but that's just my preference.

*** Thank you! I do think I'm going to get rid of the intro. And I definitely have a tendency to be overly descriptive lol. Eventually, when the fic is done, I'll probably go back and cut a lot of it, and then condense the chapters so they're no longer drabbles.

I'm glad you're enjoying the story line. As for pureblood etiquette, I wanted to incorporate the old-fashioned mindset of Victorian Era culture, but there will be plenty of twists.

** Good summary, wtf introduction. If you're not going to write the story in formal essay format, drop the intro and provide an example of your prose instead. You don't want your marketing/intro to be at odds with your story format, then people who like the intro will drop the story and people who might like the story will never make it past the introduction.

*** Thanks for your input! I'm glad the summary was to your tastes. As for the introduction, that's a very good point. I'll talk to my Alpha and Beta Readers about it, and see what other responses I get in regards to the intro. If the feedback majority feels the same way, I'll scrap it.

** Your entire first chapter should just be deleted. There's no actual content in it. It also, as another user says, comes off as very pseudo-intellectual. It screams 'look at how smart I am' and it doesn't help that the following 9000 words do not even come close to living up to.

Overusing random quotes and song lyrics at the start of a chapter is annoying and a sign of immature writing. The interactive questions at the end should also just not exist.

Questions like the ones that are posed in your 'introduction' should be in the text of the story. Not thrown together at the start like a bad high school essay question. And not actually directly asked either. The content should ask the question.

The entire thing is riddled with comma splices and punctuation and capitalization errors. And the excessive use of passive voice stilts the entire text.

** Your summary was good, your intro was not. I agree with mergirl007 in that it reads more like the initiation of an essay instead of the opening of a story.

*** Thanks for your input! This seems to be a reoccurring theme, so I'm definitely taking it into consideration.

Do you think it would be better to: - Change the format into something that sounds less academic - Outsource the link as commentary - Scrap it entirely

**** Truthfully, I'm not entirely sure you need it. The questions your introduction poses could be answered within your story, either through the plot, or through character interactions of why certain characters act the way they do, why they are who they are, etc. This would engage the reader as well as capture their attention in the nature vs. nurture match you set up. It's also important to try and let your characters do the speaking in your story; don't let your own voice drum into their dialogue.

Also, I looked over some of your chapters and I'm not sold on the idea of the 'Interactive Question' you have set up at the end of each chapter. I'd wager that many readers will either ignore the question, or not even answer it. Your writing is solid and is definitely attractive, so good work there.

***** Thank you! I think I'm probably going to end up scrapping it. As for the interactive question, I just added it (I'm revamping) and so far about three quarters of reviewers since then have answered it, so I'm probably going to keep it for now. I like being able to hear the opinions of other Potterheads regarding controversial or limited topics.
