This issue is something I've been thinking about recently, and I thought it might be a good topic for discussion.

Obviously the Harry Potter universe is written by a British native, and as such, I think many people who write fanfiction feel that they also have to write it in British (I'm going to refer to it as British vs American) simply because they feel it should be so.

I myself have grown up reading, writing and speaking American and I can definitely see the differences between British and American, but I /way/ prefer properly written American fanfiction over poorly done British.

Case in point: any story written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2638737/TheEndless7][TheEndless7]]

His/her stories are all in American, but they're properly written. They have clear plots, the characters interact with each other in a normal way.

I'm by no means a literature snob, but it seems like people write their stories in British because they feel they're obligated, and it loses some of its shine because of it.

Thoughts?


** I don't care about the narrative. Dialogue, however, makes a difference, because word choice and spelling are frequently associated strongly with a certain accent. If I read American English in dialogue I'm imagining the character with an American accent.

*** i agree that its mainly about dialogue. the character live in the uk so they are supposed to speak british english. if harry, hermione, ron and co speak american english it makes me imagine them in a different way and ruins immersion

**** Perfectly normal for kids (and I assume you were a kid when you first read HP) to imagine things using what they're familiar with, even in the face of obvious clues to the contrary.

When I first read PoA I pictured Cho Chang as white...

** The thing is, making a story British is not that difficult. Plug-ins like Grammarly take care of the spelling while a little research (Google) takes care of the biggest issues like geography and basic legal framework.

I'm not expecting that every author looks up the history of medieval Europe because they think that the magical population would not care about muggle borders or spent an hour going through Wikipedia to figure out which plane was used for Heathrow - > Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in 1995. On the other hand, using Google Maps to see that it would be difficult for Harry to walk from Privet Drive to Kings Cross should be feasible for everyone.

** I try to be patient but it irks me tbh because it breaks my immersion. I don't blame the author for this at all, I completely understand that it's really hard! But if I feel like they're not even trying to make the characters and story sound British it really turns me off the story, far more than of they get it clumsily wrong.

*** Yeah for me it's the complete opposite.

I do appreciate authors who do British properly, but it grates on me when it's British and it's wrong. Even more so if it's an author that isn't British speaking.

** Honestly, I'm british and from very nearby where Rowling was born and I'm a bit confused by some of the 'british' language that I've never heard spoken but is used in the books. I guess people tend to emphasise it even more and also assume everyone has a London accent.

** Im currently writing a story, and its definitely in American. However there are elements of British culture. For example British history is involved, and the use of mate, mum and kippers are all there. For me, its simpler to write that then it is to not you know?

*** Makes sense to me. So long as the write fully understands British and is capable of writing it, I have no issue with it.

Just when it's an American speaker trying to /sound/ British, you know?
