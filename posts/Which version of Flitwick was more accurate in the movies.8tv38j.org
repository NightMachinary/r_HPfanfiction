The flitwick from movie 1-2 or 3-8? I personally always imagined him looking like he did the first two movies, since he looked older and wiser and it matched his personality in the books more,


** Didn't JKR request the switch to how he looked in 3-8 because his look in 1 & 2 didn't look right to her? Seems to answer this.

*** No. She did think the 1-2 design looked too /weird/, but 1), she said nothing about the age, and 2), the switch was independent from her feelings on the matter. What happened is that Flitwick /had/ no part in the /PoA/ movie, but Cuar√≤n decided to do Warwick Davis a solid and gave him a small part as a different character, the Choir Conductor. Then when Flitwick had to come in again in the next film, the director decided he liked the Conductor costume better for Davis and went with that ever since.

****** What Jo actually said was that there was no specific reason for her NOT to be black.

Hermione's description in the books - apart from bushy hair - is quite vague, so casting a black actress is, while probably unexpected, not directly contradictory to canon. You don't have to like it, and it doesn't mean that she's /definitely/ canonically black now (it can't, one of the things about a play is that the cast changes regularly) but there's no clear reason why a black actress definitely can't be cast in that role.

It's not like casting a Ron with black hair. That would be directly contradictory to something that's clearly stated.

********* Look, I don't care about Hermione being black in CC. When I first heard about it, I thought it was cool.

But this nonsense that JK never described Hermione's skin color in the books is ridiculous. I've even heard that JK herself said so, but that's patently ridiculous.

1. In every depiction on the book covers which has Hermione, she's white. JK obviously approved these images.

2. There's talks in this thread about Hermione "tanning", but those aren't the only words to describe the tan. In the book she's narrated as being "very brown". Which is fucking lol-worthy if you consider that she's potentially black.

3. In JK's own drawing's of Hermione, she's clearly drawn as a white character.

4. Several characters are described as being Black, but Hermione was never one of them.

5. Hermione isn't just described as being "pale", she's described sometimes, when she's fearful, of being "white faced".

6. I can't for the life of me remember when this happened, but I recall reading somewhere in the books that her skin was "ivory". It was in direct relation to the narrator remarking on how pretty she was which made me think it was in GoF, but I can't find it. /shrug

********* That's what I was thinking of. Maybe my young mind leapt to "white" because, well...

Maybe this is me being ignorant, but /can/ black people go pale? I've honestly never seen or heard of a black person paling, and I always imagined that their skin pigmentation would obscure it.

********** Yes, they can.

It doesn't look exactly the same as it would on a white face, but they can blush, they can go ashy or pale because they're ill or frightened...

It's just blood under the skin, and everyone has that.

It would also depend on how dark the person's skin pigmentation was. If Hermione is black, that doesn't necessarily mean /dark/. A lot of mixed race kids are quite fair, even though you can't miss their ancestry otherwise.

********* For the sake of argument, that could be in more metaphorical, in reference to paleness or 'going white', as in being shocked and your face drained of blood. Unless you have very dark skin, your face will look paler/more ashen in response to being terrified.

I actually don't believe that JK had anything in her mind other than a light skinned woman when she wrote Hermione, but does that really matter? Her race has no bearing on her character or plot either way.

************ The latter I can agree with; the characters are somewhat OOC at time; but I see Hermione as Minister as a natural development.

************** I don't think she'd really need to have the diplomacy required by real-life politics. For one thing, she's a hero of the Second Wizarding War; I think Harry, and even Ron, would also have stood a /very/ good chance of being elected if either had become a candidate, regardless of whether they had any talent for leadership /or/ politics. And secondly, being Minister of Wizarding Britain doesn't require the same sort of skills as being the president of a real-life democracy, because of the much smaller population. It's more like getting elected mayor, in term of how many people you have to convince to vote for you.

** I definitely thought of him as old, and /plucky/ --- the later films' Flitwick looks too stern and... ordinary. Flitwick should be quirky and charming. That being said, the old design didn't make him look quite /smart/ enough; he is, after all, the Head of Ravenclaw. In the end, I have latched on to [[https://www.encyclopedie-hp.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/08/flitwick_bust2.jpg][this illustration]] as my go-to mental image of Flitwick, and am very happy with it.
