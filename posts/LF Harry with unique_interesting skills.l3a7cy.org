I'm looking for some reasonably long (>60k) fanfictions where Harry has some interesting skills or abilities. Preferably set in Pre-Hogwarts or Hogwarts time. Also preferably not Dark Harry but grey-ish is fine. Some examples of what I'm talking about are:

linkffn(7619993) - Calculation

linkffn(5782108) - Methods of Rationality

linkffn(12461030) - The Tinkerer

Also, fics where Harry is a metamorphagus or young animagus or something like that are cool as well.


** The Accidental Animagus: linkao3(14078862) Harry becomes an Animagus at age 5, and learns a little wandless magic before he goes to Hogwarts. Fair warning: It does make use of the "11 year old politicians" tropes, but it's one of the few fics that hasn't completely turned me off of reading with them.

We, Harry Potter has... Well. You don't get much more interesting as an ability than "permanently turn into a multi-headed dragon". It's not at all like your examples, but it definitely qualifies for "Harry with interesting abilities", and given the last sentence of the request I think you might like it. linkffn(12610360)

Victoria Potter by Taure is a fem!Harry with a significant talent for magic in general, and Metamorphmagus abilities: linkao3(13795605)

If you're okay with another person being the protagonist, there's The Arithmancer: linkao3(10070079) Hermione is an Arithmancy prodigy in this one.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (Mostly fluff, no character bashing.)

*** I think what makes The Accidental Animagus work is that the villains have been level grinding too. It's all very well to avoid antagonizing Professor Snape, and being able to turn into a small cat, but when the other side is infiltrating Hogwarts with an army of werewolves and recruiting a whole team of Voldemort-level dark sorcerers, the cat won't be enough.

**** Yeah, that really helps with the power-level thing - if everyone's more powerful and not just one side of the conflict, then the conflict still works.

The overtly-politicking children might still be a turn-off though.

** Well, potions talent isn't all that extraordinary, but linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) does some interesting things with it. More unconventionally, Harry delves a lot into exploring her mindscape and finds that she can use connections between people's magical cores as a backdoor into their minds.

** Have you read linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down)? It's absolutely fantastic. And adventure story set in the first war. Harry learns so real badass magic, the war is a bit different so there's new problems to solve. He does some vigilante work. It's completely fantastic.

In linkao3(Swung By Serafim by Flamethrower) Harry loses all his memories after CoS and starts again. He gets smart, good at Potions, becomes an Animagus. It reminds me of Methods of Rationality because it's HP if Harry wasn't a dumb idiot the entire time. Very well written.

They're the two that spring to mind anyway 😊
