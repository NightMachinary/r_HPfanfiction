** You must be reading a lot of smut fics. Cause most of the harry/fleur or harry/aged up Gabrielle fics ive read tend to have it be that thats how a lot of the world or how pureblood culture sees them when in reality theyre not. A good example is happily ever after by jeconais. Gabby mentiond that all the beliefs about veela(always perfect without a hair misplaced etc) are rumors started by jealous women. That veela guaranteed good genes but it still to a lot of work to maintain.
