I don't care about pairing. Well written. Funny if it can be. Thanks


** The one that I like best, involving a metamorphmagus Harry is the one by Marauderlover7, where Sirius breaks out of Azkaban early and takes him from his relatives when he's 8&1/2 and so he started teaching him all about magic and his parents long before he ever got his letter to Hogwarts...

Start with Innocent and then the next one is above it, but it's stuck on the Goblet of Fire, after the Quidditch World Cup, and I'm not sure if they are going to finish it out:

*** I'm gonna have to re-read this series, since I must have missed that bit where he's a metamorph. Oh well, it's a good'n. Them fake outs, am I right?

Also, it's pretty current. Updated about 4 days ago.

**** I'm sorry... I just reread your question... He becomes a animagus, not really a metamorph, like Tonks, which is what you were looking for, right?

** linkffn(10516162)

The classic.

There are also several NSFW stories where Harry is a metamorph, but they are mostly trash about inflated dicks. There's one where he is de-facto genderfluid and a law forces him to have sex in both forms, but that one has so much bullshit politics and bloating content that it is best not to bother. Also, Rule 5.

  Harry decided that the only way he can win this war with his sanity intact is to train his own way without interference. But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.

** I know there's linkffn(Morphed Secrets), a Severitis, Snape/Tonks.

There's the R-Series by Regulus, a slow-burn Harry/Tonks (she's de-aged by the narrative), linkffn(2008185). He is one, but it barely comes up, if at all, at least in the first three years (I just like the story, so I linked it).

*** I was really enjoying the R Series but had to stop after book five. I was just planning on taking a break but haven't felt like finishing it. I hated how it seemed like Harry, Tonks, and Leon all got plot-induced stupidity just to break Harry and Tonks up and create drama, and to push the plot forward by Harry being easily manipulated by Voldemort due to his lack of sleep because he didn't have a cuddle buddy. Like, I get what he was going for, but all three of them are smart enough to realize what was happening, so tgere was no reason for the three of them to be fighting, yet that's what the entire plot for the end of that book hinges on. End rant.

**** Ooh, that's something to look forward to, since I'm only just about to finish Azkaban myself. So far, this one's a diamond in the rough for me, since a lot of longfics I find tend to be abandoned.

***** I guess it's a good thing I didn't spoil it too much, then. The plot point that I was referring to is definitely foreshadowed and I saw it coming, but it still annoyed me enough to stop reading. Let me know what you think when you get to it, maybe another person's perspective will convince me to continue with the series.
