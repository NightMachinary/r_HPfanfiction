I wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12098960/1/Trolling-the-Toad][Trolling the Toad]] because I like fics where Harry messes with the inhabitants of Hogwarts, simply because he feels like it for comedic purposes and I wanted to attempt my own.

I'd appreciate some recommendations for more although I'd rather avoid the usual suspects, as I've read a lot of the more popular ones already.

Minimal bashing, please. Pairings and ratings don't matter and I don't care too much if it goes into cracky territory.


** linkffn(The Closer You Look) has a Harry who messes with people. Not perhaps as sadistic as trolling but similar.

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results. A seemingly simple step pitched his life into a direction no one had ever expected. Harry Potter, the Jack of all trades and Master of Misdirection. Intelligent! Harry.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Seven years is a long time. Especially when you have to do it twice. You know what you have to do and you think you know how you'll do it, so what can you do in the meantime? Live up your family legacy of course. It's time for a changing of the guard; the Marauders time is over, now it's time for Potter Club to step up

** The obvious answers to me are the Where in the World Is Harry Potter trilogy ( linkffn(2354771) ) and The Dark Lord's Equal ( linkffn(6763981) ) but outside of that, maybe look at A Jaunt Through Time ( linkffn(9191701) ) and Boredom is Deadly? ( linkffn(11305455) )

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  For Harry, the 'next great adventure' isn't really all that great. After two-thousand years of dealing with the whining souls of the dead, he decides to spice things up a bit...by returning to his first year at Hogwarts. Crackfic! MOD!Harry Darkish!Harry GaryStu!Harry with a twist. NO Bashing!
