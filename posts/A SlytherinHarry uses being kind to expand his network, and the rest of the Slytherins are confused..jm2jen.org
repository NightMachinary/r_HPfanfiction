One of linkao3(17818757)'s ideas with it is this: Slytherin!Harry Potter managed to confuse his roommates and Malfoys by being nice. This prompt will focus squarely on a very friendly Slytherin that when it's time for him to act, everyone comes to his aid and the "traditional" Slytherins are very confused on how the "niceness" act managed to make the whole school, including younger Slytherins, fight for him.


** Everyone is impressed and scared that he's managed to build a network in such a short time-frame, thinking that he's using tactics and the like they can't see (until he drops the hammer, but they don't want to see the hammer, so...)

In reality, Harry's just being nice. There's no ulterior motive: it's just that Slytherin is so damn paranoid about everything, they expect he's doing something he's not.

  Hari Potter was a quiet girl, though everyone seemed to intentionally forget the 'girl' part. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia called her 'boy' all the time, and Dudley too. All it seemed to take was baggy clothes, and none of the neighbors noticed. What if people continued to 'not notice'? What if the castle of Hogwarts went along with it? Hari Potter grew up as Harry Potter, and no one noticed. What happens when she wants someone to notice? This is the Slytherin take
