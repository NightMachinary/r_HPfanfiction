Not just AU, but like a supercharged AU on crack.

Like they take the premise of magic and the Wizarding World and Hogwarts and then just write an entirely new story with new characters and new conflicts, plots, etc?

(Fics that have the same characters but have Voldemort dead for good and so the plot is based on something else entirely are also welcome.)

Long, well written fics appreciated. Something with good world building.

I've just read too many fics where we start with 11 year old Harry and the rehash the same old timeline.

​

Edit: thank you all for the thoughtful comments!


** Try linkffn(2488754). It is basically a completely original story starting after book 6 in which some minor characters which has a minor crossover with the Harry Potter series later on.

** Is the ao3 linkbot working? If not Ill edit this post.

If your willing to read something very dark linkao3(Manacled) is very good. It's essentially The Handmaid's Tale but with Harry Potter people? They lose the war effectively. Voldemort is barely in it but it's still just terrifying. It's really very dark and heavy but if that's something you'd enjoy then this is really very good. It's the most AU thing I've read that still has all the same magic of Potter.

I'm reading linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) at the minute and this has a whole different plot to the books. Harry is sent back in time to the 70s but doesn't do the "Find the Parents" thing. He ends up living with Aberforth in the Hogs Head and running an underground vigilante ring during the war? I've no idea how it'll end but it's not following any HP plot I've ever read before and I've read a lot. There's pirates and criminal gangs and smugglers and vampires and all sorts it's great! A lot of OCs.

And (because it's me) I'm going to recommend linkao3(Of A Linear Circle by Flamethrower) because they take Harry Potter and throw out Harry Potter and then take their time fixing all the inconsistencies and adding in waay more lore and politics and secret societies and titles and war mages and laws and lands and family trees and lineages than anyone could possibly need in a story and it's flipping brilliant and I love it 😊

** Supercharged AU on crack sounds like a job for [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]]...

Starfox5 has a bunch of great stories set in a wizarding world with a few differences, they use the same worldbuilding across all the works. For example we see the civil war in Quebec mentioned in the background in several fics. A few of the stories are set in the "defeat Voldemort" setting, all with very big differences to canon, and several others are in the "we defeated Voldemort, what now" setting.

The latest one, Linkffn(The Granger Principle), is set almost a decade later in the early 2000s. It's even more AU than the other ones, with all the familiar characters but with some big differences.

There's several other stories with very different themes. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) is a heist fic about burglars versus death eaters, Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution) is a war fic, Linkffn(Democracy by Starfox5) is post war politics, Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) is guerilla warfare, Linkffn(Returned, Reformed and Really Trying) is Grindelwald crack, Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl who walked on water) is.... weird, Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) is a spy romance, Linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider) is Indiana Jones / Tomb Raider style archeology adventure, and there's more.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

I don't know how well it fits your criteria, but I randomly found this while bored and it's probably my favorite hp fanfic.

The MC is an OC, there are characters from the listed crossovers but the world is HP.

It's definitely not for everyone though, mainly because of incest and evil-ish mc but I found it super interesting for some reason.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Wastelands of Time is probably one of the bigger AU fics I know that haven't already been mentioned (AU to the point that it's basically only Harry Potter because of the names of the characters and the things they shout while casting spells at each other). It's pretty good, if a little odd at times. It is still Harry fighting Voldemort, yes, but the setting, plot, and concept behind it is so completely different that I think it fits that criterion. :)

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
