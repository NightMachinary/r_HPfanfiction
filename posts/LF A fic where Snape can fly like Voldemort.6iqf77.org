It might have been a Snape re-do fic, but the detail I remember is that Snape can fly as a student (not as a Death Eater).

I know this is vague, but [[/r/hpffn][r/hpffn]] really knows its stuff.

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.
