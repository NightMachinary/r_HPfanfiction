** Come once again and love me by laventadorn

After Snapes death, he gets sent back in time, as does Lily after her death (to their sixth year Christmas hols). There is no explicit content. It's basically a slow burn romance.

The characters are so on point it's a breath of fresh air. Lily has a personality and isn't just a Hermione+Percy. It's the fic that made Snape/Lily seem plausible to me. linkffn(7670834)

Past's Player by The Fictionist

Harry gets sent back to 1942. No slash.

It's the prequel to Fates Favourite and equally brilliant. Tom is a controlling manipulative bastard. The OC's are pretty good too. linkffn(5736901)

I tried checking if these hadn't been recommended but I'm not 100% certain. Hope I helped.

  Getting stuck in 1942 was bad. Getting put into Slytherin was even worse. Having Tom Riddle practically stalk him? Harry hated his life. Prequel to Fate's Favourite. [ABANDONED.]

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

linkffn(8581093; 10772496; 11494764; 11655125; 10871795; 8233539) - I'm sure I'm missing some but those are the ones I've read recently! (Note: Divergence is actually a (spoiler) dimension travelling story, but I mean, Hermione also gets sent back in time so, I think it still fits.

not an actual Harry/Tom or Voldermort romance story. It's more of a, Harry goes back in time, adopts Tom, and everything else is adorable and Lord Black is a creepy pervert.

edit: Also, the fanfiction that made me want to read the original series to fill in the blanks of the story in my head :')

P.S. I dived in with only the bits and pieces to know the gist of the HP plot and came out of the entire fic loving it and wanting to know more of the wizarding world <3

** Harry Potter - Three to Backstep linkffn(10766595) It's a Reptilia28 challenge fic, but in my opinion, it's one of the better ones, it's a good story, with good pacing, and although the romance is rather lacking, it's a fun ride from start to finish. Harry, Hermione, and Daphne Greengrass all travel back in time. Dumbledore and Weasley (RW/GW/MW) Bashing

Harry Potter and the Last Chance linkffn(11922615) -An in progress fic,but probably one of the best Reptilia challenge fics. Harry goes back alone in this one, with its fair share of changed things, a far better romance than most Reptilia challenges, and Weasley bashing that doesn't drag on until the end of time.

  ONE-SHOT. Vernon Dursley is not willing to take Harry to King's Cross, so that he has to find another way to get to Hogwarts for the Sorting. However, something is strange about this Sorting - and it will have far reaching consequences, even for Albus Dumbledore :D. Completely AU!

  Harry was massively disappointed in how things were going after the final battle. Nothing had changed, it only looked like it on the outside. So he decides to change the past to prevent certain things from happening. Being the Master of Death has its perks. Time-travel, Harry / OC

** I think *Many Thanks* is Hermione alone, only from James' POV.

*Spectrum*, linkffn(9561455), is only an one-shot, but is pretty much the only fic where Hermione travelled back to Tom's era and killed off Tom Riddle.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/805856/chapters/1520166?view_adult=true][nightmare]]

The writing is breathtaking. A lot of confusion and whiplashes. Like I have to reread and reread and reread it, because /the hell is going on./ Hermione's portrayal is pretty great and she takes it well considering the impact of the war and losing everyone and having taken to the past wherein there is a young Oldsnakeface.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082/chapters/6126311][tea and no sympathy]]

Not sure, if it qualifies as time travel? More like time loop, but I think the story is amazing enough that it'd suffice. There's soooo many things I love about this. Draco's characterization is the most perfect and true to canon I've read. He's pretty cowardly, spiteful, and says mean things. But yet I can't help but be sympathetic towards him. The pacing is so gradual, how everyday Draco falls more in love with Harry. The tone fits the mood very well, as each day passes by I can feel the urgency and his frustration. His world doesn't revolve around Harry, though. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the realm of the story is beyond most fanfictions I've read.
