** Not read it (been on my to read list for years though) but given that it hasn't been updated since 2006, and the [[http://www.greyblue.net/MidnightBlue/story.php?storyid=2][website I found for it]] hasn't been updated since 2010, I think it's safe to say the fic's abandoned.

** [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Mirror_of_Maybe]] links to it on [[http://greyblue.net/MidnightBlue/story.php?storyid=2]] and it seems to be there. If somebody downloaded it, I would love to get it.
