*** "Can I take an inheritence test," Harry asked the Goblin.

"Does this look like St. Mungo's to you?" asked the Goblin. "We are a bank. I've been told you were raised by muggles, but I doubt they go to HSBC for a paternity test."

"So I need to go to St. Mungo's to find out if I am related to Godric Gryffindor and Merlin and the Peverells?"

"What are you hoping for? That there are some unclaimed riches they left behind for you? Use your bloody mind, Mr Potter. There are twenty thousand wizards in Britain. Gryffindor and Merlin and the Peverells lived a thousand years ago. Every single witch and wizard who is not muggle-born is their descendent."

"So are you telling me that there is no fortune Dumbledore is keeping from me?"

"How do you get that harebrained idea? Dumbledore has a Philosopher's Stone. If he wants unlimited gold, he has no need to rob orphan boys."

** linkffn(A Game of Chess by Kirinin) /kind of/ has this, but saying it has that is a bit of a spoiler. It's not the best story by any means, but it's decent.

  The war is all but over, and the wrong side won. Worse, the Wizarding World's hero and Ron Weasley's best friend died in the fight. When Draco Malfoy offers Ron a way to go back and fix things, he jumps at the chance. But can he anticipate how his changed moves will affect the board? How long can a king masquerade as a pawn? [Trope stew: read the authors' notes.]

** Honestly most WBWL stories do this, even though the WBWL isn't actually ever named Harry, He's still arrogant and attention seeking, basically canon Harry if Snape was right about him.
