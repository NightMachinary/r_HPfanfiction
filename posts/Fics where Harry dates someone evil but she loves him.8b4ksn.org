  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG

Daphne is literally mentioned in like one sentence in canon. Pansy however, could certainly be called a minion of Malfoy. Being cruel, a bully, and wanting to send Harry to Voldemort is definitely fucked.

************* I'd understand if she married anyone other than Ron. I'm not familiar with genetics that much, but I'm pretty sure it's hard to have a kid with both red hair and black skin since both are considered dominant traits.

The way Rowling responded to that criticism was "Well, Hermione /could/ be black as I didn't specifically write Hermione as white" nevermind the fact that there have been multiple blatant points about Hermione being white. That's where part of my dislike for Cursed Child comes from; the other part comes from it being considered canon while breaking all established rules of lore.
