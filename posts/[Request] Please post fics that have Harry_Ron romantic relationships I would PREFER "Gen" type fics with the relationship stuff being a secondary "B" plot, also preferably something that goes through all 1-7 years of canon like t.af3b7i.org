#+TITLE: [Request] Please post fics that have Harry/Ron romantic relationships? I would PREFER "Gen" type fics with the relationship stuff being a secondary "B" plot, also preferably something that goes through all 1-7 years of canon like this with MINOR AU changes of any sort! Please and thank you!

Yes please read the title, I'm kind of tired of seeing Harry/Hermione tags and requests all the time, and I'm interested in seeing stories about Harry/Ron instead! Best friends who become best friends in love. :) Does anyone have any stories that can fit my criteria? I'll accept stories even if they only LOOSELY fall under it, if I have to. I might even try writing the story I want to see myself, if nobody else has done it - or done it "good".

** Harry/Ron is surprisingly undershipped. I don't even have decent recs on hand, because usually by the time I find an acceptable fic that keeps it in line with their characters I've read through too much bad smut to remember to bookmark.

I think part of the problem is that 70-80 % of the time Harry and Ron would just be two bros who happen to occasionally kiss each other and argue about who hogs the sheets more. Many people don't even do a good job at portraying their friendship because for some reason Ron is a slippery character to write for most writers, so in a way it is probably a good thing he doesn't end up as Ron in name only, Harry's other half.

WHY is this a problem? :( Isn't this how healthy, normal relationships are? At least that's what my older sister tells me about HER relationships; that she's basically just got a really good friend she can watch TV with and play video games with, except she gets to kiss them and have sex sometimes too. She says they're just two people who like to be together, sometimes in extra ways than usual.

This would be the most accurate, normalized freaking LGBTQ relationship to ever exist if people just wrote it that way. It's how I write all MY story relationships, based off seeing my sister's.

  Harry's sent reeling when he learns that Professor Snape is his bio dad, and if that were all he had to deal with, he'd probably be all right, but he's got werewolves, escaped convicts, a stubborn Dark Lord, and his own inner demons to deal with. Starts third year. Rating mostly for violence. Story deals with mental health, bigotry and child abuse. See more notes inside.
