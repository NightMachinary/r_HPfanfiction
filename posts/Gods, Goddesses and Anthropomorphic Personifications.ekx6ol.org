Looking for novel-length fics in which worship of pre-Christian gods is integral either to the plot or to the world-building, or where a deity or other mythological figure plays a large part. I'm thinking of Death in the Black Queen series, all of the rituals in Yule Ball Panic, Snape's worship of Selene in Moon Fire.


** There's one I forget the name of where Harry has a bunch of different death Gods in his head. They all talk a lot and are generally rather kooky - being cooped up together for millennia will have that effect - and Harry starts to go a little mad alongside them. It was pretty fun.

** Linkffn(as good as death) - this one is interesting and if I remember correctly Harry here is gathering followers to become a deity, just like his daddy Death and aunty Destiny.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5936137]]) - this one... eh... good but... It has an interesting idea and it's well written. Death's subordinate fucked up and took Harry's soul when Death and Fate made a deal long ago about him surviving. Death feels guilty and decides to have his first vacation since the beginning of his existence and ventures into the mortal world to live as Harry Potter. Sounds very interesting, right? Why would I be so unsure about it? It's readable only up until the start of second year (if not earlier). The author got impatient and wanted lemons. The pairing is snarry. The result is disgusting. I understand that Death is millions years old and it's just his body that is 12 years old. And his body is very horny. It would be probably tolerable if only Death felt that way. But when Snape starts having wet dreams about mf 12 years old boy... WTF??? So. I advise you to read it until the end of the 1st year, then drop it and say "ah, it's so sad that it's unfinished". This part is really interesting. And I liked the interactions between deities.

  Or how Death lost Harry Potter's soul, had a small mental break and took a vacation. A vacation as the Boy Who Lived. Because irony.

  Death messed up his job at Halloween 1981 and now neither Voldemort nor Harry Potter are dead. As if that wasn't bad enough that noisy little brat appears to be able to see him. All of that was quite unexpected. Still it doesn't explain how he somehow found himself stuck to raise the baby. Alright, now that's just awkward. Complete (sort of)

  ...Don't necessarily make the master. If anything, it's the other way around. “The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, the Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows. Together, they make one Master of Death.”Except, Beatle the Bard was not quite right---and neither was Xenophilius Lovegood. Now Harry must find his own path as the Master of Death, all the while dancing a one-man tap dance between Death above and Death below. What's worse, unmaking and remaking the Hallows is only the first step.
