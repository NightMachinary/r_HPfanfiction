Dietics class took place in one of the sub basements. It was dark and colder here and would have been creepy enough without the pickled cancerous intestines, calcified hearts, and spoiled livers floating in glass jars all around the room.

Snape, like Flitwick started class by subtlety flexing as he paced the room and then taking role. And like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name. ‘Harry Potter, our new celebrity.'

‘You are here to learn the subtle science and exacting art of dietics' he began. ‘As there is little foolish calisthenics here, many of you will hardly believe this is useful. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering protein shake with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through the human veins, bewitching the muscle tissue, ensnaring the articular ligaments... I can teach you how to bottle muscle mass, brew glory, and even stopper geriatric tissue atrophy - if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.'

Snape flexed his impressive physique again, muscles rippling in the dim light. Then as Harry feared, his torment began. Snape turned his eyes toward Harry and barked out ‘Potter, what would I get if I combined creatine monohydrate and a infusion of dextrose powder?!'

Harry knee this! It wasn't rocket science. Every lifter did. But McGonagall has said not to rock the boat and play dumb. So he shrugged and said ‘I don't know sir'. Snape looked him with sneer of disgust that rivaled all others. And then after a pause Snape asked ‘Do you even lift bro?'

...Yes I wrote (stole / copy pasted) all of this to give you the mental image of the last lines. Cheers!
