Hello fellow nerds,

I am currently writing my first fanfiction and I don't know how it is going. I am around 30,000 words in and only three reviews. I would really appreciate the feedback here or through pm or a review to know what I can do better and if anyone likes what I am doing (Also if anyone likes it enough to be my beta please do so!)\\
A quick summary of where my story will be going.\\
Harry is not good at most wand based magic, nor will he ever be. I am planning on following a general outline of cannon until I feel like I have changed too much for it to continue. I will use primarily divination magic, followed by enchanting, then blood magic, and finally necromancy. The story will be told by Harry in third person limited, minus a prologue and epilogue at the end of each arc. It is a slow story focusing on character and world-building until much later. I have no pairing in mind currently.\\

  Harry Potter enters the wizarding world unaware of the dangers that lurk beneath the surface. Struggling in class, he can barely make a feather float, how can he fulfill the destiny everyone expects of him from this? His only hope in tipping the balance in his favor is to delve in the more esoteric magics. With a Harry Potter focused on divination, mind magic and necromancy.
