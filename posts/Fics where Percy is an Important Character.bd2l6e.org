Title says all really. Not a major fan of Canon Percy but The Secret Language of Plants is my all time favourite Harry Potter series and I started reading Percy Take the Wheel which both have fabulous expansions on his character.

He can be evil, good or neutral. Just as long as he is an important character (doesn't have to be the main character, he's not even present in the Secret Language of Plants until book 3 if I remember correctly). Just so long as he matters to the plot.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** linkffn(12181042) is Percy-centric (along with Bill/Fleur).

​

The author's got some other Weasley-centric fics so Percy has a chapter in them too, chapter one of linkffn(11544454) comes to mind.

** He has a much stronger than canon role in the Dangerverse series as well in the Both More Wondrous and Terrible series, iirc. But I haven't read either of those in a few years so I might be over exaggerating the plot. UT I'd definitely recommend looking into them as an option.
