I am currently finishing When Harry met Wednesday, and am enjoying the Addams family tied to Harry potter, but i feel it gives you a OC Harry<well it does>. And then i remembered the fic " No Competition" which had dark creature's attracted to the Horocrux.

â€‹

So an idea came to me. The Addam's come to Uk, for some reason and then decided to send thier two oldest to hogwarts. The kids sensing the great evil in harry take a shine to him, and Wednesday gets a crush, which starts unrequited but slowly harry likes her back.


** Everything about this is awesome

*** Just think about it. Harry unsure how to wct about it. The addams taking draco to task, how they affect the war. How does hermione deal with Wednesday's affections for harry and odd knowledge. The twins with pugleys. The whole muggleborn to hogwarts but know magics thanks to thie lives. < grandmom frump knew magics, thier magic allies etc>
