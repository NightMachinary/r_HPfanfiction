There is a pic that I think was on archive of our own that is driving me crazy because I can't find it. All that I remember is that it was a post-war fic, where Luna had found a specific type of bird that could play vinyl records by putting its beak so then and humming along with the vibrations. One of the songs was "everybody wants to rule the world" by Tears for Fears. Of course, there's another fic with that name, so I can't find the one I'm actually looking for. Please advise. I remember it being excellent, but I never bookmarked it.
