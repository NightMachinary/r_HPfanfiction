Hi, I've recently started writing Draco FanFic and I have already written 5 chapters. I'm happy with the plot etc. I've followed the HP plot loosely so far however I want to put it in the background as much as I can and focus on Draco's character development/story along side the love interest. I'm not sure on how people will take this upon reading it. I just find most Draco FanFic's can get too much about Harry quickly.

I guess I'm really asking for advice on how I could maybe promote the fanfic for people to read I know you should write for yourself and I am but it would be nice for people to see it and follow along too! I'm just not sure how to expand it to readers as there are so many Draco fics. I know I should use my social media however I'm not too sure on how I feel about people I know seeing my writing lmao.

I am also interested in hearing what other people want from Draco fics as like I said I find they become too much about other characters and you lose the main focus of the story. I recently read an excellent one but the last chapter had 20 out of 25 parts just about Harry. I also find they use too much of the film within the story and it becomes the script with the added extra of the protagonist

Let me know :)


** logistic wise you should publish on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and ao3. Once you have a few more chapters you can make a post about it here with the tag "self promotion"

Story wise good luck, but I am not convinced by the current plan. A big part of fanfics is to change the classical story, but here we know in advance how Drago will develop... I think it needs to diverge from books fairly quickly.
