It's a fic about a guy who stalks Hermione. The writing was really good because it explored the mind of the stalker. It was really dark and a bit psychological. I've been looking for it for a long time so if you know what fic this is, kindly give me a link? Thank you ever so much.

EDIT: The stalker was anonymous. He wasn't identified and was characterised as someone that no one really knew. I read it at livejournal


** linkffn(7550124) I remember reading this two years ago and not being able to get into it because of how creepy it was. There is some stalking throughout this fic but I'm not sure if it's what you're looking for as it has been so long since I've read it.

  Birds should be watched and not kept. But Draco never was one to obey rules, now was he? It's their sixth year. Draco still hates Hermione, but finds he's becoming obsessed with her. Really dark. Non-con situations.

  I have not read this one. Will read later. The stalker in that fic was anonymous. No one really knew him
