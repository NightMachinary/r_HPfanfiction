I love the idea that transfiguration stays for a long time because it's changing something even if it is only “surface level” for lack of a better term. I feel like the changes are complicated things especially human transfiguration. I also like the idea of general spells that are much more difficult to do and you have to have an image of what you want and a strong focus on it as well as a basic understanding of what you want but not that you have to understand how the organs inside work.


** Should be permanent, right? You're transforming one object into another, there's no reason it should wear off. The whole 'changing stuff at a superficial level' is a thing is fanon AFAIK. There's a whole island of transfigures monsters that's been around for decades.

On the other hand, Conjugation is different, since you're using magic to create an object out of nothing.

*** I mean surface level as in if you change a rock into a piece of candy it looks, tastes, smells, feels like a piece of candy but is truly a rock. That's the role I like to imagine of alchemy with it truly changing things but it is much more complicated.

***** My headcannon is that's why you can't make food from nothing/transfigure inedible into edible is because at its base it isn't truly changed. I also could see someone changing vegetables into a cake for instance and it be a cake with all the perks of the vegetabless

But what does that mean, "at its base"? This is a weird statement, because it presumes that there's something else going on. I feel like this is a bleed over from other stories where magic isn't permanent. I don't think its ever established that food cannot be transfigured from non-food objects.

To quote JKR: "With a transfiguration you change its nature completely; the molecular structure alters..."

******* But you can't make food from nothing or transfiguration if I remeber right if you don't have food. If it truly changed an object to that point you could take a rock and make an apple to eat. It would also raise the question on why alchemy is needed to make gold.

******** Who says you can't make food from transfiguration? The exception is with CONJURATION, which is a different branch of magic.

We don't know why gold cannot be transfigured, but that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with transfiguring food? For all we know, gold is just inherently difficult to affect with magic or something.

********* Why would wizards and witches have gardens or anything when they could transfigure it from dirt? Why would the trio not transfigure it when they were starving? Conjuration is not inherently different from transfiguration I think. You're making something from nothing as opposed to changing something to something else. In the gamps law wiki “It should be noted that while food cannot be outright created from nothing, it can be multiplied if one already has some food to multiply, it can be enlarged or the food can be summoned if one knows the approximate location and is fairly sure the food will still be there.[1] It should also be noted that while "good food" cannot be conjured, consumable liquids such as sauces,[2]wine,[3] and potable water can be,[4] as they are not nourishing substances. “ Food wouldn't be good is what I am saying. You can make pigs with conjuration but they won't be nourishing. You can turn a desk into a pig but it would have the nutrients of a desk. Why would the philosophers stone be so big a deal if it was simple to make true gold from something else.

********** Because not everyone is good at it? Why is any industry a thing in Harry Potter when anyone can learn magic? Just because you can transfigure food, doesn't mean you're going to practice enough to be able to do much with it. Transfiguration is noted at being the most difficult branch of magic. There's no reason the average wizard would be able to transfigure a full meal if they don't focus on it.

​

Nothing in what you just said mentions transfiguration. It's specifically Conjuration. Transfiguration is altering matter at a molecular level. Conjuration is making shit appear out of nothing. There's a fundamental difference there. Gold is a weird exception, and that's noted in HP. There's nothing about other metals, so there's just something different about gold.

I can make my own sofa, but it's a lot easier to just buy one.

** I think that transfiguration can be made temporary (reverts after some time) or permanent depending on the spell used since both have their use cases. But even with the best permanent transfiguration it still 'remembers' the original shape and can be untransfigured without knowing exactly what the original was, which is why animagi can be untransfigured with a simple spell. It is also why a rock transfigured into food isn't edible, transfigured uranium isn't fissile and why you can't just transfigure lead into gold. Alchemy is a more advanced art that allows complete transformations that cannot be reversed, but it is much more difficult and requires catalysts. The Philosopher's Stone is a very advanced catalyst that can be used to create gold and elixir of life and possibly a few other things. A different alchemical catalyst may make the creation of edible food possible.

** In my headcanon every single magical person has their own innate resistance to magic, so any transfigurations cast on them will eventually run out after a while as their own magic "attacks" the foreign magic affecting their system, like antibodies attacking a virus.

Muggles consequently lack this innate resistance so transfigurations cast on them would be permanent. That's why there are strict Muggle Baiting laws in place to prevent this.

As for conjuration? It depends on the complexity of the object in question and the power used in the casting, as well as laws of physics. Which means you can conjure water and its safe to drink because there is already water everywhere, the air is full of minute, trace amounts of it, unless you are in a very dry environment. However food is another matter, conjured food would lack any calorific content and would just be flavoured air given temporary solid form.

A wizard or witch, given enough power could conjure a chair and have that chair be permanent, but only powerhouses like Dumbledore and Voldemort could pull that off. Anyone else and the chair would disappear eventually.
