I want to have Buffy be in my new story but having her there she would believe she's in a hell dimension and i've already used her as a love interest in stranger in a strange land.

So, suggestions? No anime characters.

Edit: i'll be using ciri for my hp/fallout|elder scrolls fusion story!

** Harry/Galadriel. Never seen it.

I think I may have posted this before, but I've had a plot bunny for some time, where Harry travels to ME and makes his way into Lorien and is completely smitten with the Lady. So he seduces her and steals her away from Celeborn (Gal is very bored running the forest and whatnot). They make their way to Cirdan and steal a ship. Then they sail up and down the coast, freeing slaves (who become their crew), battling pirates, looting evil lords and evading, a)the outraged elves who think the Lady was kidnapped, b)The servants of the enemy, c) Some Maia who also want to rescue the lady/want to know who tf Harry is.

Any takers?

** Harry/Lara Croft: There are a severe lack of Tomb Raider crossovers.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sun Queen by Steelbadger)

Harry/fem!Shep: There are plenty of HP/ME crossovers, but for some reason, almost none of them feature Harry/fem!Shep. I've tried to figure out how this would play out, but I don't think there's enough room in the Galaxy for both Harry and Shepard to reach their full potential.

*** I was debating her in fact. Considering how often she comes across mystical whatsits, it would easily work.

Every hp/me i've read has been harry/fem!shep where harry's humanity's first choice for spectre but he decides he doesn't want it until she shows up and then he's tripping all over himself to be in her group and every fuckup like cerberus has been usinf harry's stolen tech or prototypes like biotic control implants and he saves the day, all in the hopes that she'll tickle his tonsils.

I'd be supremely surprised if I haven't read every half-decent HP/ME crossover and none of those feature Harry/fem!Shep.

I guess I'm limiting the pool of fics to those that are good enough to actually read. If you extend the search criteria to include anything that denotes a Harry/fem!Shep pairing, then your statement holds

Edit: I take that back, linkffn(Beyond the Veil by NaniteSystems) could /generously/ be defined as half decent and apparently it becomes Harry/fem!Shep eventually (though I didn't make it that far before giving up).

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Ã‰owyn.

** Well if I ever do write a Harry Potter Star Wars crossover, my two favorite series, I'll probably have my female Harry get into a relationship with a few women in the Star Wars EU! Maybe Jaina Solo, maybe Tenel Ka, maybe Alema Rar pre-Yuuzhan Vong War PTSD mental illness/crippling injuries (which would probably get avoided altogether because female Harry would save her and avert her canon fate - OR she could be with her POST those things, but keep her on the light side and have it be about her learning to live and cope and adapt with it all while still being a Jedi), or if it's like prequel era I'd have her be with Padme Amidala, or maybe Shaak Ti or Ahsoka, or Ventress! If it's Old Republic-ish era I'd have her be with a female Revan or Bastila Shan, or Darth Zannah and turn her to the light side at a critical point in her books where she COULD HAVE but didn't.

And if it's like FOTJ era I'd probably have my female Harry romance a few Keshiri Sith women and get them to make the difficult decision to go against their own people, but maybe not necessarily be on the Light Side yet just to keep stuff interesting, like Mara's early books.

** A lot of my interests relate to various plot bunny's I have in mind usually involving Harry being stuck in another setting, but I would like to see... Harry/Star Sapphire (Green Lantern) Basically a less frilly magical girl, possibly from space, powered by love, interesting and compatible power set.

Harry/Stargirl (Stargirl / Starman) I like the Starman comics and think a wizard in Opel City would be a good fit.

Harry/Poison Ivy (Batman) The implication that wizards are less environmentally destructive than muggles and potential consequences of Ivy getting her hands on various magical plants is under utilized at best.

Harry/ an X-man (X-Men) So much fertile common ground, so few good stories.

Harry/(RWBY) It shouldn't be this hard to find a good crossover.

Harry/Angel (Borderlands) The idea of Harry stuck wandering Pandora is amusing to me and a long distance relationship with Angel could be sweet and keep the plot moving.

  When Arthas seized the Frozen Throne, he cast aside both his humanity and the remnants of Ner'zhul. The Guardian sealed away the spirit of the former Lich King in another world, entrusting them to Albus Dumbledore. Now, however, Ner'zhul has ensnared a new host: Lord Voldemort. With two worlds threatened, heroes are brought to Azeroth to cast down both Lich Kings once and for all.

** I'd actually be interested to see Harry paired with Star Butterfly, the protagonist from /Star vs. the Forces of Evil/, or one of the Butterfly princesses or queens (i.e. Eclipsa, Queen of Darkness).

In SVTFOE, Star is already shipped with the male lead, Marco Diaz, by most people. Marco is actually a lot like Harry in many regards in terms of personality and background; the only major difference I can think they have is that Marco wasn't born with magic, like Harry was. Instead, he got it from a magical bonding ritual or ceremony, linking him to Star's magic. This enables Marco to use Star's wand and perform spells as well, as he seems to tap into her magic to do so.

The Butterfly royal women are born with the natural ability to do magic, having specific court card / symbol cheekmarks that glow when they use it. They can also, through training, develop extraorindarily powerful nonverbal and wandless magical ability through travelling to "the Realm of Magic" (a separate dimension, from which magic from every realm flows from). I've theorized before that the Butterfly royals are actually probably similar to accounts of the Fae, Fair Folk, or fairies in real-life lore.

I think it would be very interesting to see a Harry Potter/SVTFOE crossover fanfiction where Star, instead of going to Earth, is sent to Hogwarts instead, as a part of Harry's class...or where Harry is sent to Mewni, Star's kingdom / dimension. Star is absolutely a Gryffindor, and I think she and Harry would learn a lot from each other, as well as become good friends...if not more.

Then... they aren't different species. If two individuals can create viable (that is, fertile) offspring, they aren't different species.

Superman vs Lois is entirely different... because it isn't a subtle difference. Superman is literally an alien. His species evolved on another planet entirely. Kryptonian and human similarities may suggest a recent common ancestor, but by no means are they the same species.

** Harry Potter and Maggie from TWD (can't decide if post-Glenn, or perhaps in the early days of the Governor conflict and kill Glenn off then or an amicable breakup before Harry and his team arrives). So takes place in TWD universe but Harry arrives with himself and a few familiar faces; post-DH, EWE-compliant, so perhaps a team of Harry, George or Percy, Padma Patil, Susan Bones, and perhaps some OC Slytherin (or just do Daphne because you can make her into whatever you want).

Some ancient curse from the magical world turned all dying people into Inferi, and Harry is part of a magical team being dispersed around the world to quell the uprisings. Stumble upon Rick and Maggie's group, inform them of magic and that Houngans who will soon be invading the states. Accelerated timeline of Maggie becoming a leader in the group (perhaps Rick's step-back is just a more permanent or more necessary move) leads to constant interaction with Harry. Could also see a Padma/Percy relationship that gets torn apart, Susan falling for one of the TWD guys. I'd love to work in that an original TWD character is a wizard or witch, just need to find the appropriate work-in. Michonne is the obvious, especially if story picks up around the time of the Governor. Real fun would be having Carl be a Muggleborn.
