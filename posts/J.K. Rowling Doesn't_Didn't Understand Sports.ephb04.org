/《I'm not a particularly "sporty" person but I grew up in a household that was and I feel a personal dissatisfaction towards this.》/

J.K. Rowling (at least at the time of writing HP) doesn't understand sports and Quidditch is the epitome of her lack of understanding.

Though I could bring up the Golden Snitch example as a valid criticism, the crux of my complaint actually comes from the Quidditch World Cup itself. Specifically the case that every four years a completely random team seems to win the cup. That's not how competitions work.

Odds on, for the most part, a team is going to be fairly similar and play fairly similar to four years on. However this is compounded by the fact that the magical world is a fraction of the rest of the world. Thus there cannot be THAT many people actually playing Quidditch.

Yet the lineup of the winners from 1990 is as follows:

▪︎ Canada (1990)

▪︎ Ireland (1994)

▪︎ Malawi (1998)

▪︎ Egypt (2002)

▪︎ Burkina Faso (2006)

▪︎ Moldova (2010)

▪︎ Bulgaria (2014)

With the exceptions of Ireland, Egypt and Bulgaria (which are directly linked to Viktor Krum) there is no rhyme or reason with this. She is whimsically giving the World Cup to any team she feels like giving it to. Contrast this with the Fifa World Cup, a tournament that also takes place every 4 years and also deals with teams all over the world. From 1990 we have:

▪︎ West Germany

▪︎ Brazil

▪︎ France

▪︎ Brazil

▪︎ Italy

▪︎ Spain

▪︎ Germany

▪︎ France

Notice something? Course you do, in that period both France, Germany and Brazil have won the world cup twice. Additionally, every team on this list (with the exception of Spain) has won the cup before as well.

Of course their are some wildcard victories every once in a while, underdog stories do exist in real life, but there is some form of consistency. The above are countries known for having strong football teams, the same should (and must) exist in the magical world because it is a common trend in sports.

It takes a LONG time to build a team. You need talent, then you need to train that talent, then you need to find a way to work the individuals of your talent into a cohesive unit that can work as one (hence why Ireland won the QWC in 1994 and not Bulgaria), then you need to have strategies and plays that best maximise the skills and abilities of your team whilst best countering the strengths of your opposition. And even then, sometimes it isn't enough, sometimes the opposition just does it better than you, sometimes the talent pool is too shallow, sometimes the team falls apart. One bad game can potentially ruin an entire season for any team.

Thus it doesn't make a lick of sense that a different team can win the QWC every single time.

*Tangent:*

/Mahoutokoro is supposedly a school that is big on Quidditch. They learned the basics of the game, trained up and dominated one year and won the Cup. How is Japan not a powerhouse in the Quidditch world after then? Their magical school is well known for their Quidditch reputation yet have precisely ONE QWC victory to their name (to our knowledge)./

It just doesn't work like that! Countries with that much national pride for something like sport (e.g. Brazil and football for real life comparison) often do well at an international level (e.g: Brazil, who've won the world cup 5 times).

It does not make sense to me and every time I think about it I get kinda vexed.

** Quidditch is so much more random than football tho. It's so easy for unexpected results to happen because of how many points the capture of the snitch awards the team. I don't think it's illogical to have different teams winning every year and football is a very bad comparison imo.

*** Quidditch is not a random game. With the exception of the Snitch it plays fairly similarly to most team sports games. There is the defense (Beaters and Keepers) and the attack (Chasers and Seekers), the pitch and goals are uniform, the balls are uniform, the players and positions are uniform and the points are uniform. Since wands are banned from games (thus magic can't be used) it isn't possible for the game to be random (or more random than football) as it is very clear how the game can/will be played.

The only way the Snitch would be that much of a deal breaker would be if the game didn't have Beaters and Bludgers to distract and injure Seekers who were going for it.

Because of this, you (as a coach, captain and team) can make plays, plot out games etc. The Snitch does not change my overall point because you would plan out games with catching the Snitch/the opposition catching the Snitch in mind. To use Bulgaria 1994 as an example, the Snitch caught in that game was irrelevant in the face of Ireland's Chasers. That would undoubtedly be a common tactic/result. Just as a team maximising their Seeker's chances at finding the Snitch to end a game quickly, which would in turn lead to counter-strategies (e.g. the Beaters dog piling the Seeker to knock them out of the air and stop them from ending the game).

150 Points is a lot, but Ireland were able to rack up 160 points in a (for Quidditch) relatively short period of time. Remember that Quidditch matches are known to go on for days at a professional level.

In the grand scheme, the Snitch is a non-entity. It's a dumb addition to the game (just to gift a team 15 goals) but it is not the be all and end all. Being 16 goals ahead of a team in a game like Quidditch (to ensure the Snitch doesn't matter) is a perfectly reasonable expectation to expect of a national team.

Thus the "random" element of the game is not random at all as it can be *EASILY* factored for before and during a game. You can win Quidditch games without catching the Snitch after all.

And because you can plan for it, you can train for it. You can train a Seeker to quickly find the Snitch, and train the rest of the team to support them in doing so. You can train Beaters to keep an eye on the Seeker and deal with them (and the other players). You can train Chasers to maximise goals so that they can get the 16 Goal lead.

Just as you can train Strikers to maximise goals. You can train Defenders to intercept before a ball comes into the box. You can train a Keeper to save the ball. It is the same principle because team games in sports (on a bare bones, foundational level) work the same way with superficial differences on the surface: e.g. Basketball, Netball, Rugby. It is all about a mix between physicality and strategy.

And if you can train for it (as you can in football) you can win. And you can consistently win if you do it well enough. Hence there should be teams who win the Quidditch world cup more than once.

**** I'm not saying the game of Quidditch is random. I'm saying it's random compared to football and that makes it a very misleading comparison imo. I'll elaborate further. Football is played under a fixed duration of time under mostly controlled conditions; the way Rowling puts it, Quidditch games are sacred and will be played regardless of any extreme weather conditions that may be present. Also, there is no fixed duration for a game. It could last a few minutes or days depending on the ability of the seekers to find and capture the snitch. In football you have subs, so if your keeper or striker are having a terrible day, you can always switch to someone else. In Quidditch, I don't think there's ever been a mid-game sub and if i remember correctly, when Harry was hit by a bludger and was knocked out cold, his team had to go on without a seeker. During the world cup Quidditch game, we had what i think you would agree was a case of absolute domination of one team over the other and even so, Bulgaria only lost by 10 points and the possibility of them winning was very real even when they were 15 goals behind because of how good their seeker was. That'd never happen in football. Even losing by 3 goals will almost always mean a loss. I think these cover the "random" elements I had in mind when I tried to compare the two sports in my head.

***** And again, I disagree:

▪︎ Football games have been played in some severe conditions.

▪︎ There are subs in Quidditch, it was mentioned in the same paragraph about games lasting days if I remember correctly. At the very least it was mentioned in the first book. Thus making Gryffindor team (a school team, as opposed to a professional one) more of an exception than a rule.

▪︎ The time limit discrepancy would make comparing football to any other game illogical. A real world example would be the NFL, which tend to 3 hours but can be shorter or longer than that. Just because the time played is different doesn't mean the games cannot be compared at all.

▪︎ Quidditch has no known time limit but it does still have a fixed point as to when a game is over. In this sense it is like shogi or chess, the game lasts until a certain piece (the king or the Snitch) is captured. Quidditch isn't actually unique here at all, it just incorporates a different rule as all games do.

▪︎ A game where one team comes back from an opponents vicious lead in the same game happens all the time in pretty much every sport. Just because Quidditch has an easier way than most games to make a comeback doesn't make it any different.

I understand your mentality, but you're wrong.

****** I still don't think subs are a thing unless maybe if a player is incapable of physically continuing, otherwise they would have been used strategically in official games, as they are in football (i highly doubt there wouldn't have been a single sub during that world cup game if there had been the option for one). So you agree that one has a time limit and the other doesn't. Chess isn't football. There have been football games of all sorts but they are outliers. Quidditch games' results depend stupidly too much on the capture of a single tiny evasive ball every single game. As a person who has been watching football since childhood i really can't judge the two with the same criteria so I guess we are gonna have to agree to disagree on this one.

******* If your player is still good to play, and he's a better option than the sub, why would you substitute them? And, again, the game does not rely on the Snitch. Both I AND JK Rowling have explained otherwise.

Like someone else commented here (in this thread) the only reason we have such an opinion of the Snitch is because Harry catches it so quickly. And every time HE catches the Snitch his team wins.

******** That's not how you use subs. You say Rowling doesn't understand sports and maybe she doesn't but u don't seem to understand them either. Depending on your strategy, you may or may not start with a team including all the "better options" and it doesn't even have to be a case of better options. The Bulgarian chasers were terrible during the world cup game. If there had been subs, even the most terrible coach in the world would switch at least one of them out and try something else in case something changes. Sometimes you keep your really good players for the second half to push when the other team's defenders are getting tired. It all depends on strategy. Strategy you can't have in Quidditch because of how unpredictable the duration of a game is. Ofc the golden snitch is important. It's worth FIFTEEN goals and it literally ends the game. Bulgaria was destroyed by Ireland and as i said they only lost by 10 points. Imagine in games between teams that were more similarly skilled. The only real comparison between Football and Quidditch is the hype around it.

********* I think you may have misunderstood my point/I didn't explain it very well. The Bulgarian team seemed to (not just then but afterwards) center around Krum. It very much appeared they were banking on Krum catching the Snitch to end the game quickly (hence why the goal difference ended up so narrow). Again, I reiterate, the Bulgaria vs Ireland game was a very short game in comparison to how long games can be (a QWC game once lasted for three days). If the game had lasted longer then perhaps there would have been substitutes, but it didn't. I've seen plenty of games where a team is getting absoloutely hammered but they don't bother subbing for whatever reason.

My little brothers play academy football, I've been sat near the dugout and seen a bunch of subs who sometimes get dressed up in their kit and don't even set foot on the pitch, even as our team loses.

And seriously, Quidditch is based, in some way, off of football. The goals, the players and their positions, tbe main portion of the game (that being played with the Chasers) is the same basic gameplay as any football or rugby game: a team attempting to make it to the oppositions end of the pitch with the ball to score, whilst the opposition plays defense and intervention so they can get the ball and do the same. J.K. Rowling is British, are you honestly gonna claim that when creating a sport she didn't look to the most popular in her country (and around the world) for inspiration? Inspiration you can clearly see in how the game is set up and played. On a fundamental, basic, level it is the same game just played differently (as is the same with Rugby, Basketball, NFL etc.) thus, AGAIN, they are comparable.

****** You say that football has been player in severe conditions but when you are literally FLYING through those conditions, it makes a world of difference. With heavy storms, your car trip might take a bit longer. With heavy storms, your flight might be straight up cancelled. You are entirely discounting the effect of being on a stick of wood in the air during those extreme weather conditions.

Subbing does happen. You mention Gryffindor being an exception but none of the House teams are said to have subs. Thus that is likely just a feature of either the writing, the fact that school games don't go long enough to need subs or that the school teams simply don't have them for whatever reason.

An NFL games has 4 15 minute quarters and rarely goes to overtime. So I have no idea what you mean by "it would a better example because it lasts 3 hours but could be longer or shorter." The only length added is in timeouts and Quidditch gets those as well. The 3 hours you quote is only understandable if you are talking about a televised viewing of the game. The game doesn't actually pause for commercial breaks.

You mention chess but fail to recognize that chess can be a game that takes 5 minutes or takes days to play. Except that chess is entirely based on the mental skill and strategy of the player. A game ends because 1 player made a mistake or a bad strategy. Not because someone got hurt. A game of chess doesn't require you to find the King to go after it. A game of chess doesn't operate in a way where there is 1 king to kill and it could appear directly next to one side's Queen while being on the other side of the board from the other player. Chess and Quidditch are similar ONLY in the way you state, that there is one object whose capture ends the game.

While come backs happen, for Quidditch, focusing on the Quaffle game isn't "coming back". It is a specific strategy. Coming back would imply that the team focusing on the Quaffle loses by a few points with the catching of the Snitch. Except, in many games, the score isn't likely that far apart. Sure, it can be. But the reality is, the Snitch is likely not viewed most of the time as a means of covering a deficit but as either the means to just end the game or as a last resort to winning. Since either Seeker could locate and capture the Snitch and end the game, there isn't much in the way of delaying a game ending to use it strategically. You can try but, again, due to randomness of seeing the Snitch and where it shows up, that is a hope at best, not a strategy.

The Irish team in the game referenced several times focused on their Quaffle game. They likely knew they didn't get Krum and Krum could very well end in the finals and they wouldn't stand a chance on that front so they focused on getting as amazing a Chaser/Beater squad as possible and effectively ignoring the Snitch, with their Seeker really only pushing Krum to catch it as soon as possible and not draw out the game to the point where they lose the lead. It is actually a reasonable strategy.

The fact is, you cannot compare Quidditch to muggle sports as there are too many variable things that only exist as a consequence of magic. These are things that also change the outcome of games enough that comparison to outcomes in muggle sports aren't comparable.

The ones I've been to usually run 3-3.5 hours at the stadium. The college football championship this last weekend was exceptionally long and ran 4+ hours.

The only game I can think of that is comparable with the capture-one-thing-and-win-the-game feature is capture the flag and still, since it doesn't have the quaffle scoring function, it's not too close a comparison.

**** Except that you discount just how random the Snitch is. The time frame of the game 100% depends on the Snitch. If a Snitch is caught 5 minutes into a game, there is a 0% chance the non-catching team would win. Honestly, without a fairly longish game, the chances aren't great.

Winning based on Quaffle goals and effectively ignoring the impact of the Snitch requires at least a bit of time and a heavy heavy focus on both Chasers and Beaters at the expense of a Seeker. While it is doable, the level of play in the World Cup wouldn't typically be that lopsided with regards to 5/7 of your team.

The Bulgaria/Ireland game seems more of a fluke than a common occurrence since it strikes me that they built a team akin to the Colts with Peyton Manning in American Football. They built a team around 1 position leaning on that person doing their job well enough to make up for a deficit in the rest of the positions. Peyton Manning got hurt at the beginning of a season and missed the entire season and they went from winning the Superbowl to winning 1 game that season Manning was hurt.

Bulgaria 100% relied on Krum catching the Snitch early enough to compensate for less talented Chasers/Beaters in their Quaffle game. I have a feeling within lore, while there are likely lots of examples of it happening that the Snitch isn't relevant to the final outcome, there are likely just as many where the Snitch was caught early enough that the Quaffle was largely irrelevant.

Additionally, another poster made a comment with regards to male/female physical disparity with regards to physical sports: this is another thing that doesn't matter with Quidditch which shows that you can't use normal sports as a guideline.

The poster was correct that in normal sports, a female is not likely to outdo similarly talented males. It is a simple fact of physiology. However, Quidditch doesn't care about that because there really isn't much physical in the game. The broom makes up most difference in speed. The fact is, for Chasers, it might actually make more sense that a strong female with good aim would be a far superior Chaser as they can navigate the field and typically weigh less thus potentially getting faster speeds out of their brooms. A closer analog would be car racing. Danica Patrick has shown that a woman can easily compete and win against males on an even playing field.

Also, as far as the teams changing so much, that can be explained as well. With the Bludgers being effectively metal cannonballs shooting around up there, it is easy to under that major injuries happen. Even if they can heal them, it is equally possible that a key player gets hurt just before a key game and is laid up in a hospital getting bones regrown or something.

Lastly, the timeframe you illustrate was while (at least in Europe) Voldemort was coming back to power. As they were effectively terrorists, depending on the stance of certain players, they could have become targets. As you mention, teams take years to get great at working together. You remove a couple players and a team can be set back to square one. Look at what Voldemort's rise to power did to the populations of students compared to the quoted population of Wizarding Britain during Harry's time. Rowling has said before that Hogwarts normally had about 1000 students (or something in that neighborhood). But during Harry's time, there were an average of 8-10 students per house per year. Putting the total population under 300. The first Blood War would explain why the numbers were so drastically different. A second Blood War could explain the why, during the 90's and up to present, the team composition could have changed greatly. The students in school during Harry's time would be the younger newer players during the 2000's. A much smaller pool of students means fewer choices of high caliber.

The reality is, because of the random, magical nature of the game coupled with it taking place primarily on brooms, you simply cannot use traditional sports as a guideline or basis for analyzing Quidditch. Couple that with what was going on during the times you mention and the times leading up to those timeframes and it can be explained why things seem so crazy and chaotic and unlike traditional Muggle sports.

I think another valid complaint is the lack of time limit and substitutes. What if a game goes on for days? People have to go to work/ school. And what do the players do- eat and drink on their brooms?

Quidditch games could only really be followed by people with no life, as by going to a Quidditch game (as a fan) you would have to be prepared to be there for as little as a few minutes to as long as maybe a week?

Additionally, like you said, it must be a nightmare when games drag on, but the books did mention substitutes (specifically for longer games) so I assume they'd sub off tired players so they can eat and sleep before returning to the pitch. Which is, in itself, a ridiculous notion.

** Note that in your sample size, the RL world cup has one more recent winner - France (/yay/), that adds one to the number of repeat winners. If you take another international football tournament (the Euros) over the closest time period (either 1988-2012 or 1992-2016), there's only a single repeat winner, despite a smaller number of teams involved than the World Cup.

Quidditch, as it stands, also relies on the individual talent of the Seeker far more than that of a single player in football/soccer - that can make it so that there could be more variation in winners, depending on factors influencing that player. With the smaller magical populations, it might also impact how consistent the national teams are.

It's also interesting that you note "And even then, sometimes it isn't enough, sometimes the opposition just does it better than you, sometimes the talent pool is too shallow, sometimes the team falls apart. One bad game can potentially ruin an entire season for any team." which is a reason why there might be great year to year variation in winners - but conclude from it that it doesn't make any sense that there isn't more consistency. Combine that with just catching the Snitch being enough to win many of the games... (From the wiki, looking at the 2014 QWC, 7 of the 15 games would have been won even if the team that caught the Snitch had scored 0 other points, basically 50% of the matches).

Another thing to keep in mind is that the qualifying for the QWC is very different from the RL World Cup - apparently for Quidditch, there's 16 qualifying groups and only the top team from each of those groups gets seeded in. That opens up the possibility for multiple top teams to have been put in the same group, and thus knocked out before the tournament even begins.

Anyways, Quidditch as a game is essentially a plot device to put Harry in the only position that really matters - if we really wanted to turn it into a 'real' sport that made sense, we'd need to adjust the rules. I've seen some fics do that decently, I suppose - eg, reducing the points from catching the Snitch to 50 and making it need to be caught 3 times to end the match would keep the importance of a good Seeker, but also reduce the variability greatly (and make team skill/quality much more important)

** There are two types of generations defining authors:

1. Those that build a comprehensive world and well-developed characters and then write about how the two interact (Tolkien is an example of this). The plot is very dependent on how characters react to the circumstances they find themselves in.
2. Those that come up with a plot and then shoehorn in interesting characters, world development, and anything else that catches their fancy (Rowling does this). The plot is a runaway train that happens and the characters and settings are along for the ride.

In short, Rowling's work is not meant to be logical/rational and trying to find some in it is a waste of time. This fact is frustrating for many as HP is a very entertaining and engaging read, but this is why HP fanfiction is huge - fans do their best to either fill in the plotholes or re-configure the story elements into a more sensible whole.

** That's a far too simplistic analysis.

Firstly, you have to remember that soccer teams consist of eleven people and countries need to have good, if not great, players for every single position + six substitutes. In practice, this means a country really needs to have 22 fantastic players in order to be able to merely compete. And then you'e got to figure out a system. Look at England's Golden Generation which never really got anywhere... the common argument is they never figured out how to get everyone to play together.

This is an enormous contrast to a Quidditch team consists of seven players who don't have to worry about injuries because of magic... so having merely seven fantastic players is good enough. And they don't have to figure out formations to any where near the same extent because you have to have the same fixed positions. You cannot, for instance, play without beaters or use a false striker whereas wingless wonders and false nines are very famous ideas in soccer.

Secondly, you've got to remember that Quidditch is massively distorted by the quality of your broom. A team on firebolts will always beat a team on some antique from the Weasley broomshed... unless the firebolt team is completely useless (which, again, they won't be because you only need seven people... and you can get away with a lot if your seeker is good enough).

Thirdly, remember when you wrote:

#+begin_quote
  One bad game can potentially ruin an entire season for any team.
#+end_quote

Yes, exactly. You get a bludger to hit the enemy seeker at just the right moment, it doesn't matter how good the rest of the team is. And because we're talking about a knockout competition you don't have any "it evens out over time" effects.

Fourthly, let's look at the Champions league... in world cup years. The reason to do this is that domestic teams can buy players to fit a system, to replace injuries etc. etc. It's still a far from ideal comparison but it's better than looking at FIFA World Cups...

- Red Star Belgrade
- Ajax
- Man Utd
- AC Milan
- AC Milan
- Barcelona
- Barcelona
- Liverpool

Clearly... more variety. But let's look at Men's Gold Medalists in tennis by country (starting in 1988):

- Czechoslovakia
- Switzerland
- USA
- Russia
- Chile
- Spain
- UK
- UK (same player)

Those last four Olympiads come in the Roger Federer era, for context. By far the most consistently dominant player ever (if only due to being older than Nadal and Djokovic) but he doesn't have that Olympic Gold (in singles). Why? Because one bad match and it's over.

Again... it's not a perfect comparison... and maybe looking at doubles would be fairer (only one repeat gold medalist for men's... the USA) but you can see the pattern, right? The closer we get to the conditions of Quidditch, the more we get variety.

There are very few real world sports even remotely similar to Quidditch. Netball's the only one I can think of, actually. Any other team sport I know enough about doesn't have fixed positions. But hardly anywhere plays netball (because it suuuuuucks) and Australia thumps everyone anyway (also, too many people). Actually, rugby might do set positions too now that I think about it.

If we want to look at catching the snitch as /the/ deal breaker... it's not actually that different to sports like baseball or cricket which, in theory, continue indefinitely until you've got the right number of dismissals. However, these sports (well, cricket anyway) allow for player variation. (It is definitely different since catching the snitch is a shared condition, making cricket and baseball more Turn Based to Quidditch's RTS.,)

Now... you'll note that the Champion's League is an annual competition (and not all of those teams won the Champions League as it exists now... and you may disagree with deciding 2018-19 is the 2018 winner instead of 2017-18) but I reported at a four yearly interval. If you look within those four year spans you'll find more repeated winners. The reason for this is that keeping a top quality team around for four years is actually really hard. If we assume that Quidditch players have short careers (at least, at their peaks) then that's another reason to believe in higher turnover.

But... magic should extend careers. Maybe the fixed positionality of Quidditch comes into play. It took decades for the All Blacks to have a 100-capped player... why? Because for a long, long time there was always a better player in the position you occupied pushing through (and also it was an amateur sport until 1995. Let that sink in for a bit, 1995! You might even have been born when the sport was still amateur). That is, no matter how much magic might prolong your career, it can't make you better than the replacement level player... so you're replaced.

tl;dr -- when you look at Quidditch it actually kind of makes sense that there'd be high turnover of world champions

*** No... I can't explain why the Euros only have the one repeat winner (according to one of the other comments in this thread). It may be a travel thing... until 2014, no European team had ever won in South America, for instance. Another possibility is that players care less about the Euros so games are less conservative (and hence swing on chance more often). My final guess is that it's because countries use Euros as a check-up for their progress... they have a plan to win the world cup, which will almost always come into effect the year after the cup, so by the time the Euros roll around they're only 2 years in and nothing's really sunk in yet.

** You don't have to go this far. The fact that Gryffindor with its three female (underclass) Chasers can somehow manage to defeat Slytherin with their three male (upperclass) Chasers (especially when the three Slytherins are described as "gorilla-like") is enough proof that Rowling has no idea how sports works.

Boys are naturally stronger and no amount of talent can compensate for the large differences in strength. Canon has a 12 year old Katie Bell (and the 13 year old Angelina and Alicia) somehow being better at a physical sport than a 15-16 year Slytherin boy, which is nuts.

There's a reason why age groups exist in sports as well. There is zero chance that a U14 player can ever hope to compete with a U16, forget a female player competing with a male player.

EDIT: Looks like people in this sub don't get sports either. I don't know how to explain this to people - go watch sports like football, tennis or whatever. They will ALL have U12, U14, U16 and U18 divisions, and separate ones for boys and girls. The performance gap between these divisions is clear as day to anyone who isn't completely delusional.

To give a simple example, the average first serve of a male U18 tennis player would be between 170-190 kph. That of a female U18 player would be around 140-160kph. This is the kind of gap between the genders, and that trend is present in all age groups.

4) The Gryffindor Chasers would be worse at passing the Quaffle amongst themselves, this I don't contend, but they'd also be harder to catch because they're more nimble. That's not to say that the Slytherin Chasers would be outclassed by the Gryffindor Chasers.

Fun fact, they /don't/. Gryffindor wins the one match in first year (the only one where I have the reference handy, sorry) by 170-60. Harry's responsible for 150 of that, so the score was 20-60, and 10 of those 20 is from a penalty (and Alicia just needed to fake first- or second-year Keeper Bletchley out since the Slytherin Chasers wouldn't be allowed to interfere).

The second match ended 150-0 in record time. The third is lost because Harry wasn't there, but given their track record we can assume that the Gryffindor Chasers were blown out.

I'll look up the rest when I get the other books back from my sister, which might take a while :p

****** Look, you're clearly not getting what I'm trying to say.

Just visit your local school during their annual athletics meet or whatever, and see for yourself the difference in results between U12, U14, U16, and U18 categories between boys and girls in different events. Or better yet, just look them up on the internet.

Compare the results across all categories. If you're still unable to notice the huge difference in performance, I'm afraid there's nothing I can say to you about this.

Angelina is 14: she would be on the U16 team with Warrington and Montague

Alicia and Katie are 13 and 12: they'd be on the same team as Pucey.

I don't get why you think there's a huge age difference in players. Even when the girls are gone they're replaced by 15-16 yr olds.

*** There's one identified upperclass male chaser when Harry's a 1st/2nd year: Flint. And Angelina, at the very least, is 14. The rest of the identified Slytherin chasers are in the 7th year when Harry is in his 5th and 6th, same year as Katie and Angelina.

**** Are you seriously suggesting that girls are as strong as boys are? That somehow, girls in the U18 can compete with U18 boys?

Please leave your feminist equality nonsense for the debate rooms - it has no place on the sports grounds.

The U18 male tennis player has an average first serve speed of around 175-180 kph. The average of the U18 female tennis player is between 140-145 kph. It should not require someone with Einstein's level of intellect to decide who is stronger.

In sports, boys are always going to be taller, stronger and faster than girls.

***** Apparently, some of us need an Einstein level intellect to comprehend replies. I suggested nothing. I pointed out that you don't know the ages of any of the characters you are discussing. I hope you understood that.

But also they are riding brooms. Being taller and faster doesn't matter here and I know it was pointed out to you that the chaser girls weren't as good as the Slytherin chasers. Keep up.

****** Holding on to a what is essentially a thin rod as it hurtles through the air at speeds over 100 kph with one hand and two knees requires strength. Think inertial forces - I'm sure you must have heard about it in high school somewhere.

Throwing a heavy quaffle while doing the above activity requires even more strength. Same with striking bludgers, which incidentally are solid metal.

Being taller generally implies greater wingspan, which allows for more power in the arms and shoulders. Throwing balls and striking with bats comes under this.

I'd ask you to take a look at something like shot put results between U12, U14, and U16 categories on both boys and girls, but I'm not sure you'd be able to understand things as complex as numbers and charts.

Political ideology has NOTHING to do with the fact that male athletes will always be taller, stronger and faster than their female counterparts.
