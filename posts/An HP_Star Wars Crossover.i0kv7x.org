:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to look for a relatively new HP/Star Wars Crossover fic that may or may not have been taken down.

I remember that HP was reincarnated as Anakin and mainly set in episode one at the moment. He was sarcastic to Quigon and Obi-wan. Obi-wan was his verbal sparing partner when they picked him up.

I also remember him being presented to the Jedi council and them vehemently denying him training, only to relent when Master Fay convinced HP/Anakin to lower his mental shields and HP/Anakin shown like a star in Obi-wan's point of view.

It then showed him mocking Padme regarding her dealings with the Republic Senate and giving her ideas on how to recapture Naboo.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

  74 lives since his original, Harry Potter, or the being that once went by that name, is tired. He has had enough, yet his lives continue. Now, he's reborn into a very different life than many of the others he's had. Once again he's got to save the world... With a bit more. Now, he's got to save the Galaxy... Because he's the Chosen One... again.(Abandoned)

*** No I read that previously. Doesn't mention Jedi master Fay anywhere. Fay appeared early on in the chapters.

**** No rest for the Weary by Skadarken might have been it. But I think the old fic was taken down and it's being rewritten.

******* Yes. If you check out the bot link below, the author clearly states that he did take the original down and rewritten it.

  Anakin just wanted freedom to make his own choices. Too bad the galaxy seemed determined to throw the most troublesome things at him for it. Well, at least he could figure out what the annoying noise was- "No, Fay. I am NOT going to do THAT... I mean it. No, this is not going to be a repeat of Tatooine... and I totally blame the slugs for that!"
