Pretty much what the title says. I'm looking for something to read. Preferably with pairings but it doesn't have to be the focus.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Angry at the rich pureblood elite for their blatant discrimination and ministry bribery? Well, what if they weren't rich any more?

Featuring Cat (literally) Burglar Hermione, auror Harry and Ron, and the best Mundungus Fletcher in all of fanfiction.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** My single best recommendation is Hogwarts Houses Divided, which is about Teddy Lupin's first year at Hogwarts and is EXTREMELY well written.... though there aren't really any pairings in that story, if you don't count that canon pairings have gone on with the adults (Harry/Ginny are married, as are Ron/Hermione, and so on). The main characters are eleven-twelve, so they're a little young for serious romantic pairings... most you get are some precocious crushes and a few shy glances. I still think it's one of the best, if not THE best, HP fanfics around, so I recommend it anyway. linkffn(3979062)

"In the modern-day wizarding world, two half-blood wizards attended Durmstrang with hopes of bringing change and justice to all students regardless of blood status. They seemed inseparable until tragedy struck, leading to them departing ways. While one withdrew to the shadows, the other boy continued the rebellion against the pure-blood hierarchy."

** The Code by Aduro and the series for it [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2750775/1/The-Code]]

Its eventually Draco/Ginny but thats in the sequel fics. Its not the main focus of it, the focus is more on Bill and Draco's friendship.

** I'm gonna give you two, cause I've never been able to choose between which one I like better.

The Art of Self-Fashioning is definitely one of the best fics I've ever read. Voldemort goes after Neville instead, so Harry's parents are the ones tortured. Harry finds this out when he meets McGonnagal, and dedicates his entire life to curing his parents. It features an incredibly un-empathetic Harry, who's anti social, doesn't understand people, doesn't care about anything besides curing his family, etc. It's amazing. Also, it simultaneously has one of the best and one of the most haunting endings I've ever read. linkffn(11585823)

And the other is Broken, by inadaze22. Now, it is a Dramione fic, so keep that in mind, but it's one that doesn't try and make the characters better than they are. Draco is still a massive piece of shit who only begins to get closer to Hermione because she's a friend of a friend. It's a post war fic where, after spending five years out of the country, Hermione returns to Britain and finds herself ostracized by her friends. It's got an incredibly realistic romance, and some really good plot twists. linkffn(4172243)

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition.

** IDK what's going on, it's not letting me link anything apparently. Just search Harry Potter and The Prince of Slytherin by TheSinisterMan. It's a WIP but it's 800k words in and probably my favourite story on the site. It's also absurdly popular so I avoided it for the longes time just based on that... that was a huge mistake on my part.
