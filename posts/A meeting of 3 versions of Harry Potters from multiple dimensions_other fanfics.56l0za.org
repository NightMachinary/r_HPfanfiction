  Hogwarts is home to any number of strange occurances. This one, however, is stranger than usual. Can the school survive Luna Lovegood getting together with Harry Potter and Harry Potter and Harry Potter and Harry Potter? Rated mostly for innuendo.

** I could swear I've read a crackfic where Harrys from different universes get accidently summoned, including a somewhat scary Healer and a Dark Lord Harry with a skeletal pet on his shoulder...

It was ages ago and can't seem to remember anything about the title, might try searching through my favs later on.

  “Welcome to the first Interdimensional Harry Potter Meeting!” Harry wakes to find himself surrounded by seven other, very different Harry Potters. He's about to learn more about himself than he ever wanted to know. Premise: I've read many stories in which Harry's life takes a turn at some point along the way and he becomes a completely different kind of person. This story explores several of those while focusing on Harry as he was in canon at the culmination of the 1st book. What if JK's Harry Potter were to discover prior to 2nd year exactly what his own potential could truly be? What if he had found unconditional acceptance and support to guide him on paths he'd never imagined? What if, at the tender age of 12, he had discovered unrestricted access to a deep well of information Dumbledore had never meant for him to have? I give you The Harry Potter Self-Help Group...WARNING: This is a Work In Progress. It is not finished, nor may it ever be finished. It is presently at around 35,000 words. I will post what I have written and add more if/when I write it. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

** I had the idea too, and want to see it done so bad, like especially in some certain fanfictions. Imagine fanfics of fanfics... and maybe even of fanfics! This is now officially a Request.

** Oh boy, I get to recommend linkffn(Dimension Hopping for Beginners)

It's short (sort of like an extended series of one shots), but it's one of my favorites.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.
