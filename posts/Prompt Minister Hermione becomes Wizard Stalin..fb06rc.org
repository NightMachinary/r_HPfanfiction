After her proposal for equal rights for goblins, centaurs, elves, etc. being dismissed by the I.C.W nearly unanimously ( with Britain the only country supporting Minister Granger's proposal), Hermione takes a page out of the French Revolutionary wars (and the Napoleonic ones) and Joseph Stalin and declares war (maybe cold) on nations that voted down her proposal.

Her vision for equality amongst all beings magical and mundane is strictly enforced and propagated by the Ministry via pamphlets, advertisements, etc and any dissent in magical Britain is monitored by the Aurors and dissenters shipped off to Azkaban. The Daily Prophet gushes over Hermione's policies while singing praises of her intelligence (" brightest witch of her generation " being one among them).

In short, Hermione in an attempt to improve Wizarding Britain had instituted a Stalinist state that ended up being more repressive than the one mentioned in Orwell's 1984.

** So let me get this straight- she gets power through civil war and bloodshed and then proceeds to establish a state of terror while committing genocide? Also while being extremely paranoid and executing people left and right or sending them to literal concentration camps? I can't even... There is just so, */so/* much wrong with this prompt. Hermione is a good person. There is no scenario in which she descends into being a mass-murdering, paranoid psychopath. A prompt like this would work much better with Tom Riddle traveling to the USSR in the late '40s/ early '50s and being impressed by the cruelty and evilness of Stalin. Bottom line: Stalin was *evil*. Hermione is *good*.

​

Just so I'm not completely off-topic:

#+begin_quote
  Harry was surprised to see Hermione immerge from the fireplace in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place at 5 o'clock. She hadn't come back from work on time since she became minister. What alarmed him even more was the ashen colour of her face. He rushed to her side immediately and asked her what's wrong. Hermione remained silent as she walked up to the drinks cabinet, pulled out a bottle and poured herself a glass of firewhisky. This caused Harry to become even more agitated as Hermione never drank strong alcohol. The last time she did was at Fred's funeral after the final battle. As colour returned to Hermione's face she explained:

  "Oh, Harry, I'm horrible. I was in this meeting with members of the Wizengamot. They were proposing all sorts of nonsense like marriage laws, reintroducing indentured servitude to reduce poverty. They even wanted me to make attending foreign schools of magic illegal." Hermione hiccupped, the first signs of tears causing her eyes to shine in the candlelight. "And I just sat there and I honestly thought about sending them to a concentration camp. Or killing them. I even considered which spells to use and how many of them I could take down before calling for help. It was awful." Hermione broke down in sobs as Harry rubbed her back.

  "But then I remembered reading about the communists and Stalin and what /they/ did to their own people. I felt so revolted of myself for even considering it." She looked up to Harry, hope filling her eyes. "Please take me away from here Harry. I can't take it anymore. So much bigotry and racism. Such cruelty."

  Harry remained silent for a long time while he considered Hermione's story. Then he replied softly:

  "Okay, Hermione. We'll leave. I hear New Zealand is great this time of the year and I'm pretty sure the Blacks had a house somewhere in Wellington. You just rest now and I'll go and arrange a portkey for tomorrow morning." The way Hermione's body relaxed and her lips curved upwards told Harry he had made the right decision.

** It's an interesting idea for a prompt, though I'd push back at the historical comparisons - the French Revolutionary (and Napoleonic) periods are pretty heavily different from Stalin and the Soviet Union, and in neither of the bunch just outright declared war like that on other nations just for that disagreement.

(For instance, the French revolutionary wars started, to a large extent, because there was the idea that the Austrians and Prussians were already gearing up to attack France - which the King's flight to Varennes the year earlier helped to make that appear the case, and was then exacerbated after the war started by the declaration of Pillnitz)

Personally, if someone /were/ to use this as an idea, I think looking at the french revolution (past the 10 second version that's taught in secondary school ;) ) would be an excellent source of inspiration while making it realistic. Eg, it doesn't make any sense for Hermione's new government to immediately declare war or start a reign of terror like you describe - but if you were to draw parallels/inspiration from the Revolution for how to get to each of those steps, well... Suddenly it becomes a /lot/ more interesting. In something like this, it's not the final goal that's interesting - it's the way you get there, /particularly/ when each step is reasonable and can be debated.

** To be honest, in my unpopular opinion, this is what she would do. She would force people to conform to her thinking on magical races. For example, house elves getting wages. While this is isn't confirmed, it's also widely believed and accepted that house elves only need magic from the bond, otherwise they die. In which case she bases her argument from an exception. It's similar to saying all dogs are abused and should be monitored each month when one rich owner has been found guilty of abuse with others being suspected of it. While I could be wrong, it just seems like this essentially what she'd do.

****** Not unless it furthered his goals, no.

But I don't think it would be uncommon if you start forcing them into freedom when they don't yet want it or understand how to react to it.

I think it'd be pretty ironic if they, after having freedom forced upon them, rejected all of the counselling ("brainwashing") that they'd been given and simply refused to do work for those who freed them.

*** The elven bond is fanon bullshit, commonly used to justify slavery. While a bond exists, as seen with Dobby and Lucius, it is nothing but a slave-bond. The relationship is parasitic on the wizards' part, leeching work and loyalty for nothing in return.

Also, even if it were so, that wouldn't be a justification.

***** Of course it's fucking used to justify slavery. It's two of the three N's used to justify all forms of bigotry - It's Necessary, because they die without it, it's Natural, because that's how they work. The same arguments people make were used by slave owners in real history - Blacks need to work, they're happier when they work, etc. That is basic justification 101.

Add to that that the bond is obviously not just societal or informal, but actually, physically binding, and you get a whole other level. All those fics which state that they need the bond are fics which state that slavery enforced by an inescapable force is the right way to do things.

Willing slavery is still slavery, especially when there is no realistic way to get out of it by running away.

I find it very, very telling that all three of the named house elve characters are abused to the extreme, or indoctrinated to the extreme.

The only one talking shit is the one who says "house elves need the bond" is generally accepted.
