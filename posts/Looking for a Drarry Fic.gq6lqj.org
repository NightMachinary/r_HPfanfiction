:END:
A long time ago I found this fic, I think it was on wattpad but I'm not sure, it was a drarry fic with a couple of OCs, one was a girl (I think she had either purple or silver hair) who befriended drarry, and one was a centaur (her childhood best friend) who was in love with said girl. It was set during Christmas, and there was a secret Santa (Draco had to give gifts to Harry). In one scene the girl mentioned she had never decorated a Christmas tree before. I can't remember the title of this fic and wanted to read/skim it again. also if it helps I think there was another guy in love with the girl, there was a love triangle and the girl had to pick between this guy and the centaur. If someone could find out if it's still out there or if it was deleted that would be great.
