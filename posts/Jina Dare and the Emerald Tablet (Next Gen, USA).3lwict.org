  Jina Dare is an American witch-in-training, a good-hearted girl who rather unfortunately comes from a long line of notorious dark wizards. It's a hard legacy to live down, especially when You-Know-Who-Else --- the most feared and hated villain of the 21st century --- also happens to be your father. Jina's story is also unfolding right now, in 2015, so you can follow her in real-time!

** I'm intrigued from your blurb posted here. Will there be sequels / are you following in the footsteps of the original series and writing seven books?
