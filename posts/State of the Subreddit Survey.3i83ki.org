*** I don't think it should be banned, but I have to admit I would definitely support the subreddit being removed from the sidebar.

EDIT: Or if not, why not add links to all the subreddits for HP fic? Apparently Alexandra Quick has one, too. Not sure if any others do. But really, I don't think it's necessary to have links to any of them.

** I just thought of something after doing the survey. Maybe it is here somewhere, and I just suck at finding it. It would be nice if there was a description for some of the acronyms or at least some basic fanfiction terms for newbies. When I first started looking into fanfic, I had no idea what stuff like AU, Slash, etc. meant. Might be a nice resource for new readers to have at least an idea of what they are looking at.

** Done.

I asked for a looser restriction on inciting arguments so that heated fic debate might be allowed.

I also suggested that the proposed fic tournament have a grand opening with all available fics. Score multiplier for fics with fewer reviews to help the less popular stuff get noticed.

Not sure how popular those two ideas will be but I remain hopeful.

*** I think there's a distinction between "inciting an argument" and "participating in a heated fic debate". You can be passionate about your opinion without descending into personal attacks, logical fallacies or contrariness for the sake of it, which I consider to be the hallmarks of an "argument" as opposed to be a debate. But yeah, it'd be nice if it was made clear that debating and disagreeing is acceptable.

** I didn't mention this on the survey because I only thought of it this morning, but I think it might be helpful to have some clarity on when downvotes are appropriate. The reason I bring this is up is that there are so many different tastes in this sub, and downvoting somebody because, to throw out two random examples, they like Harry/Hermione or they are not a fan of Dark!Harry, doesn't seem reasonable.

Whether people should downvote fic recs they don't like is a little more ambiguous to me. On the one hand, it gives a more clear view of the community's general opinion, but maybe it'd be better to let them stand and simply add dissenting opinions if you feel strongly about it?

EDIT: I also have a comment on one of the pieces of feedback, specifically the "starter pack" of fics. I think it would be good to divide this into categories, as different things appeal to different people, and the last thing we'd want to do is scare people off because they think that all HP fic is similar. [[/u/tusing]] helpfully created that guide that's a good introduction to DLP-style fic, and maybe some other people who are heavily into certain genres (Next Gen? Canon-based? Slash? Pre-DH 7th year fics? Not sure what categories people would want) could create their own guides. I think this would both be helpful, and also cut down on a lot of repeats of common, fairly generic requests.

** So looking at the results, something I see repeated a few times is that this sub is very focused on what you might call the DLP style of fic, and not welcoming to others (especially slashers).

This kind of surprised me because, for the most part, I'm actually kind of impressed with the diversity of genres and different parts of fandom that I see here. But I can see where they're coming from.

I have a couple thoughts on this, and I hope that people, particularly those who feel their interests are being mocked and/or marginalized, will weigh in on them.

1. Regarding slash. It is completely reasonable to say you do not want slash in a fic request, because that way nobody's time is wasted (the reccer's or the requester's). I don't think it's necessary to explain your reasoning, though, and that often seems to veer into the kind of talk that is making people uncomfortable. You don't need to defend your lack of interest in slash. Similarly, others do not need to defend their interest in it.

2. There is no reason to go into a thread for a genre you do not like, whether this is slash, smut, Dark!Harry, Ron/Hermione or whatever else, and talk about how you don't like it. It's fine you don't like it, but the person requesting it obviously does, and your opinion on it is unlikely to change their mind or be helpful.

3. Be the change you want to see. Make a rec list for your preferred genre, make requests for it more often, and always chime in on those threads where you have something to recommend. You can't expect the community to suddenly talk about more diverse interests if you refuse to start the conversation.

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.
