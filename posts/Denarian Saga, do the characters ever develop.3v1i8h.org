So, after several years of recommendations I have decided to give the Denarian Saga a try. I am currently on chapter 18 of renegade and am wondering if Harry ever develops as a character? Right now he is a little annoying prick that makes it very hard to enjoy the story.

Does Harry every develop and become a character who is enjoyable to read about, or does he stay a typical Super-Harry douche? If he doesn't can anyone explain why the series is so widely loved?


** He never really changes that much. At least, I don't think so.

I think it's widely loved because not everyone dislikes that type of character, and because some people just don't care about the characters all that much, just the plot and the world, which I feel are areas where the Denarian Trilogy most definitely excels.

*** Hmmmm, as someone who almost only cares about characters the concept of not caring about them never really occurred to me. Does the world develop as the story goes? It seems lackluster at the moment, but that could be because I am very familiar with Harry Potter and Dresden Files so nothing is blowing me away positively yet.

**** I can't really remember all that much. I read the Denarian Trilogy before I read the Dresden Files, so I remember really enjoying the world.

It's probably my favourite fic (mainly because of the plot and battles, as I said), though I can definitely see how it might not appeal to some. I'm going to say that if you aren't enjoying it by this point, you probably aren't going to at all.

**** The story develops, expanding a bit on the concept of magic and how the different types work, why certain ones more powerful than others, and harry does grow as a person...a little. Just enough where Dumbledore no longer considers offing him.

***** Do they explain the systems as from the source series or do they just make stuff up? I ask because water, mostly running water, is incredibly disruptive to Dresdenverse magic. Even just in a lake the only reason Dresden was able to use magic is he was drawing it up from the earth he was standing on (He was about waist deep). I know this Harry is a powerhouse, but to not even mention it during the second task makes me think that the author plays a little fast and loose with the rules.

****** There's definitely some making stuff up that explains things seen in the source series but not really explained in them. The author covers the water thing in an indirect way in the second story.

*** Ah, I guess I am too uptight for it, certain things suspend my disbelief. Such as Harry beating a Dresden Dragon, or using Dresden Magic underwater during the second task.

** Harry is always rude, but he does develop into a more caring person although it's hidden under his attitude.

*** Attitude is fine, but what I read of him so far isn't attitude, it's being a brat. Possibly him growing up will make things better.

** He grows, but it's slow going.

He never (entirely) stops being a bit of a Jerk-Sue, but I found him more fun to read about later in the series.

** If I remember correctly he doesn't change that much, he's always an abrasive wise-ass but he /does/ grow, he learns about sacrifice and goes through heavy emotional pain which tends to mellow him a bit, but not by much.

** There's a lot of character development, actually, especially with Harry. It's quite subtle, but it's really well-done, not unrealistic.

** Yes and no, leaning more towards no. But what you'll probably come to understand fairly quickly is that he is most changed when his relationship with his fallen is threatened. Also, I always took the story to show him as a character that there's no real reason for him to change.
