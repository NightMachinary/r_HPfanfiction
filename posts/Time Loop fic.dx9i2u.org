:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic that has Harry looping. He does at least once before Hogwarts. Then gets to Hogwarts and is sorted into Slytherin. He's bullied a lot and Oliver Wood helps him but then he dies and the next time Oliver won't help him. Think he's friends with Adrian Pucey too. Really want to reread this fic! Please help!
