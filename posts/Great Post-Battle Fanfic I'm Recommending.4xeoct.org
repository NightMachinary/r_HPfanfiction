I've read about 100 novel-length fanfics about life after the war, generally with a focus on Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione. All told, I've probably read over 10 million words, and that's being conservative. So I consider myself well versed in the typical tropes and storylines for such fics. I have my own preferences for stories I like to see, and am happy to engage with other readers in discussing whether these plots make sense canonically.

Having said all that, I would be remiss if I didn't recommend one of the best stories I have ever read on the topic. Actually they are two stories, told back to back. They are "Starting Over" and "Inner Demons" by serendipity_50 over at A03. "Inner Demons" is almost 500,000 words but reads incredibly fast and is one of the most addictive stories I have ever read. The themes the author delves into made me reexamine my own head canon many times over. It also made me question how we as readers and writers interpret these characters' lives and whether their actions are OOC.

What I mean by this is we frequently will dismiss a character's behavior or actions as OOC based on how they behaved in the books. While this is certainly warranted in many cases, we too often forget that most of these characters were kids who went through a war. We don't ever actually read about their behavior when it's over. So we take their personalities before the war and assume they will keep them after the war.

What these fics did was show that war does change people. The author handled it very realistically so that the characters weren't completely different people, just damaged individuals who often struggled to cope with what they had been through.

I hope others who enjoy this particular genre give the story a read and I would love to discuss the idea of a character acting OOC after the war.


** I read 0.5-1M words/week.

Which is why even my kindle unlimited cannot satiate me and I need fanfiction....

....oh fanfiction, you are the best crack for reading addicts with budgets.

** Greyback was most likely KIA at Battle of Hogwarts. He was brought down by Ron and Neville with the Sword of Gryffindor. If I remember correctly, the Sword of Gryffindor was imbued with basilisk venom, and any cut by that sword would be fatal to its victim.

How then could Greyback rise from the dead and attack Ginny in 'Starting Over'? If you want to write canon stories, then at least pay attention to source materials. Don't cherry pick stuffs just to introduce unnecessary drama or suspense!

In the melee that followed, I highly doubt Neville could get his wand back.

***** He could easily get somebody else's wand, though. Death Eaters were falling like flies at that point, so there's hardly any shortage of spare enemy wands.

Harry also used a shield charm to protect Neville right after he cut off Nagini's head, so Neviile could very well have had the opportunity to retrieve his original wand.

In any case, if Neville were indeed using the sword, it would have been mentioned when and Ron he took down Greyback. As it is, there isn't nearly enough evidence to even suggest Greyback's death.

The basilisk venom just means that an unskilled wielder like Neville is just as likely to kill himself or his allies anyway.

*** Was he? I dont remember that but it's been a while so you are probably right.

My take on non-canon stuff is if it isn't so far fetched or doesn't take away from the basic events of the books, I'm ok with it. In this case, I found that Greyback could have been replaced with any other Death Eater and the purpose of the plotline would have still worked. So the fact that canonically, Greyback probably died wasn't really an issue for me.

**** Based on information in TCC, Rudolphus Lestrange most likely didn't participate in the Battle and was in charge of taking care of Delphi. He later gave her to the Rowles and probably went on an one man campaign against the new Ministry. I think this guy would be the best candidate for postwar threat.

** My favorite postwar fic no longer has canon pairing or Harry becoming a Ministry worker, but a Dark Lord: *The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167).

*Aurors and Schoolgirls* by Northumbrian, linkffn(5521420), is really good, but hasn't been updated since 2011!

Speaking of Northumbrian, he seems to be really upset at TCC, too, and will no longer include its time-travel elements in his stories.

*** I appreciate the recommendation, but honestly I'm having a hard time getting into this one. The story is just an endless stream of cliches:

- Harry the impossibly stubborn idiot with no impulse control and the emotional awareness of a stump

- Ginny the irrationally angry girl who can't get over herself long enough to figure out what she wants

- Hermione, who knows an incantation for every situation but can't manage to convince two of her closest friends to get over themselves and talk to each other

- Ron the socially tone-deaf buffoon

- George the PTSD-afflicted zombie who serves up the occasional flash of brilliant life advice

- Molly, the family matriarch who serves no purpose other than cooking and weeping

- An endless stream of implausible events and contrived misunderstandings that drive Harry and Ginny apart even as true love tries to bring them together

It just goes on and on and ON...
