** I am currently working on my next fic and I'm getting pretty close to being ready to start posting. Always an exciting time.

It's a bit of a strange one. It's set in an AU where Draco Malfoy was born a girl, and as a potential candidate for an altered version of the prophecy. She is the Girl Who Lived, and Lucius Malfoy has enjoyed years of incredible influence.

It's set when Harry is about to start his final year at a somewhat altered Hogwarts, and at the very beginning he learns that his fate may be entwined with his schoolyard foe. There is more to the prophecy than even Fem!Draco knows.

So, I guess I'm writing a Drarry story. Or, if you subscribe to the Daphne = Fem!Draco theory, a Haphne story.

I really hope it comes out well.

EDIT: Also, big news here, but it's not a crossover with anything which is a pretty major departure for me.

** Something about 70s and time travel. Harry became a DADA professor in 1975. He would try to sabotage rise of Voldemort. Good Dumbledore. No bashing. No overpowered Harry. No deatheaters whitewashing. Marauders would not be much of a focus. Basically it's about consequences and how future knowledge can be useless. Like if Harry changes a thing, other stuff would possibly not happen. For example, if he decides to save Regular Black from joining Voldemort, that particular Horcrux doesn't happen in 1979/80. Or how prophecy is useless if Voldemort doesn't know it. Etc.

Basically an attempt for what if AU canon station points don't happen or changed

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13829746]]

Posted 3rd chapter. However, thinking how to come up with new chapter. Tropes-wise, saving 1-2 deatheaters from joining Voldemort, or ministry of the magic first took Voldemort as a threat will be next focus. Or when OotP established.

** Writing HP and the Continuity Crisis:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28259916/chapters/69252006]]

Summary on AO3 is:

#+begin_quote
  The summer between her fourth and fifth years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry have been difficult for Harry Potter as she has spent too long being able to mull over her feelings. She's confused, and hurt that her friends haven't spoken to her, and with a slight crisis about her identity she's had nobody to turn to.

  We join her on her last evening before rejoining her friends. You know the characters, you know the settings, but with a /slight/ tweak of fate, her life begins to diverge from canon.
#+end_quote

It's roughly canon compliant with a few tweaks until about halfway through 5th year (and so halfway through current chapters) and then it splits wildly. Latest chapter has changed quite a bit from canon, and is the setup for some more changes.

Basically a polyam+trans!harry plot, and because of that, how does the story change.

There are a two non-chapter chapters, but the AO3 chapter mark is now at 30 including those. Approx 2k words per actual chapter.

** I'm working on a different version of Harry's 5th year where he is more affected by Cedric's death (and his life at the Dursleys). I've also added an element I always wanted in canon: competent adults who actually look out for Harry. It features a lot of Sirius, Remus, Professor McGonagall, and Spell-Crafting!!!

summary: After the war, Harry has the not so original idea to go back in time to his eleven year old self. Of course in hindsight, he should have known that his bright counterpart in another universe would have the same idea.

** I'm currebtly trying to write a story I have titled Artoria, Lady of Thunder...

The fic will follow Artoria, a female Harry Potter, who was born the heir to Ravenclaw from her mother side and somewhat slytherin since the Slytherin family came out of the Peverell and Slytherin had no children.

The story follow a totally socially inept Artoria who has never learned how to read, write count or anything other than hard work and creative problem solving.

The idea being that she is kind of like Luna but in a different way.

She doesn't believe in strange things but she is infinitely curious and impossible to bully since she doesn't understand the concept of bullying as an intelectual construct.

Her attitude being that she wants to learn as much as she can, be the best she can be, and discover all she can.

Expect a high dosage of magical theory, experimental tinkering and random pearl of wisdom thrown around.

Looking for a beta who'd be willing to go over and help me improve my english?

But anyway, if you want more details, ask away, I'll be happy to reply! :-)

Currently not posted online.

Here is a little bit of what you may expect to find...

The subject of the conversation then went on a tangent to speak about what Mr Ollivander meant by the fluidity of spellcraft.

#+begin_example
  “You see, Miss Potter, not all magic are born or created equal. As a general rule, Wizards and Witches possess an attunement to a special magical composition. That is, their core of magic within them, flows either like fire, water or lightning. All three have their advantages and inconveniences.”
#+end_example

Artoria nodded, showing she followed.

#+begin_example
  “Take me for instance. My magical core flows like fire, which means that I am naturally passionate and dedicated. After all, fire does not stop until it has consumed all which feeds it, and it can grow or shrink depending on how much fuel it has. This has for inconvenience that my magic is better in short burst than in continue.”
#+end_example

She nodded again.

#+begin_example
  “Now, if I had, say, water as a magical core. It would mean that my magic would flow naturally and without much blockage along its path. However, time may come where it burst out of the damn, or much like a tidal wave, crush everything in its path, not caring of foe or friend alike. It is also harder to grasp, while you may not be burned, you might not realize that you have expunged your strength as clearly.
#+end_example

She nodded.

#+begin_example
  “And for Lightning?” she asked.
#+end_example

Ollivander smiled.

#+begin_example
  “Well that, is the strangest case ever. You see, Fire and Water are found within ninety-nine percent of the wizard population. The one remaining percent possess a lightning core. And it is this that has made those wizards and witches known throughout the history of our world as geniuses, prodigies, great doers of both good and evil. They are, quite specifically, referred as Emperors of Magic. Because they command it unlike anyone else.”

** I'm writing a 5+1 things one-shot for Neville it's gen with Neville/Luna friendship that could be read as more if you squint.

The basic premise of it being that Neville's magic expressed itself differently in childhood and throughout Hogwarts but he himself remained unaware of it as did his grandmother etc. This also explained why he wasn't active with accidental magic in the ways his family expected.

The 5 times he ignored it so far are 8 years old, 11 years old, 13 years old, 15 years old, the Final Battle (17 years old) & Voldemort's last stand being the 1st time he acknowledges the difference.

Most Canon remains in place but it obviously is slightly AU with some different world building and tweaks to how Neville responds to the world around him. I wanted to finish tonight to post on this thread but real life has gotten in the way!

** So... Its been a wild ride for me writing this one.

I am the author of one of the weirdest, powertrippy fics in the fandom according to one random reviewer. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12666080/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Potter-Grimoire]] is a story about a harry who for his fourteenth birthday is given the Potter Family Grimoire, in a world where magic and familiar based identity is highly important. Add in a voldemort that isn't an idiot, a majorly not-as-defeated Grindlewald, some crazy OCs and an alchemist named Flamel and you have the first two years of my fic.

I just finished year 5, and am working hard at getting year 6 started... but I am having so much fun just writing little history portraits for the OCs in the world that I sorta got sidetracked. I'm thinking of publishing those as a separate work, because I am really happy with some of them.

I am also working on a Naruto/Starwars fic called Shadows and Shin'o (I wont like due to different fandoms) which is a dramatically different place. That one is about to hit its first major stride in the battle of Geonosis, which kicks off the clone wars. So excited to write that.

I wound up having three scenes that I didn't plan on in my outline, so that was interesting. I don't know how it happens, sometimes I start writing one thing and something else comes out. It's good that it did though, because it allowed for a good character moment.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** I'm writing a story where Harry is de-aged into his 3 year old self, with only the memories of his life up to 3 years old. It's a crossover with Star Wars, so he will be discovered by the Jedi.

No links yet. I wanted to finish the story first before I post it anywhere.

Thing is, I need Harry to be able to at least speak some words (his own name, if nothing else). I'm trying to write the scenery (he's out in the forest) from his perspective, except I just realized... at 3 years old, Harry had never even been outside his cupboard except for meals and potty time. How would he even know what a plant is? And how would he even know his own name?

And on that note, how did he even learn how to speak? I don't see Petunia or Vernon being patient enough to teach Harry how to speak, what things are called, etc. I'm assuming that, at that age, the only words he knew are "boy" and "freak". I doubt he even knew his name. He probably thinks his full name is "Freak Boy", not Harry Potter.

And yet he came out at age 11 perfectly fluent in English. How did he even learn it?

*** That level of abuse is unlikely. If he would have been left in a cupboard his development would have been seriously hindered. Since Harry grew up without any language impairment we can only assume that Petunia was not as cruel with an infant than with a child.

At three years old kids can speak and have grasped the concept of "self" it wouldn't be weird for Harry to know what a three is. Is not like the neighbours didn't knew of his existence.

For the longest time, I've had an idea of a fem!Harry in Azeroth in my head, but never got into actually writing it. Then the Resident evil Village demo appeared and Alcina Dimitrescu overtook the internet. But my mind was like giant vampire, there are vampires in HP universe, oh there are also giants, why couldn't fem!Harry be a giant vampire? Suddenly, the idea that I previously had was tottaly wrecked and my imagined story got a major twist to it.

An outline was born. And then my first chapter came into existence. And a second one. A year and a half of trying to start writing and this new thing comes and I just start.

Absolutely crazy.

I'm three chapters in, with fourth coming along and a general outline planned.

If anyone here is interested, give it a try and tell me what you think. Constructive criticism is always welcome.

*** Yo! I've already read all the chapters before I saw you post. I think it was in chapter 3 where there was this really weird change of perspective. Like everything was 3rd person and then suddenly 5 lines 1st and then back to 3rd.

That was really weirding me out. For me personally the wizard runemaster intro doesnt really work anymore. I've seen it like 4 times now and its getting kinda old.

I get that you want to give a tribute to a fav. fic, but I think it hurts the originality of what you are writing.

Though I'll read it anyway :)

**** I get what you mean with the intro thing, as I've reread runemaster a few times, and it is just that, a tribute. The story will get its own unique direction really soon(in a chapter or two).

As for the third one, it is an interlude, and ive decided to add those every so often to show the pov from other characters, and I decided to write those completely in third person.

I will glance through the chapter 3 again and edit the lines that are in first person.

Thx for the input.

** I've been kind of stuck on playing with different tropes so far, and just recently put up chapter one (of three) of a Hanahaki disease based fic. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13835719/1/I-Just-Keep-Coughing-Up-Flowers]])

I'm still working on my fic that is a marriage contract take where one party chooses to give up their magic to prevent it (Daphne) and the other later finds out and wants to help them (Harry). The next chapter of that should be up soon.

Other than that I'm working on various other ideas including a Pixar's Inside Out and/or Sander's Sides inspired Haphne. (I just love the potential of the Department of Mysteries to have some of the weirdest workplace accidents.)

  Hanahaki Disease AU. Harry Potter was going to be the death of her, though Daphne Greengrass doubted either of them counted on death by heartbreak. Still she has to choose between giving up her love or dying, or does she? Love is Harry's greatest power after all. Angst with a happy ending.

** Well, after a few weeks where I managed to turn out multiple chapters, real life caught up to me and now I'm trying to get the next part of my ongoing fic posted by Friday, which will be like . . . 11 days after my last update? Argh. But that's just how it goes. I'm going to try to be productive tonight and get some words typed up, at least.

It's the same between the wars gen fic, Auror murder mystery thriller that follows Moody and Charlie's class that I've spent the last year working on, but, hey, I keep making progress, and that's what matters! Here's to a lot more weaponized apparition and dragons.

*** Okay quick thing here.

Dont ever worry about the amount of time you have between uploads. That is the easiest way of rushing your work, getting sloppy or worse putting fanfiction ahead of your primary methods of support. Because of its improbable chance of creating wealth, fanfiction will mostly be labeled as a hobby. And hobbies are always second to major life things for a reasonable adult.

So take it from an author of two fics with months between updates at times... Dont sweat the upload times.

** I'm writing a Tom Riddle-centered ultra-rare pair with Nott Sr., taking place during the early 1970s. Nott Sr. kind of ballooned into a favorite foil for me after using him in my last fic. In this story, Tom offends him right as he's starting to rally his supporters for the first war, and has to go through some personal discovery to learn how to apologize for that. I feel like I'm reading a piss-poor apology on Twitter or IG every day, so Tom's plight is a way to illustrate how a good apology requires a recognition of harm. Give it a shot if you enjoy low-stakes Tom Riddle!
