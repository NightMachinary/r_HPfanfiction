Hi everyone. I'm looking for some Slytherin Harry Potter fanfictions. My main problem so far is that most Slytherin Harry fanfics I've come across have an overpowered Harry, one dimensional arsehole Gryffindors, and from my limited knowledge of the Harry Potter fanfic community what I can only describe as some sort of dark lord Dumbledore in all but name.

~~~~~~~~~~

I'd like a fanfic where:

- Harry is in Slytherin (obviously).
- No character bashing, or if this is too hard to find then at the very least limited character bashing.
- Grey character moralities.
- Non-overpowered Harry. I don't mind him being advanced for his age, but nothing too ridiculous.
- No Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ginny.

~~~~~~~~~~

The two fanfics I've read like this so far are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7038840/1/A-Chance-Encounter]['A Chance Encounter' by Spectre4hire]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13507192/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Ashes-of-Chaos]['Harry Potter and The Ashes of Chaos' by ACI100]].


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) One of the best worldbuilding and believable slytherin harry fanfiction ever.

Very long and easily readable at just about 1 million words.

These words may seem daunting but believe me, the writing is so good that you will forget those hesitations.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter enters the wizarding world unaware of the dangers that lurk beneath the surface. Struggling in class, he can barely make a feather float, how can he fulfill the destiny everyone expects of him from this? His only hope in tipping the balance in his favor is to delve in the more esoteric magics. With a Harry Potter focused on divination, mind magic and necromancy.

** This one is mine. Maliciously compliant Harry is obviously a Slytherin, but he's not very interested in solving mysteries. He's just there to learn magic and eff with people who annoy him by being rude.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE.

** The "A Very Slytherin Harry" series on AO3 is good. Harry has normal age level abilities, his closest friendship is with Blaise, and it's well written. Severus is half decent. There's a green and purple snake called Jax that Harry can talk to. There's about seven instalments, with the final one still being updated (it's definitely not abandoned, I noticed it had been updated last month).

** I'm going to plug my series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn). Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all in Slytherin and the series has an emphasis on politics and world building. I'm currently towards the end of the fourth volume and it's 230k words and counting.

  Chessmaster Volume I. AU. Harry discovers that cleverness is the best way to outwit Dudley and his gang, which leads to a very different Sorting. While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain. Sequel complete.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836][The Heir of Something or Other]] is only about 14k long but it's a nice little what if snippet. The author, dirgewithoutmusic, does a lot of HP what ifs like this. This one has Harry in Slytherin and befriend Millicent. As far as I remember, Harry himself does not end up with anyone just yet at the end.
