Hi all :)

I'm trying to find a fic that I read a while back (I believe on ao3). I can't remember much but, here goes. Harry somehow wishes himself into becoming a women in his sleep. Like he was longing to be anyone but him or some such thing and bam (!) he woke as a girl the next day. I think its like 5th year-ish. Anyways, he (now she) panic contact dumbles (or maybe Sirius first...) and its confirmed that her magic "made things right" and turned her into a girl or something like that. All else that I can remember is that harry has a hard time coming to terms with things and Sirius ends up being a rock star about it in the end. I think it also might have featured the extended Black family and female cousins (but, I also might be mashing 2 fics I read together about the same time). If this sounds vaguely like a thing that you've read (or written) please let me know! I am obsessed with this fic and its driving me crazy that I can't find it again.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

*** If this isn't the story they were talking about they managed to accidentally sun it up pretty well.

  in a burst of accidental magic, Harry uses legilimensy to see pictures of his mother, and wish magic turns him into a little girl who looks like Lily. Vernon dies, and Petunia looks for somewhere to move. In Crawley they meet a little girl who also has accidental magic and with Petunia's knowledge and Dan Granger's cunning, plots are made. Fem! Harry, an experiment for me.
