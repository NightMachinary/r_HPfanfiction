** If its explicit then it falls under the MA rating which FF.net does not allow, they cap at the M rating.

If its not explicit, please just stop reading whatever offends you and don't abuse the report function. Personally I think the MA rating should be allowed but I won't tell you not to report them.

*** I don't report anything, I just don't read them. I just wish it was more explicit before I started the story.

*** Second that. I would love to have the MA rating available. It frustrates me to cut my stories when they go full on brutal in order to upload them.

** Yeah, no. Everyone has different tastes. The slippery slope easily becomes AO3's "nightmare of a thousand tags."

**** It does: use the Search within results and include the unwanted with -"[thing]" like this one: -"M/M" -"Thor" -"Avengers" -"Sherlock" -"Teen Wolf" -"Winchester" -"Glee" -"Once Upon A Time" -"megamatt"

It works with partial values and applies the filter in all the searchable fields.

***** Unfortunately every author on AO3 seems intent on tagging their stories with every tag there is, regardless of whether the story involves it.

** A tag would be nice, I guess. There are the ratings available, but I wouldn't be opposed to a "trigger warning" system of sorts for chapters.

Would drastically reduce the amounts of reviews a'la "OMFG you baited me into reading this. This triggers me hurrdurr"

** I agree with you--I think there should be a sexual violence tag. I don't mind reading "normal" violence, but I really don't like reading about sexual violence (or graphical violence against babies, but that's another matter entirely).

You nicely summed up why they don't expand detail on their tags. Once you go past violence the categories become unwieldy.

** I honesly can't understand this issue, i mean it is a description of something that didn't happen. How can it trigger anything? I would understand better if it was a video, but these are words o.O

I hate when the violence is unrelated to the plot or just needless, but if you need it because the ripercussions on the character are important on the plot i'm all for it.

*** I can understand the point- you're reading a story, identifying with the main character when suddenly they've stepped on a wasp's nest and it describes their panic and the pain and the buzzing... which would be cool from a suspense/horror perspective but if you'd recently had a similar experience or have always had fears about it, being confronted with that situation without warning would be unsettling.

To the OP: Don't read any of my Holly/Spiral stories.

The reason why fanfiction.net doesn't have a tag for it is that they don't have a tagging system at all. Just genre, rating, and most relevant characters. If they were to implement a tagging system now, the bulk of their archive wouldn't have any anyway.

**** Exactly , i understand that's polite to put triggers at the start of the chapter unless the story is dark and the trigger goes unsaid.

Even better would be a google docs page with the triggers and chapters related . It's more or less what HPMoR did.

PS: you just reminded me that i stopped reading HE and the Spirl path for no apparent reason , and i was searching something to read. I'm stupod :P

** On ff it is agents site rules to have sexual or explicit scenes, therefore there is no reason for that tag.

*** Incorrect. M rating allows for sexual and/or violent scenes/mentions. They may not be explicit.

[[https://www.fictionratings.com/]] - This is what FF.net uses for their ratings.
