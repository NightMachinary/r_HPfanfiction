I want to start out by saying that the Weasley's as individuals are good people and characters. Ron is my favorite character in all the books. I also think that the Weasleys are great for Harry.

- Giving Harry a Weasley sweater without really knowing him in book one
- Ron, Fred, and George breaking Harry out of the Dursley's house
- The twins giving Harry the marauder's map so he can be with his friends
- Ginny talking Harry out of several bad moods in books five and six
- Ron in pretty much everything he does with Harry

But I was thinking and I couldn't think of five good interactions between the Weasley siblings. The more I thought about it, the more negative interactions piled up and the positive ones were left almost empty. The only positive one I seen is the Twins dancing with Ginny at either Yule Ball or Bill's wedding. I can't remember which one. There are more instances of Ginny hanging out with Harry or Hermione than with Ron. The most prominent interactions I could think of are these:

- The Twins constant teasing of Ron and Percy
- Percy distancing himself from the family and the younger siblings pushing him further away
- Ron and Ginny's bad argument in book six, I believe. (Ron thinking Ginny as a "scarlet woman" and Ginny teasing him about his lack of romantic experience)
- Nobody seems to notice that their only baby sister is off killing chickens and summoning basilisk
- Ginny tripping Ron in front of Fleur.
- The Family's disbelief of Ron's prefect status

JKR probably had it so ingrained in her mind that the Weasleys were such a great family that she didn't bother to write positive scenes between them.

I can't honestly believe that Ginny or the twins never got their asses beat for a lot of the stuff they did. The only mention of any such discipline was when Ron talked about Fred trying to make an unbreakable vow with him.

** It depends how you look at it. Not all sibling relationships are perfect and the Weasley children clearly aren't the best in treating each other well. So yeah it is pretty much overlooked because they are so well liked in the Harry Potter world.

Look at the Weasley twins for example, they are the typical bully type. Ron came after the twins and they tormented him, maybe Fred and George were jealous when they were little and it just continued until later years? Ginny was probably a no go because Molly wouldn't allow it. (With Ginny being her only daughter after 6 boys and all)

Bill and Charlie were probably the cool older brothers, Percy wasn't that much older than the twins and he was the guy who stood out like a sore thumb.

There was more, Percy was extremely protective of his younger siblings. Ginny in COS, Ron after the 2nd task and he tried to warn Ron from Harry in that letter. (At least his intention was not bad). Then Bill who let Ron stay in his house in DH and told nobody of it. Ginny doing stuff with the Weasley twins. Ron not hesitating to go down into the Chamber of Secrets to get his sister out of there etc.

*** I love that moment in GoF, and it didn't even register with me until a recent re-read. Percy did not hesitate to jump into the lake to help Ron to the shore, during the second task. Percy was obviously uncomfortable with the whole premise of live “hostages” in general, and also specifically with his brother involved.

It should be noted that at that time, Percy was already on the outs with his family, and he was firmly devoted to his fledgling ministry career. Yet he walked into the lake in front of everyone for his younger brother, though Percy was there in a professional capacity. It's all the more notable as a “family thing” because Percy and Ron weren't known to be particularly close. Percy was just being a big brother.

** Not sure I agree with this. Given the stipulation that I'm an only child, what I read in the books and observed in the movies was mostly what I would have expected from a close family with (mostly) good relationships. She wrote that family almost perfectly for that type of family. Also, something many people seem to ignore in this fandom is the age of the people we're talking about. These are early to mid teenagers for the most part. There's gonna be a lot of nastiness, but the tight knit family aspect that the Weasleys foster counters that very easily.

Molly is not some horrible helicopter parent, but she isn't fine; and each of her kids represent that in one way or another. I think this was the author's intention, though not to the extent bash fics take things.

**** I think all of those things just point to how different the wizarding world is supposed to be, as well as how the Weasleys aren't a perfect family. If there was some kind of scale for perfect families, the Weasleys would fall somewhere in the range of 7. Overall tightness, but with obvious flaws and dysfunctional aspects.

The point about Ginny is valid, but don't forget she was suddenly alone with her parents for an entire year for the first time ever. I can imagine that both the child and the parents would struggle with that dynamic, and that could lead to a desire for some space on the side of the child. And Molly I think I'd driven a lot by her brothers, even though it's not stated as such in the books. She's got a severe overprotective nature, and I think her interactions with Harry just amplify that. His receptiveness to it and her kids' somewhat abhorrent rejection of it at times just show that she's trying her best, but that she can take things overboard on occasion.

** Some of these problems can be explained. For example, most of the family interactions are (or at least seem) well intentioned but badly executed. And while they all have their disputs, they all gather together when it really matters (like Percy return at the start of the battle).

As for the "Family disbelief of Ron's prefect status", honnesty you can't blame them. How could they expect Ron to be prefect when there is Harry in the competition. Both boys are equivalent academicly speaking (with probably an advantage to Harry thanks to subjects like Defense Against the Dark Art where he is the best), Harry also has the advantage to play in the Quidditch Team (always good on a record). And while Harry may have the bad habit to disregard school rules for the greater good of the school, Ron is pretty much always in the list of culprits.

So yeah, when your little brother is in competition with someone just like him, except he is a little more (and I didn't even mention winning the Triwizard Tournament or the political implications of being The-Boy-Who-Lived) you are a little surprised when he win. Even Dumbledore admited he didn't pick Harry because he already had too much on his plate.

Plus I can think of some positive scenes between them. The older brothers concern over Ginny in CoS for example - they definitely notice something is wrong, there are many mentions of them forcing her to see Pomfrey, her having nightmares, them saying she is very upset by Mrs Norris etc. The badly executed but well intentioned attempt to cheer Ron up over the "death" of scabbers in POA by Fred and George. The fact that it was them that gave Ron the charming witches book, etc.

  Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares.

- Not believing her children's account that Harry was abused
- Believing Rita Skeeter over Hermione, a girl she knew fairly well by that point
- Not supporting the Twins in their endeavor
- Not trusting Harry with information that was very relevant to him
- Sabotaging Trio's preparation for the Horcrux Hunt

Furthermore, (if it's not another of JKR's silly plot railroading) she must have insisted to hold the Wedding at the Burrow. This was an utter insanity considering the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Britain, and it needlessly put the bride's family at risk.

Of course, writing Molly this way is good literary practice, but I don't like this type of people, not at all.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) does a great job here, I think. Harry ends up living with the Weasleys, and so we see a lot more of how they are from day to day. They squabble, but they're not nasty; they just, shall we say, take a very active approach to having fun. (Note that Harry deliberately uses his foreknowledge to smooth out some relationships, eg curbing Percy's ambition, so it's not /exactly/ the same as how they would have interacted in canon, but it's a great read.)

** Hold on, I think you're looking at things from a skewed angle there. First off, let me proclaim, so I can talk without creating a misunderstanding, that the whole Weasley-bashing concept is based on a ridiculous premise and that I do like them in canon.

But the reality is, that I think they didn't help Harry nearly as much as you make it out to be and I furthermore agree with all the points you made that doesn't show them in the best light as a family.

What Harry got from the Weasley family is positive interpersonal relationship, basically the diet version of a familial bond. What they did with and for Harry allowed the young boy to feel like he had something like a family, but they never really acted like a real family should have to support their child or sibling. In other words: most of what Harry could take away was all in his own mind.

Maybe that's due to them not being the best family though, because they didn't act like they should have toward their own family members either.

The one matter I have been most concerned with as soon as I had read the Chamber of Secrets book was the way they dealt with Ginny. I'm fully aware that the topic has been flogged to death in fanfiction, but the fact that Ginny had been possessed for most of a school year (without any of her siblings noticing or acting) is bad enough already, but that she didn't get counseling or any other kind of magical treatment, or that there has been no other lasting reaction from the Weasleys is pretty disturbing.

A child's mental state can be a very fragile thing, especially when they undergo a traumatic event. The closest thing I could compare that possession to in our own lives is rape and we all know that some people never get over that even with all the counseling they have had since the event.

There are plenty other small things, such as the fact that Molly Weasley was content to let her own underage family members clean out the home of a dark witch by hand and at times apparently without adult supervision. That they didn't help prepare Harry for his hearing at the ministry in the same book doesn't help either. Granted, nobody could have known that it would balloon into a full-on trial in front of the Wizengamot, but even a child facing an underage magic violation hearing should have received /some/ preparation. Instead Molly kept Harry too busy and Arthur lead him to the cave entrance and let him fight the cave monster on his own.

Pretty sure there's more I can't think of right now, but added to your own list of things, I see a clear pattern that the Weasley family home life wasn't as amazing as it was made out to be by Rowling.

*** They DID notice something was wrong with Ginny, but she wasn't possessed 24/7. Any interactions they had with her, were with the real Ginny. They were 16, 13,4and 12, they were never going to guess she was possessed, or cursed, or anything. Percy kept dragging her to Pomfrey, and the twins kept trying to cheer her up, and Percy kept trying to stop them. It's not their fault they didn't realize she might be petrifying people and killing chickens!

As for Ginny - why would you tell Harry about any treatment she might be getting. Ginny was a side character we barely saw anything of, and that turned into a blushing mess around Harry. Add the Weasley pride, and it's very believable that Ron was told to not tell anyone.

I also think JK is not good at dealing with the fallout from traumas. I'd say it's difficult to write adventure fantasy books that include Harry going to counseling to deal with melting Quirrel.

Also, the family suffer from the same thing most adults do - plot convenience. It's not fun to read about adults dealing with everything for kids - the kids have to do things themselves.

She indicates in CoS that she is worried about Harry's homelife and was considering an intervention, but nothing ever comes from that. Making an abused child that kind of hope and then not delivering is unforgivable IMO. Like, she knows at several points that Harry is suffering there, yet she just sends food and cakes.

I know that it's not really on topic, but having grown up as effectively an only child, I wished for a family as large as theirs, and I've seen a few that were exactly like the Weasleys, and then there were the families that were probably the model for the Simpson's religious neighbors, but those were the exception, not the rule...

** I follow a huge Percy Weasley fan on tumblr, and they've made a lot of great points about how a family environment like that can be toxic and harmful to certain types of people. The Weasley family was a godsend for Harry, because he never had a real family, but from the inside looking out it was fairly dysfunctional. It seems like a lot of the kids struggled to receive positive attention or to be understood and accepted by the others.

My dad is a lot like Ron and Percy in that he comes from a huge family and struggled with issues of self-worth as a middle child, and later got the hell out of dodge to "make something of himself" in a government position. My mom also comes from a big family that was extremely toxic, but was like the older 2 in that she was the talented older sibling that the other kids tried and failed to live up to. I think it's easy for people who aren't familiar with big families to idealize the Weasleys because they don't know how bad an environment like that can get and they don't recognize the red flags.

** The books are from Harrys POV so we dont see any interaction between the Weasley siblings, or letters sent from Bill and Charlie. In the movies, in the background, we see Ginny sitting with the twins a couple times. Not unreasonable to think it happened more often than Harry or Ron noticed.

** Big families are generally like that. But I still have a HUGE issue with them not getting Ginny help. I know they were poor....but still. Harry should have gotten help too.

*** I think that's a wizarding culture thing more than a family thing, all of Hogwarts should have gotten therapy at some point but it doesn't seem like it was a thing.

** Most of your problems with the Weasleys interactions among themselves are leaving me confused. Other than not noticing Ginny being possessed and disappearing for periods of time in Book 2, the rest of it is quite normal and common behaviour for large families.

  The Twins constant teasing of Ron and Percy

  Ginny tripping Ron in front of Fleur

  The Family's disbelief of Ron's prefect status

Ribbing between siblings and sibling rivalry is the most normal thing in the world. Percy's behaviour of saying hurtful things in the heat of the moment and having too much pride to apologise is also quite normal.
