So I was reading the Prince of the dark Kingdom and got to chapter 148,\\
my question is: Is there a continuation of this fic or is it abandoned and incomplete?\\
Or I am I plain stupid for not understanding it somehow ended then and there?


** As far as I know, it's abandoned. It's one of the fics that I never started reading because it's not finished.

*** It is a bit sad, the writing was exceptional. The world building unique and the characters memorable and deep. Do we know whatever occurred?

**** Yeah it's been five years since it was updated. There had been months between updates at times, but nothing more than a few months gap. I've tried to find any social media that the author is using to see what happened, but I've found nothing. My hope is that the author got some amazing job or something and just doesn't have time to write anymore. I think that's much better than the alternative.

I would love to see this story finished someday. There were so many unanswered questions. I normally never read abandoned stories, but I had stumbled on this one very early on and was hooked from the get go. I had commented about the story a few days ago in another post and seeing yours has convinced my to do another read through, it's been almost two years since I last read it.
