Seems like I can't find a fanfiction that scratches my itches the right way. Maybe I'll be lucky this time.

I prefer *E on Ao3* or *M on FFn*. Please no porn without plot but also not the longest of slow burns.

At least 1k words but you know the longer the better.

/A creature fic would be the cherry on top but not a must have./


** Fueled Anger by Kaitabi on FFn is complete and a pretty good story. Features a female Zabini. Clocks in at 187k words in 28 chapters.
