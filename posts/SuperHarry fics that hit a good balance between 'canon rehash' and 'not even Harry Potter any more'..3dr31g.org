I want the plot to progress differently to canon, but the universe to still be that of Harry Potter.


** This is only two chapters so far, but it's my favorite Super!Harry ever, and I think it's closer to what you're looking for.

**** I know, right?

The other one I'm dying for an author to write more of is linkffn(Messing With Time), you and the OP might like it too as Harry has some super-powered shields due to time travel. It sort of gives me the same feel of really good writing and not taking the subject quite seriously, but definitely not a crackfic either.
