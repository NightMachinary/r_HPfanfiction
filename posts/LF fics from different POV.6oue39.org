  Neville's seventh year at Hogwarts presents many challenges, but he is his parents' son. This was originally written for the springtime gen exchange on livejournal. Thank you to kennahijja for beta-reading.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

***** The Snape Chronicles badly written? O.o Why do you feel that way? It's true that Snape is whitewashed but the writing is one of the strongest parts in that fic. It's the most immersive, comprehensive account of a character's life I've ever read. It takes into account many outside factors like class and time period. The descriptions of Occlumency is fantastic, and so are his initial teaching years. Still highly recommend it for those who want to read a different pov.

****** Well i feel that all it does is showing snape this wonderful guy.his abusive attitude towards children is just because he had to. I disagree with that, i think it is a bit childish.

  Admit it, you've always been curious about what the professors were thinking while Harry, Ron, and Hermione got themselves into all kinds of shenanigans.
