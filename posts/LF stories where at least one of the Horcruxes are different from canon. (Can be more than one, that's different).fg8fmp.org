Just kind of interested in seeing different objects being a Horcrux. What would happen if the Sorting Hat had been one? Gryffindor's Sword or something else? Would it affect the characters more, or not much of a change?

It does NOT have to be the main part of the story, it can be a minor part.

Can be on ANY site, anyone can be the main character. I'm fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

NO Lord Potter or Harem Harry. Would rather not have overpowered or super intelligent Harry. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful than in canon is okay, but I'd rather have it be somewhat believable.

Would also rather not have character bashing if possible. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash on a character is normally a no go. If it's a more minor part of the story I suppose that's fine, but I'd rather not have any, at possible.

Would like for it to be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Can be as close to canon or AU or anywhere in between.

Harry travels to an AU. THAT night, Voldemort used baby Harry's murder to turn Sirius's skull into a horcrux
