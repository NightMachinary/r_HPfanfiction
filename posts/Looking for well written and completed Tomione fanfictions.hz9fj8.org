I thoroughly enjoyed [[https://my.w.tt/MLSZXogVt8][Veal & Venison by Patagonian]] and I'm looking for fan fictions that are similar to this book.

I'm just getting into the world of Tomione and I'm loving it, although sometimes I feel like they don't depict Hermione and Tom's character accurately. If you have come across a book you think surpasses Veal & Venison--or just a good tomione book in general--let me know!

Thank you for reading and I appreciate the people who recommends. Have a nice day.


** Haven't read this one so cannot suggest something similar. But I'm going to read it now.
