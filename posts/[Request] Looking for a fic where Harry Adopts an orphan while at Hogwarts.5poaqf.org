I am trying to find a story I previously read. What I can recall is Harry helps out with an orphanage and eventually adopts a little girl. This takes place while at Hogwarts. I am not sure but I think that it is a Harry / Hermione story and that the orphanage is in Hogsmeade.

Can anyone help with finding this story?

  Harry is sick and tired of always being kept in the dark, of being lied to, and of being protected. He's had enough and he's going to take control of his life. Takes place at the summer before sixth year. HHR. Slight HBP spoilers. Some Dumbledore bashing.
