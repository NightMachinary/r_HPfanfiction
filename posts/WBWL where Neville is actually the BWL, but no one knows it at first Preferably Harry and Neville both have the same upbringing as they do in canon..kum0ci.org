#+TITLE: WBWL where Neville is actually the BWL, but no one knows it at first? Preferably Harry and Neville both have the same upbringing as they do in canon.

Basically the title. I don't like any major character bashing (a hard thing to find in WBWL fics, I know), and would prefer a fic where the Potters still died on Halloween night and Neville was still raised by his grandmother. Neville-centric POV preferred but not necessary.


** Do you mean Neville is actually the chosen one, which is different than BWL, or somehow nobody knows Voldemort went and killed the Longbottoms...somehow, and the lestranges went for the Potters? Because the second option actually requires that everyone /does/ know he went after the longbottoms, died, and Neville survived, because thats the impetus for the lestranges (+barty) to go after the other family.

** Wouldn't nothing change? Technically both Harry and Neville do extremely large parts in the killing of Voldie. So if Neville was the Chosen one I'd say he did his bit. Besides one of the Maine caveats of WBWL is the brother thing, because it has to be someone nearby. Otherwise they'd figure it the fuck out.
