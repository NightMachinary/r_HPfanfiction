I'm trying to write my first story, it's about Harry having a twin but can't think of a good name for him. Any suggestions / writing tips?

Edit: It's supposed to be a clever/manipulate twin.


** It should probably be a 'common' name in the mold of James, Harry, Lily, etc. (though it might be funny if he was named Fleamont). Jack? John? Tom? Paul? How about Ron!

Alternatively, a more complex idea, free of charge: what if James decides to name him after one of his best friends, and calls him --- you choose --- either Sirius or Peter? In the former case, the boy has to deal with being named after the man he thinks sold out his parents. In the latter, he's all happy and stuff about being named after a hero... then comes the revelation.

** Keep in character, the evans line likes flower names (for girls) while the potter line likes "normal" names (Charlus, James, Harry) So another male potter child should end up with a realistic normal name, such as Adam, Sam, Chris, etc. Dont go overboard with wizarding names, -see scorpius, severus, dumbledore, as such ridiculous names are not a naming convention the potters nor evans are known for. (also most of the ridiculous names tend to belong to the darker families, with more normal names the further towards the light they belong)

I'd go further and say realistic normal /British/ names.

Sometimes I'll see the name of an OC and it just sounds American

**** I remember looking up popular baby names in the UK during the early 80s and there were quite a few "American" names up in the top 100 back then.

** Something common and not obviously evil (i.e., don't look at Slytherin students for inspiration). The key is for it to fit in with James, Lily, and Harry's names.

Options: David, Daniel, Tom, Andrew, Paul, Matthew, Mark, Luke, Jack/John/Evan, etc.

Also, if this is a WBWL fic, I suggest looking up pet-peeves for those.

** Give normal fairly middle class English names (by English, I mean names for people in England). Don't give ridiculous American names like Todd or Walter or Skylar (yeah, I read that one). Don't go for Latin names either - no Roman Emperors please.

If male, a few examples would be William, Charles, George, Henry, Richard etc

Female, avoid the flower names. It's overdone. Anne, Catherine, Victoria, Elizabeth are certainly better than Rose, Violet, Iris, Lily, or their variations.

** Names often come with associations. If Harry's brother is meant to be weaker or less heroic, you may want to choose a less heroic name. If the twin is equal in courage or has counterbalancing traits, you may want to stick with the 'royal' names that aren't already used for the Weasleys, like Edward, John, or Richard.
