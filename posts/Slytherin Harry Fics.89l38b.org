Preferably going until seventh year. No harems. No Lord God-Emperor Potter please or obscene plots. If it could be complete that would be cool.

This might be a bit much to ask, my apologies.


** linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectere) is currently in first year, doesn't update super frequently, but has amazing writing. Hermione is also in Slytherin, and the characterizations of Snape and Aurora Sinistra are amazing.

Of course I gotta rec my own series as well, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn; The Chessmaster: White Knight). I'm planning on writing it all the way through seventh year; first year is complete, and second year I've finished writing and am updating once a week. The fic features Harry, Ron, and Hermione in Slytherin, has multiple points of view, and a healthy dose of politics and worldbuilding.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy. However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

  Sequel to The Chessmaster: Black Pawn. AU. Tensions continue to rise both inside and outside Hogwarts with the announcement of the International Scholastic Quidditch Tournament. As international influences begin to creep into British politics, Dumbledore isn't the only one worried for the future. Thomas Gaunt is concerned as well, but for very different reasons...

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11619807/1/Bad-Press][Bad Press]] by AshaMerc is a really good recent fic. I wrote a review to the author awhile ago that basically summarize my reaction since I'm too lazy to write my feelings again. So here:

#+begin_quote
  I just found this and I have to say that this is so good! I especially love how you did not stick to cliche tropes and kept everyone essentially in character. You don't even truly bash anyone either, which I am grateful for. Dudley's mindset makes sense (even though it somehow makes me want to hit him across the head more than usual). Harry's time in Slytherin also makes sense. I like how you kept him close to cannon Harry as you actually develop him in the environment he is placed into. And Harry making friends with Fluffy was something I have not came across yet. I literally had a picture in my mind of a little boy taking a nap next to an overly large 3 headed dog. Also, Fort Invisibility made me realize that they are all eleven years old. The childlike innocence in that was a nice touch.

  Despite the Dursley's best efforts, they are unable to stamp the freakishness out of Harry Potter. Much to their horror, the dreaded Hogwarts letter comes for Harry...and their son as well. What will happen when Dudley goes to Hogwarts with Harry Potter, intent on telling the wizarding world how terrible their saviour truly is?

Just a heads up in case it's not your thing - it's a Dramione fic (hence, why I know it exists lol), the author used Harry's influence to mold Draco in a way that it happened.
