Does anyone know a fanfiction during the first war with no prophecy and the marauders have to find the horcruxes? Maybe they learn about them from Regulus or someone else. I just really love the marauders and think they deserved a better end.


** There's this fic, linkao3(face death in the hope by lullabyknell) , I hope that's close to what you need. I've read it like 6 months ago, I hope that I've got it right. It's very well written, and, although not completed, the work is over 200k, so yeah. Instead of the prophecy, Harry is there with Regulus and they both help the marauders. Hope this helps!

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

*** Yeah I've read this one. It's a good one, but I'm searching for a fic where like harry isn't there or like still a baby ? They don't know about the dark future that awaits them ? There is no prophecy, or it still didn't happen. Thanks though !!
