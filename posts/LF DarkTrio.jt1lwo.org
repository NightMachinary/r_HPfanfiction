So I'm looking for Dark!Trio stories. Ones where Harry, Hermione, and Ron are already Dark by the time they meet, or they become Dark naturally, reakly anything that isn't a jarring "oh btw we're actually dark and have been all along." As much as I love those fics, they do get old after a while.

Any paring except Harry/Voldemort is fine. Preferably minimal bashing, aside from that everything goes.


** You should try /The Sum of Their Parts/. Post-Hogwarts. Not necessarily "Dark", but they become dark to protect Teddy from the actions of the Ministry. Dark!Trio against the world

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** Brah. . .

You renamed it from "And Three Makes It Whole" to "The Dark Trio" cause the first felt corny? No, the second one is corny, the first is a good title. . .

That said, looking forward to reading.
