** I love this idea. I think one of the easier ways for her loyalty to be broken in her early days is she somehow stumbles upon the truth of Voldemort's half-blood origins and considers it beneath herself to follow him. She fights against him not necessarily as a "good guy" but because she feels that purebloods should not have to bow to any half-blood.

Some ramifications:

- She'd never let Sirius get locked up the way he is. Guessing she'd hate Peter because she always saw him as weak and when stuff went down she'd out Peter as the traitor somehow, getting Sirius a fair trial.
- Perhaps having her AND Sirius on the side of the good could turn Regulus back to the good either before he gets killed or before he gets in too deep with the Death Eaters.
- The attack on the Longbottoms goes down differently. With the Lestranges and Crouch Jr doing it without Bellatrix, perhaps they are fended off completely or only one Longbottom is permanently damaged/killed.
- I can't decide if she'd be mortal enemies with Mad-Eye or they'd bond over their distrust of Snape.
- I think she'd be friends with Aberforth, grow to respect McGonagall, constantly be at odds with Dumbledore.
- Of course her and Sirius would butt heads over Lupin and being a werewolf. Probably some significant battle moment where Lupin helps save Bellatrix or someone she cares about would lead to her softening to him.

I like the constant crazy aspect though. Paranoia, recklessness, unable to follow orders would be her near-constant traits. I'm really not into the self-harm stuff but I could see that being an aspect. Maybe a bit too reliant on the firewhiskey. She'd also have a bit of a nasty streak with battle spells but never crosses over into the Unforgiveables.

Edit: Let's say she was unable to prove Sirius's innocence and Harry ends up with the Dursleys. If she found out about his mistreatment at the hands of muggles I imagine she'd do a lot worse than pigtails and ton-tongue toffee.

**** Well I think a few would, but the problem would be having the evidence that is enough to persuade them to leave. They'd need some hard evidence and the balls to leave since they all considered it a death sentence. And as important as blood purity was, another important thing is power. Some still would've stuck with him even faced with the half-blood news because they feared Voldemort and believed him to be most powerful.

It would probably all hinge on what it was that Bellatrix discovered and would others believe her. Being crazy wouldn't help her case.

I actually write a lot in my life as a lawyer, and I journal for myself personally, but never sat down and wrote extensive fiction. I once wrote a few thousand words of an original fiction about high school kids experiencing an apocalyptic event, think like Red Dawn meets War of the Worlds type stuff, but that fizzled out.

***** Look at cause and effect. Regulus is dead before the prophecy is made. You can save him via Bellatrix's defection, but then she wouldn't know about the prophecy, the hunt on the Potters and Pettigrew's treason because there is nothing in her actions which would have that impact. If anything, Bellatrix defecting makes the war easier for the order, which would delay if not prevent Pettigrew from turning traitor.

Or you write an AU where you change everything as you need to, but then your divergence is no longer just "Bellatrix changes sides", but everything you need to alter in order to align Pettigrew, Regulus and and Pettigrew already as a traitor. Which means that you either change the timeline around the prophecy, Snape's part and, consequently, Harry's age, or you deage Regulus. But that would mean that he isn't the one sent to the cave, Kreacher isn't poisoned and so on.

****** Bellatrix discovers Toms heritage and is contemplating if she should abandon him or stick with his power. That is until she over here's Regulus and Kreature talking. The two share what they know and decide to defect and try to get Narcissa to com with them. Regulus wants to go for the Horcrux immediately but this time takes Bella and Narcissa with him instead. Narcissa is a potions genius on par with Snape amd has the Black library to study from. She identifies the potin and feed it to transfigured pig. Bellatrix deals with the inferi when the pig gets the water whilst kreature takes them out one by one.

Bellatrix kills her husband and leaves, Regulus jumps ship to a safe house he has in the south. Narcissa truly loved her husband and couldn't bring herself to abandon him and her son. Instead she stays and fakes a pregnancy to avoid Tom.

Lucius cannot help but brag about his accomplishments so when his recruit, Severus Snape, brings him a prophecy to pass forward he naturally tells his wife all about the rewards he would get and how doomed the Potters and Longbottoms are, such a joke that either boy could possibly be prophisised to defeat his lord. He also liked to tell about his other recruit, Peter Pettigrew, who revealed the Potters location.

When Harry survives the three see him as there way out, Regulus helps his brother and saves him before he is arrested or even spotted. Sadly Dumbledore still suspected Sirius and does not let him see Harry. Finally at Diagon Alley they all meet for the first time. Harry gains three competent adults to rely on, a fourth adult of questionable sanity who is fiercly protective of him and an ally in Narcissa's son draco, not a best friend but someone who can help him at school in this new world.

Of course it still takes untill after first year to completely trust them and Quirrell still is burnt at Harry's hand. Second year has everybody too terrified of Harry's aunt Bella to accuse him of anything that could upset him, despite her adoration of the idea that Harry is Slytherins heir. Third year brings Lupin into the equation who hid in america for the past twelve years and with some butting heads at first with Bellatrix strong opinions all is put to rest when the man proves useful when he protects Harry from a group of acrumantula that come after him when he crashes his broom into the forest playing quidditch (It really wasn't his fault considering they shot webs at him and knocked him off).

Fourth year brings the tournament amd Igor Karkaroff proves he never abandoned the dark lord and merely betrayed those who defected after his fall. Crouch was a small price to pay so he could search for his lord. He even killed Durmstrangs headmaster so he could take the place and come to England. As much as he would like Durmstrang to win his Lords wishes are more important so he enters the Potter boys name amd ensures he gets to the cup. Surprisingly it didn't take much effort to get him there and he only need stall the others.

The graveyard goes down the same with the devistating death of Diggory and Voldemorts ressurection with Peters hand. When Lucius returns to Toms side regardless of his wifes wishes that he doesn't. Narcissa takes Draco and leaves Malfoy Manor when he invites the dark lord to his home.

When Harry is attacked by dementors he goes to Number 2 Privet Drive where Remus and the Blacks live to be close to Harry and look out for him like they had since he turned eleven. Narcissa claims responsibility for the patronus charm and with her popularity in high society is proven that dementors were there and Dudley as Harry's cousin already knew of magic.

Alastor Moody had taken a liking to Harry and agreed to help him further in some defense training under the orders of Dumbledore as the Blacks refused to entrust Harry to him again after the Dursley wards failed to stop the dementors. At first Moody was at odds with the four Blacks, Bellatrix more than others. Bellatrix's care for Harry confused him but eventually they come to a mutual respect for each other in their quest to defeat Tom. (A similar relationship to Sirius and Snape)

Fifth year brings Fudges denial of Voldemorts return, that is until Bellatrix killed him fir his smear campaign against Harry. Similarly to the mysterious dissappearance of Rita Skeeter in January 1995. The new Minister of Magic Narcissa Black formerly Malfoy starts the war effort to keep the death eaters at bay and with the assistance of the press was able to spread the truth of his origins. The concrete proof they had gathered and revealed led to a huge slow in Voldemorts recruiting and even defected some of his current followers. None of the inner circle but still a large blow to his forces.

(((((Thats a start summary of what would be different or could be. The rest if the war could go in any direction and there are a lot of possibilities for it. I like the idea of Bellatrix spontaneously killing Fudge and Skeeter and frustrating Sirius and Remus for doing so. Naturally she is too skilled to be caught and is nver suspected. Narcissa being politically inclined as she is takes advantage if it and solves that problem. You can use my thoughts and shape the war how you like or just take bits of it. If you wanted to write it I would be happy to give some more ideas or thoughts.)))))

** Something To Live For by Grey Silver Hawk, has that kind of Bellatrix, if I'm remembering it right. It's a Harry x Bellatrix fic though. Author got insecure from reviews of their writing and stopped updating it after chapter 13 to rewrite last I checked on it. It's also a Tom Riddle is good story.

** I picture this oddly like Grace from Keeping Mum - great movie, Rowan Atkinson is in it and he is brilliant. But yeah, the mum in that movie is quite mad and solves most of her problems with homicide.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
