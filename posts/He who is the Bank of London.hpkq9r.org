July 31 1991, Gringotts Bank, London

"Griphook, how many galleons are in my vault? I mean, there must be several tens of thousands here!"

"Well, the amount in this particular vault is reset each month to about 200, the rest are... well, we don't rightly know, all we know is that they are decidedly NOT galleons. All we can tell you is that there are roughly 23000 of them in this vault alone, with many times that in the main Family vault"

"Wait, Family vault? You mean this isn't all of it?"

"Indeed, although you cannot make withdrawals from the main vault nor make direct deposits until your magical majority at 17. You may still visit the vault, but nothing may be added nor removed"

"Huh... maybe next year, Hagrid's probably waiting on me..."

-Time Skip

July 31 1998, unknown location, London

"This is it, huh? A fancy hotel... well, let's see what all the fuss is about"

-Scene Change-

"Hello, I'd like a room please"

"Indeed, sir. Anything else you may need? Perhaps a tailor?"

"I believe what I'm wearing should do, I am trying to avoid some people at the moment"

"Indeed sir. Will that be all?"

"Actually, I have a question for you. Does the name "Potter" mean anything to you?"

"I cannot say it does, sir. It is quite common if I may say so"

"How about 'Bank of London'?"

"There has not been a Bank of London in residence since 1979, sir"

"That's... what was the name of the last one?"

"That would be Lilianna, sir. Lilianna Evanoska. Suite number 117 is available, 115 is currently in use and 119 is being cleaned for its next guest. Will that be all, sir?"

"Yes, I believe it is. Thank you very much, you have been a great help"

"Indeed sir, enjoy your stay at the London Continental"

-End Prompt-

This crossover idea has been floating around in my brain for the last bloody month in different iterations, so many ways to start it, so many ways to introduce it and I'm not exactly proud of this attempt at it, but here it is: a HP crossover with John wick. This one is all dialogue, mostly because I find myself unable to describe both the vault(s) and the Continental buildings as I imagine them. The vaults would be close to the original versions, but I don't think we have a canon description of the London Continental.

Several different premises could be set up with the basic idea of "most of the Galleons of the Potter family are not Galleons" and this specific version is decidedly NOT my favourite - my favourite so far will be my first attempt at actually writing a fic myself and involves a few well-known tropes twisted to a point where they can be recognized but are no longer the same. If I like what I come up with I'll post it, but it'll probably be another burner.

:: guidelines for prompt ::

the Potter Family left quite a lot of coin to their son upon their deaths, too bad most of them seem to only be usable at some place called 'the Continental'


** This is an interesting concept and I look forward to reading it.
