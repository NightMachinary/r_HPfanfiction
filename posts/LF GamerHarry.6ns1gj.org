  My 2010 Nanowrimo story. A crossover between Harry Potter and Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. Harry ends up in an ADnD world at a young age. Trained as a Ranger, when Dumbledore gets him back he's not a little boy any more.

  The magical world isn't as ignorant of muggles as it seems, and Lucius Malfoy has an idea on how to get Harry out of his way. Now Harry is in Japan and trapped in a virtual world of swords. Cut off from his friends and allies, and what he knew, he has to make new ones and get used to an illusory world that has become all too real. Welcome, to SAO Harry. Do try to survive.

** FYI there is a genre usually referred to as gamer!harry, which is different than what you are looking for(typically the world being an RPG and typically only for one character not everyone), so you might have been better off wording your title differently.
