After reading (or at least trying to) way too much Indi Harry fics, I feel like a lot of authors don't see the irony of their main character.

In Canon, outside of the main antagonist, Voldemort, Harry is also fighting against the Death Eater, and Blood Purity in general. And his very existence can be used as a proof against that, because, outside of his status as the "Boy-Who-Lived" and everything that came from that (Parselmouth, Brother Wands . . .), Harry is totally banal :

- He is not a Pureblood, but a Halfblood
- His family is an old one, but not one of importance
- He is wealthy, but not rich
- Even is name is a simple one, "Just Harry"
- The only notable fact of his family is their ownership of a Deathly Hallow, the cloak.

And yet, such a banal man managed to win against Voldemort, proving once again that Blood does not determine the value of someone.

​

And yet, in most Indie Value fics, author seem to really want to make Harry someone exceptional from the start :

- His name become Hadrian (because Harry is too simple I guess?) even if the 2 names are not linked (Harry is more a contraction of Henry but let's forget it).
- His family become a Noble House, with him being the Heir of so many family he can single handily decide the fate of the country (even though no country would let a simple man have all the powers; inheritance, noble or not, does not work like that; Canon show that Wizengamot is more a judiciar body than a legislative one; and nothing in Canon show that the Magical World has any form of Aristocratic society, even the Wizengamot looking more like its member are elected than inheriting a siege).
- He inherits so much money from his parents than even the Malfoys look like paupers in comparaison.
- And finally, is some occasion even Lily stop to be a Muggleborn, but is a Pure Blood or Halfblood at best, descending from a Squib line of Grindelwald, Slytherin, Merlin, anyone you want but he is important.

My problem with this take on the character (outside of the fact that is often lead to a wish fulfilment story where the MC encounter no opposition, which are full of cliches and generaly boring), is that it gives pretty much the opposite message than in Canon.\\
We go from a "normal" character that rised above others but is still attainable, to someone who is so much over the rest that he is more like a god than anything else. And the fact that most of his new "advantages" are inherited, came from his blood, just say that the Death Eater were right and Blood does matter. It's the same thing than with the story that makes Hermione a Pure Blood. You go from "the talented Muggleborn that prooves that Pure Blood are not better" to "the living proof that PureBlood are better".\\
It's a good thing that Indi Harry is way too egoistical to even think about sacrificing himself, because Neville speech would have a way different outcome with this character.

​

More than 10 years after the end of the story, I don't understand why new authors keep reusing these cliches. Don't they have better story they can take inspiration from?


** Why they keep using these cliches? Well...if you look through any number of other fandoms, particularly young adult literature, most anime and a not inconsiderable amount of western tv and comics, you will find that most of the same tropes in HP are actually pretty consistent with Indy!Harry stories. Most people start in fanfiction and read these types of fics and think "wow, that was incredible, that's how canon should be."

/And then they read more. And more. And more./

And at some point, one of three things happens to such fanfiction readers:

1) move on to another fandom to see the same things but a different insert POV

2) leave fanfiction in general (temporarily or otherwise)

3) recognize that the reason it wasn't written that way is because its not interesting and falls apart under scrutiny as a story.

Indy!Harry and other genres like that are appealing because it sticks to the sense of "righteous judgement" that most people feel they didn't see in their own lives. Thats particularly prominent for teenagers - I'll bet everyone can think back and remember when they felt like they were so misunderstood and only they had the right idea. Not that people aren't misunderstood or the like, just that it seems like almost all teenagers feel like that at some point or another. And its really cathartic to see Harry or Hermione or whoever steamroll everyone else or make them all out to be idiots or evil or whatever.

A better idea for an Indy!Harry fic would be to see Harry being all high and mighty, only to have reality kick him to the curb and bring him back down to Earth. I have seen this touched on a few times, but those instances are few and far between.

There are examples of people getting massive inheritances. For example, Charles V inherited both the Habsburg lands in the HRE (and got elected as Emperor) as well as the Spanish Crowns, Burgundy, the Netherlands, Naples and the Spanish Viceroyalties in the New World (and his Son got elected King of Bohemia). He ruled half of the known world because of who his ancestors were.

*** If possessions and titles get past down with a fairly strict set of rules based on birth, this type of scenario is not uncommon, yeah.

Though it is fair to note that even someone like Charles V had to greatly struggle to actually /control/ his territories - because the local nobility in Spain, Austria, etc, all had their own power bases and rights that he couldn't trample over. It wasn't ironclad control over all of it - and though he was the most powerful single individual in western Europe, those other power bases did limit his de facto power.

Edit - and to make clear, that last bit is in there to imply that a Harry that got a bunch of powerful positions/titles dumped on him as a kid should absolutely be seen as a target by those around him - either looking to further their own position by taking advantage of him, or by those supposedly subservient to him looking to get out of their responsibilities/duties, or the like. He should have to /struggle/ to keep his de jure powers/rights - everyone just accepting and bowing to him is kinda ridiculous. Doubly so if, while those lordships were vacant, everyone got used to not having to do anything with them.

*** I admit it is possible for an individual to inherit a lot of lands, especially in these case since Charles V was the country (as its ruler).

But in my example, I had more in mind something like the Chamber of Lords in the UK. I may need to do some verification, but I'm pretty sure it is not possible for an individual to occupy several chair of this Chamber, and in someone was in a position to inherit several seats, there are either rules in place to prevent it, or the weaker seat is probably taken back by the ruler who then can give him to anyone he wants.\\
I just can't imagine a situation where Harry arrive with 50% of the voting power (especially if you take into account that there is a 15 years gap before the last time his father may have sieged and his "rebellion" who usually happen in his 4th or 5th year. What did the Ministry do during this time when half the Wizengamot was absent?).

**** Well, the House of Lords (or upper chamber of parliament, or just Parliament, depending on the period) has never been a consistent institution - the powers and constitution it had in the 1300s would be very different from today!

I know that in England, it used to be possible to delegate a secondary voting title to your heir and give them a vote that way, even if you personally could only have a single one - but I'm not aware how long the rule saying that each individual, no matter how many ranks/titles that would individually let them have a vote in the house of lords, could only have that one vote has been in place.

Harry coming in with 50+% of the voting power is certainly something that'd be very weird - and presumably people wouldn't know that he'd actually control/command those seats.

** Because all those indy!Harry authors didn't understand that Harry IS NOT a superhero á la Marvel films.

Also, most of these authors don't acknowledge [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/the-problem-of-peter-pevensie-and-the-problem-of-wands.html][The Problem of Peter Pevensie]]: how to make teenage hero credible in the conflict with the adult supervillain (read more in the referred blog post), and instead of really facing the problem head on, they rather rewrite Harry in a superhero according to their (I am afraid most often) teenage test.

It is remarkable how Harry Potter in the whole series, even to its end and to the defeat of Tom Riddle, IS NOT a superhero. In the last chapter (before Epilogue) of DH, he is probably a way more battered and more experienced but still distinctively seventeen-year old teenager, not even a graduate of Hogwarts, who overcomes the evil mostly just by using weird semi-legal tricks and technicalities. There is no doubt in my mind that if he had to meet Voldemort in the fair head-to-head battle á la the duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore in the Department of Mysteries, he would end up (as somebody called it) like Sackville-Baggins of Hardbottle facing a barlog.

We see the defenders lose badly, then Voldemort calls off the attack, the defenders lose badly again and then Voldemort's elite forces, who just tore through the defenders (DA, Order, a few Volunteers) like through wet paper, being taken down by a few creatures armed like a 13th-century peasant mob. And then, rather than through his own merit, Harry wins through some incredible circumstances (disarming Malfoy gave him the EW allegiance).

There are plenty of satisfying ways for an underdog to win which do not make him OP or the antagonist a moron.

I always thought that the sheer numbers should spell the end of Tom Riddle. If you have thousands of normal wizards and witches contra few hundred (maximum) Deatheaters & co., both sides armed exactly the same (i.e., with wands), then there is no way how Deatheaters could win. The Wizarding Britain is not at all like the Muggle Britain, it is more like the Wild West, where everybody eleven years and older have the most deadly weapon by their side all the time. Which is also the only reason, why all school kids have seven years of mandatory preparation for battles.

But they are not. The Death Eaters are not above lethal force and if you look at the duel in the atrium, Voldemort and Dumbledore are leagues above anyone else.

During the Battle of Hogwarts, Voldemort was able to fight the best the resistance had three on one and was coming out on top. Bellatrix was winning against Ginny, Luna and Hermione, probably amongst the best of their generation. Hell, look at how easily Snape slaps Harry at the end of HBP.

If Voldemort had Hogwarts (fortified high ground) and the Order would be assaulting it, they wouldn't make it within 50 yards of the walls. Voldemort's frontal assaults most of his forces, but that was just him being a moron.

And no, Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, how much I like them, are not the best the Light side can offer, I hope. Perhaps the best witches of their generation, but otherwise they are lovely and smart, but still mostly untrained teenagers fighting indisputably the most dangerous witch on the bad side. BTW, to the quality of Death Eaters ... this one Bellatrix Lestrange was capable of disarming five Death Eaters, snatchers and whatever Fenrir Greyback was organizationally in Tom Riddle's forces.

******* That's misrepresenting it though. Those 6 largely survived precisely because they were holding the prophecy, which Voldemort wanted more than anything. As soon as it was actually adults fighting, the DA (even Harry, to and extent, until Sirius died) were immediately relegated to running away or being protected. The fact that The Death Eaters were practically waltzing into Hogwarts is a testament to the fact that he had way more competent forces, especially wizard ones.

The Potter Family has:

- Invented Skele-Gro, Pepperup Potion, Sleekeazy's Hair Potion.
- One of the original Aurors in America.
- Sat on the Wizengamot multiple times.
- Peverell family descendant
- A Black family daughter married into their family.

The only reason Potter wasn't a Sacred 28 family was because the author of the damn book was a butthurt pureblood bigot.

The Potter family was most definitely in Britain longer than the Malfoy family, and many other families.

The potions alone would keep them swimming in money for god knows how long. Then you add in investments, businesses, and whatnot over the years. They are swimming in money. Maybe not Malfoy levels of money, but they have a shitload of money.

- Maybe that would make Potter family prominent in America, but from what we see from the books British magical community concern itself very little with the ‘outside' world. So a Potter being an original American Auror wouldn't really matter to anyone in Britain, allowing they even know of that.
- About Wizengamot - doubtfully were the only family to do so.
- Being of Peverell descendant are certainly noticeable, just not a common knowledge
- And Black Family also was also connected to Crouch, Rosier, Longbottom, Burke, Prewett, Crabbe, Blishwick, Weasley and many more families, not all of whom were a part of Sacred Twenty-Eight

While no paupers, there's no proof that Potters were ‘swimming in money'. The ‘Potter mansions' and numerous accounts in Gringotts of witch the vault Harry visits is only a small part are all fanon. In fact, we can only compare Harry's vault to the Weasley's who are continuously called poor (and not just by Malfoy). The books really don't give a clear picture of how well-off Potters were in compression to other families.

Sorry, if I came off too hard, I came across too many “Potters were an elite of elite” lately.

2. That was listed more as a notable fact I could tack on.
3. Yes, but only the influential or rich would be able to do so. Pure blooded society where power and lineage matters.
4. Just bragging rights to add to the list the other person said wasn't there.
5. They wouldn't allow one of their own to marry into a family if they weren't rich/influential or both.

I was saying they had more money than was in Harry's vault. Speaking of vaults, Lily was sensible, I don't see her dumping ALL of the potter money onto Harry in his childhood. That's just responsible parenting.

Back to the money, I meant between more than what is shown that Harry has and the Malfoys.

​

I wasn't saying they were the elite. Probably many generations ago. But not in the last three. And it does look like all the Potters did something with their lives. So it's not like they were just throwing money away. They could have been slowly building on it.

​

Edit: It looks like Harry's Grandfather was liquidating the assets (when he sold the potions business), so that means besides the manor, there wasn't much else in the way of Manor*S*. I could definitely see him liquidating things because of the Grindelwald/Voldemort war.

They are not meant to be paragons of literary greatness or anything. They are 'what if' stories written for fun and are supposed to be read for fun. If it's not enjoyable for anyone they can just pass up and go read something else.

I guess what I find most annoying is the pointless discussion on "why do others keep enjoying something I don't?", because that's how likes and dislikes work. You can factor in age, source material and the individual readers literary... literacy, and sure those things affect our taste and preferences and the kinds of stories written but I think that when it comes to reading fanfiction we all have the right to enjoy what we want to.

** >He is not a Pureblood, but a Halfblood

So is Voldemort and Dumbledore, didn't stop them from keeping Wizarding Britain wrapped around their fingers.

​

>His family is an old one, but not one of importance

They married into the Peverell line, around the late 13th century. It means that by that time, they were already considered influential enough to be a good catch for a Pureblood family. On par with the Gaunts. Who knows if they are the oldest Pureblood family remaining in Britain, but they are definitely at the top, along with the Gaunts and Blacks.

​

>He is wealthy, but not rich

He has 'mounds of gold coins, tower of silver ones' and I forgot how the book refers to the knuts. Based on the movie at least, he has at the very least 1 million USD. At the very least. I think the book refers to it as a small fortune. Elon Musk is pretty poor too, if you compare him with Jeff Bezos. And after Sirius died, Merlin knows how rich the kid actually is. He is still one of the top dogs in the country either way.

​

>Even is name is a simple one, "Just Harry"

That's more a personal decision of James and Lily than any kind of indicator regarding the Potter family. Except for the mind-boggling awesome naming tradition of the Blacks, wizarding names don't deviate much from the standards of their current era. Some notable Potter names include Charlus, Fleamont, Hardwin, Abraham, Ralston. I agree it's a lame name when you have such awesome options available, but again, it says more about his parents than about the wider family.

​

>The only notable fact of his family is their ownership of a Deathly Hallow, the cloak.

The members of the Potter family that we know of were all accomplished Wizards. Their original ancestor was a Potion Master and acting healer for surrounding Muggles, another served in the Wizengamot (is the hereditary seat thing canon or fanon?), another was a famous Auror in America. Fleamont's hair potion sky-rocketed the Potter fortune, and James didn't get the chance to do much because he was killed.

​

There is no irony, or exhausted fanon trope, the Potters /were/ old, rich and influential.

*** At the time he first enters his vault, he has nothing, and he had never had anything. Even small amounts woul look huge, added to the fact he is not a big person. The Gaunts are not a good reference point because they fell out of power, and we aren't given enough info to determine whether or not the Potters were famous prior to canon. I have only read the 7 core books, because the new stuff has to much pandering to modern society and lost most of it's charm.

**** They are a good reference points, because it means that in the 13th century, both families were considered pure and reputable enough to marry in by the Peverells. And one of those families was the heir of Slytherin, a still relatively recent thing. Potters must have done something really impressive to match that. From what I can deduce, it's in the 1600s that they (the Gaunts) started collapsing, although there is still a known Gaunt at Hogwarts in the 1700s. Potters totally were famous prior to the First War.
