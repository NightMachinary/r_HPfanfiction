I've been reading a lot of different pairings lately but realized I haven't found many good Harry/Tonks or Harry/Luna fics. Therefore I am looking for suggestions for those pairings. If possible I would love them to be post OotP and not have Horcruxes. I am tired of reading Horcrux hunt stories so I thought it would be nice to find something where they defeat Voldemort some other way. Not everything I mentioned above is mandatory but its just something I would like. Thanks.


** My usual H/L recs . . .

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1500318/1/Luna-s-Year][Luna's Year]] by michelle-31a is the oldest of the lot. The world-building is nothing spectacular, but it's a neat little story with some interesting ideas and characterization, and written before Horcruxes were canon.\\
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5241798/1/Pathetic][Pathetic]] by A-Kubrick-Spent has a whole host of content and style issues, but there is a lot of good to say about its imagination. It's also the only take on a darker Luna I've ever found remotely engaging, but your mileage may vary.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][Conlaodh's Song]] by enembee should not be read before reading its prequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By the Divining Light]]. If you haven't read them before, you should do so---not because of the pairing, but because enembee is one of the finest authors in the fandom.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=116462][Harry Potter and the Hogwarts Rift]] by Illyich follows a somewhat cookie-cutter template, and the characterization of Harry is a little wonky in places, but it contains some very compelling moments and ideas. One of the best pacifist!Luna characterizations.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862145/1/Contemplating-Clouds][Contemplating Clouds]] by Tehan.au is simple but very intelligent fluff, and well worth reading despite being abandoned after 8,000 words.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11201910/1/Different-Together][Different Together]] by Hippothestrowl is an intelligently humorous GoF story that relies on a Rowling-like grasp of character voice and comedic beats. Unfortunately, it kind of goes off the rails in the last chapter, and some have found Harry's characterization to be off-putting.

** The two best Harry/Luna fics I've ever seen:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6862426/1/][The Quidditch World Cup]] by QuirksnQuills. Takes place a few years after DH, very well constructed.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1075603/chapters/2160140][Tomorrowland]] by winterfool. The stronger of the two, in my opinion. Picks up right after DH ends, it's the best HP fanfic I've read, bar none.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter And The Summer Of Change)

This is a great Harry/Tonks with no Horcrux hunting. It's a fic which unfortunately hasn't aged well (Magical Cores, Lord Harry etc) but it actually does them well unlike many current fics.

Not taking anything away from it. I love this and the writing is great, it just has a few overdone plot points but it was written before they got out of hand so it isn't that bad comparatively.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and Ice Cream Delights)

I'm currently in the middle of reading that one. It's H/L. I haven't finished reading yet, but as far as I can tell, it's set during 6th year, but doesn't really follow the books. I'm still on chapter 16, but no mentions of horcruxes yet so far.
