  In which Harry was sealed inside Tom Riddle's diary during his second year and tossed into another world, upon where he finds himself in Bruce Banner's lonely hands. With the life Banner leads, he supposes that he shouldn't be surprised by this "Harry Potter" being. Really, there wasn't enough coffee in the world to deal with this.

** linkao3(The Best of Intentions by Atri) though this one mostly uses it as the inciting incedent of the fic. It mostly follows Ron experiences in Dumstrang.
