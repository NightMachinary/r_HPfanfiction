Does anyone know any good HP fics that are large-scale AUs?

By "large-scale" I don't mean fics that just change how Harry grew up, or has him Sorted into Slytherin, or gives him a brother, so that he becomes more badass and changes the plots of the stories, or anything like that...

I mean fics where the wizarding world in itself is different. I'm talking "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]]" levels of change, where the society in itself is different from how we see it in canon.

I have an idea for a fic with a fundamentally different magical world, but I'd like to see how/if other writers wrote large-scale AUs.

*** Thanks!

Firebird's Son is the only of these I've read, and I didn't really like it...

...that is, I kind of liked it right up until Luna Lovegood actually appeared and the "setup" part was over. After that, everything went downhill and the fic got annoying and stupid. (Darth Marrs is great with setup and worldbuilding, but stinks at payoff. And I don't like how he writes Luna.)

The other fics look interesting though!!

**** Also, those are less AU, but still significantly different enough and with quite a lot of wordbuilding about the whole setting.

[[http://tinyurl.com/jkc2qeu][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in heavily magical Hogwarts. It focuses on school life and author's variation on magic system. Only the first year is complete, but it stands on its own and theoretically there is a new version planned. With theoretically being the key word here.

Original Description:

#+begin_quote
  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - This fic is still starting up, but has strong (though slow) worldbuilding. It's about non-BWL Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. On temporary (I hope) hiatus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] - Heavy AU with a Slytherin Harry who have a twin who was raised with their parents. Contrary to what you my expect it's decent. The fic is held down, by using quite a few bad ideas in worldbuilding (though they are mixed with good ones), and weak technical writing in early chapters, but the plot is strong enough to warrant the read. Ongoing with irregular updates.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

****** There are way more changes.

Alexandra has a society that is more focused on a worth of knowledge, thus very pricey books, there is nobility, but in a different vein than in usual Lord Potter stories, places like Hogwarts and Diagon Alley differ pretty heavily, etc.

Black Luminary has a society where there were heavy reforms after the fight with Grindelwald (and some basics are AU), so, for example, Hogwarts starts at 13, but young wizards are allowed to use and learn on their own magic earlier (includes muggleborns) and there are also other changes like a vastly differing from canon history of conflict about muggleborns. BTW: A new chapter was just published, so it's no longer on hiatus.

Prince of Slytherin also features many changes. Some are stupid, some are cool. For example, we just got an infodump about a political system, and just before that was changed Azkaban history. Then there is a whole matter of propaganda and Ministry's falsifications of history.

As I said, not as AU as the ones above, but they still have quite a lot of changes that you may find interesting.

** I've written two such AUs, "Patron" and "The Dark Lord Never Died".

In "Patron", the magical world developed differently after the Statute of Secrecy went into effect in 1692. In parts, they are far more progressive than muggles, in parts they are far more archaic, but most importantly, their society is far more magical. Magic is used all the time. Robes are layered with spells - which have both defensive uses in fights, as well as serving as a status symbol, where robes can cover anything, including clothes made up by illusionary fire. Religion is different, and the wider parts of the magical world are different as well.

In "The Dark Lord Never Died", Lucius Malfoy faked Voldemort's survival after Halloween 1981, and took over Britain in the Dark Lord's name - to promptly betray him. He has raised the muggleborns as a loyal janissary guard and weakened all rivals of his. But Dumbledore, who went into exile in France with his allies, has been preparing, and when Voldemort returns, he plays both of his enemies against each other. The society in Britain is very different - nominally, muggleborns are second-class citizens. In reality, they are Malfoy's highly-trained enforcers, and the Aurors and Hit-Wizards have become a joke by letting anyone in based on blood, not skill.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kigdom) Its a big AU where Voldemort won the first war and created a sort of wizarding society (that actually seems to work well even if it morally questionable at times). He is still ruthless and is willing to do immoral things to get his way, but he can also be strangely charming, reasonable and knowledgeable and sane. Has a lot of wordbuilding and focus on magic.

*** I've seen this recommended a bunch of times and I have three separate bookmark folders in which I saved it but I never actually read it.

I think at first I was under the impression that it's slash (probably because virtually ever fic that has Voldemort and Harry tagged /is/) but it isn't right? Is there actually a pairing? Romance is something fairly important to me in fanfiction and i don't want to start reading a 1 Million word fic only to find out halfway through that it's Harry/Draco or something...

**** Nope, no slash between Voldemort and Harry at all. They have a mentor-reluctant student thing going on. Voldemort is quite knowledgeable about magic, and involved in rhe politics of his wizard society that he set up and is trying to set up Harry as his Protege and a public face of wizarding britain. Harry is just going a long with it (since you cant exactly refuse a dark lord) while occasionally learning about some magic from him. Their relationship is very unique and sometimes strange but no slash at all.

There is some mention of background slash pairings but they are very minimal. And even though Sirius and Remus are often referred to by Alpha and Beta (Since both are werewolfs in the AU and involved in the werewolf society), there is no romance between them. No pairing between Harry and anyone really. He gets together with a few girls a few times since he is a teenager but nothing serious or long term.

Overall, it's a fun if super long read. Lots of action, humour, snarky dialogue, great characters and lots of world building.

***** Thank you. The word count still kind of puts me off a little but it does sound excellent. I had the same thing happen with 'Emperor' and when i finally forced myself to start it I didn't stop until I was done. Granted, I was disappointed with where the fic was going but it was still an excellent read.

I'll probably start this eventually and then be unavailable to the rest of the world because I won't put it down until I'm finished.

**** From what I remember Harry dates a few people, but the main focus is his relationship with Voldemort and how it changes both of them. It's not romantic but it is pretty intense. One of my lines is "We've done things the most passionate lovers or the most hateful enemies would have done to each other", though I can barely remember the context (I read it years ago).

*** I think I've read "Greater Good." I liked how the "Grey Harry" was actually presented as morally-grey, like how he managed to be both a pretty nice guy and a total prejudiced bigot at the same time.

Pretty refreshing when "Grey!Harry! usually means something like Harry as a badass antihero who's mean to the meanies and Does What Needs To Be Done...
