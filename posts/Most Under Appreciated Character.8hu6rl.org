**** We barely know anything about Regulus other than his most heroic moments. He may have had no issue with torturing muggles and muggle born and actually thought of them as low life beings. He may have had a terrible personality like Snape.

Regulus had been close to Kreacher since he was young. His fondness of Kreacher doesn't really tell us much of who he is as a person.

From the books, it seems like he just realized that everything about Voldemort was a lie and that everyone, including the loyal purebloods, would get fucked.

decent death eaters ftw

Regulus literally /volunteered/ Kreacher's help to Voldemort just days before. If he did not rise high in the Death Eater ranks, it certainly wasn't from lack of effort on his part. The kindest interpretation of Regulus is that he was new to the Death Eaters and naive in desperate desire for Voldemort's approval. Voldemort's disregard for Kreacher hit close to home and finally opened his eyes to his cruelty. That sounds an awful lot like Draco, or it would have, had Voldemort held Kreacher's life hostage instead. But that's the nicest interpretation. He could simply have been motivated by revenge for what Voldemort did to Kreacher, who Regulus loved. People don't develop moral compasses overnight, and regardless, it his highly unlikely that Regulus ever denounced Voldemort's ideology. He also struck no blow of any sort to Voldemort, just made the Trio's hunt for the locket much longer than it needed to be.

Whatever Regulus was, a decent person he was not.

******* It seemed like it was a very thoughtless act. An act of opportunity and vindictiveness. Possibly Regulus had failed in a task and knew he was going to be killed when he reported back to his master, so in a last vindictive gesture he swapped the locket with a fake and a taunting note. That sounds like something a death eater would do.

He also seemed a bit stupid. He should have at least told Kreacher about it being a horcrux instead of just a simple destroy order. He could have researched what it was instead of expecting a house elf to figure it out. If he wasn't yet in a dire situation with Voldemort then he shouldn't have left a note in the decoy locket to begin with. The note defeats the purpose of placing the locket there entirely so it wouldn't make sense unless he was just an idiot (Voldemort seems to surround himself with idiots so it seems likely). Why even deal with making a decoy to buy the 15 minutes of time it takes to grab the thing if you're only going to put a note saying that you stole it and intend to destroy it? Why not leave a note saying you had already destroyed it if you're trying to taunt him? The whole situation makes such little sense if you think about it and I'm leaning toward him being a vindictive idiot.

******* Much like Snape or Malfoy, he grew up with ideas of pureblood/magical supremacy and yet of those three, he was the only one to abandon Voldemort because he realised that he was wrong and not over a married woman or having to do the dirty work himself. That's what makes Regulus a good person, unlike Snape or Malfoy.

********* A counter-point: he was brought up by people who would not have taught him that being decent to house elves is a thing at all. Thus, that he was Kreacher's friend is a testimony to at least his potential to be a decent person.

Also, he was brought up in shade of Sirius, who got treated like shit for daring to stand out, and out of his cousins one got the Sirius treatment too and the other two got involved with Tom's croud too, to a lesser degree (Narcissa) or to a greater one (Bellatrix).

While yes, it's possible that he was an utter jerk who doesn't deserve to be called a good person, him turning on Tom /for Kreacher/ is not something you'd expect someone of his upbringing to do at all so the possibility of him actually being decent is still there.

****** Well, I would say that Regulus Black is definitely not under appreciated in fandom. Every fic I ever read about him praised him to no end and there are quite a few fics about them.

I never liked Alan Rickman as Snape (because he was way WAY too old to play him and that bothered me to no end and I would have appreciated an actually ugly person). What I like about Snape is that he was one of the very few characters who actually did something with magic instead of just learning some simple hexes and be done with it. I started liking him in HBP, simply because his notes showed that he in fact appreciated magic and was curious about it. Harry's lack of curiosity was always what bothered me most about him (well, on his part, on JKR's part it was the pure ignorance of what an abusive childhood does to kids, I think she really should have read about that a little more). I mean, Harry knew that he could talk to Snakes and just ignored it. I mean, WHAT?! You can talk to an animal. That is a once in a century chance to get to know a non-human being on that level, are you interested in anything at all?! Snape was the kind of character who would have explored that. He was curious, he wanted to explore, he wanted to know more and that is what I like about him. As for his personality aside from that, he is a true trainwreck, an abused child (and in a way more psychologically complex way than Harry for example) that never got or found any help at all. He never developed a way to make other people like him and he sure as hell does not like himself. His life has been miserable from start to end, with short red glimpses of happiness that could have been if he was a completely different person. This is in my opinion why some of us fans like him so much, we want to give him what he could never give himself. We like his raw potential and the pity we feel fills the cracks that occur when someone changes his character enough to give him a shot at happiness.

edit: I would appreciate an answer with your thoughts, instead of just downvoting me.

******** I would agree with you if we were only talking about adult!Snape, but I do not think that the teenage! or child!Snape had any social skills whatsoever and I do not think he had friends either. Lucius and him have never been friends at all, Lucius just saw his potential, much like the other Slytherins. No one stood up for him, no one tried to get to know him. They used him and of course he was extremely eager to deliver, but no one ever really liked him. He was a dirt poor half blood in Slytherin, he was an outcast. I think one of the things that really show his lack of social skill is that he does not take care of his appearance, though it is crucially important if you want to be perceived as powerful. Look at Tom Riddle, he knew how to do it.

As for your last poimt, I completely agree with you. Brad Dourif is still way too pretty in my opinion. I do not have anyone in mind since actors tend to be rather fit, but I would have liked someone with an actual huge hooked nose. Someone actually ugly, not just you-need-a-haircut-and-a-makeover ugly, but someone ugly enough to look weird under all circumstances. (and someone who is not ancient!)

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

** Percy Weasley, got more OWLs than Hermione, found himself acting head of a large department of the Ministry when his superior vanished before becoming an assistant to the Minster. Went from a loving supportive family to choosing his dreams over them. He had such high expectations and seemed to be on a huge upward trajectory within the Ministry, and I can believe that he refused to acknowledge that their might have been other motivations behind his career moves. He would have had to deal with the realisation that much of what he thought he build was just given to him. After the war he might have felt like an outsider to the family and in dark moments wonder if the others wouldn't have been happier if he was the one that died. I can imagine him and Harry bonding over feeling like fake Weasleys post war. Percy would act as a good link between Harry and Kingsley's ministry. I can imagine what he went through could lead to some major character growth shortly after the war.

*** This is actually a really interesting take on Percy. If Percy had been the protagonist in Book 5, the story would have been "Follow your dreams even if your family is against it." It's true that he handled it badly, but it's a generally good moral, at least for a western audience.

Look at things from Percy's perspective. Up until now, his family has been fairly level-headed and very much supportive of his ambitions. They're good people. They even took in the famous orphan whom no one else noticed really needed some help during holidays. But after Harry's recent episodes, he doesn't have to believe everything Rita Skeeter writes to see that there's /something/ wrong with the kid.

Now, out of the blue, Harry is says the sky is falling--that Wizard Hitler is back from the dead (which most wizards believe is impossible) in spite of a conspicuous lack of evidence and no other living witnesses. And Dumbledore believes him! Dumbledore is a wise and respected war hero and a powerful wizard, but he's also /old/. Even if he's not after Fudge's job, Percy has thought he was "a bit mad" since Harry's first year. Isn't it more likely that he's finally losing his marbles? Remember, Percy plausibly didn't know that Voldemort was involved in the Book 1 mess, and even though he knows about the Diary, Voldemort-in-the-flesh had nothing to do with that.

Suddenly, Percy finds that his normally level-headed family has swallowed Harry's and Dumbledore's story hook, line, and sinker. From his point of view, it's almost like they've joined a cult. He gets in a big fight with his father, even calling him a traitor for following Dumbledore, but he's too blind to how deep he is in the cult of Fudge to see how much he's overreacting. If Percy were the protagonist, the story would end with his family admitting Dumbledore was wrong and getting Harry into therapy, and Percy apologizing for saying all of the horrible things he did in anger.

Instead, one day, Fudge starts running around like a headless chicken saying Voldemort is back, and Percy becomes the designated traitor for all time and his forced to come back hat in hand and admit that his objectively very reasonable beliefs were wilful blindness the whole time.

**** Percy has also been a victim of the twins. Sure, there was Ron and the Spider incident but the twins seemed to set out to do the opposite of whatever he wanted, if they were supporting Harry then years of experience said they might only be doing it to spite him.

Also consider that Mr Weasley was in a dead end department, not particularly well thought off within the Ministry. Having a break with his father might even have been a good move career wise. We all know Arthur is one of nicest people in the series but he's not known for his competence. Percy wanted to rise above that, to be the best he could be. I can't help but wonder if Percy looked at his father as a person who made all the wrong choices.

***** Pettigrew is the embodiment of the ordinary nice guy stuck in a terrible situation. He was put in Gryffindor for the same reason Crabbe and Goyle went into Slytherin: because he really, really, really /wanted/ to, admired Gryffindor qualities, etc. But of courage, he had none. He became best friends with Remus, James and Sirius, genuinely so, and was quite a talented wizard too (he did become an Animagus as a teenager!!).

His friends would not see that he was not like them, that he was not a hero. Pretty much against his will, Pettigrew was roped into a war that every fiber of his being was petrified of. The moment Voldemort raised his wand at him, any semblance of a backbone within him collapsed, and he turned spy. Hating himself all the way, but too weak and cowardly to ever stand up to his devious masters, he was forced to condemn friend after friend to death indirectly, and finally James and Lily. And we know he didn't come running to Voldemort right after he was made Secret Keeper; James and Lily had been in hiding for some time. He hesitated. But in the end he gave in.

Post-1981, Pettigrew is a desperate man who considers his own soul forfeit. He literally has nothing more to lose. The one thing he treasured most of all, his friends, well, he's killed one of them, and the other two now want to kill him. With a sudden burst of malicious quick wits, for he is no imbecile, he cooks up that brilliant plan to frame Sirius, and after that is more than happy to be dead to the world --- to be nothing more than a rat, nothing more than an animal who never has to worry about moral dilemmas and justice and Dark Lords. Ask yourself. What sort of man, what sort of incredibly depressed man would content himself with the life of a fat old rat, never wanting anything more, never reaching out to any other thinking being?

Then in Second Year the very last of his hopes is snuffed out. His disguise is exposed, his last chance is destroyed. For 13 years he was content to be in inaction, but now he once again fears for his life, and once again that fear overpowers him, overpowers his conscience, overpowers his rationality. He tracks down the only being he thinks may yet protect his wretched life. Voldemort. And it hurts all the more now that he owes his life to Harry, to strong and courageous Harry who is everything Peter knows he can never be.

From there onwards Pettigrew is treated like /dirt/ by everybody. He ekes out a living, but the Death Eaters know only too well he's only with them out of desperation and doesn't give a damn about blood purity or the Dark Lord personally. They rightfully think he's pathetic (and he doesn't talk back) and treat him more like a crony, nay, a House-Elf, than like a partner. Indeed, in Pettigrew's case, the Dark Mark was no privilege --- it was /branding/ --- Voldemort gave him the Mark to be sure he could never turn back.

You say you have no idea what his goal or endgame was, but that's because he didn't truly /have/ one, save for staying alive. Pettigrew was a broken, broken man.

There's a lighter epilogue to that story, however. Pettigrew's last moments are of redemption. Actually helping is yet beyond him, but he refuses to stop the hero to whom he owes his life --- and dies for it. And you know the wonderful, wonderful thing.

He didn't become a ghost.

Peter finally dug up /some/ inkling of bravery somewhere in his soul, because he moved on to meet James and Sirius and Lily and everyone else, ready to face their ire and make amends.

And, one assumes, be forgiven.

****** You raise good points, but I do have disagree with you on quite a few.

The first is that you're saying that he is not an imbecile and wanted to live a simple rat life because he was depressed. It really is one or the other. If he wanted to live easily without blowing his cover, being the rat of a wizarding family is the absolute worst way to ensure that. Let alone being the rat of Harry Potter's best friend, since if his betrayed old friends would seek out anyone in the world it would be of course Harry. We must assume that Peter some kind of plot for his old master or him being the biggest imbecile in the history of mankind.

The second point is similar, why did he seek out Voldemort? You say that he was scared for his life, but he was a wizard and a rat, he could have easily went undercover in let's say Australia and would never be seen or heard of again. He must have known that his life under Voldemort would be horrible and definitely not save, why not choose running and living as a rat instead. Without any feelings of loyalty for the Dark Lord, wherever those might be coming from, him doing what he did does not make any sense.

******* For the first point, I think that's more of a Rowling mistake than a Pettigrew mistake. It certainly doesn't at all seem like Pettigrew was /up/ to anything as Scabbers; surely if he had picked the Weasleys to be of further use to the Death Eaters (and that strikes me as very uncharacteristic of Peter), he would have done something to aid his Lord in first or second year, or otherwise tried to murder Harry. He did not.

The second point is outright said in the books: Dumbledore's analysis of Pettigrew's character is that he has a sort of paranoid compulsion to seek /protectors/ whom he deems stronger and more reliable than himself. To his diseased psyche, hiding out on his own was barely an option in the first place, and out of the question once his first attempt at such a disguise had been blown. And the only man, as I said, whom he assumed may yet protect him rather than kill him, was Voldemort.

******* You can't be coerced directly (e.g. "tell me or I kill you right now"), but I don't think personal, not-technically-founded fear of the consequences of not telling would count in this context. I think it's hardly up for debate that Pettigrew didn't /maliciously/ want James and Lily dead; he gave Voldemort the secret out of obedience. What I'm saying is, I don't think Voldemort knew he was the Secret Keeper and asked him for the secret; but I think that /he/ felt he had no choice but to come forward and tell his Lord the secret, for fear of what Voldemort might do if he learned some other way that Pettigrew was the Secret Keeper and yet hadn't told him anything.

We don't /technically/ know when ghosts appear, but it seems clear that it's not long after death. (The one example we positively know, Binns, died in the night and was a ghost by morning.) From Mimsy-Porpington, we know that it's a choice of whether to move on or remain as a ghost upon death; my reasoning is, where would a ghost-to-be's soul /be/ in the meantime between their death and their haunting? Clearly not in the afterlife...

As for the forgiveness thing, I'm not saying right away. But forgiveness is a core Christian value, and the Potterverse's Afterlife as Rowling thinks of it is clearly some variation of a Christian Heaven. I'm not saying they'd hug him and have tea and crumpets on the first day, but just that they'd feel the same way Harry ends up feeling about Draco or the Dursleys --- doesn't want anything to /do/ with them, but bears them no ill will and will be cordial to them if they happen to meet.

Of course that's all up for debate, but I think he saw that the war was going badly for his side and wanted to be on the winning side. Of course his fear and cowardice plays a role here, but as a Gryffindor he didn't just want to run or just stop taking part in the war. He wanted to be at the center of it all, even if "glory" may be the wrong word in regards to serving the Dark Lord. He didn't expect misery.

Everyone is losing their shit over Voldemort, but this kickass young woman doesn't give a fuck. She joined the Order out of conviction and tries to keep morale up when everyone else is expecting Voldemort around the next corner. At 22 she is already an Auror and yer that wasn't enough. When the Dark Lord called, she took up arms to fight for what is right. She is the only young woman who kicks arse on screen (Hermione only turns 18 in the last book and Lily blows up Voldemort off screen).

Sadly, far too often in fanfics, she is reduced to pining after her shitty to-be husband (that arc was a true character assassination for Tonks) or arm candy for the MC.

Making that decision would not have been easy, walking into a battle that could leave your child an orphan would not be taken lightly.

They went to fight rather than stay with Teddy for different, individual reasons. Remus went to represent the family, but also because he'd rather die a heroic death than have to live with responsibilities he doubted he could fulfill.

Dora went because she had dedicated her life to defending the Wizarding world - that's what it means to be an Auror, and she couldn't live with herself if she could have fought but didn't, just because she feared losing. She wouldn't be able to face her fellow Aurors after that. It may have never occurred to her that she could die in the battle.

****** That reflects even /worse/ on her seeing as she was already remarried with children when books 5, 6, and 7 came out. I think she had postpartum depression which led to 5 but if 6 and 7 were the result of her pining after her ex-husband... Well, that clears up the Snape arc.

******* It was given as an explanation for the rather lacklustre execution of the canon pairings, which only made an appearance in the Epilogue of book 7. She said something along the lines that she would have written it differently at the time of the interview because she was no longer dealing with her ex.

Whether or not that applies to other pairings as well was not explicitly said, but you can't just switch off your emotions.

****** I've often thought she based Sirius on him, and that's why she made him so sexy and then had to kill him. But I can't see how that relates to what she made Tonks do to her tiny baby. Or maybe it does, which is kind of disturbing.

  But that she valued him (Lupin) more than her own child

I was referring to that part. Any normal spouse would have handed Lupin the divorce papers after the stunt he pulled.

** Uh, Dumbledore?

That aside, Arthur Weasley. Fought in both wars with serious risk to family. Joined a secret order to help contest the dark lord. Managed night shifts watching the prophecy in OOTP all while raising all the kids ever on a ministry salary.

*** Didn't fight in the first war, that's fanon. The Prewetts, who were Molly's brothers, were the only "Weasleys" that fought.

***** Not really, you can make sooo much muggle money with magic (without breaking laws or the statute of secrecy). Just fix mechanical stuff, multiply food or conjure stuff and sell it. That will keep everyone fed and clothed. Hell, even if he just got paid 30 Galleons each month, that is still at least 6000 Pound Sterling (assuming a Galleon is an ounce of gold and the historical gold price during the 80s).

Also, the Weasleys had considerable land holdings which can be either farmed for profit (really easy with magic to replace manpower) or for food.

Tl;dr: Magic makes you ridiculously rich, the Weasleys were not good with money or should have had a higher standard of living otherwise.
