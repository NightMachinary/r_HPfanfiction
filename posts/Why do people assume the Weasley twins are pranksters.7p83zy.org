In the fandom, the Weasley twins are often considered the spiritual successors of the Marauders. In this way, people make them 'master pranksters', even though we only see them actually do a few pranks in canon. (e.g., swamp in corridor in OoTP.) Instead, they make prank items. Even some of the items they make aren't quite prank items more as helpful, such as the Skiving Snackboxes and the Extendable Ears. Bearing this in mind, how did fanon morph them into these 'master pranksters'?


** Let's see...

- They set off a dungbomb beneath Aunt Muriel's chair during a Christmas dinner\\
- They enchanted snowballs to pelt the back of Professor Quirrel's head\\
- They enchanted Percy's Prefect pin to label him 'Pinhead'
- When Harry was being accused of being the Heir of Slytherin they walked behind him and loudly threatened people to stay away or he'd do serious evil and stuff
- Filch had an entire drawer in his filing cabinets of punishments dedicated to them\\
- They fed a Filibuster Firework to Fire Salamander to see what would happen

That's only through second book, but I sense a trend.

*** Yeah I think this is pretty apparent behavior consistent with pranking. Maybe not to the degree that fandom has inflated it to, but it is still pranking at its finest.

** Because they are explicitly mischievous jokesters in canon? Every time they appear they're making jokes, doing something silly, and breaking the rules. They describe the Mauraders Map as the secret to their success and view giving it to Harry as passing on their legacy. The twins certainly seem to view themselves as pranksters and practical jokers, so it makes sense that they would be the spiritual successors of the Mauraders because they were also pranksters and practical jokers. I also wouldn't be surprised if the twins took things too far more than once just like the Mauraders did.

As a side note, I find it somewhat implausible that the Mauraders called themselves that as anything but a joke.

*** I understand the jokesters thing, but pranksters? We only actually see one prank by the twins in canon. I know they talk about pranking the toilet seats, but it never actually happens as far as we know. I understand that they could have been pranksters and we just never actually hear about it from Harry's PoV, but then why does fanon make them such avid pranksters if we only actually see them prank once?

**** Once? They give people candies to make them vomit. They turn a hallway into a swamp. They turn Ron's teddy into a spider, and they try to get him to swear an unbreakable vow. That's just what I can recall off the top of my head, someone else made a long list.

**** I'm sorry but the idea that we only see 1 prank in canon is extremely and factually wrong. I would list all the times, but someone else has already included several of them in the current top comment of this thread and thats just through 2nd year.

I would also point out that what you consider a prank and what someone else considers a prank may be different.

So the definition of "prank" comes into play here. In the most basic of terms, any of their jokes/tricks/items that affects someone else causing some sort of embarrassment, annoyance, confusion, or ANY similar term is a prank. That happens quite a lot in canon.

**** Here's the thing. Fanon makes anything and everything a big deal as long as the mass of authors like it.

And Fred and George being pranksters isn't so far out as we read about them describing themselves as such and sometimes witnessing those pranks through the eyes of Harry. Thats is already more of a foundation than many fanon concepts have (take for example Daphne Greengrass). Furthermore you can expect a lot of practical experience when their shop is a joke and prank shop right out of the gates of Hogwarts.

The only reason we see so little of it is that it isn't the focus of the books. Its a small detail, often accompanying some plot relevant behavior or action of the twins.

** *Prank:* A practical joke, or prank, is a mischievous trick played on someone, generally causing the victim to experience embarrassment, perplexity, confusion, or discomfort.

Yea, by that definition (from a dictionary) and only looking at canon they are DEFINITELY pranksters. There are multiple examples just in the first few books, and a lot more implied by certain circumstances such as Filtch's (and other teachers) relationships with them.

** The twins are actually just dicks. I would love to see Harry's reaction to them if they had the same exact personality but just happened to be Slytherin beaters instead of Gryffindor ones and had the last name Malfoy instead of Weasley.

He wouldn't be able to stand them and would not be afraid to voice that opinion, especially since he wouldn't be trying to bang their little sister and therefore would not need to maintain a positive relationship with them.

These are the closest I could find considering only one of the Twins goes into Slytherin. Though both are time travel fics. Decent writing in both stories too.

  Part 1 of The Computational Error Series. George Weasley may be 40 years old now, but he still misses his twin dearly. And when he has the chance to go back to 1989 and see Fred alive again and stop everything from happening, he can't resist. George's relationship with everyone he loves, however, will change in the process. Time Travel. NoSlash. COMPLETE

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

**** Their personalities seem completely opposite to Slytherin though. Flashy, boisterous pranksters in Slytherin really make no sense at all. Maybe Hufflepuff, but certainly not Slytherin or Ravenclaw.
