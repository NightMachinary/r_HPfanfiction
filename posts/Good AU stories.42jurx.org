Specifically stories where Harry travels from one universe to another.


** Imho, the best completed dimensional travel story is *Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925)

*Para Bellum*, linkffn(9754483), is the sequel to *Delenda Est* and features some really great inter-dimensional actions. Unfortunately it's still WIP and has not been updated for a year. [[/spoiler][Highlights include Bellatrix's daughters pranking the Dursley's, Harry's meeting with Chief Unspeakable Hermione Granger-Weasley, Ambassador Sirius Black's talk with exonerated Sirius Black, and capture of Azkaban by Auror Captain Nymphodora Tonks and Special Undersecretary to the Minister Ron Weasley]]

#+begin_quote
  An ambitious Voldemort prepares to lead his armies into the Delenda Est dimension to topple Minister Black III. But, he has lost the element of surprise, and there is a Pre-OotP dimension in between his dimension and the DE dimension where he will have to fight Minister Black's armies, spies, and civilian meddlers, not to mention two Harry Potters and the infamous Black Triplets.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** I go with linkffn (What you leave behind by Newcomb), with a one year older Harry. A really good story that so far managed to make the AU very intresting. Of course it still has a long way to go and keep up its quality.

** My favorite alt. universe fic has recently been updated after a long hiatus: linkffn(Stunning Shifts by mindcandy). It has a bigger cast of characters with some unexpected additions in the mix. The basic foundation of the plot is greatly explored and adds new elements to the over-used dimension-travel-trope. I really like where mindcandy is taking the fic. I highly recommend it.

  While Luna simply smiled and nodded, Harry couldn't seem to wipe the expression of shock and disbelief from his face. Finally, he spoke. "And...if this plan goes wrong, and we all end up dead?" Michael rubbed the back of his neck. "Well, there's worse things you can be in life than a cautionary tale."
