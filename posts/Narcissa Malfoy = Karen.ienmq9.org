In a world where Draco picked up his entitlement and behaviour from his Blood Supremacist/Death Eater father and Narcissa "Can I speak to a manager/Do you know who I am?" Malfoy


** I'm not sure I would call her a Karen. I mean, the spirit is there . . . but she is rich.

A Karen would totally throw a fit in a restaurant because a waiter spilled a bit a water when serving, and yell until the manager offer her the meal. If the same thing happened to Narcissa Malfoy, I can't see her make a scene for anything, but rather later mention the incident to the owner of the restaurant (if she knows him) to have the waiter fired, or use her connections to ruin the reputation of the place and have it closed.

*** Alternatively if the manager /does/ offer her the meal for free I can actually see her growing even more offended over the idea of the price of the meal being great enough to be significant for her.

*** Narcissa is a woman of AUDACITY.

I feel like she'd actually screech and rave in the store because she KNOWS she has the influence and capital to actually back up her claims. Her husband is the one who puppeteers the Minister of Magic and is rich in his own right.

If she can look the Dark Lord (a known legilimens) in the face and lie, I don't think she's above bitching out some minimum wage employee in Diagon Alley

*** I think he is probably more prone to that sort of thing than Narcissa, but it's more fun (to me) to have Cissy as the Karen whilst Tom is emasculating her husband at Death Eater meetings for his numerous screw ups

** This seems more in line with Sirius's mother than Narcissa. Narcissa seems more like the sort that wouldn't make too big a fuss if something innocuous happened (like some ‘mudblood' mispronouncing her name) but would then secretly implicitly threaten the upper management into firing the unfortunate soul or giving her and her family special privileges/refunds. Still major entitlement, but a different kind. Draco probably is just as entitled, but his temper and arrogance makes him express it differently.

** I actually don't see her that way. She's way too passive aggressive, while a Karen is the perfect balance between proactive and passive aggressive to piss you off. In the scenes that she is in public with Lucius, she always allows him to take the lead. When she's with Draco in public, she might make passive aggressive remarks to him about people who annoy her, but the only time she truly becomes proactive is when Draco is threatened (she only talks to Harry when Harry directly threatens Draco and she begs and pleads with Snape to protect him during his Dumbledore's assassination attempts).

Her passive aggressiveness makes sense she is the younger sister of a psychopath who, instead of throwing a fit, will torture and kill you while laughing, and of a rebel who goes against all the values they had been raised with out of spite.

*** I'm English and know that the Karen meme is an analogue for a middle upper class (predominantly white) entitled middle aged lady who creates scenes over minor inconveniences and has a sense of entitlement so strong you could find it with just a compas. You can find Karen memes on YouTube.

**** That's what it started out as... It's unfortunately now becoming a fairly sexist meme. People are using it in other ways, often just to shame or hate on women in general, not just entitled assholes.

***** It actually started out as a sexist meme on 4chan. There was this joke about "Karen took the kids." It was basically about a horrible ex-wife - or an ex-wife purported to be horrible - who got custody after a nasty divorce. So there was a lot of misogyny tied into it. The whole 'complaining at a restaurant/calling the cops' thing came later but from what I've heard it blew up on twitter in a way that the original meme never had, which is why people are more familiar with the second usage. But the original usage persisted in some crossover of MRA and incel types spaces, and still comes out. Where it gets weird is when people who only know about the second usage share memes from the original usage and don't realize how they are promoting misogyny.

** I think Walburga is more like a “Karen.” Narcissa has a different passive aggressive vibe going on.
