Just ones like before 4th year where hes really like cheeky sassy badass whatever Or if they're after 4th year it's okay too but young Harry is funny


** Harry Potter and the Spiteful Sorting Hat by Jinxauthor (unfinished). In addition to sassy Harry, it has the best Blaise ever. “Malfoy, I wouldn't be your friend if we were the only two people in Slytherin.” linkao3(11660775)

And the snark never stops in Snapped by The Feisty Rogue (second year fic). First two paragraphs below. linkffn(11999343)

  "Scared Potter?" Malfoy sneered, and Harry snapped. He was done, finished, fed up with playing the innocent little Gryffindor with no common sense and a microscopic amount of intelligence. He rolled his eyes.

  "Why yes Malfoy, I'm terrified, can't you see me quaking in my boots? You, a second year child armed with a stick is the scariest thing I've ever seen. Please, please don't fatally injure me in front of three hundred witnesses and two teachers with your mean words and nasty smiles. Whatever shall I do?" The entire hall fell silent and Malfoy gaped. Harry smirked. Lockhart looked entirely bemused, and he thought Snape might be holding back a laugh.
