"Oh really? Is that so Mr. Potter? Let's put that to the test, shall we." Snape said coolly, a cold smirk twisting his face. Harry, Ron, and Hermione paled.

I could see this going one of two ways. Either A, Harry fails miserably, and has to acknowledge, yes Potions is a dangerous subject that requires a firm handed teacher, or B, he succeeds and Snape is shamefaced. Bonus points if Snape tries to sabotage Harry, but makes Harry look better instead of worse.


** It was all a part of Snape's plan to get replaced as the potions teacher so he could pursue the defence against the dark arts position.

** Canonically Snape doesn't have a firm hand, he just insults people after the disaster has already happened. I do expect replacing him with a random C student who took it seriously to be a big enough improvement to be noticeable in the OWLs within a year.

** How about C: He manages to succeed brilliantly at it, but has no real idea what he's doing and just makes it up as he goes along and yet, somehow, it turns out to work great.

*** We know Harry can teach Defense Against the Dark Arts. That's been established in canon. We've also seen a number of "TA Harry" fanfictions. I've never seen one, however, where he teaches Potions.

I'm pretty sure I remember reading a time-travel one where Harry ends up the potions professor and has to cram enormously for the position. (And also IIRC grades Snape/Lily's class based on how similar their potions were to Snape/Lily's)

** Harry easily would be, Snape is just terrible, he doesn't stop problems, just shouts at the kids who made mistakes after the fact, his teaching style is literally "follow the instructions on the board" no real input from him.

** The story Motivations by Jeconais has as a plot Harry joining a cross house club and one of the subjects they learn is potions. As a part of the plot Harry has Lucius Malfoy bring his pre-Hogwarts age squib daughter to Hogwarts and walks her through brewing a potion. Prior though he embarrasses Draco when he attempts to brew a potion and fails miserably putting into question Snape's teaching skills. The story is a good read.

** I once read a fic, where Harry and Snape brews Veritaserum, and in the last minute Harry switched his potion with water and wons the bet. I think it was either Robst or broomstickflyer story, but not sure.
