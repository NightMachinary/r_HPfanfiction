I recently switched from iPhone to Android and was dismayed when reinstalling apps to see that pocketfiction is not available on android. What is the best comparable app for downloading, managing, and reading fanfiction on android?


** By the way, fanfiction.net does have their own android app that is really good.

** I use moon + reader pro. I get my fics using [[http://www.fanfictiondownloader.net][www.fanfictiondownloader.net]] and have it drop them straight into my Dropbox, which I can access in moon plus reader.

*** +1 for Moon Reader. I've tried many apps, but that one's been the best so far.

**** The reason I paid for the pro version is for the tts function, which I use to listen to ebooks at work

***** It has that, does it? How good is it? I'm allowed to listen to things at work, and if I can listen to fanfiction with a decent voice, that'll be huge.
