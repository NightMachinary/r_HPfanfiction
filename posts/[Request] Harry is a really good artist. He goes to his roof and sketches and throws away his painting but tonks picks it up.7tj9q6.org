** I'm not sure if you're looking for a fic that you've read before and just forgotten the title off or if it's a general request; since the title is oddly specific but this might fit for the latter: linkffn(The Life He Leads by TonyThePony)

Neville is the BWL and Harry is a very socially awkward teenager. It's adorable and kinda sad but pretty awesome.

Updates have been pretty frequent lately but there was a time before where it didn't update at all for a while.

Still, I really enjoy the writing. Harry is interesting, good with magic without being OP and overall very likeable.

**** Hi, author here. I did at one point have Tonks, Hermione and Harry in the tags because at that point in the story it wasn't obvious to the reader who the romantic interest would be, and so I didn't want to spoil it with the tags. Now that it's quite obvious that that role is Tonks, it's only tonks and Harry now.

**** Uhm I'm not sure? Every time I've looked it was tagged as Harry/Tonks and I've been following it for quite a while.

Harry is friends with Hermione and there's a kinda hilarious "romance" scene but i never got the impression that Harry would be remotely interested in her romantically.
