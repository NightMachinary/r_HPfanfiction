7th year while on the run, the trio stumbles upon a group of death eaters but has qualms about killing them.

Ron has the idea of using Polyjuice to turn the three death eaters into the three of them and drop them into Diagon Alley.

They continue to do this to Death Eaters and snatchers when they find them taking them to random Wizarding areas then yelling Voldemort! to trigger the taboo and running away.

Sometimes they even try to turn in polyjuiced death eaters for the reward while disguised as the death eaters.

Most of them get killed or maimed by their own people and after a while the trio are able to get the drop on others by pretending to be Polyjuiced death eaters.


** 'Harry' in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), did something similar. He even wrote letters to Voldemort:

#+begin_quote
  Dear Lord Voldemort,

  You may wonder why I, Harry Potter, have written you this letter. There are a few reasons for this.

  First, I would like to inform you that my associate has brewed a cauldron of polyjuice potion, while I have kidnapped several of your Death Eaters. Further, we just followed this owl to your base.

  By the time you've finished this letter, it will be too late.

  Love,

  Harry Potter

He basically tricked Voldemort killing his own people.

*** Seventh Horcrux is really the only Emerald Ashes fic I like, but damn if it isn't one of the best fics I've read in general.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** It would be hard to get that much polyjuice, though.

*** Not really. Hermione could easily make a big batch of it in addition to what they took from mad-eye. Especially in this au if instead of camping they were hiding at one of the not grimauld place black properties as is a fanon favorite

***** Iirc most were pretty common other than the boomslang skin and one or two others. In an au story like this it would be easy to have a supply as I said before one of the Black properties or something like that

****** In my opinion that's way too easy. what's the point if they don't have to work for it? this prompt is pretty cracky-feeling but if one were to write a serious story with this premise there would have to be resistance, setbacks, losses, etc. The death eaters won't fall for the same thing too many times. just my two cents

******* Likely not but it's a usual trope. The heroes are intelligent clever and brave while the enemy is to dumb to realize they're being played. I've read a fic before where they used the taboo to lure death eaters to an ambush and significantly reduce their numbers before they realized what was happening and removed the taboo.

*** Eh, could find a way. Take the Chunnel to France and get it there. I doubt Death eaters would even know about the Chunnel.
