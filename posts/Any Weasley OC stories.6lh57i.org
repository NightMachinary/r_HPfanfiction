I've read a lot of Weasley based fan fiction and I feel like I've exhausted all the good stuff. One thing I've never looked into however is stories with original Weasley characters - are there any good ones out there?

OCs used to turn me off most fan fiction but I've read a fair few good ones recently and an extra Weasley brother sounds like a fun read right now.


** Can't think of any examples off the top of my head, but you know what would be interesting - if it exists? A story where it turns out there really IS a Cousin Barny who turns up at the Burrow one day even though the other Weasleys thought they'd just made him up.

** Can you name any of those good OC fics, I usually have trouble finding them?

** Well, the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/241642][Weasley Girl series]] has Fem!Ron, who's KIND of like an OC in that she's both like and unlike Ron, but she probably doesn't count?

There are a couple of fics that give Ron a twin sister, but none of them seem to be much good... the best of the bunch is probably [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9774250/1/What-if-There-Was-Another-Weasley][What If There Was Another Weasley?]], but even that isn't what I'd call a classic.

No stories with extra Weasley brothers that I can see, probably because there are already so many of them.

It's surprising that we don't see more Weasley cousins around in fanfics, though. Canon hints that there are a lot of them around, so you'd think that the Weasleys would be the perfect family to insert OC relatives for.

There should be an entire genre called "YAWC" (Yet Another Weasley Cousin). But, no. I suppose the Weasleys aren't "cool" enough for the fanfic writers.

** This isn't exactly an OC, but have you tried out Book Learning on spacebattles? Premise is that Voldemort's diary horcrux fuses with Ginny.
