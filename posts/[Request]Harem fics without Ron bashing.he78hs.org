I'm not really much interested in harem stories. But I was curious if there are any fics where Harry has a harem but there is no Ron bashing. Because harem usually goes hand in hand with a lot of bad fanfic tropes.


** linkffn(Witches of Westfield by EJ Daniels) maybe? I can't really recall if there were any bashing but I don't think there was.

*** He's been left out to avoid the bashing, but still a good story, thanks for the recommendation

** Clearly the solution is to magik Ron to be female. Wham, no need to bash!

... I have never understood the appeal of harems. It is usually just a bad romance fic with underdeveloped female characters. And most of them use pretty boring plot devices to set it up (as the harem is the point, instead of the worldbuilding).

I'd actually be interested in a fic say, the wizarding world being 95% female, because magic prefers witches or something. Then exploring what that means for the society, how muggleborns deal with it, etc.

Sadily, if fics exploring interesting concepts like this they are drown out by the myriad of fics where Harry pretends he is a Pokemon trainer trying to catch everything female that is even remotely mentioned :(

Good luck finding them!

Maybe check reverse harem fics, since that puts both Harry and Ron both in a position to be shown positively?
