Newly edited bunny. As starfox said i lacked plot in my idea. So:

Hogwarts (staffs, students, land surrounding under wards) appear somewhere remote in Westero.

Hogwarts disappearing act is Magic protecting children from hostile force (war, apocalypse, natural destruction?) and done this few times before in history.

Folks of Westerosi find out about House Hogwarts (?) and wonder how they survived without outside relation (trade etc), even Targaryans didn't know about them (Not their fault when people discover new land and castle and DON'T think of "oh it seems to appeared with magic") , and freak out how to tell their King Robert.

King, representatives of Stark, Tully, Tyrell, Martell, Lannister, Arryn, and Baratheon, and their bannermen is outside of Hogwarts ward and calls Lord of House to meet them and swear fealty to King.

McGonagall only wants to keep her staffs and students safe and contained till Hogwarts decide whatever war on earth is done and spirit them back to home. (As it did it and n drop of hat without any warning, famous triplet from Malfoy family [lost stranded in this world few centuries ago gone and conquered countries] whose family roasted Ministry and milked guilt till it's dry for their children)

And already fed up with this backward society (irony from people who live without electricity)

Students treat it like vacation, and everything magical like faceless killers or dragons, white walkers, children of forest is leftover from millennia ago when Hogwarts did it's David Copperfield act.

And from there on it's author's fancy how to continue.


** What exactly is the plot in your idea? Internal discussions whether they should take over Westeros and turn this cesspit into a decent country, or stay out and let the smallfolk suffer?

Hermione managed to completely change the memories of her parents as a 17 year old. She could do the same to the King and Lord Paramounts in a week, tops, working alone.

Wizards managed to stay secret in a modern world of billions of people, and pretty much could control the leaders at will. Westeros is not even a speed bump - there's nothing, nothing at all that the Westerosi can do to prevent the wizards from ruling them, or ignoring them, or doing whatever they please.

*** I can suspend my disbelief pretty well, but an entire school of practically omnipotent beings (relative to the magic users in Westeros) and they wouldn't just go out there and fix the world as they please? Especially if you have idealists within that school like Hermione who'd have a bit to say about smallfolk and nobility.

I like crossovers like "The Difference One Man Can Make" where Harry ends up being the only wizard and becomes the Witch King of the North, making it entirely clear that he /could/ wreck the entirety of Westeros to shreds, but doesn't because, well... he's not a genocidal psychopath.

But hundreds and hundreds of wizards and witches being discreet about it? 0/10 disbelief not suspended.

The Wizard of Harrenhal was a decently well written story that definitely illustrates your point about the Westerosi not even being a speed bump.

** Actually, if the entire school was transplanted there, the main conflict would still be between themselves. Different factions would most likely take over different parts of the land (including Essos), and use the Natives as their curse fodders.

Even Crabbe could carve out his little kingdom by himself, as shown in the unfortunately abandoned [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11394554/1/Vincent-Crabbe-Saves-Westeros][Vincent Crabbe Saves Westeros]], linkffn(11394554).

These guys would render this world unrecognizable very quickly.

  After his humiliating death at the Battle of Hogwarts, Vincent Crabbe is given a second chance at life by the Gods. But can one simple Death Eater really change the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros for the better?

** Harry Potter magic is broken as fuck, people seem to underestimate it because the movies relegated it to laser tag battle and crossing wand streams. Things like Apparition, disillusionment, self transfiguration etc are just too difficult for the GOT world to combat(thats not including all of the defence spells/dark spells that could destroy armies like fiendfyre, bombarda, confringo etc etc) . I'm pretty sure they could take over Westeros with minimal casualties if they wanted to.

*** If they want to. Under Iron hand of Headmistress, even if some wannabe upstart (probably Slytherin) students tries to, they'll be squished and gets detentions. Or worse expelled, upon returning to their world.

**** Those of age would give a fuck about the staff anymore, considering they could rule whole land by themselves. Idealists like Hermione would all be shouting about stomping out cruelty and slavery of this world, while opportunists like Draco would seize the chance to rule over Muggles.

A staff of less than 10 couldn't possibly control 300+ teens armed with deadly weapons, especially not when the Ministry was no longer there to enforce any wizard laws.

I think the staff itself would be divided in this matter.

They along with most students would take their cues from Harry, who with his saving people thing certainly would not sit idle and let this land tear each other apart.
