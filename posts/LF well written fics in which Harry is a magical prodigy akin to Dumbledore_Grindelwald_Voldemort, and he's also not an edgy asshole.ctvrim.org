Romance is optional, slash/het/harem, so long as it's not the main focus. I'd prefer a male Harry, but fem!Harry is fine so long as it's done well, as in Taure's linkffn(Victoria Potter). Exploration into the more esoteric aspects of magic is also a huge plus. I've read linkffn(The Life He Leads), linkffn(The Mind Arts), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi), and linkffn(Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament), some stuff by TheBlack'sResurgence, and several others that I'm too lazy to look up the names for at the moment.

I also enjoy fics with a powerful, adult Harry, but also welcome crossovers here. In the previous category, with Harry growing up gifted, I've noticed that crossovers don't seem to turn out well. With an established, powerful, adult Harry, they seem to generally flow together better. I sadly don't have a list of fics in this category aside from Kathryn518's linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) and linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) because they seem to be abandoned often, but I've read a fair few of these as well. Shadow of Angmar isn't strictly "powerful" Harry at the start, but it's so well written that I wanted to include it. Anyways, suggestions?

Btw, when I say powerful, adult Harry I mean in the top tier of power in whichever universe he happens to be in, but not straight up god-mode Harry. Just wanted to clear that up, in case.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)

** Read this, it's a slow progression of Harry finding out about other abilities and becoming stronger. It's really badass tbh and well written. I've re-read the trilogy once a year for the past few years, it's that good. Normally I'm not one for a "Snape adopts Harry" story, but this is done reeeally well--the buildup of their trust n'such. You're going to be surprised alot :) Sadly the 3rd book has remained unfinished for the past couple of years, but it's worth the read, TRUST ME. Linkffn(Resonance by GreenGecko)

*** Thanks for the rec. I'll admit that I'm a tad leery of fics written pre-2010ish because the vast majority of the ones I've tried have been of... dubious quality, but I'll try anything for at least a few chapters.

I aim to go into new fics, or any literature, really, without any bias, but I haven't been able to shake this particular notion since I got into fanfiction. I'm not sure how to succinctly describe the vibe I get from most of them beyond, I don't know, very plain? Like I said, that doesn't really convey what I'm trying to get across at all, but it's the best I've got while trying to keep it short lol.

Now I feel the need to clarify my reasoning because I don't want you to think I'm going to dismiss it outright: I think it stems from the fact that those early fics laid the groundwork from which a lot of the great stuff I've read has evolved. The closest comparison off the top of my head is that they had an effect on fanfiction roughly analagous to Seinfeld's effect on TV comedy or even TV shows as a whole. At the time, Seinfeld was groundbreaking and paved the way for future shows to take. As a result, its influence is so widespread that many or most of the ideas/tropes used in the show have been thoroughly explored by shows that came after it. It's still a great watch, but if you've seen a bunch of TV shows that aired after its run and then go watch Seinfeld for the first time, said ideas/tropes are extremely obvious. That doesn't make it BAD, because it's obviously not, given its wild success, but it does tend to make it predictable. And now I've gone and made this comment much longer than I intended because I'm terrible at reigning in my thoughts once they get going in one direction, but I hope the reason for my bias makes sense?

Regardless, thanks again for the rec, I'll definitely give it a go.

**** It makes sense, and I'm usually weary, the same as you are. I may have gotten over-excited at a chance to get someone into this series, and I hope it doesn't lose your interest because it really is a slow-developing story. The first book is more about his mental/emotional growth as a person and becoming a young man, and then the second book is where it really kicks off to figuring out what's going on with him and becoming stronger. I think you'll really be pleasantly surprised. The rescuing at the beginning...just give the benefit of the doubt and see how things kick off from there. If you can, keep me updated as you read, because I might re-read it as you go along because it's about that time...

Edit- I also just realized that the trilogy isn't contained in just Resonance... Almost two million words is quite the commitment. Still, I said I'd try it and I'll give it at least 10-15 chapters to grab me.

** It's both abandoned and slash but I find linkffn(Rebirth) to be fantastic

In it his life as Harry is his second life after he used necromancy to ensure his own reincarnation. It's not overly edgy and is somewhat reasonable with some very cool ideas.

I could probably find others but honestly i have a soft spot for DarkHarry and very few of those aren't excessively edgy

*** Thanks for the recs. I knew there were some popular ones I was forgetting to name... I've read Magicks of the Arcane and either read or at least tried most of Newcomb and enembee's stuff. Liked most of it, dropped a couple of em for whatever reason, but good recs, thanks! The Other Side of the Coin is one that I've not picked up yet because I noticed it's abandoned, but I notice it recommended often enough that I'll probably just cave and read it anyway. Thanks again! I'll probably start it depending on how this thread pans out.

Edit- Nvm, I thought it was abandoned based on the update date and somehow only just now noticed it has the "complete" tag. My bad. I've seen it recommended a bunch of times but only now noticed that little detail... Guess that's for sure up next then, lol

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter gets ready to take on a Triwizard Tournament that captures international attention. He finds a new home, mentor, friends, allies and works to become his own man. Follow Harry as he dives into international waters and finds out if he is a shark or a minnow. Rated M in case something rated M is added in the future.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

  Harry must have been lonely while living at the Dursley's. What if he wished a friend and it worked? "Inquisitive, unconventional Harry. Lots of humour" like someone said. Writing gets better later on, said another. In the end H/Hr, some N/L.

It might not be exactly what you are looking for but I'll just leave that here. I would recommend to take a look at both works in the series they differ a little bit but if you like the prompt it's cool.

Summary

While Harry had been content with his second chance, that didn't keep him from thinking what he could have done different, how many people could have survived if he hadn't been set on the very specific path he'd walked. Third time is the charm, though, right?
