** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl]] by Hyaroo might be what you're after. Here's the author's summary:

"We all know the stories that ask "What if Harry Potter was a girl," right? But what if Ron Weasley was a girl? Imagine that the first person Harry befriends on the Hogwarts Express is not Ronald Weasley, but Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first born daughter of the Weasley clan for generations... what might happen then?"

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894793/][Harry Potter and the Distaff Side]] by Clell65619 is another possibility. Harry is cast into a genderswapped AU where he meets him/herself. The fic isn't crackish, seems to take itself serious in the right ways. The one character who isn't genderswapped should be easy to gues. Its been abandonded, but its def worth the read all the same.

*** That was the fic that made me give up on robst entirely. I couldn't make it more than a few chapters in, it was absolutely psychotic.
