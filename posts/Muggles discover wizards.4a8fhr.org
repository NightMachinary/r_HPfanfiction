** You could start by reading up on the history of the place you are setting your story at during the intended timeframe.

Otherwise, try asking a less open-ended question. There was A LOT going on during that time. Everywhere.

**** That's not even looking at the Cold War, but A LOT was going on. The Troubles were still going on, Britain was in an economic depression, Thatcher had just come to power and was turning the North of England into a post-industrial wasteland, the Falklands War. And that's just the high points in Britain that come immediately to mind.

Then there's things like the hostage crisis in Iran, the Mount St.Helens eruption, the guerilla wars in Central America.

What do you think happens when a group of guerilla/freedom fighters get hold of a bloke who can teleport everywhere, control minds and perform invisible assassinations? What do you think happens when grieving family members of someone caught in a natural catastrophe learn that there's someone living next door who could have saved their loved ones with minimal effort but /chose/ to stand idle instead? What do you think happens when the CIA/KGB/Mossad learns of veritaserum, of polyjuice potion?

** A lot of the IRA shit was going on throughout the entire period.

1972 - Munich Olympics and the terrorist attack that happened.

1973 - Great Britain, Ireland and Denmark enter the European Economic Community. (The precursor to the EU)

Star Wars came out in 1977?

1979 - Margaret Thatcher became PM.

1982 - Falklands War - Great Britain vs Argentina over the Falklands islands.

^ Read up on those for some major events. These are just a few of the things that went down then, not even including most of the Cold War stuff going on in the rest of the world.

*** OP, idk if you're British, but the influence of the Thatcher years is a big one. She dramatically changed the country and people still have very strong feelings about her today.

** The Cold War was going on. Everywhere. There are literally book-series written about what was happening in the timeframe you mentioned, and even those hardly cover everything.

You need to get a bit more specific in your questioning. And with a bit, I mean a lot.

**** The economy?

Muggles discover that there are thousands of people among them who put pagan gods to shame with their powers and you worry about the economy?

But, whatever. Lets do this.

It really depends what nations will do with their wizards. Will they conscript them? Will they hunt them? Whats happening?

#+begin_quote
  "Could you conjure oil?"

  "Yea, sure."

  "Alright, we'll pay you more than the next three generations of your family will be able to spend if you conjure oil 8 hours a day, non-stop. Also tell your friends of that deal. We need a lot of oil."
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  "How strong can you make that blue flame of yours?"

  "With a bit of arithmancy...hmmm... I don't know, how strong do you need it?"

  "You're hired. 500 million over the next decade if you manage to get my coal-powerplants running on blueflame."
#+end_quote

Military would bend over backwards to get their hands on these guys.

#+begin_quote
  "THIS IS WHISKEY 4! WE ARE SURROUNDED! POSITION B4 G5! IMMEDIATE EVAC!

  "USE THOSE GODDAMN PORTKEYS WHISKEY 4! You idiots... ."
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  "So you're telling me that with one spell you could... conjure... a fire that is somewhat sentient and won't stop until its counterspelled or out of stuff to burn?"

  "Yes, sir."

  "Rogers, get that man to CIA. We'll have us some fried communist."
#+end_quote

But not just that. Lets just for the sake of it look at NASA or ESA.

#+begin_quote
  "So, we have delivered a chimney to Mars, with a base around it. What now?

  "Take that powder, throw it into the chimney and clearly say 'Mars Colony Headquarters'".
#+end_quote

Healthcare

#+begin_quote
  "Doctor, there is a patient who had every bone in his body broken. He suffered heavy bloodloss. What should we do?"

  "Did you sleep in school? Dittany, Skelegrow, Blood Replenisher and next time you ask beginner questions you're fired."
#+end_quote

or, and here we delve once again into the economy stuff.

#+begin_quote
  "So, what stock should I buy?"

  "Dragonhide, Basilik Venom, Wands and Brooms. Every other part of the economy has gone to shit. As a matter of fact, capitalism has gone to shit. Why are you even here? This isn't the Wall Street stock-market anymore. This is the Museum of Pre-Magic History."
#+end_quote

So yeah. How would a capitalistic economy react to a huge workforce of gods who can produce anything, duplicate anything and build anything with a piece of wood, some pseudo-latin and inherited abilities? It wouldn't react. It would implode since its basic principles no longer apply. The most logical thing I'd imagine would happen is that wizards and witches will be pushed into a situation where their every wish is read from their lips, each of them gets servants, villas, luxury,... as long as they keep the ressources for the muggles coming. As I said, they would be gods. And gods quickly loose their appeal if they don't fulfill prayers.
