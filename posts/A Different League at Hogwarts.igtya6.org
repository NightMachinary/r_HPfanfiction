It's fifth year and someone has stolen all the Quaffles and Snitches from the Quidditch pitch. Instead of ordering new ones, the High Inquisitor orders the Quidditch tournament to be played with Bludgers only and renames in to "75th Hogwarts Quarter Quell: Electric Bludger Bongaloo".

Basically Flying dodgeball, but Umbridge takes points out of anyone not using the full name in the hallways. All the students must play and the practices alone make Pomfrey go nuts. Moody, Silvanus Kettleburn, a mentally restored Lockhart and Goyle senior in sweatpants guide the houses' practice.

---

"Constant Vigilance!" Moody yells as he throws a bludger that bounces away on Seamus' head.

Hermione and Parvati ran around frantically as the bludgers kept coming.

---

"Coach! Greg shouldn't be in the front lines! he's too slow!" tried Nott.

"Crucio!" yelled Goyle senior at Nott, "Any more objections?"

"My father will hear about this..." whined Malfoy.

---

"Professor? What do we do? The bludgers are mad!" yelled Terry Boot.

"Nonsense it's all under control," Gilderoy said, dodging one at the last moment, "Uff, As I write on my book, "Gilderoy defeats All dragons in dodgeball"..."

Right then a new bludger passed over.

"You know what? I forgot I have pictures to sign. Goldstein, you're in charge. Why don't you all try to hit Sue Li while I'm gone, not even sure who that is."

"But professor..."

Silvanus Kettleburn used his wand to throw a huge brick at Ernie Macmillan, who dodged it just in time.

"WTF!" yelled Justin Finch-Fletchley.

"If you can dodge a brick, you can dodge a bludger!"

"That doesn't make any sense! A bludger is faster!" whined Susan Bones.

Kettleburn frowned, as he threw a new brick on Susan's direction.
