:END:
Several years ago, I was not a reader of fanfiction. Without spending much time reading any of it, I had assumed that most of it was amateur garbage and not worth the time to read. I still find this to be true of many, but not all fics. The first fanfiction that was able to catch my attention and pull me all the way to the end was Methods of Rationality. Naturally, when I discovered this subreddit, the first thing I did was search for threads discussing HPMOR. There have been many. I spent some time reading through most of them and discovered, to my surprise, this subreddit mostly dislikes or even outright hates HPMOR. I'm curious to see how people feel now. Please forgive me if this discussing is redundant to some, but most threads on this topic are years old, so I felt that a fresh one could be worthwhile.

My own thoughts, written as brief bullet points to jumpstart discussion:

THE GOOD

- Characterization. Characters are self-consistent and grow over the course of the fiction. Each have different, unique voices.

- Effort. The author certainly put many, many hours into constructing the fic, which shows in how it is a much higher quality of writing than most fanfiction

- Scientific method's lens on Magic. I really enjoyed the testing of magic. Rowling, for obvious reasons, didn't care much about keeping magic logical and consistent while this fic attempts to ground it with realism. It's able to do this without changing too much from canon.

- Powered hero vs. powered villain. One trope many fanfictions fall prey to is making the hero super powerful without doing the same to the villain. You can't give Harry a light saber without also giving one to Voldy. In HPMOR, a genius Harry is met with an even smarter Voldemort.

- Lack of sex, romance, angst. This makes sense because the characters are young, but it's worth mentioning. Unlike Rowling's canon, this book doesn't pretend like sex doesn't exist, and there are a few moments of tension. However, it does not gratuitously pair any characters or describe sex scenes. Considering how many fanfictions do, this is worth mentioning.

- Rationality. I really enjoy when fiction is written to be explicitly not stupid. No characters holding the idiot ball. Characters follow a logic that is consistent, and the reader can predict events in the story by following this logic.

- Writing is great, at least on a mechanical level. Very few typos, grammar issues, etc. Each chapter flows well, and the story is easy to read.

- All elements from the HP universe are present from the onset. Rowling was kind of making things up as she went along, but that's how writing a long series kind of works. I don't think she had much idea of the Deathly Hallows, Time Turners, etc. while writing the first book. This book beautifully ties together most elements from canon in Harry's first year.

- Originality. This is a "point of departure" fic. A few major changes in the lore cause an entirely new and original story to develop that contains most elements from canon from a new perspective.

THE BAD

- Rationality soap boxing. Even given my above bullet point, I think there are some instances where the author tries too hard to insert a "learning moment" whereby the reader is to gain philosophical insight on rationality. This alone isn't bad, but it happens often.

- The first 20-25 chapters are not as good for reasons described below. Unfortunately, this fiction's beginning is not at all representative of the last three quarters of the story. This has the effect of turning off many potential readers.

- Harry's genius is unbecoming of someone so young, but still makes sense for end spoiler reasons. Probably one of the most commonly cited criticisms of the fiction is Harry's character of being an "author insert" who is just SO smart and arrogant. This is relevant to the plot. It does have an explanation. But you have to read the entire fiction to understand, which is not good writing.

- Harry constantly deconstructs the canon and seems to be correct about everything, which is annoying and insulting to Rowling. There is payoff on this later, where there are many instances where Harry realizes he is wrong and that he is not as smart as he thinks he is. However, this payoff happens beyond the first quarter of the story, which has the effect of turning off readers.

- Pacing. Some pacing issues are abound. Considering that this was a story release chapter by chapter, it isn't surprising, but it's worth mentioning. Some conflicts are introduced without resolution for many chapters. Sometimes multiple conflicts are introduced simultaneously.

Neither list is meant to be complete, but I've spent enough time writing without feedback. Let's discuss. What do you think? Why are you a fan? Why aren't you?

EDIT: Ugh, title typo - "the fic HAS been completed..."


** There was a question over on another fanfic sub (wormfanfic, for those of you who are wondering), which led to me explaining why I'm not particularly fond of HPMOR:

From an objective standpoint, it's well-written for a fanfic. However, in many ways it comes off as rather disrespectful to the series. For easy readability, I'll put this in bulletpoints too.

- Many of the themes of Harry Potter has been thrown out the window, and instead replaced with the author's personal viewpoints.

- The author has said that he based Harry's knowledge (and thus, to a certain extent, his personality) off of himself as an 18-year old. This means that his Harry /doesn't feel like Harry at all/. Of the fanfic fandoms I read, Worm is the only one where SIs are "accepted", and while Harry is often interpreted in many, /many/ different ways in HP fics, LessWrong doesn't even seem to bother trying to emulate Harry, instead, as said before, just shaping "Harry" in his own image. I've seen the term TINO (Taylor in name only) mentioned with regard to Worm fics, and HPMOR is certainly a case of Harry in name only.

- The author uses some tricks, if that's the right word, to make it seem as if his viewpoints are the "correct" ones. I'll reference something that happens somewhat around midway in the story here, so if you plan on reading it, you might want to skip this. [[#s][spoiler]]

- Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. That's Harry's full name in the fic. It's a knee-jerk reaction, sure, but the HP fanfic fandom has... issues with Harry's name being made overly fancy. Part of this is that a great, great amount of Harry Potter fics are utterly terrible, and one of the stock "badfics" is that Harry finds out that he's the heir to numerous families, typically those of the founders, as well as a few ones the author thought would be neat. Oh, and let's make him Merlin's descendant too, while we're at it! Due to this, most of the well-read, if that word can be applied to fanfics, readers will be very, very leery of Harry having a hyphenated last name.

- HPMOR treats magic as some enigma that can be solved through scientific methods. Trying to delve deeper into magic is something I love seeing done well. Black Pawn (currently found over on SB), and Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived (found at darklordpotter) are shining examples of this, in my opinion. Magic is treated with respect, with the characters spending much of their time researching or experimenting with magic, trying to gain a deeper understanding of the mysteries of magic. HPMOR, while it has some interesting thoughts, does not do this well. LessWrong brings in scientific principles, and makes the utilization of them lead to discoveries of magic.

- HJPEV is often made seem smart by making other characters appear dumb. An example is Harry meeting Hermione in the train. It's in chapter 8, and since it's their first interaction, I don't feel the need to put it in a spoiler, so go ahead and skip the rest of this paragraph. "... With your encyclopedic memory added to my intelligence and rationality, ..." This implies that Hermione is less intelligent than HJPEV. What happens after that is that Hermione does what HJPEV himself calls a textbook scientific analysis, but fails to test for negatives. Keep in mind, this Hermione isn't canon Hermione, but rather one that's been made smarter as well. I have seen a Harry that's smarter than Hermione pulled off well, but it's very, very hard to do properly, as it will often just look like an intellectual version of the Word Effect.

- The characters are all wildly OOC. I don't think that there's a single authentic 11-year old in the story, and the adults should not take the main cast remotely as seriously as they do. As I remarked in my original post, the first HP books were written for children, which meant that the staff stepping in and solving the problems would hardly have sold much. However, for a writer who prides himself on "rationality", such a thing should not have happened. Age the main cast up to 16, or better yet, 18, instead of having 11- and 12-year old children behaving way older than they are, and being taken seriously by the staff.

There are other things as well. I'm sure that many [[/r/HPfanfiction/]] would love the opportunity to rant about it (with myself falling into that category), so if you'd like more, a quick post over there would likely get you even more.

** Reproducing a previous comment:

#+begin_quote
  As a contrast, why I don't like it:

  1. The writing isn't good. In contrast to some posts in this thread, MoR is not written "professionally". Yes, in terms of technical writing there are few if any errors. But good writing is a lot more than an absence of errors. MoR is full of characters monologuing or having extended tangential conversations. Brevity is a key part of good writing, and MoR lacks it.

  2. The pacing is terrible. This is probably the worst aspect of the fic. It just goes on and on, meandering here and there but without any overarching plot structure. Some people raise the defence of "it's episodic like a TV show" but no, it isn't. Even episodic TV shows have structure. MoR isn't like Friends, MoR is like an alternate idea of Friends where it's season 7 and they've still only known each other for a week.

  3. I don't like the magic. This is largely personal, I suppose, but I hate the nerfed temporary transfiguration, the complete reinterpretation of Dementors as representing death rather than depression and decay, the Sorting Hat, etc. It's just so much less romantic than canon, so much more mechanistic. It loses something in the translation, I think. I also rather dislike the abuse of "loopholes". This ties in with "mechanistic magic", I suppose. Magic only has loopholes if it acts mechanistically. I prefer to think of magic as capable of closing its own loopholes e.g. if you try to use Felix Felicis to brew more Felix it'll backfire.

  4. It's disrespectful of canon. While I can accept that fanfic going a different direction with magic is a matter of personal taste, this is something more objective. MoR doesn't just say "Hey, wouldn't it be interesting if Dementors were creatures of death", it says "Dementors must be creatures of death, the idea that they're creatures of depression is ludicrous". In doing so it's making itself out to be a superior kind of canon to that which JKR wrote. Not only is this insulting the source material, it also means that MoR opens itself up to all sorts of argumentation regarding canon compatibility, because it's now making claims to be a superior interpretation of canon events than JKR's.

  5. The kids act like adults. This doesn't need much explanation. The fic fails to make the distinction between intelligence and maturity.

  6. It's a mess of different ideas. MoR reminds me of Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart, where the author just shoved every single idea they had into a single fic, regardless of thematic unity or how they relate to the plot. MoR is like an ideas document, a fanfic sandbox.

  7. Thematic clash. Voldemort sending his horcrux into space is the perfect example (which is also an example of bad pacing, in that you've basically set up a villain who can never be defeated). Is it logical? Yes. Does it fit with the feel of the HP universe? No. There's a reason why wizards haven't gone to space despite having all the magic you'd need to do so, and that's the simple fact that combining space travel with a semi-medieval semi-Victorian society is the literary equivalent of toothpaste and orange juice.

  8. The author used it as a cash cow. Admittedly this has nothing to do with the story per se, but it tarnishes the story by association. The author promised accelerated chapter releases in exchange for monetary donations. Yes, it was to a not-for-profit organisation, but it was a not-for-profit that the author has a financial interest in, given that they pay (paid?) his salary. Given how the fandom feels about authors holding chapters hostage for reviews ("I'll post the next chapter when I get 20 reviews!"), you can imagine how a lot of people felt about asking for money. It's just unacceptable.

** So I'm late to the pajama party.

I absolutely /hated/ it. And that sucks because as I was reading it I thought it was pretty good. It showed me a few things that I still notice coming up in my thoughts even though its been years since I read it. But when I finished the story I felt like the author lied to me.

He promised me at the beginning a Harry Potter that uses science and magic together. He started with a refreshingly new character who was a total prick but who was a lot of fun to read. Having an arrogant hero was just plain fun after so many -"What? /Me/? I'm just a ____. Are you sure you've got the right person?"-characters.

The author also said it was going to be very straight forward, that you were gonna be able to figure things out from clues that were dropped in the story. And at the end it was another story of Dumbledores manipulation and ridiculous answers to all of the great questions that were brought up.

Another thing that */really/* bugged me was how Harry beat Voldemort in the end. There was such a huge hole, I can't believe I haven't seen it referenced before.

.

OK, so, in the finial fight, Harry is surrounded by Death Eaters and the author gives us a deadline to figure it out or we get another ending(I think? I don't remember much but I remember being pissed off) and Harry transfigures the tip of his want into one long strand carbon fiber(?) to beat them all. But remember how he killed the troll when Hermionie died? Harry stabbed his want into the trolls skull and transfigured acid into its brain. When he pulled the wand out he noticed that the core was sticking out of the tip. Can he just transfigure the wand all the way down or what?

I feel like I'm too emotionally invested in this, but it had so much potential, I was so ready for a Harry that knew and applied muggle science and actually tried to figure out the Whys of the magical world that the let down just really pissed me off.

** Also on the bad:

- Hermione's the story's chew toy. Not quite fridged, but close. It's a terrible trope but the author still went there.
- The story wavers between crack and serious with abandon.
- There are a bunch of references scattered throughout to other series and to canon. That tends to break people out of the story.

** I actually didn't hate this story. Kind of liked it (heresy, I know!).

But I approached it as a sort of primer on rationality, at a time when I was exploring the philosophical idea of transhumanism. I feel that HPMoR /excellently/ explained these ideas in "story-format." I do feel that it provided some level of insight.

I would not have enjoyed this fic nearly as much if I did not continue reading out of a desire to explore transhumanism and rationality.

Other reasons:

- It felt original and imaginative

- Main character was not stupid, but not always correct either

- Had a few epiphanies

- I'm also a sucker for Ender's Game-type stories

I can totally see why people wouldn't like this from a purely fanfic point of view. If you come at this fic with a fundamentally different worldview, you'll probably hate having the ideas shoved in your face. However, if you're curious about a novel and exciting new philosophy, I think I could recommend this.

*** That pretty much sums it up. I think the writing in HPMoR is high quality on the written level and that the story is refreshing and impressively detailed.

I also first read it as a teenager first exploring transhumanist/'rationalist' thought, so I didn't mind all of that; the plot reasons for Harry being that way even made it all make narrative sense in the end.

But as a pure HP fanfiction story it's obviously not what most readers are there for.

**** Me three, I guess! I found it incredibly fun and refreshing. I love it when authors work within constraints, and writing to try to make Harry Potter's magic self-consistent and not game-breaking is an incredible constraint indeed. I liked that it made fun of canon in a way that only someone who really loved it could. Occasionally I found it powerful and insightful. It's one of the first fics that really engaged me, the fic I always used to recommend to get my rl friends into fanfiction, and I've always felt a bit down that it didn't seem like people on this sub saw the good qualities it had.

But, on the other hand, there was a lot of sloppy writing. Harry acting like a supergenius is not explained, obviously, by "adopted dad was a physicist". I suspended my disbelief on my first few readthroughs because I felt like it was just a handwavy way to tell the story he wanted. Obviously Harry's character can be a bit offputting though, given how far from canon it is, and that it was eventually revealed to have a Watsonian reason behind it felt stupid, because it was a solution to a mystery that was never actually set up as a mystery by the text.

The other main problem, of course, is that Voldemort was so smart as to be unbeatable, and had to be holding multiple idiot balls AND villain balls to get the story to end. Going, of course, the original spirit of the thing in the first place.

As a final note, I don't know why I wrote this as a reply to your comment, yargle, but I did and thus it's going to stay that way.

** It'll be easier to keep track of things if I address your bulletpoints, so here we go. Keep in mind that I wasn't the most diligent reader of MoR, I was hate-reading the last third, like watching a trainwreck, hoping that everyone on board would die. Some things may have gone over my head.

CHARACTERIZATION

One can say that there was a lot of characterization because of the sheer size of MoR, but I prefer quality over quantity. The only character I can think of who has an arc is Draco.

Harry starts out an extremely arrogant, unlikeable prick and though he stumbles, he ends up in the same place at the end, having gone in a circle. He's still arrogant, thinks he knows what's best better than everyone else and is still planning to realize his plans for widely available immortality, which is a terrible idea for reasons which his ultra-logical mind ignores or doesn't seem to perceive. He just decides that nobody ever dying anymore is automatially the correct course of action logically, morally and in good in every other way.

Hermione becomes Harry's partner, but I don't see a change. Whereas Harry is supposed to be a kind of "if the villain was a good guy" character, Hermione is the epitome of goodness and purity and those traits are amplified by the end, which can be said to be a character arc if you really want to, but I don't.

Other characters are consistent in the way that they don't change, no matter what happens. They stay static. For me personally, the only character who was sort of interesting was Quirrellmort, but this was still bogged down by MoR's general long-widedness, which drowned everything else.

The character voices kind of blend in the moments when the rationality kicks in, because then everyone turns into a rational drone spouting lectures at the reader and that's most of the fic, so...

EFFORT

Yeah, okay, I agree on that. It's a lot of misdirected effort though.

SCIENTIFIC MAGIC

We're gonna have to agree to vehemently disagree here. This is something I simply don't want in a fic. Don't confuse this for me saying that I'm against all forms of magical research - I'm against applying real-world "muggle" science to magic. Magic can absolutely have its own rules. I'm all for Transfiguration Principles, but when you add rules of thermodynamics to the mix, I nope out.

POWERED HERO/VILLAIN

And what does it matter if, in the end, Voldemort still does the stupid thing and hands Harry back his wand instead of just killing him on the spot? Voldemort, the super-rational, super-logical, forward-planning supervillain let Harry hold his wand while he was making a decision instead of forcing Harry to make a decision while naked and unarmed. Essentially, MoR's Voldemort became so smart that he outsmarted the author and the result is that the author was left behind and included this particular flaw in Voldemort's otherwise foolproof plan.

LACK OF ROMANCE

As if that's an accomplishment in a first-year fic. They're freaking eleven.

RATIONALITY

You don't need the above for the story to be "written to be explicitly not stupid." It's one of the problems with the fic. It adopts the stance that rationality is the only correct worldview and anything else is stupid, or at least More Wrong™.

WRITING

We have different opinions of what constitutes good technical writing. For me, it's not just a lack of mistakes. I disagree that MoR flows well. The rationality lectures leave the pacing an equivalent to a botched abortion, there's rampant wall'o'texting and more than once, by the time I got to the end of whatever tangent the author went off on, I had forgotten what had happened immediately before it.

PRESENCE OF ALL CANON ELEMENTS

This can be said about any fic written after DH was published, so MoR doesn't stand out here. You are right that JK made some things up as she went along and not all of them were good ideas, but isn't that kind of what writers do?

ORIGINALITY

Not untrue, but the presence of those elements drowns in the infinite muddy bog of rationality lectures. And personally, I wasn't a fan of some changes, like dementors being avatars of death instead of depression and fear.

SOAP-BOXING

Nothing to add here, the very term "soap-boxing" says it all.

BEGINNING SUCKS

I'd say that the first few chapters are the best the story has to offer. It's like funny crack and then you realize you're being lectured and it's only downhill from there.

THE WAY PROTAG IS WRITTEN SUCKS

Yeah, I agree.

PROTAG IS ALWAYS RIGHT

Harry is the author's version of Garry Stu in the sense that his rationality is better than everyone else's and intellectual giants like Dumbledore and Voldemort are ultimately dumber than Harry, "proving" that wizards are dumb and muggle science and rationality is the bestest.

CANON DECONSTRUCTION

Deconstruct canon all you want, but the author of MoR was an incredibly arrogant pillock about this. To quote Taure, he doesn't just say "dementors are avatars of death and not fear/depression", he says "dementors MUST be avatars of death, the idea that they're avatars of fear/depression is obviously dumb". The author wipes his ass with canon in a way that leaves a bad taste.

PACING

Saying that MoR has some pacing issues is like saying that Titanic was a slight hiccup. Pacing-wise, MoR is an absolute disaster, which ties into the core problem with it. It wants to be a story and a rationality textbook at the same time, which the author isn't a good enough writer to pull off and as such it fails at both.

I said this before and I'll say it again: MoR is the only fic in the fandom I genuinely hate (also because of the author, who's proved to be a complete prick) and wish it didn't exist. I think it's had a net negative effect on the fandom.

****** I think the author has a very vivid imagination. HPMOR isn't really about Muggle science entering the wizarding world so much as it's about a protagonist using the scientific method to explore magical phenomenon. It's about Harry seeing magic and asking, "How does this work?" and challenging preconceived notions of magic. In this way, I feel that it's much more of a love letter to canon than it first appears, because it keeps most things consistent from canon. Harry simply discovers some underlying mechanisms that tie it together and use that knowledge to become better at magic than he would have otherwise.

******* Only what you said in simply not true, because the author doesn't stop at Harry using what he knows to understand what he doesn't. MoR is a one-of-a-kind fic: magic!bashing. It's not just that science is applied to magic, it's that Harry's "scientific magic" is implicitly said to be better than the wizarding interpretation of magic. It's not a love letter to canon, it's a giant middle finger.

******** There is absolutely no magic!bashing in HPMOR. That is a ridiculous thing to suggest in a story that is about understanding magic. The entire premise is that the wizarding world has had no need for science because magic has been able to meet all of its needs, so an enlightenment never reached the wizarding world. The muggle world required technology to advance, which requires science, which requires asking and learning. Harry is a child of the enlightenment, and all he offers the magical world is a different perspective. He is very often wrong. His only crime is asking "why?" to magical phenomenon, a question that wizards have not needed to ask. It is a love letter because the magic is consistent - to me, the story reads very much like Eliezer's explanation of how Rowling's magic can make sense. How could that be a giant middle finger?

********* That sounds exactly like magic!bashing to me, to be honest. It's giving magic no credit.

To me it's clear witches and wizards study magic the same way Muggles study science. How does the author explain the Department of Mysteries if not a giant research lab to understand how things work? How does he explain Snape inventing his own spells? Does he think the witches and wizards just say higgeldy piggeldy with a stick until something happens?

I understand if readers complain that /we/ don't get the facts about how magic works, because I agree, it's not there, but it's painfully clear to me the /characters/ in the book understand magic. /The entire plot is dependent on Dumbledore's superior understanding of how magic works/. I can't even emphasis that enough. There literally would be no series if Dumbledore did not have an incredibly deep and intimate understanding of what makes the world and magic tick.

That's what I mean by the author seeming to bastardize what I hold dear in the books and lacking imagination because he's failing to grasp there is logic to the magic.

Not saying I don't like rational magic either, I've read plenty of fantasy books that have that sort of magic and it's great. But the idea of writing a fan fiction to "correct the book's magic" is the thing that gets me. If he just wrote it to have fun, and doesn't really mind how the book does it, then I'll eat my words, but considering everyone, including yourself, says he's very preachy, then I'm guessing he has strong opinions about what the books are "lacking".

#+end_quote

This is the core of the argument.

Wizards have magic, therefore don't need science, which is so sad for wizards, because their ignorance of science makes them unenlightened, unlike muggles, who have been enlightened by science.

From the very first chapter, MoR establishes one of the points it's pushing: wizards are dumb. Wizards need the scientific method to stop being dumb. The fact that wizards don't know about brain damage, or didn't go to the moon, proves that they are dumb and science is their salvation from their ignorance.

See, I don't think wizards are dumb. I think wizards are just as smart as muggles, only in a different way, because their society evolved differently due to presence of magic. Wizards can literally break the laws of physics, have instant teleportation and can cheat death and all those things have been around longer than modern muggle science.

That is one of the points. Wizards AREN'T dumb. Harry is often wrong about wizards because he assumes they are in some aspects. Wizards are incredibly intelligent when it comes to performing magic and surviving with magic. Because they don't need enlightenment, they don't need to experiment and ask questions of their magic. But why hate a fiction just because it does?

This fic's entire premise can be summarized as "what would happen if a person versed in enlightenment ideals becomes a wizard?" There is no harm in that. I'm not sure why you rally so strongly against it. Wizards obviously do not need an enlightenment to last as long as they have, which is part of the point. What the enlightenment could bring to wizards is more powerful magics and better treatment of their fellow man... which may be something they don't need, but could certainly use.

Harry straight out assumed things like Souls don't exist. He uses the same arguments creationists use to assume Atlantis must of existed to create some mechanism fior magic, with some genetic marker. His two biggest accomplishments, his patronus and partial transifiguration, are not due to careful researtch, experimentation, observation of the world and trying to find some theory. No they are the result of him thinking really hard and fnding the answer.

His review is very thourough, I would reccomend a read of it. HPMOR is wrong about a lot of the scientific, and philosophic concepts it introduces, and this author is informed enough to point out the outright wrong ideas Yudkowsky presents.

******* Hm, interesting. Thanks for the explanation, I'll not jump to conclusions about people's strength of imaginations so quickly in the future. That does sound imaginative, and I guess there are obviously a lot of different ways of being imaginative. I think I'm being prejudice (which I don't want to be) because it seems this fic is bastardizing everything /I/ loved about about the books. Clearly this author loves the books if he's going to write such a long fan fiction, but I think what he and I liked about the books are very very different things, and it seems what I consider "the point" of the books, he's gone and said "that was stupid, and I'm fixing it here".

I think that's why I get the impression he looks down on parts of the books. I know you say it's a love letter, but I can't help get the impression (and again, I've never read it, so it's only an impression, and obviously you would know better, which is why I'm interested in your thoughts) that it's also the opposite?

Perhaps... perhaps a love letter to the story, but not the world-building, then? What are your thoughts on that? And please don't hesitate to tell me I'm still being prejudice, if I am, I want it pointed out.

And disclaimer, I'm glad not everyone thinks the same way about the books. I don't mean to say he or you or anyone should think like me. The fact that people who love the books still respond differently makes me think they're even more impressive, rather than less impressive.

*** I'll respond in kind to the bullet points you've posted. Thank you for taking the time to write such a lengthy and well-thought out rebuttal to everything that I posted. Posts like yours are exactly what I desired when I made this thread - challenge my beliefs, and allow me a forum to defend them otherwise. First off, a note: I believe you hate HPMOR with a greater intensity than I like it, so I don't have any intention of changing your mind. Hopefully, through this discussion we both gain some food for thought, though.

CHARACTERIZATION

Draco and McGonagall both experience the most dramatic character shift throughout the book. Draco you've already mentioned, so I won't bother to expound. It's hard to say that McGonagall is the same, static character as she was at the beginning. McGonagall changes throughout the story, from an old teacher embedded in her role as a teacher, into a more open-minded person. The entire "Roles" arc seemed to be somewhat directed at her character specifically, breaking her roles when it conflicted with her values.

Harry starts out extremely arrogant, outright dismissing characters such as Ron because of their stupidity and claiming superiority over all magical things. Over time, he becomes a much warmer person to those around him and by the end of the fic is much more aware of his own stupidity. He had a few monologues toward the end conveying this very thing. It is his stupidity that gets Hermione killed. It is his stupidity that loses Dumbledore to time. Neither of these things are lost on Harry. Voldemort was only such a threat at the end simply because of how arrogant Harry was and how much he was willing to bias his mind against Voldemort.

You mention that Harry passing out immortality is a terrible idea. Why, exactly? I totally buy into Harry's philosophy at the end. If we can agree that death is bad, then it is morally good if death can be avoided for all people. If it is easy to grant immortality to people, then why not?

Hermione's character changes from a willing participant and sidekick to Harry's actions to a more self-focused, mindful person. She does not want to simply be a part of Harry's story and over time realizes that she wants to be her own person. It's not about her going from "good" to "really good."

Other characters are worth mentioning, but I'll save that for a future reply so that we can focus on what I've already brought up.

SCIENTIFIC MAGIC

I found the exploration of science and magic to be less about interweaving Muggle magical principles like the Laws of Thermodynamics and Transfiguration Principles and more about applying the scientific method to magic. Observing, questioning, testing, updating beliefs. Harry asks "why?" and "how?" to most magical things and tries to come to some conclusion. I agree we may just see totally differently on this, though, but I believe that all forms of magic in fiction should have some underlying logic to them. The reader may not be aware of the logic, but the author should have some idea of what's going on. Look at the Lord of the Rings. Gandalf operates in highly mysterious ways, governed by a set of rules the reader never becomes aware of. The rules do exist, though, as Tolkien has demonstrated in his later letters. I view Rowling and HPMOR to be two sides of the same coin - Rowling's canon is a canon in which the reader never becomes aware of any of the magical mechanisms going on, while HPMOR is an exploration into what mechanisms must be going on in Rowling's canon. I phrased this in a different post in a similar way, but in this way, HPMOR is a love letter to Rowling's canon. It embraces the magic wholeheartedly and merely asks "why?" until it gets to the bottom of it.

POWERED HERO/VILLAIN

Well, this is something we may end up disagreeing on as well, though I understand where you're coming from. First off, I don't think this is case of Eliezer writing himself in a hole and making Voldemort stupid intentionally to make Harry win. The author has stated that this scene was planned from the beginning, which I wholeheartedly believe given that it is foreshadowed in the very first chapter. The rationalization behind Harry having his wand is that Voldemort asked Harry to show him secrets of magic, which Harry must have a wand to do. Voldemort has Harry completely surrounded at thirty-some odd wandpoints. Voldemort is arrogant, and believes he knows most of all there is to know of magic. This is why Harry is only able to defeat him with magic that Voldemort is completely unaware of. The story could have easily had Harry request his wand to show some magic, and then do the partial transfiguration... the outcome is the same.

LACK OF ROMANCE

My bullet-point list is written in the context of other Harry Potter fictions. It is not at all out of question for fanfiction to show romantic interactions between eleven year olds. This may be a minor point of praise, but it's worth mentioning.

RATIONALITY

I did not say you needed rationality for the story to not be written stupidly. To that point, though, what other worldview adopts evidence-based questioning and utilizing scientific methodology to get to the "right answer?" It's worth mentioning that this "worldview," as you describe it, is what is used by any scientist ever attempting to learn something about the world.

WRITING

Not much I can refute here, this seems to be mostly a taste difference.

PRESENCE OF CANON ELEMENTS

Okay, this can be said of any fic written after DH, but that doesn't mean it can't be said for HPMOR. I'm merely stating what I liked about this fic. I also don't think Rowling is in the wrong for making things up as she goes along, as I say in my OP.

ORIGINALITY

Dementors being an avatar of death instead of depression or fear is well-enough explained that I like it. The change is that Dementors are indirectly avatars of depression or fear because they are directly avatars of death, which all people who don't believe in souls (should) fear.

PROTAG IS ALWAYS RIGHT

This is the biggest point of contention between us, and I think this is where your hate-reading shows the most (no offense meant). Harry is explicitly NOT smarter than Voldemort or Dumbledore. The entire story is a story of how Voldemort is constantly beating Harry effortlessly because Harry is so blind to him. Harry is wrong in every instance when it comes to Dumbledore, ultimately resulting in Dumbledore's 'death.' The end of the story makes a point to prove that Dumbledore, though seemingly acting irrationally, was the "bestest" at getting it right.

Also, the author doesn't say that dementors MUST be avatars of death - Harry does. The author writes arguments between Dumbledore and Harry, with Harry's arrogance coming out strongly. But this is not Eliezer speaking, as he has said in his author's notes since.

Because if you're operating on pure logic, you must eventually confront the question of logistics. If no dies, what about the human population? What about the planet? If you want to use magic to colonize other planets, how do you do it, potentially on a massive scale? How do you stop overpopulation? Simply "freeze" humanity in current state, by making everyone immortal and sterilizing them? Or do you just forbid procreation? There are entire industries that depend on people dying, getting older and sick, new people being born. Immortality fundamentally changes humankind, in ways that Harry never once acknowledges. This could be attributed to him being eleven years old, but everywhere else Harry is the author's mouthpiece for rationality, so why not here?

If you're a reasonably intelligent person, you can surmise some of the rules of magic from HP canon, even if they're not stated explicitly. Some /are/ stated explicitly. What MoR does isn't "getting to the bottom" of canon magic, it's inventing rules that the author believes must be "at the bottom" and dismissing or changing canon to fit his interpretation. Now, I have no problems with changing canon, it's a part of what fanfiction is about, but no other fic does it in the way MoR does it, i.e. with a level of pretentiousness that cannon be expressed within the confines of all the human languages combined.

A story doesn't need to be a lecture, or a textbook, it doesn't need to be attempting to teach the reader anything at all to not be a stupidly written story. There are textbooks for that. What I meant by not stupidly written more or less translates to a well-written story. A. /STORY./ Not a 600k word lecture on rationality. A story doesn't need to promote any kind of worldview. What You Leave Behind is what I consider to be a not stupidly written story. I like to think my own fic is not a stupidly written story. So, it doesn't matter if there's any other worldview that looks for the "right answer", because this is simply not a factor for me when looking for a not stupidly written story. Including or not including a promotion of a certain worldview isn't what I pay attention to when looking for good fics. I look at characters, plot, conflict and if they're good or not. You know, stuff that fiction is made of.

RE: ORIGINALITY

  Also, the author doesn't say that dementors MUST be avatars of death - Harry does. The author writes arguments between Dumbledore and Harry, with Harry's arrogance coming out strongly. But this is not Eliezer speaking, as he has said in his author's notes since.

***** CHARACTERIZATION

Harry actually does acknowledge all of those points. Harry's logic is that defeating death is the greatest enemy, and if death can be defeated, other issues can be defeated as well. Harry surmises that the greatest existential threat is the heat death of the universe, something that he has no idea how to deal with. All other threats he believe can be solved in time with magic. I think this is perfectly reasonably, especially as the process of turning the population immortal is slow, and is only acting on a specific demographic of a few million people (Harry isn't giving muggles immortality from the get go, for much the same reasons you pointed out.) Just as a point of order, these issues are certainly addressed in the fic. If Harry can prevent the death of life, then what is the risk of overpopulation or any other issue you bring up? The entire threat of overpopulation is scarcity of resources, leading to death by famine... which Harry can stop by giving people immortality. Death is the root issue, and now that he has solved that, other less vital issues can be addressed. I fail to see the problem here.

SCIENTIFIC MAGIC

Perhaps we should agree to disagree. Literally the only major departures from canon are 1.) Voldemort is a genius and 2.) Dumbledore has read ever prophecy. Any other change in the story arises from those two events. There are no changes to Rowling's logic or the way that magic operates. The author rationalizes some new forms of magic that arise from deep questioning of Rowling's logic, but in my opinion, this is fair game. And considering that he could have easily just done away with her magic system entirely since he intended to write such a long fiction, I believe that this demonstrates some respect for Rowling's work.

POWERED HERO/VILLAIN

The basilisk is an actor that Voldemort has no reason to distrust, very much unlike Harry. And you are wrong on that Azkaban - Harry does the magic, and summarizes a quick explanation (leaving out details) to Voldemort. Voldemort is weak at this point, recovering from being knocked unconscious by Harry.

RATIONALITY

I completely agree that a story doesn't need to be about teaching or learning anything to not be stupid. As other users have pointed out, this story does serve as a great primer for rationality and this story was certainly written to introduce more people to rationality, but that isn't a requirement for a non-stupid story. I enjoy this story because it isn't stupid. And it is also a primer on rationality. I also think that believable characters should follow a form of logic that one can follow, even if it's not as explicit as in this story. I don't like when I read stories where plot happens because characters ignore obvious ideas. Your audience should not be able to think "why didn't they just do this, because it's easier?" To stress: you do not need to be a story about rationality to be a smart story. This story is a smart story about rationality, however.

ORIGINALITY

I disagree, simply said. I think the argument between Harry and Dumbledore is fairly civil, even if Harry is arrogant which is consistent with his character.

PROTAG IS ALWAYS RIGHT

Agree to disagree. There are many rational voices in this story that could be said to be a mouthpiece of the author. That you choose to latch onto the most arrogant is your decision, but I don't think it's at all reflective of the truth.

I think you should also take note that Harry is not always right, not even half the time. He's wrong FREQUENTLY.

There's a reason that the same principles rationality proposes are taught in AI courses as the most optimal and correct way of thought.

Transhumanism is simply an extension, in part, motivated by a desire to not die.

Ironically, people (for some reason) approach both philosophies like they're fundamentally irrational. It's frustrating, because wanting to enhance the human condition is only natural. We've been doing it for millennia: we're already transhumanist! But you attach the word "transhumanist" to the philosophy, and people freak out, like it's suddenly voodoo magic.

And rationality can be decomposed to hard mathematics - it, by definition, is the most optimal mode of thought.

You say that rationality is applying logic to life, and I'm going to go ahead and assume you mean "without emotion." Correct me if I'm wrong. That's not what rationality is, really. That's part of it, but rationality certainly includes emotions. There are two definitions of rationality that the HPMOR story operates on: instrumental and epistemic rationality. Epistemic rationality means updating your beliefs based on evidence, to believe the most true thing possible. If the sky is blue, I want to believe the sky is blue. If the sky is not blue, I want not to believe the sky is blue. This is the definition of rationality that motivates scientific research. Yes, it is fair to say that this definition of rationality is devoid of emotion, because emotions don't necessarily best reflect the real world. This definition of rationality doesn't make judgments based on subjective factors such as your life values.

What I'm getting at here is more the other definition, instrumental rationality. This means "achieving your values." It simply means steering your life by doing actions that seek to best achieve your values. I think you have a misunderstanding about some things, so I'll show by example a completely rational thought process involving emotion:

"I really enjoy walking through nature. It makes me feel better about my fitness, because I feel good when I walk several miles. It makes me feel more connected to the Earth, which is a satisfying feeling. For other reasons I can't quite articulate, being in nature makes me happy. Therefore, I should steer my life to increase the number of opportunities I have to hike. Perhaps, I should consider a career as a Park Ranger. Or, maybe it is better to consider a career that is high-paying to benefit other avenues of my life, while dedicating my weekends to nature hikes. This is something that I have to make a decision about that involves evaluating my personal value system."

Rationality isn't going to be the most "emotionally serving" worldview, as it requires the strength of will to temper our feelings with cold logic. It doesn't claim to be the most enjoyable philosophy, either. It simply claims to be the most optimal (for accomplishing your goals).

Ironically, if "enjoying life" and "experiencing emotion" are primary or even important goals for you, rationality is very simple to tune for that purpose.

  Harry starts out an extremely arrogant, unlikeable prick and though he stumbles, he ends up in the same place at the end, having gone in a circle. He's still arrogant, thinks he knows what's best better than everyone else and is still planning to realize his plans for widely available immortality, which is a terrible idea for reasons which his ultra-logical mind ignores or doesn't seem to perceive. He just decides that nobody ever dying anymore is automatially the correct course of action logically, morally and in good in every other way.
#+end_quote

Actually, Harry starts off as amazed and wide-eyed as he is discovering the world, he becomes more arrogant as he sees himself better than the world he discovers, and ends up humbled by his mistakes. One of the last scenes is him realizing he was about to do something that could have destroyed the world just because it seemed right to him. Also, immortality for everyone isn't an irrational thing from his pov when there are extraterrestrial colonies and virtually infinite resources. Morally it's just your opinion vs his.

Hermione's arc was going from her canon character, to an echo of HPMOR-Harry, to her fully realized self. Her story focused on her feeling left out and second best to others. At first, this was due to her being nerdy before Hogwarts, then it was her feeling stuck as Harry's assistant when she tried to actually prove her worth, and in the finale she found herself as a fully realized protagonist in her own story. She was finally the 'hero' she wanted to be.

** So, I liked HPMoR. It's by no means perfect, but there's a lot of great moments. Harry himself is the weakest link, the author's pretentiousness coming through in Harry. Still, it explores a lot of interesting ideas. Harry sending himself a note to /not/ fuck around with time travel is one of my favorite moments in any HP fanfiction.

Outside of Harry's occasional "I'm so smart" rants, the wars were definitely the worst parts. Writing large-scale battles is hard enough for experienced writers, and even the most well-written battles still struggle in text. The medium is just not suitable for depicting a battle on that scale. The guy made a good three or four dozen anime references throughout (Puella Magi Madoka Magica is even suggested to be HPMoR canon), I dunno why he didn't go one step further and turn the wars into teamed duelling contests from every shounen ever. It makes far more sense in-universe and is far easier to write. You really have to try to make those boring. That said, it didn't serve much of a purpose, so changing the format would only make it more interesting, not more important.

Speaking of boring, HPMoR has its downtime, but it never gets /too/ bad with it. One of the hardest parts about writing fics closely examining magic is that it gets very dull, very fast. It's very easy to end up writing paragraphs of the magical equivalent of technobabble, which will put your readers to sleep long before you get to the point. However, if you don't spend enough time on it, whatever goal you're trying to accomplish will be unbelievable. HPMoR leans more towards the technobabble side of things, but you know exactly what you're getting into when you start reading, so I'm willing to give it a free pass on that. Otherwise, it either tries to have fun with its idea, or it tries to turn them into horrible killing devices. Either works for me.

One thing I think isn't brought up nearly enough is how close the story became to a deconstruction of fanfiction tropes, seemingly on accident. Harry starts off as an insufferable twat self-insert, constantly inventing new magic while acting as the moral arbiter of the wizarding world. This is not (solely) due to bad writing, but the entire purpose of the fic. It's intentional, because Harry needs to be that way to explore the ideas the author wanted to explore. However, it all comes back to bite him in the ass at some point. As the story shifts from "fucking around with magic" to "saving the world from a machiavellian evil", it doesn't pretend like Harry's nonsense didn't happen. Rather, it embraces it and forges on, the story no longer being so forgiving of the author's idea of a perfect Harry. It sort of undoes it all in the finale, but that's really just playing Harry's intelligence straight again. A proper deconstruction probably wouldn't have made all of Harry's miracles possible, but since they were, you have to use them or you fail at your original premise.

I think the fic suffers from the closest thing to "mainstream syndrome" a fic can have. It's actually good, but its popularity has led to more vocal critics than it would otherwise have. If every fic even half as good as HPMoR got the same treatment, there wouldn't be enough space on the internet to hold the complaints.

As a side note I couldn't fit in anywhere else:

#+begin_quote
  Lack of sex, romance, angst.
#+end_quote

I don't think HPMoR gets enough credit for this either. It has romance /elements/, but it has fun with it. Hell, even the books struggle with this. It seems like most people writing romance forget that, at some point, real love is supposed to be fun. In fiction, most of the time you mirror this by pairing the romantic elements with comedy elements. HPMoR accomplishes the goal by making Harry's outlook on romance "I'm 12 and what is this". It barely qualifies as a minor part of the story, but it does work to keep the mood light when it needs to.

******** I had had enough around chapter 38 (it's been quite a while, so I can't remember precisely why) and quit, so that doesn't fit the first 25 chapters theory. I would agree with the pacing problem more than anything else, although I felt that the author, at least, got more arrogant as the story went on, not less, and that also may have contributed to my inability to continue.

********* My first 25 chapters theory is something I gained from reading through the many threads already discussing it, where most people agree that they could not get through the intro which is very critical on Rowling's canon. Your mileage may vary, obviously I don't intend for it to be a golden rule of thumb. You're allowed to dislike the story if you've read further, but many people stop at that point.

** The first hint that I would have issues with the fic was when the supposedly rational adult, when confronted with magic, didn't react rationally but went into full blown denial.

The second hint that I would have issues with the fic was when I realised that the title of the fic was literally true and that the supposedly rational main character was anything but. Instead of rational thoughts and actions he pusued a mindless, religious devotion to only the tools, to the methods of rationality. In ritualistic rote he fervently kept applying them without plan or understanding.

I did not bother to wait for a third hint.

Scepticism is not the issue. The issue is that he kept in denial even after witnessing the effects. Not "something happened, there is some explanation for it, I just don't have it right now" but full-blown refusal to admit something he witnessed with is own eyes.

Not a perfect rationalist? He was a full-blown unthinking worshipper. He wouldn't know a rational thought if it bit him in the arse. The tools were the ONLY thing about rationality that he had any connection to and even those he kept misapplying because he understood nothing about them.

***** 1.) Please reread the first few chapters. You simply must have misread the first few chapters. He is not in denial after witnessing the effects. He does not refuse to admit it happened. This is factually incorrect. He is uncomfortable with it because it is so weird and challenging to his worldview, but he accepts it. There is no argument from Harry's father against it. Harry's father even helps him find Platform 9 3/4.

2.) Again, this is part of Harry's character and is literally a huge part of the plot. This story is about Harry's growth as a rationalist, from an arrogant guy who thinks he's right and gets most things wrong to finally becoming much more rational by the end.

** My opinion of HPMOR has evolved since i finally finished it about a year ago. The first time I read it the first few chapters were a hilarious and brilliant breath of fresh air, and then it devolved into a scientific and philosophical analogy that I wasn't able to follow due to the change in tone.

I quit after the first few chapter but since it was a massive deal in the FF universe I decided to try again. Here are some of my overall thoughts:

PROS:

-It's unique compared to the tired tropes and pairing of the fandom so it allows the reader to take a step back and enjoy the fandom all over again.

-It allows for more than a passive somewhat forgettable read, because we read so many fanfictions somewhat passively we can't always appreciate them. HPMOR is one of those epics that stands out amongst the hundreds of one-shots, ficlets, drabbles, and mediocre fics out there.

-You can revisit and find something new.

CONS(these are mostly personal reflections):

-It's a tiring read, after reading the first half it slowly becomes more difficult and exhausting trying to follow what the author is "teaching you".

-The pacing and the unrelenting contradictions in the story can make it confusing to follow, especially if like me your not someone who knows all that much about rational thinking.

-It's very long and the ending doesn't really pay off, it's been a while but I remember thinking how anti-climactic the ending was making the tiring last quarter of the story seem even more bothersome.

-Most of what is considered an in-depth take on magic doesn't hold up and in the end is more of a negative in the narrative than a positive, certain instances like transfiguring a wand, make even less sense even after it's explained.

To me there are too many negative's aspects to ignore and I don't think it's a fic for everyone. In the end I found the beginning interesting and different, however it's more troublesome and irritating to read than anything else and it ends up being not worth the confusion and contradiction. This is, however, just my opinion and I am not of the opinion that everyone will agree with me.

** It became terrible towards the ending. Harmoiny was turned into a mere plot device nothing more than a trophy a way to motivate Harry. The ending was bullshit as Tom fell into the classic mistake of monologing and gloading. And the fact the harmoiny did not die was bullshit and felt like a hamfisted effort to undo the damage he had done to the character, but the way it was portraid felt childish and forced.

** One of my biggest problems is that most characters are totally OOC. Since the story makes a big deal of how Harry's upbringing made him a differsnt person, it rather defeats the point for everyone else to be different while presumably keeping the same background. Also, often the characters are made purposefully dense in order to emphasize the /brilliance/ of Harry. Hagrid is the worst example of this. HPMOR has us believe Hagrid is completely mentally impaired. I mean, he's no genius in canon, but c'mon.

** Those "learning moments" were exactly what turned me off. I got to about chapter five where Harry was explaining the fundamental attribution error and rolled my eyes. Sure, not everyone knows this stuff, but for anyone who has an interest in sociology this is very basic. I stumbled across the term in 7th grade during my figuring out people phase. The way it was presented felt, arrogant. I tried a few more chapters but I didn't feel like I was reading a story, I felt like I was having concepts thrown at me for no reason at all. The wizarding world is in the dark, but to have an 11 year old straight up lecture a teacher is just cringeworthy.

I am an extremely intelligent person, and several of the things that Harry mentions I had to look up for context. While fine for some, I hated it. I agree about how Harry must have a foil. However MOR didnt provide that. Sure Voldemort is intelligent, moreso than in canon, but the author doesnt give me that feeling of "Harry might actually lose this." It just isnt there.

*** As a rule of thumb, I don't think anyone should ever declare "I am an extremely intelligent person," without some modicum of evidence behind that. I'm not saying you're not, but it definitely will color people's perceptions of you. And it's a claim that can't really be verified, so it's useless in discussing.

I think the biggest thing that helped suspend my disbelief was knowing that Voldemort was there the entire time, befriending Harry. Despite how smart Harry thinks he is, his mentor and confidant throughout the book is his villain. This is something that other people, including Hermione, notice and Harry outright ignores. The vastness of Harry's stupidity and arrogance when it comes to Quirrellmort suspended my disbelief that the book may end with Voldemort winning in some sense.

**** I don't Need evidence to point out that the references made during HPMOR are not possible to understand without background info. I admit, I should have given evidence of percieved intelligence, however I have a feeling that doing so would have cause someone to comment with "that does not make the story bad". Which it does not; however it does make it unenjoyable to me. In fanfiction I should not have to google what is being sprouted every other chapter. Especially as a student, who uses fanfiction to escape his mundane life.

** It's...well, it's essentially Atlas Shrugged, with Harry Potter instead of trains and Yudkowsky's views instead of Objectivism.

It's not something written because someone wanted to entertain people, or create a legitimately good work, or because they liked Harry Potter - it's something written with the /very/ blatant purpose of self-promotion / soapboxing, by someone who openly doesn't even like Harry Potter. The author has absolutely no respect for the source material and definitely chose it because it provided the largest possible audience.

And, well, it worked. The fanfiction community is constantly desperate for anything written by someone with the ability to write at a 12th grade level that includes characters with familiar names, so, despite the idea looking ludicrous at face value, it worked. His online presence shot up over it. The notability challenges on his wikipedia page stopped happening once newspaper articles started being written about his fanfiction.

Maybe motives shouldn't matter, I mean, that's a completely valid view to hold, but it's also just /not good./ If it were an original work, that hadn't been written to manipulate an easily-used community in order to aggrandize a person, it'd just be one of a handful of other extremely preachy attempts at original fiction no one but his cult of personality has read, sitting on his blog - which, in all likelihood, would have a much smaller readerbase than it does today.

TL;DR: The stated purpose of the story is to teach you about how to think properly. The actual purpose of this story is to make people know Yudkowsky's name. It really only succeeds at one of those.

** I love it. Its a deconstruction/affectionate parody. I think people get very caught up on the author and take it too seriously and overly defend canon/the rest of the fandom.

I also live in the UK and I think that the way HPMOR is written appeals to the way Brits affectionately criticise things. In the US criticism seems to be taken more seriously as something to rail against or push back at. Ultimately; it doesn't matter how bright MOR!Harry is because he's a fictional character in a world where everything else is logically consistent. There definitely are bright children out there if you're concerned about realism - they just tend not to be protagonists of these kinds of stories - or most kinds of stories; because who would they appeal to when most kids aren't? Aimed at mass markets anyway. By contrast, Artemis Fowl is another character popular in the UK who's a child genius. I don't know to what extent railing against smart!Harry is anti intellectualism.
