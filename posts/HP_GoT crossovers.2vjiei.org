  He remembered being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold, dead things. He is only the 2nd son of the King, a spare, but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.

**** The author's still around, but hasn't been working on this lately. I'd assume not abandoned, but I'm feeling a bit optimistic.

*** Is it necessary to have read or watched GoT to understand what's going on? I haven't, but seen this fic recommended so often that I'm getting curious...

****** You should really read ASOIAF for its own sake though. It's some truly astounding fantasy.

******* Have to second this. I put off reading ASOIAF for years and years even with the rave reviews, because I was burned out on high fantasy (was reading almost exclusively urban fantasy at the time).

As soon as I started, I just couldn't stop. I read through books 1-4 in under a week nonstop. It really is an amazing series.

It ongoing but rather short, it features an older Harry, sorta OOC but tolorable. It really good and it an instant love or hate. Give it a go. (TIL that i'm terrible at revievs)
