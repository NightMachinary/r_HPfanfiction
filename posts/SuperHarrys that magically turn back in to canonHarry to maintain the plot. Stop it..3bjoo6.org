Ok, this is more of a rant than a discussion, but you know what I'm talking about. Your super hero Harry has just blow through the tri-wizard tournament with ease. He blew the Dragon to pieces, levitated all the water out of the lake and simply walked across the bottom to collect his hostage. Then, with a wave of his wand, all the hedges in the maze moved out of his way so he can fetch the cup.

And the cup is a portkey, and because of (insert contrived reason here), Jesus Harry loses a duel to Peter fucking Pettigrew, gets tied to a gravestone and is used to resurrect Moldyshorts.

So, the canon story continues relatively uninhibited and you didn't have to come up with a unique plot. Yaaaaawn.


** I remember one fanfiction where Harry just roflstomps the homunculus, just to be looking out for an even more insane Voldemort. He kills the different horcux off in this one by just duelling with Voldi over and over again, the last duel happening when Harry was 135 years old, had a pretty damn good life and decides to just go through the veil when Voldi got him with a Avada Kedavra. The last soulpart of Voldemort then gets offed by an orbital strike because, well, its the year 2115 and muggles are damn scary at this point.

oh boy, do I have to reread this... /searches bookmarks/

edit: Can't find it anymore :( sry guys.

***** The link goes nowhere for me.

But I get your point. I mean Percy literally dives into the tartarus faces the unspeakable horrors of it and comes out unscathed, while in the first series he fought to defeat a titan, sure he was badass there but everywhere else...Like Jason in here in the first book we get introduced to Jason, who, by the way, is also the leader of a never before mentioned camp for roman half bloods. He exhibits powers Thalia never showed to have, he's likable, he's basically a mary sue.

In fact the whole group was full of mary sues, shape shifters fire casters, enchantresses.

I get the point, that somehow Gaeia would awake and the Gods gave the children the best of their abilities to defeat her but goddamn. (not to mention just how easily Gaeia was beat, it was in two pages. a couple of paragraphs at most)

** linkffn(The Denarian Renegade)

This trilogy pulls off Super!Harry beautifully. And it's not really blowing through with ease - Harry is super powerful, but his enemies are more powerful.

Probably the most well-written and entertaining trilogy out there.

**** Oh, it really is! Actually, its one of *the best* trilogies in existence, and is up there with the gods of Fanfiction like Joe's trilogies.

You aren't meant to understand everything at the beginning. The fic actually reads to feel more interesting and expansive if you haven't read Dresden Files, because it feels like that there is an entire unexplored universe out there.

*This is definitely a must-read for all people seriously considering spending time in the HP Fandom. It has great character development, excellent plot, some of the best action I have ever seen in any fic, ever, and a refreshing AU that puts almost every other fanfiction to shame in terms of creativity.*

****** Oh, if you don't know of JOE, you'll have the best fucking weekend ever! His fics are legend.

linkffn(Sword of the Hero) this is the most epic trilogy ever written in the history of HP fanfiction. No author - NONE - come close to even hoping to match the sheer scale of epic action in this trilogy (and you'll see what I mean when you get into the second book in this trilogy).

The beginning is a bit rough, but once you make it to the second book, you'll not even consider stopping.

linkffn(Wastelands of Time) is the beginning in another, tamer (in terms of scale) trilogy that still absolutely WILL blow you away. Incredible world building, action-packed, and full of intrigue.

I can not recommend the trilogies here enough. They are the cornerstones of AU HP Fanfiction, and really legends unto themselves. They are absolutely essential reads and I can not recall ANY piece of literature more thrilling than these (especially te Hero trilogy).

I recommend you read the Hero trilogy first, the Time trilogy second, and the Denarian trilogy third, as it will be the best way to get a feel for the character type these writers go for.

(P.S. Harry will seem like an ass for part of the Denarian trilogy, which is why some drop it - but it will grow on you - eventually)

And I apologize in advance for depriving you of sleep.

****** Also, I must warn you that it might be difficult finding fanfiction outside of the lauded ones on the DLP Forums to read, after you finish those trilogies. Everything else will just seem super "meh", which is a testament to how interesting amazing they are.

If you don't know about the DLP Forum, it is where some of and the best writers in the HP Fandom come together to review fanfiction, and the DLP Library consists almost solely of quality fics. I highly recommend getting an account (Free) so you can check the Library out.

The community might seem a bit caustic at first, but it is that same attitude that leads to only the best of the best being featured in the Library.
