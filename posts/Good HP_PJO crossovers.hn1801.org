I've browsed through ff.net a few times but all i seem to find are poorly executed "PJ n company go to Hogwarts to help Harry" type fics.

I mean i get that at least in the hp books the actual year things are taking place is mostly irrelevant because 85% of the series is in Hogwarts which almost lives in a time bubble, but it still bothers me that (per timeline) Percy would be a toddler while Harry is battling death earters in the DoM.

Are there any fics that actually pull off the trope or, failing that, fics where Harry becomes Percy's mentor/ally instead?


** Best PJO crossover ever is Harry Potter, Squatter. You've probably seen it linked/recc'ed already, but it really is the peak of the category. :)

** I'd also recommend The Legend of Perseus: The Labors. While it isn't a HP crossover, it's one of the genuinely good Percy Jackson fanfics. It follows the journey of Hercules and Percy back in Ancient Greece.

** One of my favorites is the series by Perseia Jackson starting with "The Forgotten Daughter" where fem/harry is Percy's older sister. There's also a completed Lightning Thief, incomplete Sea of Monsters and a couple one-shots linkffn(8345417)
