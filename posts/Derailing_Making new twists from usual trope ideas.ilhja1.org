The Wrong Boy Who Lived Trope

Neville is Boy Who Lived

Ron is a Death Eater

Snape is Harry's father or raises Harry

Marriage Contract trope

Magical Creature Inheritance

Going to an AU.

And other similar usual tropes, what twists/derailing and the like would you use on them and other tropes?

Can go into detail on how you'd change things around, or make a few pointers. If others would like to write that person's story idea feel free, just tell that person that you're interested.


** *Ron is a Death Eater* because all the Weasleys are.

Arthur and Molly were actually dormant agent during the last war. Arthur and Lucius hate each other because they are rival for their Lord favor. Ron approached Harry on the Hogwart Express because his parent asked him to become closer to "the future Dark Lord". His mission to become close to him was a success, but with Voldemort return in GoF, the family has a chance to infiltrate the Order of the Phoenix and prove they are the best servant of Lord Voldemort.

** The Wrong Boy/Girl Who Lived - It's actually Molly's Squib cousin's son also born at the end of July. He/She is treated as a Mudblood when the Death Eaters come to power in 1997-1998 and gets sent to Azkaban. There he/she uses the accounting knowledge gained from his/her father to win over the Death Eaters in charge of Azkaban by helping them launder their money (Shawshank Redemption style). Relying on the leniency and preferential treatment he/she receives, he/she forms a cult of Muggle-borns around him/her with the ideology that the time of the old pureblood families' time is over and they need to be exterminated. They form a rebelion, break out of Azkaban, defeat Voldemort and his Death Eaters and enslave them. Voldemort marks him/her as his equal because he has to admit the WB(G)WL is just as capable of gathering followers and the power he knew not were accounting skills.

Neville is the BWL - Bellatrix had a secret crush on Frank Longbottom so when Voldemort goes for the Longbottoms, he wants to spare Frank and it's his sacrifice that protects Neville. The story is essentially the same, minus the Dursleys and with Bellatrix as Potions Mistress.

Ron is a Death Eater - Ron doesn't believe in blood purity or all that stuff but instead joins Voldemort because he wants to learn the Dark Arts and become the next Dark Lord. He proves himself so loyal and efficient that Voldemort makes him his protege. Ron eventually learns about the Horcruxes, destroys them, poisons Voldemort and because he was so close to their leader, the Death Eaters accept him as his natural successor. He takes over the magical world and uses his power to put an end to the bias against Muggle-borns and the mistreatment of House Elves. Turns out he did all of this out of love for Hermione.

*** Snape adopts Harry/is Harry's father - Snape does not trust either Voldemort or Dumbledore to keep their promises of keeping Lily safe so he decides to follow Voldemort's every step in case he might go after the Potters. He even gets the secret from Wormtail. As Voldemort is about to kill Lily while she's begging for Harry's life, Snape shows up begging Voldemort to kill him instead of Lily. Voldemort obliges but then Snape puts the protection on Lily so it's her that destroys Voldemort's body. We later find out that James ran away in fear. Lily raises Harry telling him that Snape is his father.

Marriage contract - after Harry saves Gabrielle from the lake, Harry is told that she will be her wife and sex slave for life once she comes of age. Because of their beauty, Veela think that they bestow an honor upon a mortal by doing that, but Harry is obsessed with Cho so he refuses. This refusal makes the Veela Council deem Gabrielle as unworthy so they punish her by taking away her beauty and youth and enthusiasm. She returns next year as an old bureaucrat under the guise of Dolores Umbridge to get her revenge on Harry.

Magical Creature Inheritance - The Basilisk develops a crush on Ginny, but Fawkes is in love with the Basilisk. The Basilisk uses its sight to posses Harry and from then on Fawkes keeps getting very sexual with Harry. When Harry and Ginny finally get married, James, Albus and Lily (Harry's kids) are all quarter Basilisk, quarter Phoenix, quarter Potter and quarter Weasley.

Going to an AU - Harry follows Sirius beyond the Veil at the end of OotP and ends up in a world where Lord Hadrian Potter Black Whatever is the actual enemy and Voldemort is part of the resistance. While Lord Hadrian has a harem, the driving force behind his lust for power is Daphne Greengrass who uses her influence to drive him to do all the horrible things such as killing and torturing people. Harry teams up with Voldemort and Manipulative (but good)!Dumbledore to defeat Lord Hadrian and Daphne (who turns out to be the reincarnation of Morgana, while Harry is the reincarnation of Merlin).

** Probably all of these have been done already, but...

*Wrong Boy Who Lived-* A ruse by Dumbledore to protect the identity of the real Boy (or Girl) Who Lived. Neither Boy Who Lived is an asshole- they're just pawns in a much bigger game.

*Neville is the Boy Who Lived-* Neville dies as a baby, because Snape doesn't give a damn if Voldemort kills Alice Longbottom. The rest of the story is about the post-appocalyptic world after Voldemort wins. The lesson is "prophecies are bullshit".

*Ron is a Death Eater-* Someone posted this here recently, but maybe he's not actually a Death Eater, but playing double agent like Snape.

*Snape is Harry's father or raises Harry-* A few options. James was sterile and Lily asked Snape to be the sperm donor because she knew he was a) familiar with Muggle procedures for treating infertility, and b) desperate enough he'd say yes no questions asked. Alternatively, Dumbledore used Snape's DNA (preferably with his and James and Lily's knowledge) as part of a magical ritual to create a Chosen One who would combine James, Lily, and Snape's abilities.

*Marriage Contract-* portrayed as the state-sanctioned slavery and rape that such a system would actually be, the protagonists lead an armed revolt against it, and the people who are contracted together do not end up falling in love and happy with it.

*Magical Creature Inheritance-* Rather than just being a way to give the hero more special powers, said inheritance comes with major negative side effects, not least the prejudice of a Wizarding World that looks down on anything associated with magical creatures. Or- Harry becomes a vampire and its a Buffy the Vampire Slayer crossover, because I love Buffy. He's not a fluffy vampire though- the Chosen One is a soulless murder monster Buffyverse vampire.

*Going to an AU-* Canon characters go to a fanfic AU and are thoroughly horrified by how their characters have been butchered. Ron is so horrified by all the Ron the Death Eaters that he ends up turning evil to seek revenge on fanfic writers everywhere.
