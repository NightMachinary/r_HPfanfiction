** Itachi, is that a baby linkffn(11634921) is notorious for it. It's a crossover with Naruto. Not the part where the Headmaster deliberately kills people, but he is totally fine with different people's deaths.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** One of my favourite senile Dumbledores is in linkffn(Sympathetic Properties) - I didn't find it to be _especially_ cracky but it has its moments. I really loved the approach to Dumbledore, though.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

** Partially kissed hero

Dumbledore is more lawful evil in this. But..IMHO he's insane. This fic has an interesting premise and then devolved to the catckiest of crack
