Is this a good idea at all to try out, just for FUN, or would it be hated even if it was created for amusement purposes? I kind of want to write a Lord Potter, millionaire, Lord Black House type story that everyone else writes and that get shit on around here so much...but I am afraid even if I wrote it as a fun thing it would still be dogpiled with hate and stuff?

That IS what "Crack" fics are, right? Outrageous or parody stories written for fun, not like seriously?


** I've considered the same :) It might be hilarious fun to write. I expect if you label it as crack it won't get as much hate as you expect.

*** Yes, I just think it could be a fun time to like make stuff DELIBERATELY exaggerated and over-the-top, like to also poke fun at the fics that DO play the whole thing serious and straight. :) Also to see what I could do with a story like that, if I was TRYING to make one for once and use all the tropes people do.

** Definitely go for it! At the end of the day, writing fanfiction should be done because you love to do it, not because you're trying to please random internet strangers. If you have a story you want to be told, write it and you don't have to listen to those who provide nonconstructive feedback. I think a lot of people around here enjoy crack stories (myself included), especially those which poke fun at the overused tropes you mention.

I look forward to seeing what you create! :)

** Speaking as someone who absolutely hates crack and anything humor related in fanfiction you should definitely write your story.

Personally, I won't read it BUT I won't go out of my way to hate on it, specially if there's some way you can warn readers about the crackish nature of the fic.

**** 'cause it makes me cringe. Specially randumb humor, it feels forced plus it's never funny, like something you'd see in shitty fan art.

The jokes are shit but such and such characters were involved so that makes it funny right? RIGHT?!

-Fuck that :v

I did like at some point Champion's champion I think it was called? The one where Ron joins the TWT, he signs a contract and he farts every time he gets jealous, funny at first. 20 fart scenes later, not so much. 50 scenes later, srsly? still beating that dead horse but somehow I have to believe that's still funny?

I also tried A black comedy but I never got past the Ginny ghost, unfunny af.

A bit off topic but I also hate Ryan Reynolds jokes, NOT EVERY JOKE HAS TO BE A FUCKING REFERENCE TO SOMETHING ELSE!
