I would say standardised education and safety :

Standardised education because before wands no two magic user used magic the same way makeing it almost impossible for all but the best to teach more than one student at a time.but even then you can only standardise the learn of magic so far, so learning at hogwarts after fifth year becomes a more personal journey with the hogwarts teachers only as guides.

And Safety because before wands there was no when buffer when casting/learning a spell so if you got a spell wrong it could backfire on a magic user and that made some magics very dangerous to learn because before wands magic users would channel magic threw there body that made learn spells like the stunning spell hard because if you stuffed up casting and it backfired you would knock your self out for hours each time you cast it wrong and learning a spell like the killing curse would be almost impossible because if you got it wrong and it back fired you would die.

What do you think about are the biggest advantages of wands?

** I generally assume in my stories that wands make casting spells much, much easier. Wandless magic is inferior in every aspect, and whatever you can manage with wandless magic, you'd do much, much better with a wand. Therefore, a wizard with a wand can cast far more complex/difficult spells, and can use them with more precision as well.

In my stories, that's why the Europeans conquered so much of the world prior to the Statue of Secrecy - they could easily beat the wandless wizards opposing them in the Americas and Africa.

** Hm...are there advantages? We don't know how magic was taught before wands (it's not shown in canon) and we don't know if magic without wands has limitations ("You need a wand for this, you can't do it without one!"...that might be the case and it might not and the wand might only speed up learning or help weaker wizards along, while the stronger ones might even be held back by wands, wand-movements and even words...some might work way better with visualizing what they want and making it happen basically!), we only know that it's taught with wands now (must have some advantage, unless you are into conspiracies and wands are a control tool by the ministry!) - not why!

ps: A wand could be what the Colt-Revolver is to people who like guns, when they quote: "God made men and Samuel Colt made them equal!" (thus it closes the gap between the more naturally powerful and talented and "lesser" wizards! Hell, it might be a limiter in that it prevents catastrophic spells, but also weakens all spells cast (more precision than brute force)? That would explain why the Elder-Wand is that powerful: It lacks that "feature", thus giving it to a first year? Not wise!)

*** We're told wands allow for more powerful magic because the wands act as a medium to channel the user's magic into. Now, it was never specified if the wands literally make the spells stronger or if they simply make magic use more efficient (and thus more magic power is available to increase spell power). But there's an equation used in Transfiguration that has "wand power" as one of the variables, so that gives a bit more credence to this business.

*** I don't have a good metaphor for wandless magic.

But I see wands as being a bit like a bicycles and wand movements and verble incantation as being a bit like training wheels.

Up to fifth year most of the student learn with the training wheels on this allows for the teachers to teach multiple students to "ride" at the same time were as before a magic teacher would have to do the equivalent of walking along holding there student upright while they learn to "ride". there are some students that take there "Training Wheels" off early like Dumbeldore and Voldemort but they are the exemption not the rule.

In sixth year student are made to learn Silent casting(ride without training wheels).and then there's spells that are above N.E.W.T. Level like the Patronus charm that don't have any "training wheels"(wand movements)to help you learn them.

Wizards like Dumbeldore, Grindelwald and Voldemort Are all the magic equivalent of a mountain or bmx bikers. Or mabye the equivalent of magical triathletes.

  The magic wand originated in Europe. Wands channel magic so as to make its effects both more precise and more powerful, although it is generally held to be a mark of the very greatest witches and wizards that they have also been able to produce wandless magic of a very high quality. As the Native American Animagi and potion-makers demonstrated, wandless magic can attain great complexity, but Charms and Transfiguration are very difficult without one.
#+end_quote

So only very great wizards and witches are capable of producing high quality wandless magic. Which means that the average person can't. But it isn't stated anywhere that wandless magic can actually be more powerful than using a wand. Using a wand still creates more precise and powerful magic, but if you're a great witch, you can do some good wandless magic as well.

** From a storytelling perspective?

1) Wands are iconic, bringing lots of associations about how they're used (movement, spell projectiles?)

2) It's an object. You can take a character's wand away, so they can't rely on their usual tricks. Very useful tool.

3) If everyone believes you generally need a wand to do magic, wandless magic indicates an advanced magic-user.

There are obvious advantages over potions - spellcasting is instantaneous and doesn't require specific ingredients.

What would be interesting is why wands? Staff might be a problem of size. It's probably hard to get core so big, it's also absolutely bulky. But why not, for example, the brushes that onmyouji use? That's an interesting question.

*** We can assume wands have advantages because they use wands. If they didn't have some sort of advantage, no one would use them, much less the powerful wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort... who were basically the only ones who even /could/ reliably use wandless magic IIRC. And yet they still used their wands. In fact, when Voldemort thought his wand was weak to Harry's... his solution wasn't to blast Harry with a wandless /Avada Kedavra/ but to take Malfoy's wand.

*** Just because wands have advantages doesn't mean that wandless magic doesn't have its own advantages.

As you point out most users of wands become reliant on them leading them to become a crutch. But with wandless magic you can never be disarmed.

All magic users should probably learn at learn the summoning charm and the strongest dispel magic they can find wandlessly so they don't end up like poor Neville at the end of first year.

*** Not really a disadvantage. If someone is able to disarm you then they've managed to get a spell through your defences i.e. they are better than you at magic. Being able to continue the fight without your wand wouldn't make much difference as they're still better than you.

The only time a wand is a disadvantage is if you've been ambushed. But I doubt being able to cast wandleasly would help much there either. The whole point of an ambush is to catch you unawares.
