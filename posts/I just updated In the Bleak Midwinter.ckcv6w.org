I just posted chapter 14 of In the Bleak Midwinter. This chapter is going out especially for the people here who were arguing that the only ethical thing to do with a heavy-duty time turner is kill baby Hitler. Fixing political problems isn't that simple, and y'all were thinking too small anyway. Hermione and Tom can save a lot more lives than that with some creativity.

** Oooh looks interesting.

IMHO the obvious thing to do is abuse time loops for thinking time until you invent immortality and free energy, then go back as far as possible to implement them for everybeing.

** Oh man, I love this story, but I'm just waiting to continue reading it until there's more chapters because I tend to binge the fics, I'm awful at reading them one chapter at a time.

*** Understandable. I can't promise it'll be complete for a while, though. The plot is ridiculously ambitiously huge.

I have some complete stories you could try, but nothing else with a main character who's a vainglorious prat like Tom.

**** That's perfectly fine and understandable. I subscribed to it a few months back and it just makes me happy when I get emails about new chapters. I'll do that :)

** Here is my take on time travel to 1930s:

1. I see nothing wrong in killing baby wizard Hitler and the real Adolf Hitler.

2. Practically though, I agree with you that turning Tom Riddle should yield a better outcome.

3. But, in almost every such time travels, Hermione (Harry, Ginny, Luna) ends up raising or shagging Tom. I'd like to see something different, something that has them killing off baby wizard Hitler right from the start, but later dealing with some nasty butterfly effects.

*** Butterfly effects could be interesting. Hitler/Voldemort weren't the sole sources of evil in their times. They had whole organizations full of people who were plenty evil, but just didn't manage to claw their way to the very top. Without Voldemort, who would reach that top spot, Umbridge?

**** I don't remember the fic but it brought up â€œwhat if Voldemort killed someone who would be worse than him one day and because you killed Voldemort, that guy is now free to do worse things.

***** similar thing with hitler, hitler was a major negative on the german military force constantly fighting with his generals and making stupid choices that hindered them

but the underlying hatred and bitterness would still be in that country and it would still boil away.

or maybe without hitler world war 2 is delayed by a decade and is far far more devastating as a result

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
