A mother to her 8 year old child: "Harry Potter lived with muggles for 16 years and didn't even know magic existed till he was 11. Now stop asking me to buy you a wand!"

A senior Auror to his trainee: "When Harry Potter was 11, he fought his DADA teacher who was possessed by Voldemort, and he killed him with with his bare hands! Burned him to ash! And here you are, getting sick because of seeing a little blood!"

A Quidditch coach to his rookie Chaser: "When Harry Potter was 14, he did a Wronski Feint with a Dragon. A BLOODY DRAGON! Now, are you going to keep complaining about too much wind or are you going to send that Quaffle in the bloody goals five times in a row?!"

A father to his 34 year old son: "By the time Harry Potter was 17, he had defeated the most powerful Dark Lord in the history and had ended the second wizarding war. What have you done with your life, you waste of space?"

However, while she /is/ wrong many times, she's always displayed as such blatantly onscreen. There is never, ever any doubt that Hermione is wrong in those circumstances

And seeing what we have seen of their world, the Wizards are absolutely people who just get on in the world due to their massive power, rather than a smudge of competence.

*** That might be a fun fic idea. The next generation grows up with Harry as the "ideal." Everyone raising their kids lived when he defeated Voldemort so they all revere him but the next generation starts to loathe his name and has trouble believing his supposed great deeds.

The next generation Gryffindors gets a real ego about being in the great Harry Potter's house and some of the trio's kids end up forming a Marauders sort of gang that takes pranks too far at times to the point of bullying. But they're still treated wonderfully because of who their parents are.

So Gryffindor becomes the sort of "asshole house" for this generation, high on their self-righteousness. Slytherins could still be being treated badly because of their reputation, their role in the battle of Hogwarts and the roles of a lot of students' parents in the war. The "bad blood" title for a lot of Slytherins is alot fresher in people's minds now.

So maybe the fic could revolve around a group of Slytherin kids having to deal with this oppressive sort of system and ending up forming an anti-Harry Potter group that becomes seen as "the rise of a dark wizard group" once again when really they're not really doing anything bad other than rebelling against the current system and not wanting to be seen as awful or "not as good as Harry Potter and his Gryffindors." And while the trio's kids are treated well no matter what, aged Harry and his friends aren't assholes themselves, but they also don't quite see their kids for the menace they are. So there could be a bit of nuance to their conflict.

Perhaps Albus Potter could even be one of these Slytherins, dissilusioned with how everyone treats his other family members and it could be a more grounded, less bizarre version of their conflict in "the Cursed Child."

**** That'll be kind of tough. Slytherins have a well deserved reputation for being a den of snakes (pardon the pun) with next to no ability to resist the social consensus.

It's just that, historically, they've been rich aristocrats who could get away with it.

They're not going to be the oppressed underclass in any world where their parents are still rich and hold the highest offices in the land. Britain isn't the US.

***** Hmm, well in 17 years a lot of old guard Slytherin wizards who were in power could have been killed in the war or ousted from their seats of power in a post war political revolution and replaced. Maybe the new minster hears about Snape being a double agent, gets paranoid and takes action against against former death eaters in office. They def wouldn't be powerless but the could certainly have their status reduced in the political scene and in the public eye in 17 years.

A lot would have to go right for this to happen though

****** That can and would /absolutely/ happen, or the new MoM cannot claim to hold power.....but notably, it's mentioned at the end that the Malfoys got away with their crimes.

And money always talks. Not to mention that Slytherins are generally dangerous sociopaths that seek more power.

Personally, I think the House should be liquidated and a Soviet Solution imposed upon them. But that's just me.

***** I think a more accurate representation of a Ravenclaw is "Did you know that Harry Potter had a brand new racing broom at eleven? Pretty interesting huh?" Not to get a broom but to share something they know with their parents. Because Ravenclaws like knowledge and learning. That might not include scientific data collecting and presenting said data in a professional manner. Just look at Luna for example.

Basically its next gen and the plot is that they are fed up of the HP worship and when he comes to teach at Hogwarts for a pr stunt it comes together like the manga/anime Assassination Classroom and a select group of students plot to kill him and fail every time.

It's a coming of age story and in the end they dont succeed but create a friendship that winter break.
