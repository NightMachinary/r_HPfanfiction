** Full Pensieve's [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Last_Horcrux_final/index/][Harry Potter and the Last Horcrux]] is quite sad throughout. 269k words, complete.

Lady Altair's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] certainly qualifies on the sadness front, though Harry is not the principal character.

Deadwoodpecker's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4871753/1/Through-a-Dark-Mirror][Through a Dark Mirror]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4774670/1/Socks][Socks]] both have a sombre tone.

It's been awhile since I read it, but I recall MuggleBeene's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8145563/1/Goodbye-Hermione][Goodbye Hermione]] as being quite sad throughout. [Edit: fixed link]

Though it's Hedwig-centric and listed as humor, the ending of Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4176058/1/India][India]] managed to draw a tear.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] is my favorite fanfiction. I've read it about half a dozen times, and each time I sobbed like a baby. It's not unrelentingly sad, there are definitely moments of humor, but it is heart-wrenching.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10027124/1/Playmate][Playmate]] really messed with me.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186589/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Two-Lovers][Harry Potter and the Two Lovers]] is not a sad fic itself, but there was one scene toward the end that almost broke me, it stuck with me for /days./

** If you can accept Snarry, then [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewseries.php?seriesid=29][If You Are Prepared]] is accepted within this ship as the single most heart-wrenching story in our corner of fandom. Warning: it will wreck you and I don't say that lightly.
