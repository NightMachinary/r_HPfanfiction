** Hey there, first of all I personally don't hate James.

That being said, James in the books is portrayed as nothing but obnoxious. I know he supposedly changed at some point but we never see that, we only hear it from others, so there's nothing much to like about him really.

**** You can still love your family and be obnoxious. James would have done the same for those he loved even before he supposedly grew up. Lucius Malfoy would have done the same for his son, wouldn't have made him less evil.

The point is we never see the final product, the supposedly mature not-bully James, which means he's stuck as this obnoxious bully in many peoples' heads, which makes him hard to empathise with.

** I used to hate James a lot, I think, and it was definitely to do with his being a bully - it wasn't just the bullying itself, though, but the nature of it. The attack on Snape in Snape's Worst Memory is just sick, honestly - regardless of the fact that it was Snape, using magic to cause that kind of humiliation, especially where you're threatening to take off your victim's underwear, is unspeakably cruel. I mean, honestly, that sounds terrifying for a fifteen-year-old.

Snape was a cunt. Obviously he was, and the way in which he snapped at Lily was understandably unforgivable.

But I think that just as people project onto James their highschool bully, others project onto Snape every cruel authority figure they've ever disliked, and work up a ridiculous hatred towards him, balanced out by a love for James.

I think that James was a bully - I think he was loud, obnoxious, proud of himself just for being himself, and I think he was very used to being given what he wanted. However, he was also courageous, capable of great honour, DEEPLY, deeply loyal, and a very loving friend and husband.

I think the fact many people forget is that you can indeed carry all these traits at once.

** Some readers forget that we only know James through the memories of others, and we only see him through Severus' memories. We know memories can be altered; even without magic we know we remember things differently from our peers.

That aside, yeah. Some of that hate comes from people who identify more with Severus than James.

*** Pensieve memories are supposed to be objective, though, and it's pretty obvious when they've been tampered with. Also, Snape didn't expect Harry to violate his privacy by sticking his head in the bowl. If Snape had been distrustful enough to try altering a memory, I'd wager it would have been the Mudblood moment, but there's no evidence in the books that it even occurred to him his memories weren't safe.

***** Oh, I agree about the unreliability of memory, but by magic's rules, we're expected to treat Pensieve memories as the most reliable form of "recording" an experience. I don't think Snape's hatred of James influences the actual content of the memory at all. The unreliability in that scene stems from Harry's interpretation, which has insufficient context for what's going on. Even so, when it comes to James, what you see in that memory is probably exactly what Harry thinks it is. The missing link is that Snape's betrayal of Lily is far worse than it appears at first glance. Meanwhile, James in that scene? Is being an asshole, full stop.

Memory as an unreliable index applies more to Sirius and his nostalgia and grief-tinged recollections of James than to SWM. Because Sirius, whatever else you can say about him, was quite a flamboyant asshole himself, and he apparently never saw anything wrong with almost leading Snape to his death at Remus's fangs. By the same token, Sirius isn't the best judge of whether the Marauders' behavior at school was laddish blokes simply having a bit of fun at a Slytherin's expense or actually reprehensible and cruel. He remembers their cruelty and James's arrogance fondly, which did nothing to rehabilitate James in my eyes when I was reading the books.

** To me the biggest issue with James bullying Snape is that it's a numbers game. Outside of James' friends they are pretty evenly matched and I'd probably say that Snape was more talented with a wand during Hogwarts, until James grew up, realised that there was a legit war going on, and that there where people he wanted to protect.

Snape's bullying of his students and in particular Harry and Neville is a person in a position of power picking on two dis-empowered children who have suffered many hardships in their short lives. Sure Harry could handle it, he was strong from day one, but Neville legitimately suffered. Snape's bullying of Harry gets even more pathetic and reprehensible when you consider that Snape is a major factor in the death of Harry's parents. If I had to rate the three biggest people involved in James and Lily's deaths: Voldemort, Snape then Pettigrew.

That's why I hate Snape, he's an embittered man who even though he was a direct factor in the death of James still treats James' son like dirt. He's a man who uses his position to belittle, mock and emotionally torture children. Sure he did things that helped end the war and deserves a level of commendation for that, but otherwise he was a reprehensible man. In no way does that Justify James and his friends actions towards Snape, but their actions are fairly standard schoolyard mockery with magic thrown in. Snape's actions where far above and beyond that.

For me though, I don't hate James. He was rough around the edges in his childhood but plenty of people where and come 7th year, and he grew up, and then began dating, and later marrying Lily he had someone to ground him. Plenty of people talk well of James and no matter a level of rose tinted glasses concerning those who have passed on Snape is pretty much the only person that bad mouths James in the entire series. That much respect from others would be earned.

*** I agree with pretty much everything you said. People are entitled to their opinions but I always get a bit annoyed with some peoples James hate. I know that he was by no means perfect. He was in fact a bully in school, at least in Snape's case, and came off as arrogant in the one memory we are shown. The problem is that the people who are usually hating on James are also going on about how amazing Snape is. How everything bad that happened to him is James's fault. I've seen some people going on about how James "stole the love of Snape's life" from him as if Lily were some possession and how by doing this he drove Snape to become a Death Eater. I find this mindset ridiculous. Like you said, I feel that Snape's actions as an adult were much worse than what James did as a child even if Snape sacrificed much for the war and saved Harry's life several times, it doesn't excuse his actions when he was a teacher.

** I agree with this statement.

James was a prick. I knew boys like James in high school, many of them with the same name funnily enough. They were assholes who never understood the affect their behaviour had because it was all in fun so long as they weren't on the same end of the stick (or they did know full well what they were doing and they were just evil pricks). Most of those people (girls do this too) take a lot longer to grow up and I watched it happen with these people over good time, while some still remain largely the same from those cringe years.

I'm going to assume that after that fight in fifth year, James began to take a very hard look at himself, eventually realising that being an asshole was taking its toll and not just because he loved Lily but needed to do it for himself, started to mature and change, while still retaining some of his traits but not so aggravatingly. Otherwise he wouldn't have been the husband to Lily and father to Harry by the age of 21.

And just like there is hate for James and sympathy for Snape, I think everyone who believes this in the fandom sorely underestimate Lily.

She didn't pick the lesser of two evils offered to her. She didn't have to pick James. I'm sure those weren't the only males who had any interest in her during her lifetime. In fact the persistence James had in that time has got to be one of the most unattractive aspects in dealing with someone who is a prick at that age.

But she did choose him. While we never get to see the change unfortunately (we don't get a scene in which Snape witnesses the two doing a curfew round as Head Boy and Head Girl, beginning to see the differences yet similarities to James from fifth year so it's not too OOC and that Lily warms to him as her Head partner, or the exact scene in which Sirius disappoints everybody and sends Snape to the Shrieking Shack before Remus transforms and James has to save him from being ripped to shreds because of his idiot best mate, etc) I have to give some of their peers (McGonagall hasn't got excuses for anybody, so if anybody would notice that change it would have been her so that could have been a magical conversation between her and Harry that might have solved his dilemma in fifth year - a new one shot has been created in mind) and friends some credit as well as the fact that had he not changed for himself, Lily certainly wouldn't have gone anywhere near him.

(Side note: There is actually a brilliant one-shot based on how James didn't make it in time, [[/spoiler][Sirius is sent to Azkaban for life, Snape is killed horrifically, Remus despite being incredibly remorseful obviously still has to serve the consequences and is given the Dementor's Kiss. Peter and James grow closer, as do Lily and James and instead of betraying them that night, Peter dies and the Potters live.]])

Everyone has some redeemable factors and serve the consequences for those actions under different circumstances, even if they come with almost irredeemable back stories which in my opinion include Sirius and Snape. I love reading both characters for both their lines and obvious flaws, but both are just as capable of their actions. Sirius sends Snape to his death, Snape stupidly trusts Voldemort to kill only Harry and James and to keep Lily alive. He's also a bit of a dick to Harry and Neville and just about everyone else when Harry pretty much had the same upbringing as Snape because his parents died and he grew up with the Dursley's of which Snape knew his Aunt apparently, so if you're trying to lead by example on how to stop the cycle - probs not the best way to go about it, you know?

TL;DR: James was a bully who grew up and people will always interpret that differently because they either grew up similar to the victim or similar to James (I'm not saying you were a bully - but if you had tendencies that you regret then maybe you might have been a slight dick, but I don't know you so obvs not judging you). From memory, he never tried to kill Snape.

I think we also have to remember that while James should cop some flack, Remus lets it fly even though he's clearly a Prefect and should be correcting their behaviour, Sirius is possibly the worst in those Hogwarts years if you put it all together in offences and well, Peter as an adult betrays them and frames Sirius, not only for the betrayal but the unnecessary deaths of the muggles nearby in their confrontation.

Also we never get to see James change because he never lived long enough to in Harry's perspective.

I realise this was meant to be a "Why do you hate James?" thread. I used to despise him when I read OOTP. And then I realised that Lily wasn't some braindead twit who just fell for James when he pulled his shit together a bit.

It's Chapter 21 of a series of one shots, which I've mostly found rather clever and are decently written, with the occasional "calm down" thought in mind.

They've always stuck with me, particularly this one which has coloured my view on Sirius if the situation had turned.

Edit: I got the consequences wrong but they're just as harsh, and there isn't a mention of Lily with the exception that she married James, most likely him changing very quickly because of what happens.

What do base this on?

Draco is a special case in that he never wanted to kill, but Voldemort would have killed his parents if he had failed. Dumbledore points out at the end of HBP that Draco knew his murder attempts were very unlikely to succeed, and wonders whether his heart was ever in them in the first place. Hardly equivalent to Sirius killing for shits and giggles.

Dumbledore also threatens Harry and Ron with expulsion at the beginning of CoS, so it's not as if he's unwilling to go there.

  As the Headmaster, the logical approach would be to expel Draco in order to protect the innocent students, regardless of what happens to the Malfoys (they made their bed, 'bout time they sleep on it) because the lives of the many is more important than the lives of the few (three in this instance).
#+end_quote

A 'logical' thing by your moral system certainly, but not Dumbledore's. Dumbledore does not view the world (and Draco) the same way you do.

#+begin_quote
  “Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to. A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to accept, he likes you -- ”

  “ -- much less since his father has lost favor. Draco blames me, he thinks I have usurped Lucius's position.”

  “All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemort's wrath.”

  [..]

  “If you don't mind dying,” said Snape roughly, “why not let Draco do it?”

  “That boy's soul is not yet so damaged,” said Dumbledore. “I would not have it ripped apart on my account.

  [..]

  “I'm not afraid!” snarled Malfoy, though he still made no move to hurt Dumbledore. “It's you who should be scared!”

  “But why? I don't think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe...
#+end_quote

Do note how Dumbledore views Draco: 'A frightened teenage boy', 'innocent', 'soul not yet so damaged'. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. Dumbledore views Draco as innocent, and he will not send him to his death (do note that expulsion = certain death, there is no way that Voldemort would let Draco live if he abandoned his mission), even at a risk to other students' lives. Effectively killing one student to /possibly/ save others (which you're advocating) is very much the /Greater Good/ morality that Dumbledore's spent the last few decades distancing himself from.

That said... Dumbledore obviously viewed Sirius and James (the latter is involved, but mostly blameless) as reckless teenagers too, which is why he protected them. I empathise with Draco more than Sirius in this case, because Draco did it under threat to his family and under huge mental stress, whereas Sirius not only risked Remus's life (surely he would have been put down had he succeeded in killing Snape), but tried to kill Snape for his /amusement/ and showed little remorse for it:

#+begin_quote
  "Sirius thought it would be --- er --- amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it --- if he'd got as far as this house, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf ---

Anyway, this also forgetting the fact that James grew up and matured. I know we didn't see it but we only saw two scenes with James in the whole series. Should he be condemned as a horrible person for his whole life just because he was a jerk at the age of 15? If so, then the worlds in trouble as i think most 15 year-olds are pretty self absorbed.

The last thing is Lily. I don't think it has ever been stated in canon that Lily just "gave into him." I think more of her character than to believe she would start dating, marry and have a child with someone because they bugged them long enough in school to wear them down... Just my thoughts.
