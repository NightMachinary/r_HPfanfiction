or fics that does not take HBP and DH into an account.

I prefer ones not focusing on romance (there can be pairings but it should not take too much space). Something not full of fanfic cliche (imo a lot of fics are great when they are published but when you read them several years later, it is like 'eww, how could this be one of my favourites'). Something you would read even now.

Thanks!

** Just reread linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) recently and can attest that it's a breath of fresh air. It was started pre-OoTP (but last updated between HBP and DH I think) and has a very different take on magic, the characters, and the world at large that essentially turns it into a heavy AU. It's a very well-written story as well.

Also, after re-reading it, I went looking for earlier fics in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6w9ry0/old_predh_high_quality_fics/][this thread]] if you want more recs.

** Well, this might not be quite what you're looking for, but this was written pre-HBP, and it's more or less Luna's POV for /Order of the Phoenix./

There's not much in the way of romance, minus Luna's crush on Ron. But given that Luna doesn't really understand romance, it's not particularly prominent.

There's a bit of cliche, I suppose--the author is ambiguous on whether Luna is seeing glimpses of the future. Though she's certainly not Sage!Luna.
