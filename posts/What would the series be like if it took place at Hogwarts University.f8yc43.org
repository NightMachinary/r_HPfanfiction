Pretty much a discussion, prompt, and looking for all in one: what would the HP series look like if it were time-shifted forward and/or Hogwarts was a post-secondary institution instead of a secondary school?

I wondered this after catching up on /the Magicians/ TV show - if you don't know, Brakebills is a magical university hidden in upstate New York. The only part of HP canon that would need to be discarded is Obscurials (for arguments' sake: you can only attend a magical school once your magic has had time to "settle" instead of needing to be trained to avoid magical build-up).

What would Hogwarts University look like? Would there still be four houses "sorted" by personality traits or by affinities? Would there be a greater divide between Purebloods and Muggleborns? Would Purebloods have more magical knowledge (learned from their parents) and therefore be ahead of Muggleborns, or would Muggleborns be more 'open' to different magical concepts, thanks to popular culture?

Would Muggleborns - being isolated longer - develop serious mental issues (anti-social personality disorder) or experience greater social issues (bullying, suicidal thoughts)? Would there be cliquey "hedge" witches and wizards, who never attend Hogwarts but find a way to do "off the books" magic?

Would Voldemort stick to the canon timeline or would he wait for Harry to attend Hogwarts? Would Sirius still escape in 1993, or would he wait until Wormtail's photo was taken? Would he remain a rat for 7 more years than in canon?

Would Harry be different from a Stonewall Secondary education? Hermione? Would they become friends with Ron? Or others? How would they handle the Philosopher's Stone? The Chamber of Secrets? A TriWizard Tournament?

Anyway -- these questions clearly got away from me. I've never seen either a time-shifted canon story set to adult character ages, or Hogwarts as a university. If someone knows of those stories, I'd love to read them, else this will be shelved to be worked on after my WIPs (so, like, the unlikely future). And I'd love to know your thoughts!


** More worldbuilding in terms of other wizarding careers I'd imagine. If Voldemort became active I'd imagine Harry would be more proactive if he were to pursue his career as an Auror. The Auror Office itself would probably be fleshed out more, from what little we know about them they seem to be a hybrid mix of a domestic and foreign intelligence agency/law enforcement organization.

**** I'd imagine there might be more specialization if Hogwarts was set as a post-secondary institution. Healers might have selective courses that students take if they want to be a Healer.

Specialization does seem to be the norm in the world of HP. Aurors are selected right out of Hogwarts for further training, and they have high standards according to McGonagall. Their selection process seems to follow much of special forces selection in the real world, where there's a high drop out rate(Tonks was the only candidate accepted and there were none others following her acceptance for three years).

** I can honestly say I'm not overly sure about this. On one hand, Oxford Uni was founded in the late 1000s (can't remember when precisely), which is barely a thousand years after Hogwarts in 990. So, the culture wouldn't be wholly different. On the other hand, waiting until 18 to start Hogwarts would lead to a whole lot more identity-solidity in Muggleborns. At a guess, I'd say there'd be borderline US-College-Movie level Cliques and Ghettoisation between the cliques. They'd probably have less support from Parents, and learning would be harder (eg. we find it more difficult to learn new concepts the older we get, with neuroplasticity dropping off drastically after your mid-twenties ish, IIRC). There'd be a lot less of an alumni/legacy feel to Hogwarts too.

If it's taken in a modern university sense, there probably wouldn't be houses. They're not really needed. There might be named dorms if it's still a boarding university. Logistics would also be different - letter sending is a lot different when you're eighteen and possibly living alone than when you're eleven and all your mail is screened by your parents.

Home-schooling is a thing in England, but far less of one than in the US, so I don't know how hedge-wizardry would manifest. Probably more like a punk/skinhead-like counterculture. Bunch of loners in dark clothing get together in one area and form a coven, then read a lot of books and talk about how crap the government and society is, basically. Probably a lot of powerful dark wizards preying on them, too. I can picture a sort of delegate from the Magical Government being assigned to make regular check-ups of any formally registered covens to make sure they're obeying the rules, and all of them acting like teen-movie dorm kids do when the RA comes along to check for the weed or alcohol you're now hiding and desperately hoping they don't find. :D

That is a very interesting prompt. Hell, if you don't do that, I just might. Goddamn. You'd have to be very careful to get it adequately britpicked, our university experiences are drastically different to the US college/uni experiences. Unless you're British, but I'm guessing from the clarification of 'upstate New York' that you're American, since I've met very few Brits who actually know New York is both a state and a city.

*** Canadian actually! I love the idea as a prompt, personally, if only because there's /so much/ worldbuilding that could be done with the idea.

I hadn't thought about the Dark wizard thing; if shifting the canon timeline, it could bring a very interesting new angle to Voldemort and his Death Eaters - or even Dumbledore's Order!

On the other hand, there could be extreme legacy feels for purebloods versus a lack for Muggleborns or half-bloods. In the Magicians, parents can teach their children magic but they're either homeschooled or sent to public education; I see homeschooling an option in this potential time shift!

Go for it! I need to actually finish my stories before I attempt anything new. But definitely link it if you do!!

**** Definitely. So much worldbuilding, and so much /interesting/ worldbuilding at that. You'd have to work to keep it Harry Potter and not Harry Dresden (Jim Butcher Urban Fantasy novel series), but it'd more than like be worth the work.

Indeed! I expect there'd be a lot more politicking in a world like this. More of that "Send Hagrid to the giants, Remus to the werewolves, and Sirius to the deadbeat kids down the road" sort of vibe. :)

I can very much picture a Fagin-esque Dark Wizard running a gang of disenfranchised street teen wizards as a proper Coven-cum-Streetgang. Definitely a lot of favour-trading between the two sides of the Blood War and the various gang leaders.

Probably a scene with Hagrid in biker leathers on Sirius motorbike or something too. :D

I don't know, if they can teach magic when they're young, there's not much sense in waiting. You'd either have to have a really good reason why the Magicals get prep-school magic classes but only go into formal education later, or a really good reason why they wouldn't need Muggleborns for seven years longer. If not, I'd suggest keeping it to basic non-casting skills and theory for the prep-schools.

I'll let you know if I do. I have one big idea I'm really in love with at the moment for a Harry Potter fic, and fourteen Life is Strange fics to finish, so I'll probably be a mite delayed too. :D

**** Sorry, that should've been 'new concepts' not 'basic concepts'. It's a little overstated in academic literature, but it is a decently strong influence. Essentially, you learn by changing your brain (usually by growing new bits to store the new concepts) and your brain gets harder to change the older you get. It's why it's easier to learn new languages and to play music and such if you start when you're a kid than when you're older.

***** I think learning would be.. different. Presumably, there'd be an expectation of a baseline level of skill prior to entering Hogwarts, like there is in canon (eg, everyone knowing how to read/write in canon). That would lead to the ability to teach much more advanced subjects and mechanics.

Eg, going deep into the theory of potion brewing doesn't really seem to me like what you'd teach an 11 year old. But for an 18 year old, it would seem weird to just say 'mix this' and never have any theory behind it.

If you've never heard of an atom or a mole, you still need to have those terms defined before you can get onto Titration or Brownian Motion, no matter how old you are.

I always thought having no theory behind potions was just Snape, not potions training in general, but I don't really remember Slughorn's canon lessons too well.

******* Well, I didn't necessarily mean that it'd correlate with the muggle subjects - though in my mind, a higher baseline level of math would certainly have an effect. For potion-making in particular, I would expect that some of the principles of chemistry and ways of thinking about it would be applicable - but that it wouldn't transfer 1:1 (ie, nothing with atoms - but the way of thinking about reactions and molecules would transfer over to the mechanics of the magical reagents/reactions in potions).

Past that, I admit I was thinking more of what the non-muggleborns would have skill level wise - it's always surprised me how even everything is in canon, and how little those who grew up in the WW seemed to know going into school. At a later age, there'd hopefully have been a baseline of teaching that they'd be building on there.

The best handwaving I've seen of the lack of theory is that JKR found it boring, and that it's all supposed to be there in the background (eg, their essays). I'm just not convinced by it, as a chemist/chemical engineer who'd like to get that greater theory :P

******** Fair. Yeah, if we're talking strictly magical-raised, they'd definitely have to up the teaching level. If they couldn't cast until 18, the kids would just be taught theory until their eyes bled up 'til that point. The Muggleborn kids would be having to get used to a whole new paradigm of thought though, if the Muggle Subjects didn't correlate well. Maybe if they arrived a year earlier and got a kind of 'foundation course' (a preparatory course in the UK akin to the US 'pre-whatever' courses designed to get your necessary skills up to allow you to do a proper degree) in basic magical philosophy and epistemology, in order to let them have the basic understanding needed to get those complex magical theories. It'd probably only increase the ghettoised gap, those Muggle-raised kids bonding throughout that year while the magic-raised bound throughout their lives. Now I understand what you were getting at, I definitely agree that older kids would have a stronger 'baseline of teaching' (great phrase) that the University of Hogwarts would build on with more complex stuff.

For the Muggle children, it's the old "I can tell you that E=MC^{2,} but unless you know what E, M, and C mean, and how to square a number, telling you that is completely useless" problem though. I'm sure as an engineer, you saw people who struggled with first year concepts struggling far more in later years when you built to the more complex and intricate stuff, right? Gotta fill that baseline before you can build on it.

I mean, that's probably the right answer. Detail is certainly subject to the whims of Rowling throughout the series and she certainly seems bored enough by her own continuity and ruleset anyway considering how often she ignores/breaks/modifies it.

*** On your comment about houses, you'd probably still have them, but they'd be colleges as opposed to houses, a la Oxbridge. Because of that you may end up with more isolation between houses/colleges than we see in canon, and you'd be 'sorted' or just apply to the different colleges before you started your first year. This is, of course, assuming that the number of students is increased from canon, 40 people per year is tiny for a secondary school and practically unviable for a University, the Oxford intake this year was about 3300 students.

Like 'Gryffindor College is the School of Defence, Hufflepuff College is the School of Healing, etc'? Or is it just a mix of dorm and fraternity?

I don't currently have access to the population stats for early Universities, but I'd expect them to be a lot lower than modern unis. In England, especially. It'd have a similar dynamic to 'this school can only be attended by the upper class' in Muggle Parlance, only it'd be Magic-users instead of rich nobles, I expect.

***** I have no idea how applications worked historically, so I'm basing this off my own experience applying last year, and studying this year.

I'm not really familiar with dorms and fraternities, beyond hearing them thrown around in Hollywood films, so I can't really draw a comparison, but colleges at Oxbridge manage the less academic side of Uni, so accommodation is done in college, most Welfare support is done by your college and most of the parties (we call them BOPs, I have no idea why) are hosted by and for the college.

Colleges don't have specific specialties per se, pretty much all of them offer the typical classics, science, philosophy and english courses, while the more obscure courses like Archeology are only offered at a few.

I also can't speak for Ofxords early years, but by 1990 the split of private school students to state school students was about 50-50, though considering how behind magical society seems to be, that number may be considerably lower.

As for size, it varies. My college has about 300 undergraduates across all years of study, and my year has about 90 Freshers, but the smallest and largest have 90 and 500 undergrads respectively.

****** Well firstly, congrats from a random person on the internet on getting into Oxbridge. Go you, fellow internet person. :)

Ah, okay. So a college is a pastoral rather than academic University institution. Sounds sort of like a fraternity then in provision, but drastically different in obligations - I'm English, so I've no personal experience with them, but to my understanding a fraternity/sorority is a semi-national independent-of-the-college/uni organisation with an individual name and branding scheme that rents out accommodation and organises social activities like fundraisers and parties while requiring you to undergo testing for membership and charge fees of some description. Sounds like an Oxbridge College provides similar things, but as a department of the uni rather than an independent group.

Understood about the courses. The only reason I asked is that my uni (Huddersfield) had departments being called 'The School of... whatever subject' that were occasionally also referred to as colleges. I wasn't sure if that was a universal thing or just a couple of teachers' slang/mistakes.

I don't know about behind being the reason for lower numbers, the society is just... smaller. It'd make sense for there to be a lot less than 3300 students considering that's (according to Rowling's terrible maths) how many Wizards there are in the entire country. :D

According to the tab fresher's guide, a BOP is a 'Big Open Party'.

****** I think the issue is on the usage of "university," which prompts images of large campuses, prestige, etc.

If it were Hogwarts *college*, and took on a more American liberal college feel, then the intake would be smaller, there would be shorter degree programs of two or three years, and it would be considered a stepping ground for additional schooling or the workplace. (Essentially, Last Chance I on Netflix).

The issue here is the numbers in canon, which we still don't really know. And then hire those numbers would appear for the medical equivalent. If highways is still the only educational institute in Britain and people need to be educated, then the numbers could stay the same.

But how you get those students there as legal adults is a different story....

You could argue that Voldemort would be a completely different person if he hadn't been able to go to hogwarts until he was an adult. Maybe he would have been caught and imprisoned sooner since him mind controlling children at 16 years old would be less tolerated than him doing it at 9 or 10 years old.

The way I see it is that Voldemort only came to Hogwarts to go after the stone, so if you make the assumption that Dumbledore gets the stone in 1991, then Voldemort will follow. If not, then Voldemort does something else and the whole plot of the first book can be bypassed completely. Sirius only made an attempt to escape once he knew Wormtail was alive, so we can assume that something would only happen once the Weasley family makes that trip (whether it's in 1993 or some time later).

** I think the main difference, education wise, would be a significantly larger focus on the mechanics of magic and the /why/. In canon, most of what we see them do seems to be around just doing magic - practicing a spell, mixing potions, etc, but there's comparatively a lot less theory (or at the least, it's not really mentioned). A Hogwarts with an older set of students would almost certainly include a lot more about that theory.

In terms of the structure, I think it would still retain the houses - it's too much an integral part of Hogwarts for me for that to change! I would imagine it would affect muggleborns and poor wizards more, with the richer half/pure-bloods knowing of the magical world and having the wealth to get better primary education.

However, I'd like to bring a slight shift to this - and towards my favorite age shifting in Hogwarts, where it doubles up as a secondary school and university. Basically, starting Hogwarts at 14 instead of 11, with OWLs after 4th year - that makes it so that the characters, while still young, come of age halfway through. Those who stay at Hogwarts after OWLs would be more like a university.

The benefit from that is that it makes a lot of things from fanfiction a lot more reasonable - the hyper smart/advanced protagonists (eg, a potions prodigy impressing Snape enough to be his apprentice makes more sense at 14 than 11, IMO), the political maneuvering (at 14-16 for 1st-3rd years, it's much more reasonable than 11-13 for the classic Slytherin political children), more difficult challenges/classes, etc. It ages up the series to a degree that I think fits the plots a lot of people want - while still maintaining the coming of age/school setting.

It's something I think is underused - IMO, if a fic is going to heavily feature first years as political entities, it would make sense to do something like that ;)

** I mean basically everything in story would be different. Whisking adults away to magic school would be vastly different than children.

Let's just look at Harry's situation. Petunia and Lily probably don't have a huge falling out because Petunia and Lily's parents probably wouldn't even know magic exists.

Harry himself was probably at the very least born later if at all since James and Lily got married at 19 in Canon. This applies to a lot of the half-bloods and purebloods, so you would see all the muggleborns having the same birthdate while a lot of the non muggleborns would either be missing or replaced with someone else.

** There would be a whole lot more beer and ramen.

And sex. Lots of sex.

Also, no 'house points', as in University, the instructors just plain don't give a fuck.

And Dumbledore would have the Gryffindors on Double Secret Probation.
