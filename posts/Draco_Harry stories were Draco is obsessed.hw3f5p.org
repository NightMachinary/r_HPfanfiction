I just think that Draco has always been unhealthily interested in Harry even in canon so I would appreciate recommendations for stories were this obsession with Harry is maybe explored more. Kind of like a voyeur maybe? Oblivious Harry and a brooding Draco in denial.

**** You're welcome! This particular sub isn't tolerant toward slash fandom or open to fans of the main Slytherin characters, so it's nice to have another community where you can ask for recs.
