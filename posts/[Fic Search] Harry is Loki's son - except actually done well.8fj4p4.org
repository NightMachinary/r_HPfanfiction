I can remember reading a certain fic a while back where Harry was (Marvel) Loki's son. However, Loki kept him hidden from Asgard as Odin had a history of treating his children badly (these scenes I can remember from the fic itself and are probably the most useful for identifying it):

- Jormungandr was exiled to Earth long ago, [[/spoiler][he was found during the story by the main cast in a coastal American diner in human form]].

- Fenrir was bound to a large rock in an Asgardian forest with a magical chain, [[/spoiler][which Harry somehow managed to free him from]].

- Hela was in the fic as well, but I can't remember her circumstances well enough to use them as a possible indicator of which fic I'm talking about. It may have been written before Thor: Ragnarok.

I have done a little bit of hunting around and the only fic I've found that comes close is called 'Harry Lokison the Trickster's Heir' (linkffn(7009094)) but that is certainly not the fic I'm looking for. The fic I'm looking for is generally well-written with decent/good characterisations (it didn't feel like a super!Harry turbostomp everything - [[/spoiler][Odin felt like a real and dangerous threat in this story, if he ever learned of Harry's existence]]). Any help finding this fic would be appreciated!

*** I read it, writing was pretty awful, minimal actual character development, the author somehow twists every male character into a love interest; harry or fray or whatever the fuck is pretty much a gary sue, not worth reading imo.

**** Agreed, it had great potential but the romance overpowered everything and turned Harry into a walking cliche. Apparently adventures are merely a vehicle for Harry to meet love interests.
