So... I was watching now you see me 2 and here's my idea. Harry goes through the veil and wakes up in the Now You See Me universe. And since there is no statute of secrecy, decides to use his magic to make a name for himself as a magician, to eventually be recruited to join the horsemen (starts before "now you see me" goes until end of the first or second movie) after thought: Harry doesn't require a wand to use ANY of his magic (elder wand repaired and fused with him, his Phoenix wand fused with him, or something else completely, or he's just overpowered as heck)


** Btw, i have no skill at writing, so if anyone wants to write it, feel free, all i ask is that a link to the story be put down here in the comments

*** Agreed, i can come up with an idea for a story, but i can't put it into words... Well if i wanted a 5k word story MAX then i MIGHT be able to do that... But that doesnt really sound like a fun story to read if its that short

**** It might also be half gibberish to fill up space and have no plot or purpose
