Things I remember:

-Time Jumps, Hermione can't control when she goes and when she next comes in the timeline (1st jump starts waaay in the past, and then each jump brings her closer to the original year Hermione started her adventure)

-Hermione saves Merope Gaunt, but then accidentally kidnaps Tom Riddle for a year when she suddenly time jumps

-Hermione turns up when Tom Riddle is about to make significant life choices to give advice

-Due to Hermione's influence, Tom Riddle doesn't become a Dark Lord, and I think he actually becomes a Hogwarts Professor(?)

-Hermione helps guide Dumbledore away from the “for the greater good” manipulative-mindset

-I think the only official people aware of Hermione's time jumps are Albus Dumbledore, Tom Riddle, and G. Grindelwald(?)

-Hermione becomes the subject of a creepy- fascination for Grindelwald. Later in the story, Grindlewald figures out how to trap Hermione in a time and place, and she needs rescuing(?).

Edit: I found it!!! I forgot that there was some double time travel in it and the pairings totally through me for a loop in the re-read but the time travel I remembered/mentioned in this post starts at Ch 13. Of course the story will make more sense if you start at the beginning. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12076137/1/][FFN 12076137]]
