The Carrow twins

Rionach O Neal

The two names on the DA parchment : Alice Tolipan and Luca Caruso

Do they not exist in your version of the Harry Potter universe ? Or do they ?


** For me, Movies are the equivalent of an AU fanfic written by Steve Kloves who ships Harmony and bashes Ron and Ginny.

I couldn't care less about new characters they created. On the other hand, I don't mind anyone using them.

** When I need a filler character I'll go to movie characters, but I wouldn't use them for anything major.

** They are useful to have around as blanks to fill whatever role you need them to be. The Carrows can be competent junior Death Eaters or the good Slytherin. Also, if you want to add some more students, you might as well use the movie names.

** The Carrow twins are in the book. Flora and Hestia are their names. They're in the Slug Club.

*** There are two sets of Carrow twins.

Alecto and Amycus Carrow were mentioned by name directly in the books, originally just as the Carrows and with their first names in the sixth (they're in the tower when Dumbledore dies) and seventh books (when they teach at Hogwarts).

Flora and Hestia Carrow are movie characters. They were never in the books.

**** There is nothing in the books to suggest that Alecto and Amycus are twins, just brother and sister.

***** Yes, I'm sure. Those are not the Carrow twins. Amycus and Alecto are a brother and sister who were Death Eaters and were in the books. The twins are Flora ([[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Flora_Carrow]]) and Hestia ([[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hestia_Carrow]]) twin girls who were members of the Slug Club in the movies.
