:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In the first one, as far as I can remember, Dumbledore is the power that keeps Grindewald's lieutenants, those that remain after his defeat, at bay and as his death draws near he starts to teach Harry all that he needs to fight them.

I'm afraid that i don't remember much about the second one, there was just one curiosity that keeps nagging at me. Towards the end of this fiction Hermione secretly joins the Death Eaters. That a first one for me especially since she was not a Slytherin. Other things that I remember are that Death Eaters are with Voldemort in Italy for some reason and that Hermione is in France and no longer at Hogwarts.

I'm aware that all of this is pretty vague but any hints will help. Also I now realize that it's possible that they are the same story, so there's that ðŸ˜„

Anyway, thanks a lot guys!!!


** The second one sounds like a mary sue hermione time travel fanfic I read years ago. Can't remember the name.

***** Read this one too. Also a mary sue hermione.

Not the one I was talking about though. I was thinking of the one where hermione is reborn as james twin and she winds up with remus and joins the death eaters and convinces lucius and several others to jump ship. Can't remember the name though.
