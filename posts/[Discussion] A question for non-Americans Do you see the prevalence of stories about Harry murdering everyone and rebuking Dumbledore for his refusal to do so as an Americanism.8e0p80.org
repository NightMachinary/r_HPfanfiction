Through chance, I've read several stories that embraced the notion that it was Harry's moral imperative to kill anyone who was remotely traditionalist. Not just Death Eaters or fanatical pure-bloods but anyone who didn't fully comply with Harry's (usually dark Harry) worldview.

In all these stories, Dumbledore is at fault for everything because of his refusal to kill his opponent and is continuously depicted as limp-wristed and ineffectual.

Interestingly, Moody who canonically "/...never killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible./" is usually presented as completely in favour of Harry's murderous intent and will argue with Dumbledore on the merits of mass homicide.

All other characters are presented as either good (in that they totally support Harry's actions), stupid (in that they disagree) or are the designated evil characters.

*What I want to know is*; do people outside the US see these types of stories as a reflection of American culture? ie: The continued use of [[https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/images/DP-State-Map-B.png][Capital Punishment]] or notions such as “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun.”

Thanks for your time, please be civil.


** As a Swiss, no. Europe might not have the death penalty any more, but the police here aren't that shy about shooting to kill.

Both "Kill everyone who disagrees" and "never kill, no matter what" are extremes and moral failures of the worst kind. Sometimes, the only morally acceptable action is to kill, since letting someone get murdered is the more evil action.

In canon, Remus berates Harry for not risking the death of his enemies, so it's not as if Dumbledore's Order was pacifist. I see Dumbledore's refusal to kill Voldemort as yet another (stupid) plot device to keep him from ruining the plot since "Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit" isn't exactly what a man who thinks life is sacrosanct would say. That sounds more like the aforementioned edgy teenager, actually.

The thing is, once the conflict with Voldemort changes from what can still be seen as a police action to outright civil war, the characters should react accordingly.

*** I think Dumbledore's refusal to take Voldemort's life actually stemmed from his knowledge of the horcruxes. Dumbledore knew that a simple killing curse would just allow Voldemort to revive himself later. Not only that, but then he'd be in the same position he was just in - the ministry would say Voldemort is dead, and Dumbledore would insist he is alive. On the other hand, incapacitating Voldemort would still end the war. Dumbledores excuse stems from the fact that he can't let Voldemort know he knows about the horcruxes. Voldemort just dismisses it and takes Dumbledore's refusal to kill as more evidence that he is a fool.

Edit: and also the prophecy. It says Harry has to kill Voldemort and it also says it in the part that Voldemort didn't hear.(I think) So that's another reason for the waffly excuse - it'd give away the prophecy.

**** Yeah he'll come back to life eventually, but last time he died there were 13 years of peace, and his resurrection involved significant effort and resources. Killing him takes him out of play, it redirects his followers efforts, and it frees up the good guys to search for and destroy his horcruxes. Seems like an excellent plan to me.

And it's not like the prophecy means he can't die- he already did die with the prophecy in place. I never understood why they wanted to avoid killing him until they destroyed his horcruxes, just because he might come back later. Dying and coming back later is still better than staying around the whole time!

So the ministry is still hiding its head under the sand, and Dumbledore is still insane when he says Voldemort is still alive. And frankly saying that Dumbledore would just cast a stunner or something similar is ridiculous. If Voldemort being dead wouldn't satisfy him, why would a stunner satisfy him? Unless he has a lot of faith in the judicial system and wants to see Voldemort go through it, I think he would use spells or curses that cause pain or mental anguish.

And the alternative of shrugging your shoulders and saying, oh well, he can come back later, so there's no point in trying to kill him now, is moronic. There are no circumstances ever where an even temporarily dead Voldemort isn't better than an alive Voldemort. Voldemort being alive is the main impediment to stopping his followers, so once he's dead, they could have a real chance of preventing his resurrection entirely, leaving them free to hunt down his horcruxes in peace.

Saying that there are no circumstances where a temporarily dead Voldemort isn't better than a live one is wrong. Which is better? A temporarily dead Voldemort or a Voldemort who has all his memories wiped a la Lockhart? Maybe throw in cutting his limbs off with sectumsempra, put a draught of living death down his throat, and you have a living Voldemort who would be hard pressed to do any damage. Maybe hide him under a fidelius. By saying that a dead Voldemort is always better, you are buying into (well some of ) the same beliefs Voldemort has - that death is the worst thing that can happen to you.

**** Quite right. Slight correction, however: I find it unlikely a Killing Curse would do /anything/ to a Horcruxed Voldemort. It doesn't physically alter the body, seemingly just affecting the soul (in that it violently kicks it into the beyond), so as long as Voldie's soul was anchored to the real world he might imaginably shrug it off.

******* I dunno how you came to that conclusion. The sacrificial protection was just protection, it bounced the curse back, there was no 'infusing', in my opinion anyway. The explosion was the result of his death, not the cause; the result of his soul being ripped apart, one fragment latching onto Harry, the rest, the 'master soul', bring expelled violently outward. After all, the explosion only detonated in one direction, the direction of the destroyed wall, so it's less that he blew up like a bomb and more that the curse violently forced his soul away.

Edit: To keep things in focus; that explosion stuff is just speculation on my part, but what I do know is that the books say the curse was rebounded because of Lily's protection, which caused Voldemort to be reduced to a spirit instead of dying (because of his horcruxes, obviously). There's no mention anywhere of the protection 'infusing' or enhancing the curse, or 'gigantic magical backlash', so I tend to believe the killing curse is what 'killed' him.

******** To be honest to me Achille's reasoning makes sense.

Granted, it's just a theory, but you can't deny that Voldemort's first disposal couldn't possibly be the result of a standard killing curse. The results are totally the inverse of what a killing curse does. We have utter obliteration of the body+distruction of part of the house vs painless and markless death.

So in my opinion it's still the result of Harry's protection. Whether directly as in "smiting Voldy for attempting to harm him" or indirectly as in "the curse rebounded and was morphed as a result.

So Achille's theory that a normal AK wouldn't harm him is still sound.

Also, I'd like to point out that whatever happened isn't actually known. We may have Dumbledore's explanation but for all we know it might be totally wrong. As he himself would say, he can also make mistakes, and when he does they are usually bigger. The books are still mostly described from Harry's pov and what we know of those happenings is only what Harry has been told.

Well, perhaps I'm influenced by the movies here, but it seemed to me that the sort of thing that happened with Quirrell in /Philosopher's Stone/, magically amplified, seemed very similar to Voldemort's body being obliterated in 1981.

Your interpretation works as well, of course, but it sits on ice exactly as thin as mine: it requires one to accept that ripping apart a soul produces outwards, physical effects like an explosion. We don't actually see the process elswhere, but no evidence of such was found in the Riddle House after Voldemort Horcruxed the Ring there, and overall souls don't seem to have much physical existence.

Look at Batman. And for criminals, that might apply, but not active warfare. Hence why the aurors were granted permission to use the Unforgivables; it was wartime.

It also strikes me that the Order was dancing on the border of legalization. If they'd been killing people, they'd have been outside the law, in a way the courts might not be able to ignore.

By age 14, pretty much everyone in Germany knows about the gruesome details of the Holocaust, has seen movies with close ups of death camp survivors and was told that their ancestors are to be blamed for this by the public school. We all know that our grandfathers and/or great grandfathers fought and killed. When I was twelve, I was told how my grandfather dragged a wounded soldier (the future Bishop of Cologne) to the Soviet lines to get him treated there. I was told how he deserted in 1945 and hid together with a French Forced worker on our farm. I heard stories how allied bombers attacked Bullay Bridge but only hit everything around it. I know that plenty of people here have similar experience with the past and their ancestors. Maybe because we're German, but there was never much innocence for us. And honestly, telling Harry that his parents killed a bunch of racist bigots (there was no draft for the Death Eaters, unlike in WWII Europe) would probably make him proud that they were doing the right thing. I mean, the boy has a memory of watching his parents murder, do you really think that telling them about his parents fighting would lose his innocence. Or that Hermione has no World War veterans in her family?

Because that will be so effective if a Death Eater squad is coming at you. I'm not saying that you should take them on, but if you want to escape, you need to either disable or at least distract them. And unless you transfigure the whistle into a handgrenade, it will not help you. Yes, kids should not worry about killing, but if a SA ripoff is after them, it's better that children lose their innocence rather than losing their lives.

But if only one side uses the hard to counter magic while the other stays at schoolyard level, "one-sided" doesn't even begin to describe the resulting confrontations. It is arguable that the Death Eaters were inferior fighters, but their willingness to resort to lethal spells was a great force equaliser.

It was the utter incompetence of adults (the Ministry especially) in the Series that forced those kids to fight in the first place. Dumbledore could have done more, but I don't think he should be blamed/bashed that much in the fandom.

The British Ministry of Magic, however, was the perfect model of a failed state and an utter piece of shit. It should be seriously purged and cleansed after the kids had scored their hard won victory.

** (Yes I'm American but I couldn't help commenting)

I really just see it as edgy teens doing what they do, not solely American (although it is rather liked here, in an odd kind of way). American influence is possible, but teenagers and college students aren't always the deepest thinkers, so I take that into account.

That said, Canon Dumbledore never killing always seemed hopelessly idealistic to me. I mean, he had me interested when he said that killing Riddle wouldn't satisfy him. But beyond that, it just reeked of the Superman problem:

Dumbledore can preach about killing being the worst evil (and JKR can construct an in-universe explanation for why that is) but the real issue is Dumbledore is powerful enough to solve individual problems without killing. Next to no one else has that luxury so his ethical pronouncements on the issue ought to fall on deaf ears.

Like, I have tons of issues with cops and the malpractice that many of them engage in with the assistance of the legal system here in the states. But if a cop guns down a mass shooter I'm not gonna cry about it. It's not because of that crap, simplistic nonsense of "only a good guy with a gun" (because "good guys" with guns kill lots of people, in actual fact). Rather, that sometimes circumstances force one to prioritize certain moral principles. Most of the time killing someone is bad, but if that someone is about to (or already has) killed a bunch of innocents, well, what are you honestly going to let take precedent?

Eh, Europe decided to disarm altogether (personal firearms), for good or for ill.

However, the idea that Europe is liberal hippie land of peace and love is a fairly recent one. Europe was in an almost constant state of warfare for *2000 years*, until WW2 ended. If you study a bit of each country's history up to WW2, you'll see it was skirmish after skirmish, civil war after civil war, massacre after massacre. This shit is stamped on the population's collective consciousness. Two or three generations are not enough to evolve beyond that. If the necessary conditions appear (i.e economic collapse, enviromental crisis), I am fairly convinced violence will reappear in a heartbeat.

** Crazy idea: What if it's the result of fanfic writers asking themselves the question, "How would I deal with this issue?", not, "How would Harry deal with this issue?"

Because from our perspective, we know everything there is to know. Of course Voldemort and Pettigrew are evil, just look at the little Hangleton scene! Of course the Malfoys are involved with Voldemort, just look at (I don't actually remember if there is a scene like this, but pretend)!

But the characters can't know that. If you told Sirius Black that Peter Pettigrew would grow up and help bring Voldemort back, he'd probably laugh and ask if you'd taken a look at meek, shy Peter. And can you really tell me you know for sure Lucius wasn't Imperiused, considering it was Voldemort who might have been doing it?

If our world was a story for some other world, I can guarantee you someone's written a fanfic in which they drone strike every terrorist/terrorist sympathizer in the world simultaneously and then berated the UN/US for not doing this. But we don't know who those people are, and so we have to exercise immense restraint, lest we kill someone innocent.

No, no, no. This is a common HP trope but it completely misunderstands both the actual law and the role of capital punishment in the UK.

Firstly, only High Treason, as in against the Head of State or national sovereignty, was even punishable by hanging. The Death Eaters never tried to take over Muggle government, let alone rebel against the Head of State or invade the UK as a foreign power - and the MoM was clearly stated as being outside the realm of Muggle government, so taking over magical government was clearly not the same thing. What they did would have been classified as terrorism under UK law, which most definitely came no where near a hanging offence.

Secondly, hanging was still legal until 1998, but it had been obsolete since just after WW2. Marcus Sarjeant /actually shot at the Queen/ in 1981 and was convicted of High Treason and didn't face hanging, and there have been other High Treason convictions for selling state secrets to foreign powers prior to 1998 that equally were given jail time over capital punishment. It wasn't something that would have been sentenced for the Death Eaters.

/If/ they had managed to take over wizarding Britain, which isn't linked to the Muggle UK by law, then perhaps - but Voldemort's battles were clearly against Muggleborns and was a wizarding war, as opposed to Grindelwald's clear belief in Muggle subjugation. If Voldemort had conquered wizard Britain, perhaps - but never once is his plan to come out of secrecy and take over the Muggle UK made explicit.

In addition, the scenes with the UK Prime Minister make it clear that Voldemort is conserved a wizarding problem, and not a Muggle one in terms of both the war and punishment, so Muggle law wouldn't have jurisdiction.

#+begin_quote
  And the treason act predates the Statue of secrecy and was, to the best of our knowledge, not revoked.
#+end_quote

Only the first part of the Act. The second part, disruption of the succession, was only introduced in the 1700's, after the Statute of Secrecy.

However, if you want to include the excuse of not having been revoked and that wizards are still under that law, then technically the whole MoM is committing treason, as they have hidden members of society from registration and census, and rule without democratic vote or Crown signatory, and allowing murder of prisoners etc which was illegal long before the actions of the books, and tell the Prime Minister (the Queen's official leader of government) what to do under intimidation.

To anyone versed with UK law, it's clearly obvious that wizards run their own show completely separately from UK law - fic writers just like to pinch the archaic and grisly bits that suit them best.

#+begin_quote
  Veritaserum works best upon the unsuspecting, the vulnerable and those insufficiently skilled (in one way or another) to protect themselves against it. Barty Crouch had been attacked before the potion was given to him and was still very groggy, otherwise he could have employed a range of measures against the Potion - he might have sealed his own throat and faked a declaration of innocence, transformed the Potion into something else before it touched his lips, or employed Occlumency against its effects. In other words, just like every other kind of magic within the books, Veritaserum is not infallible. As some wizards can prevent themselves being affected, and others cannot, it is an unfair and unreliable tool to use at a trial.

** Respectfully I have to say that I am having a hard time seeing a connection between these concepts and how it relates to an 'American culture.' It seems you have three seperate concepts here. Firstly I will say that a story where Harry goes on a jihad against all who he disagrees with has no reflection on 'American culture.' I would actually argue that it's quite possible the most unAmerican thing. Secondly this killing crusade/rampage you're explaining isn't comparable to capital punishment nor is it comparable to the use of deadly force as defense against deadly force directed at ones self. None of these concepts overlap because they are all entirely different situations and entirely different from a moral standpoint.

Corporal punishment is certainly seen in-universe so we can disregard the notion that fanfics with corporal punishment are reflections of 'American culture'. In canon the Dementor's Kiss is magical Britains form of corporal punishment. I think JKR needed a less graphic form of corporal punishment that is in-universe, being that it's both uniquely magical as well as circumvents the issue of ghosts. A magical prisoner being sentenced to death but sometimes leaving a ghost doesn't seem to be the punishment it's intended to be. A person who is Kissed can't leave a ghost behind and can't move on to the afterlife (which seems to existing in canon). For a witch/wizard I would see this as being significantly worse then experiencing life in Azkaban or just dieing and moving on.

#+begin_quote
  "The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun."
#+end_quote

Now I think this one doesn't reflect 'American culture' in the way that it's actually already seen more widely implemented in canon. /Almost everyone age 11 and up has a wand/. I think everyone can agree that a wand would be more deadly and more versatile then a gun. Both can be used to kill and both can be used to disable. The difference I see is in the amount of training between the two. In American one has to be 18 to own a gun (people are pushing for 21, with military service still at 18, go figure 🙄) but in-universe, wand use starts at 11 years old. I would argue that, even with a child having little magical ability and little knowledge of spells, the most mundane and harmless of spells can be used to kill on purpose or by accident. Full-Body Bind? Just bind them and push them off the astronomy tower or keep them bound until they die of dehydration. Horrible acts can be done when someone is bound that I won't even mention. Levitation Charm - levitate a sharp or heavy object above someone and let gravity do the work. This one makes me immediately think of childish cartoons like Looney Tunes which just makes me imagine it would be more common than first thought. Aguamenti - shot into a mouth/throat can cause asphyxiation or rupture a lung or the stomach (eww).

I think it's clear that stories of Harry going on a killing crusade/rampage/jihad against those who don't think his way have nothing to do with an 'American culture.' I also say that considering corporal punishment, as seen by the dementor's kiss, and the using of a deadly weapon in defense is in the canon universe, that those are going to be presently in most fanfictions and aren't indicative of the 'American culture' you state.

Hopefully that didn't come off as me being asshole 😝

** I see it as immature. American, though? Nay.

Personally I'm all for punishment in the form of capital punishment and/or straight-out torture for people who show themselves to be irredeemable fucks, because people like that won't become better human beings if they can help it and they have no qualms about hurting others for their own amusement. However, I am aware that this is something of an extreme world-view in some ways, and I cannot take seriously the idea of applying such punishments to a group people just for belonging to some group when there isn't, neither de juro nor de facto, any knowledge of what was required of those who joined that group. I mean, where do we go from there, to murdering all slytherins just because they were ambitious, including some muggleborns whom the hat saw as ambitious because they always aimed for A+ when doing homework in their muggle school because they wanted to prove something? To murdering all the hufflepuffs because if they aren't loyal to Harry that must mean they are all, down to the firsties, plotting to murder Harry in his sleep? To killing the Dursleys to prove that you are better than them?

Fenrir Greyback was an irredeemable fuck. Bellatrix Lestrange was an irredeemable fuck. Narcissa Malfoy was just a bigot, but one who throw her beliefs aside for a moment to give life to someone she should have hated, even if in exchange for something of equal value. Peter Pettigrew was a coward who made all the wrong choices and hurt all the people around him, being left with nothing but fear, no purpose, no anything, no anyone, but at crucial points he made his choices, acted with purpose when doing horrible things, and that too makes him an irredeemable fuck. They may not be good people, but not all of them deserve death; many do, but not all.

No, horrible punishments are for people who have proven, with their own choices, that they are horrible people who would keep on doing horrible things just because they can if they were let go. You don't need a trial for this, but you do need to at least look at the person as a person before you can know, and if someone can't even do that and yet handles such punishments nilly-willy it is, to me, a sign that they aren't mature enough to understand the oh-so-complicated concept of people having motivations and sometimes being forced to act against them by outside circumstances.

** As an American, I will take the controversial side of this and say "Yes". Americans have long admired the ideal of the rugged, independent hero, for whom the ends justifies the means. Furthermore, we have also a culture that enshrines the idea that an attack on your person or property is to be met with immediate, overwhelming and deadly force. Add to that the expectation that you are expected to resolve your own issues, up to and including threats and attacks on your life, without the expectation of any outside aid, and the result is that many Americans look at the "Heros" of the HP universe and scratch our heads.

Let's ignore the fact that Mr. Potter would have been a Columbine hopeful after ten years of physical and emotional abuse. Let's ignore the fact that Hagrid explains to him about his parents death, and then less than 24 hours later, he is handed his wand by Ollivander and has the idea of wands as murder weapons irrevocably linked in his mind by the wand makers creepy speech. Ignore all that.

Mr. Malfoy unleashes a basilisk on the school, and demonstrates a clear willingness to throw an AK at Mr. Potter. At that point, end of his second year of schooling, our hero has a clear and present enemy. Many American readers/writers at this point expect Harry to handle that shit, in no small part because JK wrote her story in such a fashion that, and this can't be stated strongly enough, it matches many American expectations that help either won't be given, or it will arrive too late to be of any use.

So, we have a teenager who knows his enemy, and has a deadly weapon at hand. We aren't expecting Mr. Potter to duel Mr. Malfoy, because even teenagers aren't complete idiots. But we do expect Mr. Potter to plot Mr. Malfoy's demise as best as he is able.

And that is just by the end of the second book. Honestly, the HP series is like a how to manual to put many Americans in a killing mood.

2nd book - Murderer who bribed his way out of jail tries to wipe out the whole school and directly murder the hero from ten feet away.

3rd book - Innocent man jailed without a trial, law enforcement told to kill on site.

4th book - Entered into a deadly tournament against the heros will, multiple brushes with death, terrorist/cult leader resurrected, asshole who tried to kill the hero attends the ceremony, still no resolution on that.

5th book - Tortured by a government appointed teacher.

6th book - Asshole murderers son joins the cult, attempts murder himself, not arrested, then lets more cultists murders into school full of children, more people die.

So... Yeah. Pick that point at which Mr. Potter has the skill to start delivering some justice, and go from there.

As one who lives here, I can confirm that this is far from a universal sentiment in the U.S.

Same with capital punishment; 19 states have outlawed it and it's functionally paused in several others since drug companies that make the lethal injection drugs no longer allow their use for non-medicinal purposes such as executions. (It's both exposure to legal risk and really bad P.R. to do so.)

** A German here. We do not have death penalty, but I still feel that the Death penalty should be used for the Death Eaters after they were tried under Veritasserum. If it comes out that they supported the cause, its lifetime in prison. If they have killed a human for the cause, either Veil or Dementor kiss.

Perhaps because I am quite knowledgeable about history and can see the obvious Nazi parallels, but the thought of not at least locking them away forever is disgusting me. If you MURDER (if you plan to take a life and go through with it) or rape (not just drunk sex while neither party can properly talk) someone, your own life should be forfeit. Not necessarily through an execution, putting someone to manual labour duty where they spend the next 50 years digging holes would be fine as well. Add to that the countless things you could change any Death Eater with (treason, terrorism, genocide), and their sentence quickly surpasses decades.

Generally, I support a corrective justice system, but stuff like murder and rape have to be punished severly, a lot stricter than what we currently have in Germany.

Why? What's wrong with just sticking them in jail forever where they can't hurt anyone? As long as it /is/ agreed they definitely won't be released after ten years for good behavior or some nonsense. Sure, Azkaban was a crapshoot, but only because the Ministry was inexplicably unable to process that /the Dementors were terrorists just as much as the people they were meant to be guarding/. A wizarding prison that can hold even the most dangerous Dark Wizards is totally feasible: Nurmengard successfully held Grindelwald, even in the early years before he was overtaken by remorse; and post-1998 Azkaban, which had been deDementored, successfully contained all the arrested Death Eaters, and, later, even someone as dangerous as Delphini Riddle.

The problem is that Veritasserum can be fought by various means and isn't applicable in court. So it would be very hard to find out who was an actual supporter and who was under the Imperius curse.
