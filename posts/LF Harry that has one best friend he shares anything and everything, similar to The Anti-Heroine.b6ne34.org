Hello I'm looking for fics that have a Harry that has one best friend he shares a special relationship with. They're the ultimate besties and are constantly by each other's side, sort of like Harry and Hermione in The Anti-Heroine, except without Tom. Preferably they end up in a relationship. No slash and preferably but not necessarily complete.

Thank you


** It's not the best written fic but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7801230/1/With-You-by-My-Side]]) has this.

  Harry and Hermione are 'child prodigies'. Destiny managed to throw them together and they form a bond far stronger than any seen in the wizarding world. They use their intelligence to bring innovations into the world that have not been thought before.

  A strange child has become interested in an even stranger lady. She comes and goes as she pleases, but his fondness for her always stays the same. He may be scrawny, but he would get her attention.
