:END:
I can't remember what its called but during the attack on bill and fleur's wedding he gets into a muggle woman's car while fleeing and when they arrive at her house he meets her friend/sister/cousin? Called jack/Jacqueline. And they eventually fall in love. It was pretty fun and i would like to read it again


** Lady Potter, Lord Black. It's a Honks fic and the Jack scenes come in at chapter 8-10 ish.

  At the reading of Sirius Black's will several shocking revelations leave Harry Potter and Nymphadora Tonks reeling. How will things change for them? And what about that crazy, drunken contract between James Potter and Sirius? What will this mean for Harry and Tonks? AU after Order of the Phoenix. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.
