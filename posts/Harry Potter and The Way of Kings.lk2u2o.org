Hey there, I just finished the first chapter of my HP / Cosmere crossover and thought it was worth to pester this sub with self-promotion.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29449923/chapters/72341664][Harry Potter and The Way of Kings]]

/Harry reads the Way of Kings, decides that the freaky stuff he does must be Surgebinding, and consequently tries to get better at it. His magic does the rest./

** Definitely interested to read this type of fic, seeing as I am halfway through the 2nd Cosmere book.

Not to much has happened so far so can't really comment on the story itself other than your writing is good, maybe a tad bit towards the selecting proper sounding words than is usual in normal human thought, not sure if there's a reason for your Harry to be thinking that way or if you just enjoy a voluble vernacular.

*** Thanks for reading. Right, at this point I am seting the scene and he just has gotten the book, so all the fun things are still to come. Writing Hoid into the HP universe was fun, though. :D

I picture Harry as an elderly wizard telling somebody his story. It is quite hard for me to find the right 1st person POV voice with him. I might still tweak that a bit in later chapters.

** I've been meaning to read The Stormlight Archive books but haven't gotten around to it yet(probably because I spent most of my reading time on fanfics). Is any background knowledge on that necessary for this fic, or is it pretty understandable if I just assume Harry read a fantasy book with a unique magic system and tries to imitate it with his magic which leads to cool abilities that HP wizards usually don't have?

*** As of now, it reads well fandom-blind. He meets a mysterious guy who gives him a book. And I think you could continue reading fandom-blind, but it will include lots of spoilers to WoK and you wouldn't get all the subtle details where the two worlds blend (which is what makes writing this fic so much fun). As to how exactly the magic systems will work together (or not), I will not spoil that here. :)

** Definity interested in reading this but i've not read Oathbringer or Rythym Of War yet. Will there be any early foreshadwing/spoilers for those books, or is it safe for a while?

P.S., you should pick someone, maybe his besft friend, or future love interest, and make them a Mistborn, just a thought :-P

*** I havn't read RoW yet, so safe for that. If there are any spoilers for Oathbringer, they will only concern the workings of the magic system (if at all? I don't remember a lot of new reveals regarding that between WoR and Oathbringer, especialy with the Ars Arcanum annexed). The chapter I have out already should be safe. I will see to tag spoilers accordingly.

** Oh gosh. As a major fan of Sanderson, I will have to look into this. Is this just him copying it, or will he be actually getting some variant of Surgebinding?
