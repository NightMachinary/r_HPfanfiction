  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

A mysterious poster for a new club catches Severus' eye. Little does he know... What the club has planned will challenge everything he knows and change the course of his entire life.

** linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5)

It's been a few years but I remember really enjoying this. Might lean more towards adventure than romance though I can't remember the storyline too well

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

**** Newt was looking for like actual magical creatures. Animals. Harry and Luna would be doing that but also looking at supernatural things like Windigos and other things. Or they aren't looking for new magical species they're just on vacation looking for things and use fantastic beasts as a reference

** I've probably recommended this so much that the bot will start to auto-rec it for me everytime I come to a "Request" post. Mind you, I don't recommend it if it isn't related to the post. Its such a good fic that gets so little recgonition, and its constantly updated with 10k+ words chapters at least twice a month.

Great OC, the world building is absurdly intricate and new; since it started being written before HBP, it has different ideas about the Horcruxes (it even takes a while to get to that). Kally isn't a Mary Sue, mostly because you can clearly see she's flawed, same as Harry, both are extremely stubborn and paranoid, Tonks and Lupin are hilarious together, this Ron is prob one of my favourite iterations of the character, Severus is so so funny with snarky retorts, the romance imo is really really good and well written, even if there's a bit too much doubt from the characters even later on (not about being on the fence). The Horcruxes are scary as fuck, not tame like in canon, Dumbledore is by far one of the most actual GG there is, so he's really canon-like, with all his whimsy and funny quirks, but also being the utilitarian chess master that he is.

Overal, I'd rate this a 9/10 simply because of pacing, which can be a little slow in the begining. linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky)

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.
