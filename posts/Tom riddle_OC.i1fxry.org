Looking for any good, well written fics that features Tom riddle and a female OC. I found it hard to find fics that stay true to his character. Thanks!


** Afflicted with Filth is a fantastic fic by MehrpDehrp which features a female OC who is Hermione's younger sister and Tom Riddle. It is written in a highly unusual way, but I recommend sticking it out at least until chapter three because there is an explanation for everything.

The same author wrote a story called Tom and Evie which is a short crack fiction but honestly its still in character and imo fantastic. It's less overtly romantic, but the potential for a relationship is hinted at.

  She doesn't know the world, or herself, but she'll always know the boy who meets her in a washed-out King's Cross Station. Even when he starts coming to her in pieces.

  Tom Riddle has always believed he was special, but having a girl only he can see constantly criticising him wasn't what he had in mind.
