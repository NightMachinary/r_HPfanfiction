Alright, so everyone knows the wrong boy who lived trope. Most have also probably seen the trope done in such a way where Harry is raised by Voldemort. However, most of the fics I see with this, have it so that Harry hides that he is Harry when at Hogwarts, and reveals it later to the shock of the light side, or he simply Disney go to Hogwarts at all. What I want, is a fic where Harry is raised dark and then goes to Hogwarts as Harry Potter and hiding his identity as Voldemort's adoptive son. This would obviously need Harry to know he was born Harry Potter with him still wanting to be on the dark side despite this. Simply put, can anyone recommend a Harry Potter fic where Harry Potter pretends to be Harry Potter?


** I came here for an explanation of an intriguing title.

I will leave disappointed.

** Not to get all picky, but technically Harry Potter can't pretend to be Harry Potter. he IS Harry Potter regardless of his light/dark/grey leanings.

So if I catch your drift... what you are asking for is simply a Harry Potter hiding his true intentions and pretending to be more like the canon Harry we all know.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** linkffn(The Darkness Within:The Rewrite)

Instead of killing Harry, Voldemort adopts him with the goal of making his greatest liability an asset. He raises Harry as a secret son. James and Lily aren't killed in this story, but they think Harry is dead. When Voldemort sends a teenage Harry on assassination missions, the Order of the Phoenix captures the mysterious "Dark Prince" and realizes it's Harry Potter. Harry is forced to attend Hogwarts, and Dumbledore forbids him to tell people he's the Dark Prince for his own safety.

  A rewrite of the first part in my Dark Prince Trilogy. What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? Book One of the Dark Prince Trilogy.

** It's not the sort of story you're looking for, I think, but Ebenbild's /Basilisk-Born/ does have Harry Potter pretending to be his much younger self, so it's a very different Harry casting himself in the role of himself as he once was. linkffn(10709411)
