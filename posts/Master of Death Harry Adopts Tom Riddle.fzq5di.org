:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic that has the following plot points. I think it was a two parter and the second part is incomplete but I'm not sure.

1) MOD Harry travels back in time and adopts infant Tom Riddle. He works at a pub (Leaky Cauldron?) as a server and makes friends with the other servers. I recall someone named Annie? A black lady server, as well as her muggle boyfriend who Harry gets close to.

2) He meets up with Dumbledore at some point, who tries to fish for information about the Deathly Hallows

3) Charlus Potter gets involved, and Harry meets Septimus Weasley who reminds him of Ron.

4) There's seepage between Voldemort's Horcrux and Harry's memories/souls. At one point Harry remembers that TNT stands for Trinitrotoluene --- knowledge that comes from Voldemort.

I may have mixed up some details but if anyone can remember the fic?
