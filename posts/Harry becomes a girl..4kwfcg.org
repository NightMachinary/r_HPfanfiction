Well, I'm rather drunk. Playing Overwatch and drinking Talisker just works out for a limited amount of time.

Therefore I want stupid fics. Fics in which Harry becomes a girl through any means.

Give it to me.

And don't worry about posting late. I like stupid fics just as much when i'm hungover.


** The Pureblood Pretense is one that's recently gotten me hooked, I'd definitely recommend it

  A thoughtless comment during the final battle, and Voldemort realizes the danger he's in and how to avoid it. Harry appears in Limbo alone with his regrets, until he finds a strange game... about himself. What happens when Harry decides to play, changing things in the process? Second chance, gamer!Harry, girl!harry(?), fanfic cliches used and/or twisted.

** *Effects and Side Effects* linkffn(4606270) is probably my favorite.

I have two stories I wrote/am writing where Harry turns into a girl.

The first is *Rose Lily Potter* he turns to a girl pretty early on in life, but it does explain about Harry. linkffn(11486857)

The second is *Harry Potter: Neko's Mate*. In this story, Harry's a Metamorphmagus, who can turn back and forth between a boy and girl. linkffn(11868945)

*** I dropped Rose Lily Potter on the first chapter. The author spends a heap of time going on about how Rose wants to keep her trans nature a secret, then promptly tells the first person she meets.

**** And of course, she explains exactly why in the following chapter, and later chapters. But of course those who drop the story "on the first chapter" wouldn't realize that.

***** I can see how that would be frustrating for you. But as a reader, and a fic-reader specifically I have a thousand stories on offer and only so much time. I don't know you as an author, I haven't bought into your brand, so when I come across what I consider structural issue in the first chapter, how can you expect me to trust you to fix it?

Perhaps it's ultimately an issue of the medium more that your work, as fanfiction.net is basically a dating site for readers and writers all vying for attention.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.
