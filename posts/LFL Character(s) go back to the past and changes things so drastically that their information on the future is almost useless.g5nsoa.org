As is says in the title.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Am fine with any ERA, anyone can be the main character, any warnings, can be on any site.

Not looking for OP Harry or super smart Harry. Harry smarter or more powerful then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to believable.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Not looking for bashing, characters disliking or hating each other is fine but an author going out of the way to bash a character is (usually) a no go. If it's minor I suppose it's fine.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), is a good example of a time traveler with incomplete knowledge. This Harry didn't know about Horcruxes, and after meeting Bellatrix, quickly rendered most of his future information useless.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
