That up top and the question, "Couldn't people just vanish Death Eaters?"

And, "Why the bloody hell didn't the Wizarding Population stand up to the Death Eaters if they all went to the same school?"


** --- Fanfic often holds that it's not. In canon, it /is/ permanent in the sense that a transfiguration performed by a skilled wizard will not pop back into its original form unprompted, even after a billion years. However, it is possible to turn it back to its original form with an Untransfiguration spell, and "botched" transfigurations (such as Hogwarts students') have a tendancy of turning back. It seems to be semi-permanent in the movies' continuity, with the transfiguration reverting upon the original caster's death (cf. Lily's fish given to Slughorn)

--- I'm pretty sure that it's either impossible, or /extremely/ hard to Vanish a living organic being. Unless memory fails me, all the "animals" that the heroes Vanish in canon are conjured, not actual living creatures.

--- General "bury your head in the sand" mentality ("Well, I'm half-blood, so I'm okay; and yes, those people are awful but I'm a cowardly Hufflepuff; so better just fade into the wallpaper and hope they leave me alone."). Also, the fact that a not-insignificant portion of the wizarding population may have supported the Death Eaters' purebloodist views, and thus turned a blind eye to their "innocent fun" until they started committing absolute atrocities in the wizarding world itself. Add Malfoy bribe to the equation, and the reasons become plausible.

****** As for the last thing, then it's rather impossible for Fawkes to transport Dumbledore from wherever vanished things go because as McGonagall puts it, "/Everywhere/." Well, more specifically, nonexistencem but she adds the word on, which means that vanished objects should technically be spread so far that they are unable to exist anymore. Considering the fact that humans are made of atoms and the fact that McGonagall said everything, then should't magic spread the atoms apart so that they are 'everywhere?' If this weren't the case, then where /do/ vanished things go to? An island? The RoR?

*** Adding on to that last one - it seems that in general much of the magical world think that muggles are a bit silly, notice particularly poor old Arthur Weasley's total lack of knowledge about the muggle world, despite being in charge of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office and thus one of the most important members of the Ministry that operates in direct contact with the muggle world.

Reading in from this, atrocities committed against muggles by Voldemort's forces would probably be either ignored entirely by magicals or, as [[/u/Achille-Talon][u/Achille-Talon]] said, they'd avoid action despite their shock or disapproval by rationalising inaction to themselves somehow.

In real life, psychological studies have been done that examine how ordinary people, despite witnessing something awful, can justify to themselves to not even contact the authorities by believing that someone else would do it. As someone who's had to give witness statements to the police in the past, I understand how daunting it can be to even indirectly assume responsibility for something like that.

*** I would also assume that magic could interfere with the Vanishing spell, so the complexity of magic in an item scales exponentially. So vanishing wizards and enchanted objects would be all but impossible. However, that is complex and directed magic. As we see in the books, Snape can and often does vanish failed potions, which are magical.

Using them to fight would require an offensive mindset, or a philosophy such as "Everything Is A Weapon", and that is simply not how most people think. You have to remember that wizard or not, everyone who is not a an auror, hitwizard, Hogwarts teacher, or duelist is a /civilian/, and will act accordingly. Namely, "Oh shitsticks, violent people!

*** I always think that the whole conflict doesn't make sense. Why did people follow him? There have to be some reasons. Economic? Cultural? Is there evidence that says people with less pure blood are less magically powerful, or maybe studies done?

Point is, in soooooooo many fics (the vast majority) there is no nuance, there is no believable politics. There is just the dark and the light, and I'm sorry, but you can't define beleifs and people by a vague reference to photons, or lack of thereof.

This also goes hand in hand with the main protagonist not having a goal, or even a coherent reason to oppose a certain way of thinking- indeed, mist of the time the protagonist has absolutely no idea what his opposition is thinking.

The IRA, for example, are terrorists, and terrorism for any reason is fucking awful. But they still had a legitimate grievance that they were trying to address.

This is why generally I'm attracted to pure fantasy fulfillment stories, like Harry becoming the best he can be (like Harry in Emperor by Marqis Black, etc), or trashy novel-level "romance" like Jeconias' (or however you spell that) fics with Harry/Gabrielle. Because at least this way, I don't have to think of how bloody shallow and unengaging the conflict and characters are....

** There are two main reasons to believe transfiguration is permanent unless reversed.

1) It makes sense from the theory of the thing. We know transfiguration changes an object's actual physical make-up (JKR word of god even specifies molecular structure). And the nature of the physical world is that objects do not spontaneously turn into other objects without the intervention of magic. So at the end of a transfiguration spell, you have a magicless object of a different physical configuration than the magicless object it used to be. There's no reason for it to revert, because it doesn't require continuous magic to maintain the transformation.

2) Wizards themselves believe transfiguration to be capable of lasting at least hundreds of years. The Ministry of Magic dispatched wizards to attempt to untransfigure Quintapeds. Now, the story that Quintapeds are transfigured wizards may or may not be true, but that doesn't really matter. What matters is that the Ministry believed the story to be possible, which meant that they think transfigurations can last hundreds of years.

*** I guess the argument a contrarian would make is that you need magic not only to change that structure, but to keep it in that form; like pushing down on a marshmallow. You need to exert force to compact it, but once that force leaves it reverts to its previous form. Or perhaps a better example would be water: magic is like heat or cold, and can evaporate or freeze it- but eventually it reverts to a state of equilibrium with its environment.

So I suppose the difference between permanent and non-permanent transfiguration would be that one pushes matter to be like- represent- something else, while the other actually changes the molecular structure, and hence would require more power and understanding.

Otherwise, why would Gamp's Law be even relevant? What makes food so different, if not the underlying assumption that you are using magic to create and change things, and that eventually that food or whatnot would revert to its basic form?
