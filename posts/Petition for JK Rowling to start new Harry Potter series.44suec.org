** Something about this petition just irks me. It comes of as someone begging for more candy after having finished several bags.

While I wouldn't say no to more from the Potterverse, I'd prefer if it was completely unrelated to Magical Britain, set in a different place and place, and not spawned from some beggars petition

** I actually don't want her to. I already feel like the 7th book was kind of rushed, the epilogue was weird, and some of the stuff she's added the the universe through pottermore just ruined some of the mystique the series had for me when I was younger. I think it would be a bad idea to have her write more. I'll stick with Fanfiction for wish fulfillment. Thank you.

** Well, that's not going to do anything. It also seems a little bit greedy or entitled as well as desperate. She knows the fans will always want more (the steady cash flow and Fantastic Beasts movies are an obvious clue). If anything, I'd want a petition to abandon Pottermore in favor of the encyclopedia that was scrapped.

** Is there an anti-petition? I'd rather not have her make even more of the worst fanfiction cliches we have, canon.

** I'd rather she didn't... the fun of the next-gen is that they're canonical yet blank slates and a lot of great fanfiction has come from that.
