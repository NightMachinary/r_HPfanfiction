  There's just something about James Potter that always causes Lily to make the worst decisions. That's probably how she ends up throwing away a month of her seventh year on a bet with a boy she can hardly stand. A story of growing up, identity, and falling in love.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

#+begin_quote
  3 years after Hogwarts, James and Lily are back with old and new friends by their side. Their lives are motivated by fear, their world surrounded by immense danger. As they each fight for their lives and for their loved ones in a world centered around Voldemort, the struggle to survive the war against him is nothing compared to the struggle to survive the wars within themselves.

  This is the story of four boys. This is the story of how these four boys came to know each other, of how they became friends. This is the story of their unbreakable bond that could survive any test. This is a story that will ultimately end in tragedy.
