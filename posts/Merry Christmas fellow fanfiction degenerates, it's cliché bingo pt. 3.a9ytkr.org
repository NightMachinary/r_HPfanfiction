*** I find that the eye thing is mostly used by authors who find themselves incapable of just using the name of the person that is doing something. They constantly feel the need to describe people by their hair or eye colour (or worse both at the same time) or a certain trait (i.e. Bookworm). It actually detracts from moments where using those kind of terms to describe someone actually add something to the scene (for instance emotional or romantic parts of the story).

Then I realised that it was a 'wildcard'. Maybe giving it another colour would have been a good idea?

*** I mean, TBH, I actually really like this cliché, if it's in a dark!Harry fic. It can seem ridiculous from our perspective, but that's only because we're stuck in the mold of thinking Voldemort is evil. If we imagine him in the way his supporters imagine him, it becomes /much/ easier to understand.

Imagine that you're a kid growing up in Nazi-occupied Poland, and you absolutely /despise/ the Nazi regime. The thing is, your dad was a high-ranking Schutzstaffel officer, and your mom was a party propagandist. Your house was bombed when you were one by the Polish Resistance; they gave their lives getting you out of the fire. What's worse, the executioner later went on to be the current head of the Resistance. You want to start taking action against the Nazis, what do you do?

It's perfectly possible to love your parents, and think that they chose to support an evil dictator. You don't have to be /happy/ that they're dead, but you don't have to change your ideology to match theirs.

My favorite use is probably linkao3(The Anti-Heroine), it has a canon-ish Harry---Hates violence, very timid, adores his parents---that supports a violent revolutionary like Voldemort.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.

***** For Love of Magic had a TON of potential, and started off really great. However, the author, who was already pretty conservative, had a political conversion to the alt-right about 80% of the way through, and spent large portions of the last 20% of the fic having Harry inexplicably use his magic to drive Muslims out of Europe.

Harry (and the author) was kind of already a smarmy, Christopher Hitchens-type guy in the fic, so he'd occasionally make a disparaging comment about religion, but around a year ago Harry just randomly starts roleplaying Charles fucking Martell

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

**** Harry sighed as he woke up early, ostensibly to give Sharky her mixture of ground beef and liver. In reality, Harry had been depriving the poor creature of her food for several days. He looked in to Sharky's eyes and whispered in sharkletongue "It'll all be ok, big girl. You'll get a nice big traditional English breakfast this morning."

Uncle Vernon stomped down the stairs, angry with his lot in life.

"BOY! Where's my damn coffee grounds?"

"Uhh, they're just there, over Sharky's tank Uncle Vernon. I can't reach them."

Vernon dragged over a chair, standing precariously on top as he stretched his meaty hand for the coffee tin.

Harry slowly crept behind his uncle, preparing for one good PUSH. His plan was going perfectly. He looked at Sharkey and smiled.
