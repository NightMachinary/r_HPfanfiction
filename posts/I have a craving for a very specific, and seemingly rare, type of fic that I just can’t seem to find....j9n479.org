So there are quite a few fics where Independent!Harry or Powerful!Harry is just the Mozart of magic and is great at literally everything he does.

There are also fics that play up his ability with Transfiguration or Charms, and a veritable landslide of fics that make him seem like the Magical equivalent of John Wick because of his Defense Magic prowess.

But what I'm looking for is a fic where Harry really understands the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind and ensnaring the senses.

TLDR: I'm looking for any good fics where Harry has a talent for making potions.


** Typing "Potioneer" into AO3 search field finds lots of stories. No idea which are good, but that's a way to start. Find appropriate tags, look at comments/favs, etc.

** The best potioneer Harry I ever read was in linkffn(Shadow of Angmar). It's a lotr/HP crossover though, so might be outside what you're looking for. I liked the first Part a lot, not so keen on the second part (though I might be on a reread).

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

** this one isn't just potions centred, so it may not be your cup of tea (especially with some of the tags) but it does have some interesting takes on potion making that I found interesting as a baker. It also has some great creature stuff as well, and is just a bit fun really
