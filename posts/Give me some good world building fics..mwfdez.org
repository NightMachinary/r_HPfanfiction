40k plus, doesn't matter if it's not hogwarts or in the UK. Just give me something unique. Don't like fics that focus on romance.

Thanks


** linkffn(Rigel Black and the Pureblood Pretense)

This is more similar to the HP world but there are massive differences especially in Riddle and how the society works and the way the author reveals it without just outright saying it is great.

Also just an amazing, well-written series

*** I agree with the recommendation; it expands and explains a lot of the principles around mind magic, potion brewing, the differences between light and dark magic (and between pure-blood vs muggle-born magic), and many other points. Plus a really original plot.

Your bot invocation is a little odd, though; "Rigel Black" doesn't appear in the titles anywhere, even though they're often referred to as the Rigel Black Chronicles.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

It's probably not most people's cup of tea, but it matches your request. It's definitely more an exercise in world building than a proper Hp fanfic. A tiny bit of school romance, but it's not the focus.

  Canon-compliant up to most of DH, more than 10 years later in a hyper-magical, post-apocalyptic Britain, a spectator sneaks into the empty Once-Ministry to watch Harry Potter and Voldemort's final duel.

** If you haven't read Alexandra Quick yet, that's a popular world building not romance focused one. I feel like I have tried to start it a few times and need to go back to it. It's a really impressive sounding world.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16927533/chapters/39772074]])

Someone just left me a very generous comment about my worldbuilding this week AND my fic is not romance, so I am going to throw it in, too. It's not finished. It's a thriller. Explores the years - and the world - between the wars, along with a bunch of canon adjacent magic. If you're looking for a fic that spends a lot of time with the characters in Hogwarts classes and pranking the school left and right . . . this is not that.

  Charlie Weasley's classmate Aaron disappeared in 1991; vanishing while the magical world was locked in turmoil. Aaron is presumed dead - or worse - until 1994, when he arrives at The Burrow through a blood-soaked tear in space. His sudden return - and a series of terrorist attacks that have the signatures of the Death Eaters all over them - has gotten Alastor Moody's attention, and he has some questions for his former protégé.But, what happened to Aaron isn't straightforward. Ten years earlier, a certain dragon-obsessed redhead, a hand magic prodigy, a jokester metamorphmagus, and a kid who can't even use magic - or so he thinks - arrive at Hogwarts as a controversial act threatens muggle-born autonomy. Within months of its conception, muggle-borns across the UK are being found dead. The class of 1984 soon find themselves involved in a series of interconnected events that lead to the killers, Aaron's disappearance, and the Second Wizarding War.
