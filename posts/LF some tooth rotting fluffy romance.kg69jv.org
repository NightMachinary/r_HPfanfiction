  Goblet of Fire AU: The change in their relationship happens during 4th year, when an exhausted and dateless Harry groans out the important question, "Why can't we just go together?" - Pure Harry/Ron fluff for a 5 AU Headcanons prompt.

** The first three-and-half chapters of “A Different Halloween by RobSt” linkffn(6439871). The remainder after somebody forgets to read fine print with fatal results is rubbish, IMHO. But really, you should book an appointment with your dentist before reading it ... the amount of sugar is unbelievable.

**** Just checked through my bookmarks and they are literally all Drarry. I've posted them here in case someone else is searching for fluff (if it makes a difference, they are all post-Hogwarts with Draco actually having come to terms with the fact that he is a war criminal; I know that's why a lot of people don't like Draco and fair enough!)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875/chapters/1568057][All Life Is Yours to Miss]]: Draco and Harry are professors at Hogwarts. Professor Malfoy's world is contained, controlled, and as solitary as he can make it, but when an act of petty revenge goes horribly awry, he and his trusty six-legged friend are thrown into Hogwarts life at the deep end and must learn to live, love and let go. (115,000 words)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082/chapters/6126311][Tea and No Sympathy]]: Once again, Draco has to deal with the consequences of his actions. This time, he's botched an important speech about post-war unity so he messes around with an experimental time turner and gets himself trapped in the same 24 hour period. (70,045 words)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/640449][Here's The Pencil, Make It Work]]: Malfoy is working in a coffee shop in muggle London. Harry keeps running into him. (49,493 words)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2304488][Draco Malfoy: Toilet Supremo]] is based off a ridiculous prompt taken seriously. Summary:

> It must be a vision brought on by eating cheese sarnies too close to bedtime, Harry thinks. There's no way that Draco Malfoy can really be standing on his doorstep, calling himself a Toilet Supremo, and expecting Harry to buy not only this unlikeliest of scenarios, but also a new loo.

>But no: Harry's eyes do not deceive him. Malfoy, Lord of Toilets, is really there. Which begs a very important question: what the hell is he up to, and what evil scheme is he about to unleash? Because there must be an evil scheme . . . mustn't there?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17123729][Around You Moves]] is based off a Reddit post from AITA. The poster was worried he was homophobic because his gay roommate bringing home men makes him feel really angry and even disgusted. A commenter asked him, "Are you jealous? You're only upset about roommate." OP realized that he was in love with the roommate and confessed his feelings. (29,659 words)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15024440][Blue Sky Is Living Here Today]]: Draco's a father, Harry's in love with him, and it's really hard to take things slow. (4981 words)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20946260][Faint Indirections]]: Harry is working at a magical university library. Draco Malfoy is the last person Harry expects to turn up in Boston, Massachusetts. But now he's here, and he won't stop requesting books from the library where Harry works. (29,793 words)

I can't find another one I vaguely remember, but it had to do with Harry befriending Bulstrode because she was a part creature and was poor and the other Slytherins avoided her because of it. I think they got snape to save her mom's life with an expensive potion at one point as well.

My favourite hp ship doesn't get enough love :(

I think I messed up the bot somehow. Here are the full links.

  Harry never wanted to be unique. He only ever wanted to be Harry, just Harry. In one brave, or perhaps foolish moment, someone lets him know he is not alone and that changes everything.
