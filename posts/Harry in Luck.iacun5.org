Basically along the lines of the fairy tale Hans in Luck.

For context, Hans works away from home for seven years and receives a big lump of gold at the end of it. He then makes his way home, but the lump of gold is heavy so he trades it for a horse - only he's cheated, the horse is old and clapped out and won't carry him. So he ends up trading it for a milk cow - but it's barren. This continues, Hans trading down and getting cheated at every turn, but he getting ever happier because he getting closer to home. At the end he arrives home empty handed, but considers himself really lucky to have made it. (And lived happily ever after...)

Harry doesn't have to work for it, but he's still an eleven-year-old used to having nothing who comes into a big pile of gold. I think it would make for a cool story to have him trade in his gold for things, getting cheated maybe first by the goblins (e.g. making him sign over his vault/pay horrendous fees for some service or item), then by other wizards and ending up with nothing, but finding a family in the process and feeling really lucky for it. The Weasleys are of course an option, maybe Andromeda/other distant relatives or someone else entirely.
