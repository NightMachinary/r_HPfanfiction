:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't know if I came across this fic but I hope you can help me find a Severitus fic where Harry discovers he's Snape's son and Snape rejects him (ish?) until such time Harry becomes a man that he thinks he doesn't need his biological father's approval.


** What does Sevetitus mean exactly? I have seen that term once or twice but I don't really understand its definition.

*** It means that Harry is discovered to be Snape's biological son. The name comes from the original challenger.

*** Adding that it came from a term meaning Snape being Harry's biological dad but now it can also mean Snape raising Harry.
