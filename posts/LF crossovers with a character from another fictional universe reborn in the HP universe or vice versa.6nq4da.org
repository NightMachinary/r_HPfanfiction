Vice versa being a character from the HP universe reborn in another fictional universe. Can be reborn as an OC or a canon character, fine either way. Preferably with all their memories of their past life but with only whatever powers are available in the new universe, not the ones from the old one. But if the story is really good then retaining their old power is fine.


** linkffn(Where No Wizard has Gone Before by Blueowl) has Harry reborn in the Star Trek: Then Next Generation universe with all his memories intact. He does retain his old powers, but also gains some new ones due to his rebirth. I don't know if I would describe it as "really good", but I did enjoy it. I'd probably rate it 4/5 for a crossover.

  Harry has been reborn time and time again after becoming the Master of Death, living through hundreds of lifetimes in dozens of universes, but this rebirth is strange even by his standards---no doubt thanks to how he had died the last time. StarTrek:TNG/HarryPotter Powerful!Harry MoD!Harry, Guinan, Q, Borg, Lwaxana. COMPLETE

** linkffn(The Black Prince) is about Harry being born in the A song of ice and fire universe as a son of Robert and Cersei. It's extremely well written and a great read

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.
