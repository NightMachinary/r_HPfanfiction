During the Gryffindor Hufflepuff match during 3rd year, the Weasleys are caught by the Dementors, who attempt to apply the kiss, but it fails to do anything.

It turns out that the Old saying was true, and Gingers really do have no Souls, so without Souls, the Dementors can't remove what doesn't exist.

It also turns out they can't make Horcruxes. Can't split what you don't have

(Also applies to other Ginger characters like Susan Bones)


** Harry, as the son of Lily Potter, a ginger, has precisely 1/2 of a soul. This is why Voldemort's Horcrux had so much trouble affecting his personality - it's just screaming into a mostly-empty chamber, hearing the echoes.

*** That or that's why the Horcrux could stay without Harry noticing. No fight for space.

** But if Ginny has no soul, the diary couldn't absorb it to become corporeal, so this would actually come up a year earlier.

*** Nu, the reason it took the course of the whole school year to absorb Ginny's soul is because the Diary had to arrange for Ginny to have a soul in the first place before it could drain it. She's secretly a blonde now as a result of getting a soul, she's just dying her hair red.

Or something.

**** No, she was never a Weasley in the first place. Everyone knows Weasleys never have girls, she's actually Bellatrix's daughter to Gideon Prewett, and her hair was dyed. Since her father was a redhead, she had only quarter a soul, since Black souls are black and shriveled. Hence why he took so long to absorb what little soul she had, and she's now actually soulless and actually ginger.

Voldemort killed the Prewett brothers out of jealousy.

*** The diary already had a piece of soul, so it only needed to drain her life force?

** Dumbledore is auburn haired... so he never had a soul either?

Yeah, I can see that.
