I'm looking for a complete story with a unique harry maybe with a gift, like one where he has the mind of sherlock, one where he time travels constantly or where he has super speed etc... You get the idea he has to be different from every-one else but not in a minor way a major way. It would be fun if he travels dimensions, but the major point is it has to be a complete story that either has sequels which are also completed or it's own stand alone story.


** How about: linkffn(8197451)

Harry genuinely believes he is a forest elf and learns magic in a very unique of ways.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

**** Well Harry is OP!BAMF! which is not unique in itself. What I found unique was his characterisation, how he was sent to the past and had to live back to the present world (which is not very touched by the subject) and his abilities which can be unique. He is the creator of the Dementor and Inferi and is a fairly insane and cruel SoB.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** Please learn how to use the search bar. I would suggest looking for OP!Harry, or Super!Harry. You are essentially looking for just about every overpowered/super harry story out there. There are many threads on here that fit that theme and they can all be found by using the search bar. The search bar exists for a reason, please use it instead of making vague posts like this.

*** No i don't care if he is op i'm looking for different harry stories that are hard to find it can be something simple like he has an imaginary friend that can somewhat effect the pyhsical world because harry's magic is doing it or he has electric teeth. Point is i'm looking for the very unique harry that are hard to find if they were that easy i would have already used a search bar and secondly most people on here know how to use it, but getting a response from a actual human is more effective and allows for a broader range instead of searching for words i don't know of yet. You can't just type hard to find harry stories and they'll be there.
