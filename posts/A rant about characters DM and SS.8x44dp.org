I am wondering what is it with fanfiction authors being so seemingly infatuated with these two characters - Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape?

DM: he is not some "bad-ass" or whatever. From the beginning, he was shown a petty, sad and cowardly little man, who bullied people (only when he had advantage of numbers) to feel superior. Like, I fail to see any redeeming or, especially, attractive, qualities in this character, either for men, or women.

SS: alright, he was a relatively accomplished spy. Although, one could argue, that Voldemort knew about that from the beginning. But still, from his years in Hogwarts, he was a rather gross person, both inside and outside. And while he was obsessed with Lilly, I do not think at least, that he ever really loved her. Because love is not about selfishness. And he was just thinking of himself the whole time. Also, the way I see it, both he and James, were being arses, in their own way. That, coupled with Snape's hatred for Harry, an innocent child, just makes him even less likeable.

Like, I am genuinely baffled about the popularity of these characters among fans of the books.

**** I'm not really influenced by HBC, but I buy the thesis of “Delenda Est” that Bellatrix could have turned out well if it were not for Voldemort's extreme corruption. In that case, a time traveling Harry saving Bellatrix very much appeals to me.

Similarly, Hermione time travel to save Snape is also acceptable to me.

Well disregarding everything else, I believe in HBP, she brings up Sirius' death just to fuel Harry's rage. But that's disregarding everything else, of course.

And as we don't know the extent of wizarding law, it's a bit presumptuous to say she broke no laws. She would be committing a crime in many countries in the real world. This is why police investigate spouses, why people go to jail for not coming forward with incriminating information, especially when it comes to genocidal maniacs, and why you can get in legal trouble for simply being in the same car with someone who has drugs on them.

These days, if you say you like an evil character, there's a decent chance someone's gonna demand you justify every single bad thing they've ever done. I like both Draco and Severus because they're both complete bastards, but also have at least a few layers to their character. Does it have to be any more complicated than that?

*** I feel ya. Intuitively, I find there is always more depth to a character who is a villian than someone who remains good. Part of it is I think plot and character development are in some ways easier when you start out evil. I gravitate to these fics because I find a redemption arc more relatable than someone who is "good" throughout. It's tragic and I love it. Snape knows he is a POS, but cannot be better and cannot do better. Draco is a child who has been ruined by shitty parents, but still feels fear, and you feel bad.

The way DM or SS is portrayed in most of these fics are OOC. If we are talking about strictly book portrayals, I don't see many redeeming qualities. However, it's easy to tweak aspects of these characters in fics so that they are "nicer" or "more good" e.g. by elaborating on backstories or POVs.

OP is asks about infatuation and popularity. I think those are two separate questions. It's hard to redeem a bad character (esp one we already know), so amateur writing often comes across as romanticizing.

** If you look at Snape's school years and upbringing, he begins life as an underdog. That's a likable trait in most characters, it's even something he shares with Harry. He was raised by a muggle father who was cruel and abusive, this put him in a position where he was powerless to protect himself or his mother. He also heavily resembled his cruel father who made his life hell, which means he likely resented his own appearance. He also grew up very poor. So he had very little resources, little to no affection, and was horribly lonely. All implications are that his muggle father hated and fear magic and likely discouraged it.

I'm sure you see where I'm going with this, but he shares many of these things in common with Tom Riddle. Dumbledore tells Harry that Tom got followers because he was good at giving them the things they wanted, Dementors want victims, people like Snape want power and respect. I imagine that in Snape's young life a man he shared so much in common with that promised him those things was very enticing. The fact that Tom hated muggles or non-pureblood witches and wizards was probably of little import to Snape, he didn't have much concern for them himself, given all he'd experienced to that point. There's no evidence he enjoyed murder or torture or even committed it, aside from Dumbledore's death. Why would Voldemort even bother to ask that of him? He had tons of followers who followed him specifically to gain access to victims, followers like Bellatrix and Greyback.

As soon as Snape realized how empty the promises he'd been made were, and how he stood to lose the only human being that had ever cared for him without obligation, he was done. Not just done, he devoted his entire life to the cause of ending Tom Riddle. He wasn't a nice human being, but he wasn't a bad one. He was young and misguided and seduced by the offer of things he never thought he could obtain alone. I don't know if you've ever seen the movie The Departed (spoilers ahead) but Snape is not dissimilar to Leo DiCaprio's character in that movie, Billy Corrigan. Throughout the film you watch him try so hard to do the right thing and you watch it cost him everything and destroy his entire life. You watch Corrigan, like Snape, live on the outside of everything he ever wanted, just out of his reach. Just like in The Departed, people feel sympathy for these characters. Snape's story is a Greek tragedy, which, despite the echo chamber of this thread, is a character and a story people have enjoyed for thousands of years.

Draco is like Harry, he's a child who was never given a choice in his own future. Yes, Draco is a bully, but lots of kids are mean to each other in school and grow up and out of that behavior, whether Draco does is open to interpretation I suppose. The epilogue and The Cursed Child would seem to indicate he does. His only “evil” actions are actions made by a desperate child who is frightened and alone and has /way/ too much on his shoulders. People enjoy redemption, and Draco has that potential. He not only has the potential, he commits a few very small, redeeming actions. Despite his upbringing, he feels empathy and he may not see the error of his bigoted views, but he does see how horrible the world would be under Voldemort.

TLDR: People are complex. They aren't any one thing. Draco and Snape are complex, that's relatable and people can sympathize with them and root for them to be better. Also, fan fiction exists so that people with attachments to different characters and ideas can explore them through reading or writing past the established story. Maybe if you're not into a specific character or story, don't read that one.

** In the books, we see things from Harry and Co.'s perspective, and they're children through most of it. If you count the epilogue, Harry considers Snape to be one of the bravest men he ever knew and Draco, though not friends with the Trio, is still formally cordial with them. Snape did what he could out of his love for Lily, as shown by his patronus. Draco, beyond being a giant arse, only tried to do real damage when his family was threatened, and he cried about it in Myrtle's bathroom.

Given that the Wizarding World is highly insular and we are shown it through the wide eyes of a child / teenager being introduced to it in a (mostly) school setting, we can't assume to know the motivations of the characters we don't see explaining themselves. JKR's post-series notes notwithstanding, we have a playground.

As we never see things from their perspectives, it opens the door for authors to come up with backstory and personal lives for them. Many bullies have shitty home lives, so what if Draco has been raised to hate Muggles and Muggleborns by his parents and their friends inside of a completely isolated community and it only continues to be reinforced by Lucius shaming him for Harry out flying him and Hermione out scoring him in grades? He might recognize that there's something potentially wrong with the Muggles Suck theory at this point, but having his nose rubbed into his supposed failures may account for his heightened hostilities. We don't know his thoughts, but we know that based on the Trio's observations he makes himself sick and cries in his attempts to kill Dumbledore for fear of his fucked up family.

Similarly, we know Voldemort is a Crucio happy nutter. Authors like to have Snape get his fair share of torture as it is plausible and have no one to look out for him personally. Having to maintain his cover is another big reason why he's such a cruel man, though he does save them on multiple occasions including placing himself between them and Lupin after he has changed form, which is one of his greater fears.

So you take two characters whose motivations are mostly unknowns but are developed enough to have their behaviours strongly defined and - voila - Byronic heroes! Much more interesting to write about than other underdeveloped characters. I suppose a crackfic about trying to date Seamus and having something explode on every date might be fun, but people like angst, and those two carry the brunt of the angst unless you are drawn to a whiny Harry.

** The series was originally written as a children's book, let's not forget that. All of the adults are completely useless, and the government and other authority figures seem to ignore completely ridiculous stuff like incompetent and/or abusive teachers (Binns, Trelawney, Lockhart, "Moody", Umbridge, etc., and yes also Snape) - this kind of stuff is part of the genre and a lot of it is done for comic relief.

Had HP been a book series for adults, a lot of this would have had to be dealt with much, much more seriously and there would have had to be more depth and background information for many of the characters. The great part about fanfiction is that we can imagine what this would have looked like. I don't read a lot of Draco-based fanfic any more, but I am a huge Snape fan even though he's a right old douchebag in canon and should not be allowed to teach children. I find fic's which explore Snape's backstory really interesting, despite it essentially being an AU. Plus, I love a good redemption arc!

Additionally plenty of Draco/Snape haters paint fic's based on them as always being overly romanticised which is simply not true. I'm currently reading an SSHG story where quite frankly Snape is such an arse, even I'm finding it impossible to believe Hermione would fall for him! Overly-romanticised Draco's and Snape's are just as common as all kinds of other tropes and there's nothing inherently wrong with them. It's not my cup of tea either and I prefer them to be more or less in-character (just with more depth to their backstory) but hey, no one's forcing me to read that stuff and I really don't see the point in complaining about it.

*tl;dr:* I love Snape fanfiction and it's honestly kinda annoying how so many people feel justified to bash people who like Draco/Snape. There's nothing wrong with enjoying those two in all their AU-y goodness.

  [newly edited as of Feb '18] Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.By killing Draco, she saves Dumbledore and keeps Voldemort at bay for a little while. But evil never sleeps for long. When a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. She's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

With romanticism and cynicism, Albus Dumbledore plotted to keep James and Lily alive. Harry didn't need that sacrifice to live; conventional defense against the dark arts would do. He just needs to believe in that sacrifice. Dumbledore is confident in his ability to persuade.Severus Snape lived his life with one glimmer to cleave to: in the summer of 1975 he loved Lily Evans, and she loved him back. It is what helps him sleep during the worst nights. It is what motivates him to refuse to die for the cause.It is not until his early forties that finally another glimmer arrives and changes his life into one he truly wants for the first time since he was fifteen. But that spark of Lily that kept him alive throughout the years will not be extinguished easily, especially because Lily never died.

***** Omg I've read Intended Vessels and whooo boy Snape is the King of the Dicks in that one!

As for The Return, I got really invested in that fic and wrote some things to work through my feelings there. In the end, though, I think Snape wasn't actually bad in that fic, so much as severely damaged. He needed therapy in addition to a solid kick in the arse.

****** I'm still super conflicted about The Return... There are loads of interesting things in the story from a psychological perspective, for example I really liked how Snape held on to his house and that moment Hermione sees it and realises how he's kept all of that secret from her. I definitely agree Snape is incredibly damaged (Lily too), but their lack of remorse bothers me. The interaction between Lily, Harry and Ginny also seems short-changed. The author writes really well and I suspect all of this was intentional, I would've just liked more of a resolution on a lot of these stories because as it is most of the characters' actions are incomprehensible to me.

I followed the fic while it was being written and fell into a sort of Return-shaped black hole, where it was pretty much the only thing I could think of. Chapter 13 made me so angry I could hardly think, it was a little ridiculous. I feel like Hermione got short-changed in the groveling department, and I'd have liked to see more genuine remorse from Snape.

I had some wonderful conversations in the comments section of that fic though.

** I think they're both interesting characters and I'm a big fan of unpleasant and ugly characters who are strict and brilliant too so I adore Snape. His character kept me sane when I was going through a bad time, so I'm protective of his sorry asshole face.

Most people love Draco because they make him into a pretty boy bishonen. I prefer the rich entitled jerk when I write him. He can be villainous (but usually ineffective) or he can be somewhat redeemed but I imagine he still stays super whiny.

You don't have to like them, though. And you can have multiple favorites! It's totally fine!

They are good people who are also massive jackasses. Draco is played by Tom Felton, lol. I personally always hoped for a redemption arc for Draco, his character is, in my opinion, fairly similar to Zuko's and my hope for the last book was that he would see the light and join Harry. All of these opinions were formed during my early teen years, in the madness of waiting for the next book and have just stuck around.

Obviously the terrorism stuff doesn't apply. Next to that however one of the big complaints about Snape is that he bullies his students. Dr Cox is a major bully who, in real life, should be reported to HR. His behaviour goes far beyond "being a bit mean" and in a scenario where this behaviour wasn't being dealt with, people would absolutely quit that company due to him making the workplace completely unbearable.

Two points:

1) Most of Cox's outbursts are done for comedic effect - since Scrubs is in fact a comedy and not to be taken seriously

2) Cox wants his students to succeed and I wouldn't describe him as a bully. He's a "tough love" kind of guy and I've encountered people with this style of teaching - not once did I feel bullied. Snape on the other hand has no interest in actually teaching anyone, he clearly loathes everything about his job.

******* 1) Yes, I'm aware of this. After all it is a comedy and characters will therefore have highly exaggerated traits in order to make it funny. I already wrote this in another post here, but Harry Potter was written as a children's book. There are so many issues for which the finger can be pointed at the genre. Whether it's no one caring about Harry being neglected / abused by his relatives, or the Ministry's lack of accountability, or Dumbledore leaving the Philosopher's Stone behind absolutely pathetic defenses, or the /plethora/ of incompetent teachers (and this group even includes nice people like Hagrid) - this kind of exaggeration and incompetence is a common thing in children's books in order to let the children have all of their adventures. Had it been a book for adults, characters like Snape would've needed a hell of a lot more depth and back story in order to not be judged as a really poorly written character. I agree that Scrubs shouldn't be taken too seriously because it's a comedy; the same can be said for HP due to it being children's literature.

2) I understand the tough love aspect, I honestly do but there are plenty of things Cox does that do not fall under this category. Let's just take the nicknames and refusal to call people by their real names. That is entirely unprofessional and unacceptable and does not in any way contribute to him helping his students succeed.

*** Snape "did the right thing" because he owed Dumbledore and "loved" Lily, nothing more. Draco is nothing like Zuko. Zuko had interesting backstory for why he did what he did. But he never went so far as to mind-rape, torture (etc.) others. Draco was almost literally just an S.S. Jr Nazi. Of course, I can understand thinking this early on but once the end of GoF came I was certain Draco wasn't going to change. He just wouldn't commit murder. But torture and taking away free will?

*** You shouldn't assume that people like these characters just because of their actors and their movie portrayal. I find Snape interesting in both the movies and the books and I am sure I am not the only one. I even find the movie version of him a little too soft and different from book version at times. Like the fact that Snape is supposed to in his early 30s in the first book, I would have never guessed that based on Alan Rickmans age.

He is this complete bastard who has lots of issues and problems, but that's what makes him so interesting to me. He is not always moral. He is not a good person who often does the right things for all the wrong reasons. He brings conflict and spices up almost every scene his is in. Also has a great set up for a potential redemption plot line, especially with his later comment of how he is unable to save everyone. It shows that he may have changed his mind about the death eaters at least on some level. I like fics that explore these different possibilies and ways for characters to reflect on themselves and change due to various circumstance they are in even when they may not be good people to begin with.

Plus I absolutely love the cutting dry humour, creative insults, the sarcasm and just the presence that his character has. The way he says his first year potions speech for example, the way he completely owned Lockhart in the dual. While the gryffindor way is to jump into situations without thinking, Snape tends to embrace slytherin qualities of cleverness, planning, manipulation and just waiting until the time is right to make a move.

Not to mention his backstory and the parallels to Harry and Voldemort. All three are half bloods with crappy childhoods, but are so different.

Can't say I care too much about Draco, but he also has a good potential set up for redemption in the books. There is a whole book of him basically having to face that being a death eater is not as good as he thought it would be. And being all angsty about the fact that he now either has to kill Dumbledore or have Voldemort kill his family. He is also a good candidate for the ever popular "Enemies to friends/lovers" trope so it's not hard to see why he is popular regardless of how well Tom Felton played him.

Movies and sex appeal, remarkably shallow but that's what it comes down to.

Thinking about it, I've never seen the appeal of either. As far as Snape is concerned, he's a jerk. He'd been dealt a horrible hand in life, but that doesn't discount the fact he's a jerk. A jerk who bullies children. In terms of his feelings for Lily, I don't think they were ever healthy. It seems he relied on her for his happiness, which isn't healthy, and later or in addition to that was obsessed with her. It wasn't sweet, it was twisted. There are many things about Snape that make him an interesting, complex character to explore, it's unfortunate most don't choose to look at that.

Only when things went pear shaped and he had to get his hands dirty, Draco questioned his part. And not because it was wrong, but because he had to do the dirty work himself.

He's only a teenager, not an adult, though. And has grown up in a toxic environment. That are the mitigating circumstances.

** Well Snape's love for lily it was probably the only way he knew love. Who really showed him love, his parents who were too busy arguing? Or anyone at school who bullied him? He probably had a bad role model for what 'love' is. And while we know what love is, or at least is supposed to look like, he might not have had the same good building blocks. It's just like a little girl who grows up in a home where dad beats her or mom, and often times (Not all the time) they go looking for boyfriends/husbands/etc that are just like their father and beats them you know? So while he may not have 'loved' lily in the same way that we see love to him it was how he knew how to. Unfortunately it was twisted his concept of it at least, andwhile it wasn't a warped 'i'll beat the shit out of you cause i lov you' i did think it did do him a great deal of harm as he was bound to a dead woman though Dumbledore's manipulation of the situation. So eh.

Back to the original point though, I think people are fascinated by them because of the "bad-ass' factor they have which isn't really that much. I mean draco wasn't a bad ass at all. And Snape was more cunning and clever in certain specific aspects etc. Also a lot of times you find they are written poorly, and OOC one way or another. I think it's all about fulfilling some bad-boy fantasy. However, I do write a ton of Snape fics (Almost all of them have him in them). I like to think I keep him as in character as possible. I do this because Snape happens to be my favorite character. And no it's not because of Lily. Snape has been my favorite character since the very first Potions class in Sorcerers/philosophers stone. Ironically I remember saying 'there's something about him, he has a back story i know it'. But often it was because I could understand Snape, especially after the fifth book. I could relate to him. I was abused growing up and had no friends cause I was bullied too. I grew into the same resentful, bitter, mean, hateful adult. And I spewed venom as well. I'm not saying I was exactly like Snape, I had more than two good points to me, I was loyal to those I trusted (Which were very few) and I'd go to the ends of the earth for them etc. But I could understand Snape so much it hurt. While no one else could understand why I hated life so much and people. And the world. Someone in the world did, cause someone wrote a male version of me. You know.

I'm aware Snape was an immature petty selfish, mean spiteful bully. I fully acknowledge how awful he was to certain people, esp harry, and in general. I'm not defending him on those points, or saying it was okay or justified or excusable. Just that sometimes my heart aches because that was me.

He never really gained much useful information, as far as I remember from the books, at least. He was just... there.

More often than not, it was because he was ordered by Dumbledore or Dumbledore's Portrait.

** Malfoy's redemption was literally just Narcissa. She saved Harry, and had she not done so, Voldemort would have won. After Voldemort was dead, being of his ideology was probably too dangerous (probation, maybe?) so he moved on and became a sort of good father.

Snape... well, people try to see the good in him that isn't really there due to his Book 7 arc. He was the greatest fear for someone whose parents were tortured into insanity, he's not a good person by any way shape or form. Great character, but that's because he's an utter contemptible dick, not some secret tragic superhero magic man that was a good guy the entire time. If Lily had lived, or if Voldemort had targeted the Longbottoms instead, Snape would have remained a Card Carrying Death Eater without any qualms

** Because those people usually find the actors hot. Personally, I don't see it, but that's probably to an old German parody which introduced Malfoy with using "lube as a haircare product. Do you know the expression crawl into someone's ass (suck up)? He takes that literally!"

My biggest gripe with hyping those two up is the fact that they both are toothless. Malfoy couldn't kill another man face to face, even if he took pleasure from watching others suffer (Buckbeak trial) and called for racial purges. He would do for killing off some background characters, but due to the powers of plot armour (you wouldn't want some weak dude to defeat the MC, right?) and the fact that Malfoy couldn't cast the spell, he doesn't make a very dangerous antagonist. Hell, he is like Joffrey /Baratheon/ but with far less bite from his parents. Very few redeeming qualities, but Malfoy doesn't make a good villain either.

As for Snape, there is no way he'd kill Harry under Dumbledore's nose. He is one misstep away from an intimate date with a dementor, so there's very little he can get away with unless Dumbledore approves. And by the time Voldemort takes over, Harry is outside his reach. Since Snape doesn't strike me as the type for suicide assassinations (otherwise he'd have killed Voldemort's body long ago), he is an annoyance for Harry, but not a real threat. And that's not even taking Lily's eyes into consideration.

*** I never could shake the feeling that Snape was always most focused on Snape. Canon strongly implies that his no. 1 goal is and always has been the defeat of Voldemort, but his behaviour makes more sense to me when assuming that he played both sides, under the proviso that he preferred the outcome of Voldemort losing. Just a slightly different order of priorities.

In any case, he doesn't have much choice to do anything except being a spy after the events of Halloween 1981: He's a marked Death Eater and can't fully commit to Dumbledore (Voldemort would kill him) and fully committing to Voldemort would be stupid and not help to see him dead eventually. It strikes me as odd when this is framed as a grand heroic gesture of Snape.

******* I think people also forget that while Snape said, "You're raising him like a pig for slaughter." With disgust, Dumbledore accused him of caring for the boy, and Snape said, "For him? Never." And then showed his patronus, for lily. His disgust at the plan was not for Harry, he made it perfectly clear he did not give one damn what happened to harry at all, for harry's sake. But for Lily. So he really couldn't have cared less about harry himself, only for Lily. So no, I don't think Snape was all that upset that Harry had to die. Merely that for the last 16 years Dumbledore had manipulated him into doing his bidding by binding him to a dead woman who disliked him, risking his life saving Harry who he hated immensely multiple times and risking his life spying, only to find out none of it mattered because the boy had to die anyway and that Lily's son would have had to die the entire time.

He is pissed because of Lily, and how his sacrifices, suffering and promises, all in the vain of keeping Lily's son safe, were for nothing as he had to die anyway. Had harry not been lily's son, he wouldn't have cared at all, and would have not shown such disgust, so no, it had nothing to do with Harry at all.

As for his number 1 goal, I think at that point it was having Voldemort dead. As he no longer had Lily, because had his loyalty been only to her he would have given Harry choices, or wouldn't have showed him at all, or told him at any point in the seventh book like when he was in the Forest of Dean. He had multiple chances to 'save harry'. So no I don't think his loyalty to lily went that far to go beyond Dumbledore's plan to save her son. But I also think Lily herself believed in defeating voldemort at ALL costs. As you recall Harry walked with Lily, james, sirius and Lupin to meet up with Voldemort to die. None of them protested or told him not to do so to run, not even Lily herself. She knew her son had to die, and said nothing to stop him or discourage him, in fact they all did the very opposite of it. Lily's cause was the defeat of Voldemort, and so I think for Snape the choice was clear in the matter.

...but harry is lily's son. it's an implicit part of his existence. if harry weren't lily's son, he wouldn't be harry. his disgust at the plan /was/ for harry, because 'lily's son' is an inherent part of who harry is. he was also appalled at the perceived callousness of dumbledore's plan in general

like i said, i don't disagree that he wants voldemort dead. my disagreement was with the framing. snape's #1 goal, that's implied in canon, is atoning for being complicit in lily's death/endangerment. that includes protecting harry, and also the triumph of lily's cause. he then finds out that he can't have both things at once, so he's stuck

or, put it this way: if harry decided he didn't want to sacrifice himself, snape wouldn't have forced him, and would have just continued on saving people/fighting voldemort until he (snape) was killed or something else happened

Ha! How could you force someone to kill themselves? Harry had to do so willingly for it to work, not led by Snape at wand point or anything, or use a potion. Voldemort could have threatened him with the destruction of the world but that wouldn't have been free will either since it was blackmail, harry would have wanted to go on his own. Hm interesting bit there.

Although I do think Snape would have encouraged harry to make the choice to do so, probably insulting him while doing so I can just hear it now (You're just like your father willing to sacrifice everyone to your arrogance and superiority...), but in the end I don't think there was much he could have done, or wanted to do either.
