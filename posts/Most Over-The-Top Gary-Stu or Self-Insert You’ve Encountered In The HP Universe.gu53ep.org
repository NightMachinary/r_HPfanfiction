*** 30H is a deliberately bad crack fic so it gets a pass, though I wanted to bleach my brain after reading it.

From the first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Dobby relished his groinsaw's roar as he withdrew the flesh-choked blade from the astronaut's ruined skull. He turned to Harry, thrusting his bloody, retina-covered pelvis with elfin fervor.

  "How does Ronnie Ron taste, master?"

  Harry spat out an eyeball. "Like some kid with eyes."

  Dobby ducked an astronaut's poison barbed fist, digging his groinsaw into the beast's abdomen and letting the spray of viscera wash over his elfin space armor. The skulls' eye sockets on his shoulders grew brilliant with an infernal cast and vomited a bolt of light through an astronaut; he was thrown back against the deathwall, his flesh boiling in another dimension.

  Harry slapped Dobby, who giggled.

  Harry reminded himself to kill himself later.
