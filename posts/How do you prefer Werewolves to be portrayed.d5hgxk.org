Do you like them to have enhanced senses and strength or do you prefer it to be an actual curse?

I don't remember Remus having anything like this in canon, I do seem to recall him always needing time after the full moon to recover.

** My headcanon if you'd like to have it:

Werewolves were initially created as a perversion of the animagus ritual by a dark wizard who wanted an army of powerful wolf animagi who were suborned to his will and who spread the curse through bites, thus growing the army under his control. The only thing that worked as he intended was the means of spreading the curse and their tendency to attack humans; the Werewolves could only transform on the full moon, they had no choice or control over the matter and were mindless murderous monsters during that time (until Wolfsbane came along). They are normal humans otherwise though the curse takes a toll on their health.

*** If I were to accept this headcannon, I would remove the "didn't work" part.

The curse itself was very effective, it bound the subjects sanity/will to the Dark Lord while transformed. (at least on a basic level, where the beast was happy&fine with taking (simple) orders from the Dark Lord)

The problem cropped up when the Dark Lord was defeated or died of old age... the curse's subjects no longer had anybody controlling them so they fell back on instincts which had been tampered with to remove that pesky human unwillingness to kill others.

***** you could also go for a "cure", or permanent wolfsbane;

Wolfsbane actually redirects the command-connection to the human him/herself, so the cure comes from creating a variation of the Wolfsbane that records this command-connection to an object (maybe as Thought/pensive-liquid)... which one then connects to a Artifact^{charmed, enchanted whatever} that automatically links the connection back to the human.

So there, a permanent wolfsbane... or slave collar.

The cure shouldn't be simply becoming an animagus in the normal/standard way or it would've been discovered already. Have it be something that somehow settles the werewolf into a wolf animagus /only/.

** Merciless killers, monsters to be hunted down who regularly attack innocent people (while transformed). Not cute and fluffy, horrible beasts with are one of the worst thing which could happen to a village/region. I even dig them plundering graves. Which is their most common representation in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf#Folk_beliefs][European folklore]]. Wolves used to be the worst natural enemy of humans and that fear manifested in the werewolf belief (what's worse than a wolf? One that can disguise itself as a human).

Lupin is the exception in canon, Greyback gets entire packs to join Voldemort in his fight. And given what else was on Voldemort's agenda, the willingness of the werewolves to make common cause says enough about what kind of people they were.

**** Hate to call on Rowling's trend for Revisionist History, but I'm pretty sure she thought of the alligory way after she made Lupin. She said it was an alligory in 2016, when the last book came out in 2007... and PoA was still decidedly written for children, not young adults who would appreciate that direct reference. Remus Lupin (Wolf Wolf) was just a werewolf because that's interesting and cool, and he was marginalized because it makes sense and is interesting.

** I don't think enhanced strength is a good idea, it quickly would start breaking the world, just like a vastly enhanced sense of smell - Giving werewolfness redeeming or abusable traits runs counter to what I imagine it to be.

What I do like are little annoying quirks that remind the human of his affliction; like weird taste in food and odd judgement of smell in general. My dog hates the smell of lemon, thyme, coconut shampoo.. - But the rotting mouse she found? Oh yes, let me get all over that!

*** Maybe this is just my weird interpretation of the thing, but how I see it is that the enhancement to the senses referred to in the opening post is only applicable to the transformed form.

So for one night a month, you have enhanced senses(ambivalent on strength enhancement, but I'm willing to accept it)...but the tradeoff is that for that entire night, you're basically a mindless, feral monster carrying what basically amounts to incurable magic rabies.

I'd say both. It /is/, as I see it, an actual curse, but the nocturnal nature of it means that enhanced sight, smell, and hearing - particularly at night - come with the territory. Might seem like perks, except for the part about being a feral, basically mindless monster all night(unless the Wolfsbane Potion is taken).

** Either can be well written, but I generally prefer both - werewolves having some sort of advantage over magical humans but it's also a curse. I think there are so many fun ideas that could come out of it.

For example, marginalized and non marginalized werewolf communities based on country/laws/culture.

Squibs becoming werewolves willingly so they can make something of their lives.

Fics with a strong werewolf/nonhuman faction - to this date I have yet to read a fic where a werewolf faction is truly strong. And i don't mean just as a part of Voldemort's army or whatever, but strong with real negotiating power and things.

** All curse, all side effects, no advantages. Any and all advantages seen in werewolves would be strictly due to the individual werewolfs' efforts to cope with their situation.

Werewolves are usually outcasts. Recall that Lupin was the only known werewolf student at Hogwarts. Werewolves that are bit as children are most likely denied an education, and wands. They would still have their magic, and they would have some idea that they are supposed to be able to make impossible things happen, but they wouldn't be able to intuit their way to a full education, not by themselves, and not without a wand. Children taken by Greyback are probably lucky to work out how to consistently make even a dozen spells happen for them, vs the thousands that a Hogwarts graduate knows.

** So I've hella enjoyed a /lot/ of different ways to portray werewolves, but my personal favorite is as a chronic health condition that needs careful management, is a remarkable pain in the ass at times, but does come with a couple of unexpected benefits (if you can manage to leverage them, that is).

I generally prefer something along the lines of a pack dynamic making for a less painful lead up to the moon and a less painful transformation (see, Fenrir Greyback not demonstrating any of the chronic pain and fatigue that Remus does). I also personally headcanon that the more in shape and physically active the human side is, the less the transformation hurts because there is less need to create muscle from magic and because the human body is in better condition to be super active all night (ie, an athlete who spends all night running will be kinda sore and very tired, a couch potato will probably hurt themselves if they have to do that with no warmup).

The drawbacks are obvious - you have to adjust your whole life to accommodate for the curse, whether it's because you reject it and your body is thus constantly under strain or because you embrace it and therefore /have to/ keep up a heavy exercise routine, whether you like it or not, and lean into the connections with your pack in ways non-werewolves wouldn't. Extra sensitive senses aren't a pure bonus either - sensory overload is a thing in humans, so having sharper senses just exacerbates that and means you have to learn to handle things that most people wouldn't think twice about so you don't melt down from too much sensory input.

** I like to think it depends of the werewold, and how he deal with his curse. From one side you would have people like Remus, who "fight" the curse and want to stay as human as possible, these werewold would be no different to other people (except the whole transformation into in a monster thing, and the fatigue it cause I guess). From the other you would have people like Greyback, who consider Lycanthropie as a gift, and do their best to "accept" the best. These one may have some difference like enhanced senses or strenght, though I think these upgrade should be barely noticeable (both because if not, people should want to become a werewold, and because Greyback was supposed to be the most powerfull werewold in Britain, who completely accepted his curse, yet he didn't seem to be that different from other wizards, hygiene aside).

** As prefer them to act like the pack from Twilight. If you haven't seen the series then you should know that the pack are different from the typical werewolf. They are more like native american skin changers in the way that their wolf transforming ability is genetic controlled ability passed down by birth and not by the typical werewolf bite. They basically change into over sized wolves rather than the weird humanoid wolves seen in Harry Potter. They can change any time they want and aren't pulled by the full moon. They have a pack mentality and can talk through their connected minds even while transformed. They all have a temper but at the end of the day they are a pack and the pack protects each other.
