I said this in a comment and now it's stuck with me all day. I want some fics that feature male-female platonic friendships and don't have plots that distract from the relationships & characters as main focus.

I absolutely loved how Elementary kept Joan & Sherlock as platonic BFFs, so something along those lines.

Thanks!

Edited to add that this girl dreamer89 on AO3 seems dope as hell but I know her a little too well ;)

** The only thing I can think of is this, which honeslty might not be what you're looking for. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298/chapters/24670002]]) Trans!Girl Harry, dubbed Holly.

While not the focus, there's a subplot where most the school thinks Holly and Ron are a couple when they definitely aren't. (Spoilers for a scene.) Though there is a kissing scene that helps them realise, "yeah, that felt gross, let's stay platonic."
