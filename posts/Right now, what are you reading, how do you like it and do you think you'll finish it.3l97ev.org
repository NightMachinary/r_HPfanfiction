I'm currently reading two fics a Lord of the Rings cross over called Shadow of Angmar by SteelBadger and a Hermione/Bellatrix AU called murder most horrid by Useful Oxymoron.

Shadow of Angmar had a really nice start, Harry is smart but not a genius, resourceful but only enough that he can survive. Unfortunately it's fallen into the same rut a lot of Lord of the Rings fanfiction falls into, being used by the author to show how much lore they know. Because of this while there's been a lot of cool world building going on in the last few chapters, nothing has really happened for a while. It is incomplete so if the actual plot doesn't pick up soon I'm just gonna drop it.

Murder Most Horrid is an amazing AU that's tons of fun. It has a fast paced romance, secrets, revelations and most importantly it has a satisfying ending... On chapter ten... My only complaint is that the story then carries on for another *SIXTY* chapters. There are hints that the story wants to start a new arc but I can predict what will happen in the second arc and it feels so forced. I might read a few more chapters to see if something catches my attention but right now I could put it down and never think of it again.

That's what I'm reading right now. What are you reading, how do you like it and do you think you'll finish it?


** Also, just wanted to add that I'd love it if you opened this thread every month. Hopefully, more people will add to this. I'm always curious about what people are reading at the moment, and about new fics in general.

** Right now I'm reading linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle). I've been putting this off for years, but it keeps coming up on reclists, so I've decided to go ahead and give it a try. Seems alright so far, the writing style reminds me of the James Potter series for some reason...

I just finished Delicate (and sequel Still Delicate) by padfoot4ever yesterday. I liked it a lot, the author writes really well. I don't really get the hate for cousin Molly though.

** Currently reading linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/series/309447]])\\
Basically it's written like the author grabbed a bunch of ideas from other fics that interested her and smooshed them together so it's a fun filled romp hopping through cliches where EVERYONE was under imperius and bonus space exploration wannabes and a hilarious resolution to the Heir of Slytherin plot.

Pros\\
* well written, has good comedic flow with definite instances of lol that results in your pets eyeballing you for disturbing their sleep.\\
* NO SHIP EXCEPT SPACE SHIP.\\
* miraculously Ron comes out alright in the end.\\
* the fic is already finished but hasn't been posted in its entirety.\\
Cons\\
* the introduction/deus ex machina with Loki will probably make eyes roll and could probably work just as well by replacing him with random old monied-pureblood OC.\\
* some bashing with terrible traits amplified to eleven.\\
* the fic is not posted in its entirety.

Other than that, HP & the Prince of Slytherin and linkffn(The Power of Love by Philosophize).

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** Just caught up to current with linkffn(the Changeling by annerb). This is a brilliant character study with very genuine characterizations and an excellent storytelling pace. It absolutely follows canon except where relevant to Ginny's situation, and that is as it should be- most of these changes in Ginny's life /shouldn't/ affect the canon events.

******* You can keep up to date with the author's update status on her [[https://twitter.com/annerbhp][twitter]]. And her [[http://annerbhp.tumblr.com/][tumblr]]. Sadly, the next chapter isn't going so well. Still, she's writing, so that's something.

Also, according to a PM, she's already completed 90k words of her sequel (though some of that might go into the sequel's sequel, apparently), which will be a Harry/Ginny post-war fic. I can't help but wish she would post whatever she's written, proper order be damned. Given her update rate, we may not see it until 2018, and that's if she doesn't take another 3-year hiatus.....

Glad you like the story. Not many people know it -- it has only 81 reviews and less than 200 favs, but it had just 77 favs a couple of months ago, so it has caught on after it was recommended here and on DLP. And please review it on DLP, if you don't mind. This story really deserves more readers than it has, and hopefully it will motivate the author to write faster.

Oh, and check out the fic she recommended today. It's pretty good.

They are all connected in chronological order from 1940 to 2098, but most stories happen after the Battle of Hogwarts. Lots of secondary characters, such as Susan Bones, Lavender Brown, Dennis Creevey, and Terry Boots, get quite a bit of exposure. I find these stories very entertaining.

Reading:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) - a Harry is a Slytherin and WBWL story. Written well and I like it so far. Will continue reading so long as the author keeps posting.

linkffn(The Wizard Who Meddled With Time by Team Ozone) - A great, new time travel fic with Harry having time travel powers. Great take on a time travel fic. Will definitely continue reading.

linkffn(Memories of Iron by becuzitswrong) - not HP, Worm fic; just thought I'd throw this out there for any Worm fans. Taylor gets Iron Man's memories in the Wormverse. Only drawback I have of this is Taylor is a bit too over powered, but I'm still enjoying it. Hope it updates again soon.

linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero) - Harry in another dimension fic. Really good so far.

linkffn(The Hogwarts Strike Team) - Time travel fic. Great so far, and I like the strained relationship b/w Harry and Hermione atm.

linkffn(Dead Man Walking by Kitty Smith) - funny parallel dimension/time travel fic. Harry keeps trying to kill himself because he wants to go back to his real family. Some might not like it because of that, but so far its captured my attention.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** Murder most horrid lost me after the first arc. It was so well done in the first few chapters and then it was just like the author pressing two puppets together, screaming "NOW KISS!". He/She took no time to build this relationship and it felt incredibly artificial and forced.

Shadow of Angmar... Well written, thats for sure. Harry is interesting and I like that he's stripped of his tools and struggles like he does in the fic. But its so young and I think we're only 7 chapters in, so final judgement will be reserved for later.

As to what I'm currently reading...

linkffn(Coronation of the Black Queen)

I followed this series for pretty long now. I enjoy it and will probably finish it.

linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For)

Normally I like this premise, but the whole waking up and everything's different, to the scale that it is in this story, REALLY bothered me. I'm only about 1/10 of the way through, I'm gonna go another few chapters before deciding whether to finish or not.

** I've been reading pre-OotP fics on FictionAlley lately. Just finished linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unbreakable Link).

It is... not very good. Lots of really obvious foreshadowing, clumsy sentence structures, a Dumbledore who is not manipulative or a bad guy but is dumb enough to send Harry to the manor house of a supposed Muggle named "Lord Eldir," etc.

But it was written and completed in 2001, which makes it really interesting as history. Lots of guessing about what the Department of Mysteries does, how the next three years will go, what Sirius will be doing, what Dumbledore was doing in his illustrious past, even who Arabella Figg is. Any tropes that are there basically have to be invented spontaneously, because there's not a lot to work from.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

I'm liking it a lot. There are some timeline problems that I assume are the results of having no one beta, but they're easy to read over. Also shades of idiot balling on a few characters. Overall its quite good and I will definitely finish it.

A good story, updates every day. Harry takes Wormtail getting away seriously, gets his ass in gear, things sort of fall apart.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew and Harry's inherent nobility leave a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature Harry bearing more effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance...

** Oh Murder Most Horrid. Yeah, those first few chapters are good, but I nope'd out after the sudden change to a new and predictable arc after chapter 10. It's one of those cases where the author would have been much better off starting a new story.

Right now, I'm working my way through this old thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1qymvu/the_best_of_lord_voldemort/]]. I've read all of the one shots, and they are awesome. A bit disturbing, but well, Voldemort was disturbing. Right now I'm reading Fate's Favorite, which is interesting, but rough going so far. People have said in the reviews that the beginning is a bit rocky, so I'm willing to go to about chapter 20 before passing final judgement.

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? cover pic - Harry's cub

** Reading "A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story", it's a timetravel and AU fic where Harry dies at the age of 21ish and gets sent to another universe in his 10 yearold body. It focuses on highblood politics a lot so far. Has an interesting opinion on magical treats of families. So far tho, i wouldn't rec it to people. It's slow, propably abandoned. Also since it's slow and has the wordcount 147k, i can roughly estimate it either speeds up weirdly or stops in the middle of something like 2nd year, or even sooner.
