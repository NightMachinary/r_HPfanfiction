** I have one complwte story where they're students again at the end. It takes place between year seven's end---though very not canon---and the beginning of year eight when h/hr return to hogwarts for seventh year having literally married hours before the train. A sequel is in the works but low priority.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.
