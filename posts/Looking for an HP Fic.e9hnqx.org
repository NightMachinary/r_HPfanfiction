:END:
Harry has wings and color was added to them each time he found a mate and/or had a child. Ended up his mate and him were headmaster/teachers are Hogwarts and he was going to have another clutch. Think he had like 3-4 mates. Sorry for being vague I just can't remember more about it. I think it was on FF but not 100% sure by this point.

Thank you for the help <3
