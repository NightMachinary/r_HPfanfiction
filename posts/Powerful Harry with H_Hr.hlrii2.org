  AU post OoTP. Poor Harry. Sirius left him far more than a house and some money. Dumbledore is the Dark Lord? And what is he supposed to do with the women he was left? Sometimes, Pranks suck and others they are opportunities. H/Multi

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...

** Well...Harry Crow fits the request as stated, but even after deciding that I really should read it just so I can say I did, I still found myself unable to stomach things as early as chapter 4, skimming over it, and then deciding to finish my proofreading projects first. I'll get back to it eventually.

As far as I can tell, the premise of the story is, What if goblins were actually much more awesome than wizards in every way, and Harry had the privilege of being adopted by one?

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
