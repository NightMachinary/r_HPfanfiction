It was unfinished, read it at work a few months ago. Want to check for any updates, but I don't remember the name or author. Hel?

​

I think it was recent. Harry was married to Ginny, who was a pro quidditch player. Harry was a burnt out Auror, McGonagall asked him to teach DADA. He was reluctant but came around because he could spend more time with his family. Then they bought a house in Hogsmeade.

​

Is this ringing any bells for anybody?

​

Thanks.

  At twenty-five, Harry Potter is at a crossroads in his life. He's achieved his dream of being an Auror, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, and with one child and another on the way, he's missing out on precious time with his family. But being an Auror is all he knows how to do - right? So he's in for a surprise when Professor McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, offers him a job as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ...
