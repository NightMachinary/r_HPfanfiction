What are your thoughts on canon compliance? I'm writing a story where aside from a modified version of books 2 & 4, I don't see myself shoe horning in the canon series of events for the hell of it (still trying to make a reasonable explanation of how the Basilisk got around the castle without being seen by portraits...).

I've seen that a number of people (if reviews on other stories is any indication) /really/ like them some CC stories, but I feel it makes stories less exciting since you basically know how things will go down.

And can't antagonists get their plans finished before the end of term???


** It's a mixed bag for me. On the one hand the stations of the canon as they're known can be excruciating to go through and you do see why anything was changed at all if it's gonna play out the same. But change it too much and the characters become empty shells with only the names linking them to JKs work. Best is when we're not dropped in media's res with the changes but we see the world, plots and characters evolve organically as time goes on so we understand how and why they end up as they do.

** Diverging from canon is generally a good thing. If it's done intelligently, diverging more is usually better than less. For example, looking back, I feel like I held too closely to canon in The Accidental Animagus and The Arithmancer, even though I changed a fair amount, because holding too close to canon is boring.

A good rule of thumb is that if you feel the need to contrive circumstances to make the canon events still happen, you're doing it wrong. An extreme example would be a time travel fic where Harry /chooses/ to still let the basilisk plot play out because reasons. That's just Idiot Ball stuff. Or a fic where the premise is the addition of an extra character, but literally nothing else changes, even when it should. The new character /de facto/ has no power and no agency, plus it makes the story unrealistic.

On the opposite end of the scale, changes to the /worldbuilding/ should be made intelligently and should be clearly delineated. If you break the rules of the books, people will notice. You have more leeway with additions (that's sort of the premise of The Arithmancer), but even then, if all you're doing is making things easier for the characters, you're doing it wrong. That goes double if the changes are very tropey. For example, friendly goblins who have an easy horcrux removal ritual. Or evading the Trace by buying an unregistered wand. A fix fic that does nothing but fixing may be cathartic at first, but it quickly turns boring.

Now, from you're brief description, I'd say you're solidly in safe territory. After all, the most important thing is that the story is well-written. There are good stories that throw canon out the window, and if you only go with a rough parallel to the stations as you describe, I think you'll have more than enough grounding for most people to enjoy it.

*** The Trace is a plot device to keep Harry under the Dursely's thumb. If you don't care about showing how miserable Harry is with the Dursleys, you can drop the whole trace drivel without any trouble. (And you probably should, given how stupid it is handled in canon.)

**** I already changed the Trace a bit. In my story, the wizarding population is somewhat larger, and they have embedded some of their number in various muggle institutions (political offices (though never the highest office), universities, law enforcement, etc.) so as to have an ear to the ground for Statute of Secrecy violations and ease of access when they need to Obliviate Muggles after any violations.

There is a 2nd Trace to pick up magic uses from those who haven't had it removed (you have to be 17 to go to the Ministry to do so). It's main function is to pick up noticeable accidental magic by Muggleborns so the Ministry can apprise the family of the situation and prevent SoS violations from accidental magic. It seemed more sensible than waiting until they were almost old enough for Hogwarts, when they could have already blown a lid off the SoS because of public accidental magic, lol.

I thought it was a more useful reason for the Trace to exist. There's also a Trace on wands, since wands are registered to particular people they can see who specifically does underage magic, whereas the other Trace has no way to determine the user, just the location.

*** Thanks for your thorough response!

Your bit about clearly delineating what differs from canon is something I've been trying to take care to do. The actions, motivations and some history of certain characters (namely the actions of the Malfoys in the first war and what Voldemort did with his first Horcrux) are decidedly different than in canon. And there's some substantial political changes that are mentioned in my next chapter. So with all of this going on, the events of some books just wouldn't work for me (book 1 seems to have been axed as a possibility, and book 3 was never really an option). I feel much less cramped by the predetermined structure of the canon plot by not feeling compelled to defer to it.

I'm only 2 chapters in and I've already gotten the obligatory review saying I misunderstood Metamorphmagus transformations. Although that's untrue since they work a bit differently in my story, I guess my author's note didn't make that clear enough so I'll have to repeat it next chapter.

Again, thanks for your comment. Now if I can just find decent free time to get to writing, heh

** I want to read about what other characters were doing when the canon events were happening. I have absolutely zero interest in reading about what Harry was doing between the ages of eleven and seventeen. As far as I'm concerned, canon pretty well covers that (though there are short gaps where you could fit other stories).

But all the other characters have plenty of times when we don't know what they were doing, and those are the stories I want to read.

** I think you are confusing your terms here.

We have:

- Canon compliant - So fics which could be fit somewhere in the existing canon.

- Divergence AUs - So the setting stays the same, but the story is changed due to some factor derailing it.

- Canon rehash - The setting may be different but the plot is the same as we saw in canon.

The first and the second are both valid an in a way interesting option. The third is usually bad unless it's a case of it being merged with the first aka the same events but from a different perspective (and different enough for it to be interesting). But even then it falls into a certain problem - canon plots are simply bad.

Now, with a non-divergence AU you can change anything you want, but what is a problem and what I and some other people complain about is people clearly not knowing canon and putting in setting solutions that are worse from the canon ones and usually are taken and slightly modified from earlier fics that did exactly the same thing.

To summarise, reusing canon plots is bad, but not taking canon into account when planning your changed setting is bad too.

** As long as there is a believable explanation for why we you are complying with canon or changing things it doesn't matter.

When it comes to taking a full year for baddies plans to come to fruition my thought usually goes to pacing. Yeah you could have Voldemort attempt to steal the stone, release the Basilisk, get defeated, flee to a Death Eater and get resurrected all in the first year. It might even make sense with the changes you make, but now you have a twelve year old Harry facing a resurrected Voldemort instead of a 15-17 year old. That can lead to some weird problems with either slowing down Voldemort so Harry can gain enough power to realistically be involved in the war, or accelerating Harry's skills in a way that might not be believable. Going year by year can give you time to manage you character development and pacing.

**** Bring astronomy into it. The final task was within a few days of the summer solstice. Astronomy is a core class at Hogwarts so its probably more important to the average witch or wizard than runes but we never see it referenced outside of potions, Herbology and a bit in Divination. Whenever you're in doubt you can slip in astronomy and nobody can argue since nobody knows why its a core subject for 5 whole years.

** An idea for why no one saw the Basilisk:

The portraits and ghosts (and maybe house elves too) aren't able to tell any secrets of the original Founders (That's why moaning Myrtle couldn't accuse Tom Riddle of releasing the Basilisk). However they can hint at it if asked, jus like Harry did when he asked Myrtle how she died.

Like Sir Cadogan definitely wasn't there at the founding, as he was part of the Knights of the Round Table, and like Merlin attended Hogwarts himself. Maybe this idea has merit in some way or variation, so thanks for suggesting it.

  “Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it.”
