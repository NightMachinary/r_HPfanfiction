prompted by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c5gmke/boggarts_and_ptsd/][this post]]

the Boggart scene has always been something that bugged me about canon. Harry's classmates are 12-13 in POA, not 5; but their fears are written as extremely literal things, snakes and spiders and clowns and whatnot. like, okay, the spider thing for Ron makes sense; throughout the series his extreme arachnophobia has been a constant. but i can't believe that every single student's fear described derives from a trauma or phobia; it just doesn't make sense.*

Lupin tells Harry that his fear of Dementors represents a more abstract fear of fear itself. so, from that, can we assume that all of the Boggarts we see are like that? i mean, maybe.

but how do you turn "rejection from my peers" into "banshee"?

statistically, at least one of those kids:

- has been abused
- is LGBT+ and is afraid of being outed
- deals with mental illness
- has lost a family member to the (very recent) war
- has lost a family member for other reasons (canon for multiple characters)

canonically, multiple kids there are the children of literal wizard nazis, and are therefore likely:

- to not have had the healthiest home lives
- to be afraid of being alienated by their family (over personal/political beliefs or other reasons)
- to fear family members being arrested/imprisoned
- to have had family members arrested/imprisoned/killed

personally, i think it's quite likely that by that point Dumbledore would have let other students like that- werewolves, half-giants like Hagrid, whatever- into the school. Lupin, of all people, should have known that any students who weren't fully human would have feared being "outed." hell, his full moon boggart was one of our first clues as readers. i doubt that no students other than Hermione figured it out.

if the Boggart thing was part of their curriculum, Lupin should have fought it, and was a shitty teacher for not doing so. if Lupin somehow didn't consider that, and created the lesson himself- or if he thought it would be fine- then that's even worse. *i am not necessarily saying that Lupin was a bad teacher or person in canon; i'm saying that he facilitated a potentially very harmful "lesson."*

going back to the fear thing. other than personal fears: what about more general ones? being attacked, stalked, murdered. friends turning on you or playing cruel jokes. war or violence in general.

like. i find it very, very difficult to believe that all the students' fears were the way they're showed in canon. i find it difficult to believe that there weren't students panicking and breaking down after class or in front of everybody, students who had to go to the hospital wing because they couldn't get calm.

maybe it's just because Harry was with the Gryffindors, and somehow they're all childish enough not to have any real fears; all the fanfics i've seen with this scene rewritten to show scary shit are from the perspective of Slytherins, but i find it hard to believe that only one section of the school has that. and, yeah, Harry's the quintessential unreliable narrator; but would he really miss, idk, a corpse or something?

of course, there could be a fic where all the other classmates get Obliviated or something after seeing another student break down in class. that might actually make sense, in canon. it would definitely make a cool fic. but i digress.

when i was 12, i was scared of my parents kicking me out. i was scared of of my own gender, my sexuality, getting outed. when i was 13 i was afraid of gaining weight, and of my eating disorder. i was worried that i'd lose control of my intrusive thoughts and hurt someone, or that i'd kill myself and forget to leave a note.

*and before people start yelling at me for supposedly bashing their deepest darkest fears:* no one's saying it's bad or childish to be afraid of literal things. i'm not calling you dumb for your fear of clowns; i'm saying it's irrational to show a roomful of people their deepest fears and expect everyone to fear clowns more than anything else in the whole wide world.

idk. i guess i'm just disappointed. i was disappointed when i first read that scene and i'm even more disappointed now. maybe it's bc it was the first time Rowling let me down, but it still annoys me.

holy shit, it feels good to get that off my chest. i've needed to say that for, like, ten years.

*(edit: Neville's the other exception, and we don't see enough of his reaction.)

(edit/add-on: yes, i know that Rowling was still trying to make this a little kid's series at that point. but if your logic is "oh, it would've been too mature" then your logic should extend to "she shouldn't have kept that scene at all" because the implications are still there.)


** JKR has written that Lupin's dad made a living out of studying boggarts, which presumably means Remus knows a lot about them, too.

I like the Divine Comedian's interpretation the best, in 'Calibration' we see Lupin communicating with the boggart he's about to use on his third-years, making sure it won't show them anything too bad.

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

***** I see what you're saying, and I think the scene as written incanon was sort of intended to convey that. But there's a difference between organising a structured/teamwork activity and making kids face their deepest fears in front of a classroom full of their peers, and their teacher. Sure, the kids mightn't be able to conceptualise them, but if it's a subconscious fear then it's very likely it'll just spring out and attack them.

He could easily have made it a solitary activity - which he does in the exams. Or he could've just exposed them to generically dangerous (which =/= scary) creatures/jinxes/situations.

** My problem with boggarts is actually the opposite - the fact that they can show you abstract fears at all. Like the boggart that catches Molly in OotP and just shows her the dead bodies of her family. Fine, it's distressing, but how is it in any sense /dangerous/? If all the boggart is doing is showing you distressing imagery, it's hardly a dangerous creature.

Personally I think the boggart should have been restricted to manifesting only as literal fears - dangerous things which pose a physical threat to the wizard who encounters them. Which, to be fair, is /mostly/ what it does.

As for the lesson itself - chances are, most wizards are going to encounter a boggart at some point in their lives, if not multiple times. They're not exactly uncommon creatures. You can "opt out" of a lesson, perhaps, but you can't opt-out of the world. Better to first encounter one in a controlled environment than while wandering around Hogwarts on your own or when opening your wardrobe in the evening.

You yourself say it mostly turns into literal physical fears. So if the boggart has a 40% chance of turning into something distressing but harmless like corpses, and a 60% chance of turning into something like a giant spider that will devour you... you don't think that's a dangerous creature?

I know that after a nightmare, it takes me a bit to catch my bearings. Hell, there's even been times I wake up completely sobbing because it scared me so bad. Now take that and multiply it, because you're fully conscious and can see it in front of you.

That's what I think OP is saying. It would make sense that Harry would fear a dementor, because they're nasty little pieces of work, and suck all the joy out of you. If you've ever had like a heart break, or a pet or parent die, or got found out that you're not gonna be ok because you have cancer or whatever, that moment of utter despair where there is no bright side? That's what I imagine a dementor to do. And those things seemed to flock to Harry.

***** No, no. You don't give JKR enough credit. Whatever I think about her other cockups (The Case of Vanishing Ginny mostly), Molly Weasley is very deliberately designed person, and her sole purpose is one giant build up to the scene with killing Bellatrix Lestrange (the same goes for Kreatcher, he is also used for finding the locket, but his main purpose is the preceding scene with him leading house-elves to The Battle and everything else with him is just a buildup to that). This scene with her and the boggart is in my opinion very very deliberate (and perhaps one of the reasons why the boggarts were introduced at all).

No matter what trial a character went through, they would come out of it fine and dandy mentally and physically. Harry should be mentally scared for life just from the basilisk alone.

JKR also has a habit of pulling characters out of her ass. Luna isn't mentioned until book 5 even though she was supposed to be at Hogwarts since book 2. In book 3, the Marauders are introduced and Sirius is said to be Voldy's right hand man, but then in book 5 it is said that Belatrix (who only now gets mentioned) is Voldy's right hand woman. I don't think JKR really thinks beyond the book that she is writing. She doesn't stop to think ahead of time.

DOH, chapter 9 (“A Place to Hide”). The Trio is ambushed by two Death Eaters, they overcome them and then this happens:

  The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms to regain feeling in them. Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench.

  “I should've recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,” he said. He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man's eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

  “That's Dolohov,” said Ron. “I recognize him from the old wanted posters. I think the big one's Thorfinn Rowle.”

Look at the Obscurus in Fantastic Beasts. Can you imagine how close Harry could have become one himself? Sure she claimed later that Harry didn't become one because the Dursleys feared him, but imagine if he had taken their treatment of him even more personally?

That's not to mention Amortentia and the implications of that being used with little to no real consequence.

That's not what she said at all. You don't become an obscurial because you are abused. You become an obscurial because you reject your own magic.

Harry was never close to becoming an obscurial. For a start, he didn't know that he had magic to reject. But more fundamentally, his character was such that he never internalised anything the Dursleys told him - he was sassy, talked back to them all the time, never accepted their beliefs as his own, etc.

** I'm loath to do this with a lot of Rowling's work, but I can handwave this one away as ‘being for children' and also ‘because it's Rowling'.

The only reason for that is that it's already a very intense environment with all the kids facing the Boggart in front of their classmates. Yes, /realistically/, some of these kids would have lots of trauma. One of my quibbles with ‘Harry's greatest fear is dementors' is that Harry's greatest fear /should/ relate to being bullied and excluded for most of his life. But putting abuse, PTSD, and sexuality issues would have made an extremely fraught and ‘adult' scene out of something that is really only intended to be a light throwaway scene.

Unfortunately, this isn't one of JKR's strong points. She just doesn't have the infrastructure or the (I'm sorry) /emotional range/ to do it in a series like HP. Nor does she understand why such issues could potentially be serious, and fantastic opportunities for character development - if she had, Harry Potter would've been a much more contained story.

But Harry isn't mature enough as a character to deal with these issues. In fact, I'd argue that he /regresses/ in maturity over the series.

Had PoA been a different book, even a different children's book, it could've been taken... how do I put this? Seriously but lightly. We could've been shown real fears without delving too deeply (yet) into the emotional implications of those fears for each student. E.g. we might've had Seamus being gay or Neville being criticised by Augusta and then that playing off, later on, into Harry beginning to /understand/ why Neville is the way he is and trying to make friends with him. Unfortunately, even what we get in PoA (Augusta appearing in front of Neville) isn't actually carried through into an opportunity for Harry's character development.

This is also, don't forget, the same author whose one canonical example of a gay person is Dumbledore, seven books after the fact, through Word of God. I get the feeling JKR really isn't comfortable with writing stories where teenagers are.. you know... attracted to the same sex, or are trans or whatever. Even peripherally - you don't have to blow trumpets about it, just mention it casually.

Rowan of Rin (the whole series, but particularly the first book, since it's about overcoming your fear) deals with this beautifully. Every single time someone is afraid, there's real emotional pain behind it. It's not random. It has meaningful consequences, it is deep-rooted in most cases, and there are stakes to overcoming it. Spoilers follow:

1. First, we have a character running away because his greatest fear is spiders. But we get a follow-up: his sister is emotionally affected because she's so attached to her brother that she can't bear to be away from him.
2. One of the other characters is adamant that she doesn't love anyone, has no close friends or family, etc. She even criticises someone else for being “weak” because they love animals. Then we learn that her childhood friend died at age 10, in a way that was related to animals, and she still hasn't processed it. So she runs away, in absolute denial, traumatised and terrified of being reminded of her friend's death again. Hard to explain without context.
3. Then, it shows us someone else's greatest fear (swimming, okay, fine) but then, in barely a page, we get the backstory for that character's fear (he never learned to swim because he was teased as a child due to his heritage).

These are adult characters, in a children's book. There's a constant theme in these books of being left out, not belonging, being a fish out of water. The series returns to it again and again in various forms.

Harry Potter isn't nearly as recursive in its approach.

Another example: in Tamora Pierce's Emelan series, one of the main characters !overcomes her fear of the dark to help her friends escape a potentially life-threatening situation.! Actually, these are several instances where one of the protagonists is clearly terrified and they still do the right thing.

In short, the message in HP isn't geared towards ‘face your fears and do it anyway'. It's more like ‘Face your fear, but also magic it away by laughing at it!' PTSD etc are deep-rooted and are really hard to make humorous.

***** mood.

going back to your example of Tamora Pierce's works (i haven't finished the Emelan series yet, but i've noticed this in other books by her:) Pierce is one of the best YA/children's authors imo because when she /does/ write scenes with deeper/darker implications, they're done in a way that feels authentic and realistic. the characters in her books do often experience trauma (even if it usually isn't named as such) and work through them.

both Rowe and Pierce have always been very aware of what they do; there are no true throwaway scenes (i don't remember much about Rowan of Rin, but i'm pretty sure this was something i liked about it.)

*** There was one other time when a boggart was mentioned. That time showed a bit more depth than the scene in Harry's 3rd year. Mrs. Weasley had been trying to get rid of a boggart, yet couldn't get rid of it due to her being emotionally compromised (for good reason) seeing the dead bodies of those she held dear. But for when it was introduced in 3rd year, I think JKR either didn't think it through or tried to play it down. Lupin, in my opinion, didn't really have the best interpersonal skills. He was mild and pleasant, but he was 1/4 of the Marauders. Perhaps he thought it'd be a bit of fun and didn't think about the potential consequences of children having their deepest fears on display in front of their peers.

** My thing with boggarts is what would happen if someone say had a fear of the world ending or say being trapped in a blackhole. Wouldn't boggarts being able to only do very literal transformations make it nearly impossible to recreate that type of scenario since they can't become an ended world and since human cannot see a blackhole would the boggart just become a blob of vantablack? Or say someone has a fear of traveling to another universe. How woul the boggart respond to that fear? Now I understand that yes the scene was for children and the characters reacting for the most part were children, but it would be interesting to see how a creature like a boggart would react to those types of fears.

Yeah, Harry. Neville, too. Neville is scared of his abusive teacher, and Harry is afraid of fear itself, and being helpless as all his happy memories are sucked away. Remember that the Dursleys were rarely if at all physically abusive, they mostly just prevented him from having any positive experiences. The Dementors are a perfect representation for that.

#+end_quote

Just because you have a mental illness doesn't mean you can't be scared of something more mundane. It doesn't automatically inform your greatest fear. Lupin's paranoid and self-loathing to a maladaptive degree, though, so he may well count.

#+begin_quote
  has lost a family member to the (very recent) war

They're awfully young to have solid memories of that. We see Molly's boggart is just that, later on, though. She lost her brothers in the war.

I mean, we're back to Molly.

Basically, I think the point was to make it so you wouldn't freeze up if you were confronted by a boggart in later life. If part of your boggart was not wanting your worst fear to be witnessed in front of others, then if that happened to you, you'd probably go nuts. Best for a controlled detonation. It's literally his job to prepare them for this.

They change into simple physical feats with the goal of simply scaring away interlopers so they can go back to their cramped hidey holes in peace.

Class XXX boggarts feed on fear itself and take more complex forms that are capable of paralyzing their victim with fear that they can then feed on. Eg Molly.

Of course there are rumors of a class XXXXX bogart in Maine that not only feeds on fear but on muggles and wizards alike.

** The boggart scene has bothered me for the longest time as well. When I was young I got 'attacked' by bugs a lot. When I was 4 I stepped on an ant hill and stood on it. They ended up swarming me and my dad had to spray me with the water hose. I have been stung by bees and wasps on three separate times before I turned 7. The first time was near the time with the ants. I got stung by a bee in the ear. The next time some wasps made a nest under the jungle gym set in our back yard. When me and my friends climbed on it we disturbed the wasps. I was so paralyzed with fear that I ended up being stung a couple of times. Then there was the time when me and a bunch of other kids got stung by ground dwelling bees.

These experiences left me mildly scared of bugs that ended up becoming out right terror when I had a particularly bad dream about bugs. My brother have since then taunted and teased me about my fears frequently. They were utterly unsympathetic with my plight.

As a result, I don't really care much for my brothers and don't think I can confide in them about things. I hate it when anybody tries to trivialize other people's fears just because they don't understand it.

As for Harry's fears; they don't quite make much sense. You would think his fears would be something like being attacked by Dudley, an angry Vernon, the cupboard, social rejection from his peers, Quirrelmort (because that shit should be scary for any eleven year old), or maybe the GIANT FUCKING BASILISK that he fought just the year earlier. Nobody comes out of those experiences unscaved. But Harry comes out of these experiences fine and dandy.

I think this is just another sign of the weakness in JKR as a writer. She doesn't stop to think of the consequences of these experiences and how they would affect the character. I get that it is supposed to be a children's book, but that only makes these mistakes all the more glaring.

**** If you think about it, Lucius is very demanding as a parent. He has a reputation to uphold as a Malfoy and he expects Draco uphold this as well while being away from home. And even though Draco is very much like Lucius, it can be implied that he is more than likely afraid of his father as well. Afraid to disappoint him, on a very extreme level. Draco loves his father but Lucius is cold and comes across that way when he's with his wife and Draco. There's no softness between them. Draco has a very competitive nature and whether that's because he doesn't want to disappoint Lucius and suffer for it, or because he truly is just a competitive child. I've always thought that Lucius was most likely an abusive parent. He's not physically abusive but mentally and emotionally abusive. I've always believed that he's pushed Draco past his limits, making fun of how Hermione is a greater witch/wizard than his own son is, and to hear that is very, very upsetting because to hear things like that from a parent cane be emotionally abusive. Draco tried as hard as possible to be better than everyone else due to the fact that it is expected of him, not because he may actually want to. He's been groomed to think the way he does, to act the way the does, and to come out on top in every situation imaginable. I won't deny the fact that I may be making the wrong assumption about Draco and Lucius, but as someone who was terrified of having their own parents disappointed with them for making less than a B in any class, and even now while in college, it's hard for me to not think/believe that they have a very strained relationship.
