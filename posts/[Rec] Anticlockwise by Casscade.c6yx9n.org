[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13022207/1/Anticlockwise][Anticlockwise by Casscade]] Terrible things happen when wizards meddle with time, Miss Granger. Particularly to those caught in their way.

What it's about - Hemione trying to work out what's going on with Harry OR time travel from the point of view of a character that hasn't time traveled and how sinister and confusing the time travellers actions can seem when these actions aren't viewed from their perspective.


** My review of it: It's an enjoyable fic with an original premise, and Hermione is in character personalitywise.

However, I think that the story sells her intellect short. She is playing the everyman passive observer, rather than someone who is actually pretty proactive, diligent, and quite brilliant---good at noticing and remembering things and putting clues together.

For example, she sees Harry, Draco, and Luna are all suddenly casting impossibly far above their grade level, but she doesn't acknowledge it or ask how they are suddenly so capable. She presumably knows about Lockhart, yet she doesn't consider Memory Charms or take precautions, even after she discovers something terrible. She doesn't follow-up with the Remembrall. She doesn't question Dobby, even though she has every opportunity to.

And, while she observes all the clues, she never even tries to put them together. In that, the fic is a disappontment.

*** Just playing devil's advocate here...

She probably did know about Lockhart, but she may have been a bit more concerned about all the school stuff she was petrified for rather than investigating more on memory charms. She may not have taken precautions because she figured that:

1. The particular person in question wouldn't try to erase her memory (or perhaps she figured they didn't even know how to)

2. They weren't going to find her before she got to McGonagall

All the Remembrall that does is say that you forgot something, she doesn't know what it could be or how large or small the magnitude of what she forgot was. Also immediately afterwards, there was a rather distracting event for her.

With Dobby, he was about to hurt himself when she did ask questions, which was why she didn't want to press him further.

As for seeing Draco, Harry and Luna casting above their level...yeah she should have asked more questions, lol, maybe not of Draco and Luna since she doesn't know them that well, but Harry for sure.

**** Taken individually, it is, in fact, plausible for Hermione to miss each of these clues, fail to follow up, fail to take precautions, etc.. However, it is just as plausible for her not to, and it's the author's choice and responsibility to have her keep failing. If the author wanted someone more passive and less clever, they could have used Neville as the point of view character.

***** Neville /would/ be a better choice for the POV, but my guess is that the author defaulted to a Trio member (and Hermione specifically) due to convention.

** You should change the flair for the post.

I like it, but again, as a Time-Traveler, Harry is too trusting in an obviously corrupt ministry.
