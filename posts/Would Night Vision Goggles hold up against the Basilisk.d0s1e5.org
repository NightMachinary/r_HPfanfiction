After seeing a repost, featuring the now infamous screen shot of Daniel Radcliffe from guns akimbo dual wielding pistols, claiming Harry should have been bringing a gun to a wand fight, using NVGs, etc, this whole time, I got to thinking; How would NVGs hold up against the basilisk? Suspend disbelief and other obvious issues with a 12 year old wizard having access to muggle military technology for a moment and follow me.

In CoS we saw that the basilisk gaze destroyed the film in Colin Creevey's camera, and he was petrified by looking directly at it through the view finder. The way NVGs work is little differently and you're not actually looking directly at the object through a lense there are several layers of stuff between the objective lense and the ocular lense. If I had to venture a guess the basilisk gaze would likely bloom/washout the NVGs, which over time will destroy the light enhancing ability of the goggles, BUT I doubt it would truly petrify the wearer until it burned through the rest of the goggles. In the interim, aim directly for the middle of the bright glowing object and toss 10 freedom seeds in that direction. It would have to be worth a try, if well outside of the abilities of your average British 12 year old.

I'd welcome anyone elses wild speculation.


** Honestly, it depends on the time you're going for.

At the end of the day, the thing that makes muggle!wank fics so shitty is that technology just invalidates all of magic. So if you just want an easy fix it story, the. Sure it works and the basilisk is just a big target dummy.

But if wizards magic instinctively protects them from muggle weaponry by generating a field that reduces kinetic impacts, that explains how Neville bounced and how their main sport can involve batting cannonballs at each other and plowing into a field at full broom speed without completely dying.

Hell, most of this rant also applies to AU Harry's in other universes where HP magic completely outclasses the Force or Biotics or whatever. If there's no balance, no challenge, there's no tension. And without tension and a real feeling of the threat of failure, any action or drama story is going to suck.

*** Exactly. A lot of fix it stories or OP/indy Harry stories or even time travel stories have the problem of taking anything and everything that made the story interesting away. There's a reason why most muggle stuff just doesn't work around magic. And I think a lot of people overestimate guns. You'd have to be a great shot to hit someone immediately and in a way that instantly kills. I think once a wizard knows what you're doing, they can simply accio your gun away, or destroy it with a reducto or something or simply use protego, and a non lethal wound is easy enough to heal with magic.

You can get proficient with weapons very quickly (few days of intense training). You won't become a master marksman overnight, but certainly passable and way quicker than with other forms of combat.

They did not have a Napoleonic charge coming at them across hundreds of yards of open ground while they were atop of a fortified hilltop. Which makes all the difference. The Battle of Hogwarts would become a turkey shoot, ground to a bitter end within a few minutes.

*********** I think you're overestimating the numbers. Guns are not the end all be all solution, although something like that culling the fodder would be logical.

Transfiguration can be done on guns as well. A wave of Voldemort's wand and every person using a gun now has a venomous snake.

Using something like that only works once at best from a stationary position. After that the death eaters catch on.

I wouldn't mind a fic where Voldemort is terrified of Dumbledore, because when Dumbledore uses transfiguration in duels, he animates heavy artillery.

But having guns only in Harry Potter. No way. You could write a fic where there's enchanted gun defenses, but when it comes wizard to wizard, not really. It would be pretty badass to see a wizard dual-wielding a wand and a pistol, but it'd be a distraction at best.

So as a surprise, sure. Have a character confund some army officers, steal some guns, and go nuts. But up close? I couldn't see it.

************* Well, then I agree with your point, although I'm inclined to think Voldemort is smart enough to realize someone is getting hurt beforehand. Hence why it wouldn't work on him. He wasn't really the charge in type.

So long as it's heavily supplemented with magic, I don't have an issue with it plot wise.

With pistols and rifles maybe. But once you get heavy machine guns, mortars and the like involved, it gets lethal pretty quickly, especially since you could use charms to ensure proper cooling, stability and infinite ammunition. Especially in defensive situations like the Battle of Hogwarts.

****** Because effective protection against explosive munitions would require the shield to surround you completely, otherwise, the pressure difference would tear you apart. There is a canonical shield spell which does that, but it does not move, which makes the caster easy prey to other spells (which can easily overwhelm the shield given enough time.

Also, simple automatic fire forces the other guy to cast a shield charm, hence preventing them from casting offensive spells. Throw in a few machine guns, and you significantly reduce the offensive capabilities of the other side (assuming a static situation like the Final battle).

Because they could do just that with wands as well. We are not talking about Muggle vs Wizard, we are talking wizards with guns or wizards and the military fighting together.

The effective range of the kind of weapons I am thinking about can very well exceed a mile. You can accurately use a wand at maybe 100 yards if you are good. And while a blasting curse might match a mortar when it comes to destructive capabilities, it does not come even close in range.

**** A good implementation to me looks like DnD or the Avengers.

In DnD a level 20 fighter and level 20 wizard are going to be roughly on par, though with abilities and skillsets obviously tailored to different situations. They're each going to have situations they shine or suck but they can still be part of the same story.

Hawkeye and Black Widow the Muggles are still on a team with Dr Strange and The Scarlet Witch, but with skill and cleverness manage to keep up with them and be useful.

Harry Gets Guns is an entertaining trope, but to do it well you can't just hand the bad guys the idiot ball and have nobody be able to come up with a counter or the "Gee golly nobody ever thought of using enchanted muggle weapons before!"

Tom Riddle grew up in London around WWII, do you think he doesn't know about bombs and machine guns?

No. I'd argue that a complete stomp can be very entertaining to read, but you need to keep it short. Say you get the British Army to defend Hogwarts during the final showdown. At 5k words it is fun to see Voldemort's side get thoroughly buggered. But if you drag the same premise out to 150k, it gets old very quickly. Same with Hermione stomping the GoT World since transfiguration is broken, never mind mind magic. Fun for the first hour, but gets boring afterwards.

**** That would be fairly fun to read, actually. Like the entire story is the same right up until the Battle of Hogwarts, when in comes some elite SAS unit fully trained in defense against magical enemies "Men of Letters" style and one of them just throws a hunk of lead (enchanted rifles/bullets maybe?) straight through the dark lord, BUT IT DOESN'T WORK because Nagini and Harry are still alive and they still have to have that arc but in the interim the good guys are smiting the death eaters whole sale with the help of a small amount of muggle technology (the statues Mcgonagall brought to life had swords and stuff so why not?)

**** I actually agree with what you're saying, though obviously my phrasing failed to communicate that.

No challenge just makes it very hard to get emotionally invested in the story. There's no excitement or drama if I go into every fight scene knowing that no matter how crazy it is that the protagonist is going to come through without a scratch. Superman would get pretty boring without kryptonite.

With most stories there's a subconscious expectation that the protagonist eventually overcomes their obstacles, but a good drama will make you wonder how they'll pull it off sometimes, and what they'll have to sacrifice to do so.

Not all genres need that feeling. A comedy, fluff, or romance story doesn't always care about combat capability, and as you mentioned, shorter fics can also be lumped in there because shorter stories don't always require as much investment.
