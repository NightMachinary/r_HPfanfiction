Just curious about how far some authors will go to make Harry powerful/OP.

For my suggestion, i'd say the Harry from Beginning A New Path from StargateSG1Fan1 is the most OP one i've seen. In this story he becomes a literal god, but not the regular type of gods, these ones are seperate from reality to such a degree that they can hold entire multiverses in the palm of their hand. It's ridicioulous. They exist outside time, and space, and even then he becomes the most powerful.

So what is the most OP Harry that you've ever seen?

Thanks,

Warryn.


** Harry is [[/spoiler][Cthulhu]] in the one shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/13/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Strange Aeons]]. His parentage is even more epic in linkffn(5116751) by the same author (me).

** Terminal Justice. linkffn(11965672)

This is part of the extended Make a Wish sequels, and it features Harry Potter in the DCAU. Without giving away plot details, his physical abilities are roughly on par with kryptonians, his magical with Doctor Fate or Zatanna, on top of that he's a cosmic entity, and his luck is an actual power.

Unlike the core three Make a Wish stories, this one wasn't written by the Blot, and it does show - rather than being based off the author's personal travels, this (mostly) follows part of the third season ot Justice League Unlimited. It's still a great story, though.

  The unofficial fourth of the Make a Wish series by Rorschach's Blot, it was originally written by Overkill aka Irrational Intelligence and removed for some reason. EDIT: Have separated the chapters now.

*** I've read that, and while certainly OP, he's not Beginning A New Path OP. He becomes so powerful that no-one can challenge him. Trust me Harry from Beginning A New Path would beat Core Threads Harry. He's so OP that in the Star Trek crossover, he make's Q his b****.

**** Don't know about the beginning of new path but in the core threads, when you look at it from Nasuverse terms, he made third true magic his bitch, mutilated his soul with every spell he cast then fixed himself, fractured his own mind with his emotions gaining minds of their own (Now that I think about it, much like that disney movie actually.), created a whole damn world inside his own god damn mind, fused with what could be hinted as [Death] as a concept, made the grimm reaper himself fuse with one of his fractured emotions, soul fucked his friends to optimize them, become a God to the goblins, turned his own mind in to some kind of overmind that can switch between bodies he constructed. He pretty much turned himself into an eldritch abomination while still carrying the concept of [humanity] and humanoid body.

********* No it doesn't. Until he can beat BANP Harry, he is not the most OP Harry, going by that logic any Harry from any incomplete fic who is more powerful than BANP Harry at a point in the story can do the same. It doesn't work like that. Also BANP Isn't finished...so he still has room to grow, lastly I can't see CT Harry getting to the point of being basically All-powerful. Yes he's powerful, and yes he is difficult to put down, but the point is you can still kill him. BANP Harry is as far as I can tell, unkillable.

********** The "opness" is not measured by strength alone, growth rate is a big factor (probably the biggest factor..). CT's Harry is a monster because of his growth rate which indicates absurd levels of future strength. There is a "sequel" that shows a possible end of the character which would put BaNP at the level of a child. BaNP's Harry is "finished", the character hasn't grow in strength in a very long time and the author has stopped working on it.

There are many stories with powerful characters that can destroy many MCs, but are not considered OP simply because that strength is justified by the passage of time. A 12 years old with the strength of a million years old monster is very different.

*********** No. "Opness" is how overpowered they are, not future strength. How strong they are In their universe is the big marker here, and all things considered BANP's Harry is the most powerful in his universe, apart from the actual omni-everything GOD. Once again this isn't about which one will/could/should be OP, it's about at this current time, who is the most OP Harry, and currently in a match of anything BANP is the most OP in a story setting. CT Harry is creating an island, BANP Harry is killing gods, CT Harry is just beginning to travel the multiverse, BANP can take his otherselves place, and has done so plenty of times. In just about any aspect, sorry, but BANP Harry is currently the most subjectively OP Harry, between these two at least. Chances are there is probably one that trumps mine somewhere.

** Hm I wouldn't know I hate OP harry, or fics where he's not fully human. I hate that entire trope. It would be the same thing as writing this, and here's my full fic

Harry Potter, the sixteen year old boy-who-lived stood in front of Voldemort in the Entrance hall of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He had gone into the mind of the Dark Lord and challenged him. He knew he had powers Voldemort knew not. He was reay. He was all powerful, invincible. So as Voldemort stood mocking him he simply raised his finger and pointed at the snake-like monstronsity in front of him, speaking accusingly, "Tom Riddle you are evil, ignorant, cruel, short-sighted and marked to die. Today you're judgment will be cast upon you." and with that Harry Snapped his fingers and Voldemort and all his followers blew up. Harry and the gang lived happily ever after. The end.

I didn't need 50 chapters to write that story.

*** Everyone's entilted to their own opinion, but I personally can enjoy OP Harry stories if done right, or i'm in the mood for it. Think of it like Superman, on the surface it seems like it would be a boring story, but if that was true he wouldn't currently be one of the most famous characters of all time.

It just needs to be done right, and while there are a lot of bad one's out there including my OP story, you can get ones that are fun, and enjoyable. So while I can see where you're coming from, I would have to sadly disagree with you.

Thanks,

**** Thats okay, we all like different things. It honestly makes sense with your superman scenario (Ironically I hate Superman for the same reason, I am a batman person forever haha).

I don't usually mind if they are like one power, but not too powerful a power, like if Harry, after the death of his godfather, and depressed and blaming himself, threw himself into legilemency (Spelling? I can never spell that) and occlumency, and he defeated voldemort by turning the tables on him and driving him into madness that way, to the point where he was unable to perform in battle and harry killed him then that I could see. I guess for me to enjoy a story it has to be more realistic (As realistic as Harry Potter could be anyway). while others much more like a strong fantasy side of things. So I can get that.

***** I know harry used his connection/horcrux with voldemort to get into his mind, but i think legimency (Spelling?!) would help him navigate his mind and be able to show voldemort scenes of himself dying or whatever etc as well

***** Yeah, but to be honest, in a world of magic, where time-travel is something given to help with school work, realism is subjective.

I'm not even going to try spelling that either. Whenever I write a story, I always refer to it as the mind arts.

Also for me I rather Superman type characters, because it just makes it more enjoyable for me, a type of wish fullfillment character for me, which is also similar for Prototype, and Hellsing.

****** Yes it's kind of like I see the difference as this

People want wish fulfillment and want to live in another world completely where all those things are etc.

Where as people like me who want to make it as realistic as possible, want to make it (In their minds) possible to exist in the world they live in, so they can think it's real or that they could go there etc.

Idk doe that make sense?
