Just coming off a binge of several very dark angsty Fics, so I'm looking for some light-hearted and heartwarming fics.. I love magical worldbuilding, and I'm looking for creativity, uniqueness and originality in particular. I don't want clich√© coffee shop AUs. I'm not a heavy romance reader but I'm willing to give it a go. I love crossovers, and I'm okay with crack as long as it's well written.

A couple of examples of what I'm looking for:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to find them]] by EvansEntranced. After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3397283?view_full_work=true#main][Dragonheart Caravan]] by witch dragon. 5-year-old Harry Potter overhears his aunt complaining to his uncle about the "freaks" camping nearby. Maybe if they are the same type of "freak" he is they will want him?

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4437151/1/][Harry's New Home]] by Kbinz. One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention".

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=ff8ee55d72935ca389a5fae674c913fb60a69257-1611196139-0-AWinB1QXnBGYhS55_YlxziALu_HJkivQylCs2FNYPaiUSlPQQCdYApM5oIMwNmwtxQXrtLpup87LUXtST4K6Zkr6FY6WKIXKRxH6AxTsFw-ET7ivMR2X8IQhzUWJH5ju3Xkop5WRl1tB9_mIYNXymdcK49rCerX9HEKFBhH5432LUdW3VlB05Au9pk389verHfQAcyxZfHuhtEfnq9k1gTg0bS0BvfKCLAG2VxwLH5GjecJeRCCUYuu5qSU4wQmbL4jLgoheirzcKs7KgopLzzb0dpJ0z6f4j_hvSJ6WAkeo-VKGGKyQT6UikKwCh9pT4kI3ZHjjAHJfaFCZuAETYglnX9GpNxCQgwF8bi90OonYRFYYke6t5ZEbAXY_OB14FD3ODFksFf_-ImS_9OXxDK7V7F3t1TNNr3J_LEjudYLF][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] by Northumbrian. The locals in a sleepy corner of the Cheviot Hills are surprised to discover that they have new neighbours. Who are the strangers at Drakeshaugh? When James Potter meets Muggle Henry Charlton, his mother Jacqui befriends the Potters and her life changes.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629][The Problem of Potions]] by Wyste. Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8507725/1/][In Death, Standby]] by shopisme. For the better part of his bizarre early childhood Harry believed himself to be a snake. A rather dreadfully deformed snake, true, but a snake nonetheless.
