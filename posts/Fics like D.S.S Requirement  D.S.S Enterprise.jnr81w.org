So i just read Wizards in Space series by esame in AO3, i instantly fell in love with the writing and the story. So, do you guys know any story similar to this?

linkao3(D.S.S. Requirement)


** I know how you feel man. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find anything that come close to it. So I decided to write my own.

I've been working on an unofficial sequel for a few months now and I've ironed out pretty much everything. First chapter should come out in a week or so. Stay tuned.

** Maybe linkao3(Say a Prayer by Mad_Fairy) ,Linkffn(Invincible) also has a bit of it, but they are all adults trying to escape the apocalypse while dropping dead one at a time, so it loses some of the whimsical fun of just exploring space for the sake of exploring, still a masterpiece in world-building with excellent characters and a much more scientific outlook (so a treat for my sci-fi loving heart) and the author also has a really good writing style.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

** Well, if you mean in terms of writing style, obviously more esama fics are the way to go. He definitely has a knack for very interesting, VERY exposition heavy, stories. Spellist is good, linkao3(5366507), so is Disillusion, by Hermione Granger, linkao3(1149623). Really wish he would go back to more HP fics, hasn't done any in nearly 2 years.

Other than that, if you're thinking space/sci fi wise, other than the ones already linked here (Say a Prayer series, Invincible, Starship Hedwig), the only one I can think of is burnable's Back to the Beginning, linkffn(13586310).

You can always look at crossovers for popular sci fi movies/shows, though those are usually more dimension hops, and typically don't have the same magical spacecraft building/space exploration aspects that I think you're (and certainly I am) looking for.

  The new reality had no wizards or magical nations -- but it had a whole boatload of powerful and occasionally inept sorcerers. Who were usually semi-public and sometimes very popular in social media. How it worked, Harry had no idea.

  Harry finds himself thrust into his four-year old body, after Voldemort killed him in the forest in what would have been his seventh year. Knowing what he did, he decided to fix some things he never had a chance to before. He'd not go into the magical world untrained this time. OP Harry. Science, magic and discovery. Harem.
