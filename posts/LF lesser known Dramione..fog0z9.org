I'm a sucker for this pairing and I feel like I've read most of the well known ones. I've been reading like crazy since this quarantine started. I'd like something more on the fluffy side than the super angsty side, but I'll take whatever comes my way.


** You may have more luck at [[/r/Dramione][r/Dramione]]. There was a recent post re: quarantine reading which had a good variety of recs. Outside of that, I'd recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6596946/writerspassion18][writerspassion18]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/niffizzle/pseuds/niffizzle][niffizzle]]. They've both got a large variety and lean towards the fluffier side. There's also:

*** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14196345][*/The Breaking of Draco Malfoy/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/akorah/pseuds/akorah][/akorah/]]

  After the war, Draco Malfoy finds himself abandoned by his parents and hunted by the Ministry. With the help of Blaise Zabini he flees to France, expecting to find refuge. He didn't expect to have a roommate and he certainly didn't expect to come face-to-face with his disintegrating beliefs about the world beyond magic.Meanwhile, Hermione Granger returns to Hogwarts with one objective in mind: figuring out how to break her parents' Memory Charm. The task proves challenging as life begins to throw homework, boys, and Slytherins her way.This is the first story in a trilogy. Violence warning exists for Chapter 23 only (panic attack/self-harm).

  After the war Draco and Hermione were among the few seventh year students to accept McGonagall's invitation to return to Hogwarts. An unexpected bond was formed between former enemies over a few chance collaborations in Potions class and secret nighttime Patronus lessons. Seven years later a compliance visit brings Hermione back to Malfoy Manor and old memories resurface.

  Draco Malfoy storms past Hermione before she has a chance to turn him out on his ear. He's cold and damp and furious. His mother is dead and his father in prison. He's turning to a Mudblood for help. His hair is frizzing. It cannot get any worse than this.Getting drunk on muggle alcohol, and kissing Granger in her mother's front room is so very different to what he had ever known of sex and romance and growing-up, but not entirely unwelcome.

  Hermione Granger agrees to go undercover to Voldemort Inc. as one of their unskilled grunts to get to the Wiltshire Space Station and look for proof of the company's malfeasance. When she manipulates her way into teaching the Station Executive's son, Draco Malfoy, how to survive planetside, she learns more than she bargained for. Non-Magical SFF AU. ABANDONED.

  He grabbed her wrist with his left hand and pinned it above her head, pressing their forearms together, Dark Mark against Mudblood scar. Death Eater against Muggle-born. "The war left scars on both of us that we didn't ask for. But you still flinch when you see mine. And what's why I will never deserve to have you." Slow-burn Dramione. Canon compliant. EWE.
