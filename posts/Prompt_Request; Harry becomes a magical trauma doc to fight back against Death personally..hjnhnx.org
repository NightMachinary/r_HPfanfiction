Harry quickly examined his newest trauma patient. As he barked orders to the nurses, he could sense Death trying to enter the trauma ward, his long, skeletal fingers itching to steal his patient right out from under the experienced medical team. Harry growled at him. "Not in my ward, you won't, you pathetic bastard!".


** "What is Dr. Potter doing?"

"Fighting Death!"

"With... With his bare hands?"

*** Use Death's avatars (Reapers) as renewable resource? Why not just taint groundwater with EOL and/or Panacea?

** This is pretty much the opposite of canon Harry's attitude toward Death. Although canon Harry obviously isn't opposed to trying to save other peoples' lives- he's just willing (in the end) to accept his own death, and won't use dark magic to overcome death. I could see it, though, in a Harry who just finally got sick of losing people.

*** Whoa, whoa, whoa, where did the Dark Arts come into this conversation?

Also, Harry is perfectly willing to die for a cause, but that doesn't mean he'd be as able accept other people's deaths.
