Hey I'm looking for stories that contain sci-fi elements. For example Harry building spaceship with magic or some such things. OR maybe Mass Effect or Star Wars crossovers? If anyone has any recommendation I would gladly accept it.

Thank you.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock][Culture Shock by Ruskbyte]].

It's a Harry got picked up by a distant alien society from the Dursleys' doorsteps story.

*** Fucking thank you! I was going down the list wondering why the hell no one had mentioned CS.

Shame it never got finished though, this fanfic actually introduced me to the Culture series, as shamefaced as I am to admit.

*** X10,000 Culture Shock is AMAZING. I really, REALLY wish it wasn't abandoned. It's one of those that made me literally cry when I got to the end and realized...there was nothing else...

** Two come to mind by nonjon:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]], his crossover with Firefly. 300k+ words, complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7395979/1/Whatever-Happened-to-the-Likely-Lad][Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad]], 20k words, complete.

Edit: Also, one by Larry Huss:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5463888/1/Out-of-the-West][Out of the West]], 200k+ words, complete. A HP crossover with a science fiction world of his own invention.

** Lets see what I've got kicking about...

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10006313/1/Ascension][Ascension]] is pretty good even if the end did leave me a little frustrated. HP/Mass Effect.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10552630/1/Harry-s-Trek][Harry's Trek]] is also a nice read, bit short and not a great deal happens but it's done well enough that I've reread it.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9068231/1/Last-Second-Savior][Last Second Saviour]] is a nice HP/SW cross. Stops just as it gets to the story annoyingly but I'm reliably informed it's not abandoned. Just hit a bit of a wall.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10016768/1/Discordant][Discordant]] is a nice change of pace. HP/SW with a bounty hunter Harry. Pretty sure it's abandoned.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8259020/1/The-Potter-of-the-Ages][The Potter of Ages]]. I'll be honest I can't remember what happens in here. It was on my favourites list though so I probably read to the end.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5364469/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Next-Great-Adventure][Harry Potter and the Next Great Adventure]], well, depending on if you count SG:SG1 as proper sci-fi. Very lovey dovey if I remember correctly.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][The Havoc side of the Force]] is the best SW crossover that I've read. Plenty of humor and action.

** There is a series of HP/Stargate crossovers featuring Hermione by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1866585/Vedra42][Vedra42]] that I enjoyed. Not much actual magic in these, though.

** Unfinished, probably abandoned, but I recall liking this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2994996/1/Fighting-the-Gods][Fighting the Gods]]. Crossover with Stargate SG-1, Harry takes in a crash-landed OC Tok'ra.

Amusing oneshot crossover with SG-1: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4818454/1/Of-Veils-Gates-and-Magic][Of Veils, Gates and Magic]].

** archiveofourown.org/series/218294 - part one is completed in a series. Says it is a stargate xover. Set in 5th year. I found it pretty fun.

Summary: The Dumbledore's Army use the Room of the Requirement to get themselves a spaceship.

(Knowledge about Stargate is not necessary to read this story)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3951749/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Quantum-Leap][Harry Potter And the Quantum Leap]] isn't perfect and the story hasn't been updated in a long time, but it does feature Harry spending an enormous amount of time constructing a machine with the aid of magic that functions in as a type of transportation device. It may not have enough sci-fi elements to suit your description, but I felt it /might/ merit your attention.

It's not a particularly serious story. Just Harry being a badass and [[/spoiler][stabbing Reapers with the Sword of Gryffindor]] and stuff.

*** I've read that. I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand it is one of the "better" completed ME/HP crossover, on the other hand it's mainly hand waving and deus ex one after another.
