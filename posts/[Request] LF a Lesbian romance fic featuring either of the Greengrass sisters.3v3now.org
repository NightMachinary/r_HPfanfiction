  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG

The only thing that comes to mind is Bound With Silver Threads, which has the paring of Lily Luna Potter and Cassiopeia Malfoy. Cassiopeia is an OC, sister of Scorpius and, here's the thing that makes it somewhat related to your request, Astoria Greengrass's daughter.

I can't say I've ever heard of one with either of the Greengrass girls as part of the pairing but it sound like something I'd read.

  Lily Luna Potter years 3-7. Why is she stuck with a Little Malfoy tag-along? What do the coming years hold for them and everyone else? How will they change and grow, what will happen as they do, & who will end up with whom? Eventual femslash. Multiple pairings. Lily/OC. Also stars Scorpius Malfoy's OC little sister. Not T until Chap 29, really not until Chap 32 & nothing too major.
