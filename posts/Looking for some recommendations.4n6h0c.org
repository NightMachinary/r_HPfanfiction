Guys.. Im going to be honest, i just reread marauder's plan, and I felt it lacked action. So ive decided. If you all could recommend the best action based harry potter fanfics out there that would be great. Now, some guidelines. 100k+ words, on ffnet (so i can download them to my phone), and preferably a harry thst isnt a bitch about killing things/people that are attempting to kill him. Thanks in advance!

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
