:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A while back I read this really good fanfic about Harry coming across an elven mother and her baby (I can't remember how old harry was but i'm sure he was in Hogwarts at the time), The mother was in a pretty bad shape and didn't have much time left to live, she gave her daughter to Harry to raise and care for in her stead. The mother then dies peacefully and the baby is then left in Harry's care.

It's mentioned that the baby is the Granddaughter of a King and Queen far away, also Harry either comes into his creature inheritance(?) and becomes a elf as well, or his guardianship over the Baby princess triggers this transformation (Can't really remember). A fact about these elves is that their status can be presented through earrings (Studs and Loops), I believe it's studs for commoner and studs and hoops for royalty/nobility (Harry has studs and hoops). Funnily enough, Draco is one of these elves, as well as other students in the school, and Harry's status comes as a shock for them (Note: Harry continues his life in Hogwarts straight after 'adopting' the baby, and the baby is allowed to stay in Hogwarts with him, No training montages before school starts up again or any disappearances on Harry's part)

I may have just remembered it wrong and there is a chance that they aren't elves but something else? Harry did have long hair and pointed ears though; It's been years since I've read this and I haven't been able to find it. Help would be greatly appreciated! :)

**** I'm rereading it because I liked it that much and if memory serves, I think there's a sequel and that's what was unfinished, but that was many years ago and they may have picked it back up
