This is one of my favourites tropes, so I'd love to see any fics where Harry is either raised by Remus and Sirius or comes to live with them at some point during his Hogwarts education. No Sirius dying please I cannot handle it emotionally. Thanks!


** How emotional can you go?

The best one I've read is linkao3(The Art of Getting By by Sarewolf). It's angsty as hell but so wonderfully written. Excellent Remus.

Linkao3(The Dogfather) is really sweet. Lots of Sirius.

Linkao3(Stealing Harry) is also a great fic.

Sirius lives in all of them. But warning for NSFW content, especially in Stealing Harry and TAoGB... I don't remember the Dogfather but sure, I'll warn that one too just in case üòã

*** I've read the Dogfather and loved it, and I'll read Stealing Harry right away. I'll have to brace myself for The Art of Getting By but it looks like it'll be a fantastic fic. Thanks!

  ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do?‚Äù Remus says, tiredly. All he wants is to curl up on his bed. Smoke a pack of cigarettes. Get drunk. He can't stop looking at Harry. ‚ÄúRemus...‚Äù Dumbledore is gentle. Remus hates when he has that tone. Hates that he knows it will hurt. ‚ÄúThere is no one else left.‚Äù A bitter laugh escapes him. ‚ÄúSo you'll curse the poor thing with a werewolf for a guardian?‚Äù

  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.

** It isn't focused on raising Harry, but a part of it.

The characters are so well done. It is angsty first, but the fluff will come.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1449436][Building Family]] - Sirius doesn't chase after Pettigrew - follows through year 5 of Hogwarts.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5262110/chapters/12142076][In Like a Lion]] - another Sirius doesn't chase Pettigrew fic

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24528796][Professors Lupin & Black]] super short but I loved it.

Most of the ones I have that are raising Harry centered, are either just Sirius or Remus. And then the other joins in later. If your interested in anything like that, let me know. I have a Google spreadsheet that I've been using to organize the fics that I've read and would be more than happy to share that.

Also [[https://wolfstarlibrarian.tumblr.com/][Wolfstar Librarian]] is also a good source üòä

** I realise I have mixed up the stories. Wokf wolf is a very lovely wolfstar, but they story takes place after Hogwarts.

However the one I wanted to recommend is: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants series]]

There are four books in total, the last one of a long read, but they are totally worth it. It fulfilled your requirements and it is quite a lovely universe and a different take on magic :)
