Any good stories out there that touch on the subject how evil and messed up Obliviation is? Preferably from non-magical point of view.

Something similar to linkffn(7108864)


** Yes, yes it is.

Like the wizarding economy and love potions, HP universe has a few concepts not.. entirely thought out, good fodder for fics though.

I kinda liked the Natural 20's take on it (it was a side thing, but the Muggle Policewoman dealing with Oblivion is a neat angle).

I would think that Muggleborn Parents, after figuring out there is a secret world and they do this to protect their secret, would immediately find ways to give themselves insurance. Messages to themselves, notes with Lawyers. I mean, If you found out that there was a magical world that you have no input in, that mindblasts people to keep their secret, and who could one day come to take your 11 year old away and you would not be able to do anything about it, you think those parents would do nothing?

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.
