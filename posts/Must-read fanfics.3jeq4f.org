Hello! I recently discovered a world of fanfics, I've read only 1 in my native language so far, but I can't wait to read more. What are, in your opinion, must-read fanfics? The best of best, tales which are essential to call myself a real HP fan :)

** You're smart to come here instead of wading through garbage the first few months like most of us did. Wish I had done that.

Anyway, here's a list you can't really go wrong with.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/]]

DLP doesn't hand out 5/4 star ratings easily so you can generally depend on them being well written and enjoyable. Hell, even the 3 star stuff is head and shoulders above 90% of fanfiction.

I've also been using [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]] and sorting according DLP ratings to see quality fics I've missed over the years.

A bit of a conflict of interest in your thought: the best of the best will deceive you about the nature of fanfic. To be a real fanfic fan, you must suffer through the same incomprehensible yet popular stories that cause so many to come here, belly up to the bar and share their tale of woe...

"It was reeeeally interesting, I was starting to identify with the characters and sink into the story and then... the main character kisses Snape! In what world--?"

*** I was about to post something like this. I agree, and not just because of that. When one starts on fanfiction, he is not yet prejudiced by the so-called cliches, bashing and whatnot, and therefore would enjoy stories he might not want to even look at if he followed the 'best of best' list straight away.

OP, you should definitely take the time to look through the stories on your own as well. I know I definitely found a lot of fics that were enjoyable to me back then, but I would not dare link here. I guess what I am saying is that you are going to miss out on a lot of fun stuff if you go straight for the deep waters.

And that is why I will not link any of the popular stories that are always suggested anyway, but rather the first story I ever came across a couple of years ago. Is it good or is it bad by today's standards? The answer is I don't know. But back then, as a first read, it was very enjoyable to go through. (Warning: it is not finished. )

**** I absolutely agree. As an avid fan fic reader for 10 years now (new to reddit oddly enough) there is almost a rite of passage to this. If you jump into the best of the best, you become jaded and cynical too quickly. I remember reading a fanfic where the characters just emailed each other and txtd each othr lik this. and I remember when Bungle in the Jungle finished up. OP should experience the breadth of what fanfiction has to offer, the good, the bad, and the downright hideous. What I would consider to be terrible or cliche filled now, were still new and fascinating back then.

  Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy

This one felt to me like an MRA's view of the world overlaid on the Harry Potter universe with Harry turned into the Hero that will Defeat the Terrible Matriarchy and Save the Poor Men. I'd skip it -- and certainly not include it on a Must Read list.

  Forging the Sword

This book started with mercy killing a damsel in distress. I dropped it after that. That was about three pages in. I'm vaguely curious if it got better, but I'm not going to finish it.

***** Okay, so it's the confluence of three overused tropes that I can't stand individually, and that's the entire basis of the story: fridging, damsel in distress, and mercy killing.

If you introduced a story that was based on an evil Dumbledore, Lord Harry Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw, and heavy slash, and I didn't want to read it because I don't like slash and are tired of evil Dumbledore and Harry being Lord Everything, you wouldn't push me to read it.

But suddenly, when the tropes are largely sexist in nature, you press me to read it.

That's...odd, to say the least.

****** I'm pushing you to read it because it's an amazing story, and I feel like you gave up on it based on a premise that isn't really related to the main content - rereading this is unclear, so I apologize. I'm kinda confused where you got my latent sexism out of, so let's unpack that, shall we?

Damsel-in-distress is entirely canon, and besides doesn't exactly figure, as it basically starts with her death.

Fridging is a term I hadn't encountered before, but I'll concede its presence - though it's kinda different because it's more a plot device for the entire cast to spin off in a different manner and direction from canon.

Mercy killing isn't really there, tbh, as it's more about the fact that Riddle can't be stopped without killing her, so it's more about sacrifice than that.

I'd contend the difference between these and, say, Evil Dumbledore or Lord titles is that they a) aren't heavily featured, and b) they aren't inherently bad, it is the execution that leads them in unsavory directions.

Anyway, might I recommend starting with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/3/Forging-the-Sword][chapter 3]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/4/Forging-the-Sword][4]]? I mean, it's up to you, but those tropes are basically ignored from thereon in.

**** What does MRA have to do with anything? Beyond the fact that you use the term like a slur, since when does someone writing a story with bad women mean they think all women are oppressors or vice versa? I've written about slaves and goat sex does that mean I own slaves and fuck goats? Or that either of those things in any way reflect reality? Author have bad men keeping the poor women down in ridiculous fashion all the time, does that automatically mean they believe every woman is automatically disenfranchised? Does that story mean the reality is the same?

I absolutely can't stand people that can sit there and say feminism is about equality and then immediately demonize men who gather to talk about legitimate gender issues. Yeah there are a lot of irrational and obnoxious morons who use the MRA label but guess what, the same can be said of feminism. Both sides have legitimate issues and the fact that on both sides people like to downplay and ignore each others problems is what turns it from a discussion of justice to personal attacks on labels.

I didn't say anything about the author's views on the subject. I said what it felt like to me. And it reminds me with every page of a segment of society that has terrible views on its preferred gender dynamics and, in my experience, tries to derail conversations about women's issues by pointing out men's issues and rarely brings up those issues on its own. These people typically call themselves MRAs. I haven't found people calling themselves MRAs who do anything worthwhile for gender equality, like trying to reduce toxic masculinity, or fighting rape culture.

** Match by Mental. It was taken off harrypotterfanfiction.com but someone posted it on fanfiction.net. It is Sirius/OC, a smidge of Remus/OC, James/Lily. Absolutely the most hilarious fanfiction I have ever read. The humor is excessive (in a good way) and spot on. May arguably be /the/ funniest work I have ever read, actually. The catch...the author never finished the story. Some forty odd chapters later you're left at the worst bloody cliffhanger the story throws at you...but honestly worth it.

I think I'm going to read it again now...

Other than Match, I also liked Anya Violetta's "Anna Jones' Diary" (by the penname MrsAnnaJones I think?). Also Sirius/OC, also pretty funny.

Violetta's other fanfic, "The Good Morrow", is a dark drama/romance (probably the only purely romance fanfic I liked heheh) has a nice plot if you have the time. Iirc, there's a prequel and a sequel too if you end up liking her style, and with an interesting set of characters (OCs mainly, and Alphard, Sirius's uncle).
