  Harry and Gabby fluff. One-shot. Rating for implied content.

** I think one of the definitive stories with this pairing is by Jeconais, but I don't think it can be recommended here because Gabrielle is 16 or 17 during the story? Google will get you there.

**** I don't quite understand the policy, or don't understand how it is applied. There was a story recently that was decided couldn't be recommended here, but I couldn't remember anything too 'bad' in it. I remember a couple of moments in Hope that were more 'serious' (but maybe I'm just remembering incorrectly.)

***** For Reddit rules:

A good rule of thumb is, anything that would earn an R rating for a movie is banned. Hope would barely be PG-13, and then only for what's implied.

****** I asked the mods because the Reddit policy on itself bans everything where minors have a sexuality. So even a T rated seventh year story would fall under that.

Rule 5 is only applied to explicit content on this sub.

******* I'll just assume that while direct links aren't okay, discussing fics or mentioning the titles is fine.

Otherwise reddit would have to ban any mention of Game of Thrones, which has underage rape scene in it and worse. (Of course, banning a normie TV show would be a lot harder to justify to users than banning something niche like HP fanfiction.)

******** So, under these rules what age counts as the boundry? Because here in the UK the age of consent is 16 where it is 18 or 20 elsewhere. Also, the age of majority is 18 here but teenagers have a fair bit of decision making power and legal independence at 16. Does reddit just blanket everything with American rules?

********* Yes, because it's hosted in the US. I'm actually OK with that, but I really want the rules to be unambiguous and applied consistently. Like I said, I could see people being OK with censoring things which have poor reputation like fanfiction but not mainstream media.

******* I'm honestly a little reluctant to even recommend Hope, or some of Jeconais's other stuff, because some folks on this Sub treat it like it's morally reprehensible. I once was in a discussion where someone thought it was less agresious for a time traveling Harry to be grooming a harem of 3rd and 4th year girls, than Jeconais's stories.

Didn't know if that was the general consensus about Jeconais on this sub, but I think his stuff is some of the best out there.
