I'm always reading stories where Harry get's sent to another world by chance, magical backlash, accidental magic, fate, etc... sometimes he even comes back(usually by the GOF), but i've yet to read a story where Harry was powerful enough, and skilled enough to decide to go on his own. I'd love those stories, hell he could even come back later to an AU, because of the GOF. As long as he can traverse the worlds of his own violation is my only request.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Harry Potter's most excellent adventure linkffn(11619134)

Does it count if Harry decides to go back after he returns to Earth? Harry is captured along with SG-1 by some Jaffa. After he escapes, Harry decides space is cool. He steals the Al'kesh SG-1 had commandeered and cruises the galaxy. A Fidelius charm is better than any cloaking shield, and expansion charms make the troop transport huge on the inside.

  Harry Potter simply wanted to take a break from being everyone's Hero. Who'd have thought that being kidnapped by Jaffa out of some lousy Diner would do the trick? Poor SG1. They have no idea how far down the rabbit hole goes. Harry Potter/Stargate Crossover, eventual AU (COMPLETE, if you can believe it!)

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  Two alcoholic men decide to jump through the Veil. This takes them back to August 1st, 1993. They don't have much to lose, anyway - the only thing left to do is to go around and piss everyone off, true Marauder fashion. So they do exactly that.

  (Loose) sequel to Through the Veil. Harry, Ron, Fleur and Katie travel to Middle-Earth as part of their interdimensional apparition experiment. The four pseudo-immortals tend to procrastinate a lot. Just like Gandalf and the Elves, really.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5751435/1/Stories-of-the-Lone-Traveler][Stories of the *Lone* *Traveler*]] he gets accidented into other worlds but as the story progresses he figures out the requirements to hop to the next world so he can kinda control when he goes away. Even more into the story he figures out dimensional portals so he can pretty much go to places he's already visited
