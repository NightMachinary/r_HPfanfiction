I had an Idea about a Harry Potter fanfiction, and I wonder if something like that already exists. It may sound oddly specific, but please humor me with this:

Well, it starts pretty obviously und typically: A warharded, resourceful and older Harry findes or creates a ritual that sends his spirit back in time. He does this and finds himself reduced to some kind of wraith, very much like that, what voldemord became once. He is bound to the area his younger counterpart and his aunt are living in, because thier blood binds him to the world. So he tries to convince both of them to help him to "restore" his body, with bones of his father, flesh of an ally (servent sounds wrong for this situation) and blood of an enemy.

Does this ring any bells? No? Well, be free to use it then.

I'm not a native speaker, in case my ductus seems odd.


** So.... a nose-less Harry?

*** I always thought Voldemort became noseless because of his constant possessions of Snakes, it eventually morphed his wraith to look as it did in Philosopher's.

**** That is a possibility. It also can be the result of the fluid inside the cauldron, which contents are unknowen to us. It could contain Naginis poison. This again was used to strengthen Voldemorts temporary body. There could be a connection to Nagini being a Horcrux of Voldemort and so a product of the Horcruxes body can be used for rebuild some of the old bodily essence.

*** Well, that could be funny, but then again i'm not sure that the mechanic of this ritual/potion was actually this clear. So the noselessness is a possibility, in case you what to create a stroy with some crack-elements.
