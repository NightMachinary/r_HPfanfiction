** Nah, fanon. We know extremely little of the Longbottom parents, never mind what fanfiction would have you believe. It is equally fanonical to propose that Alice and Lily were friends at Hogwarts; we don't even have hard evidence that Alice even /attended/ Hogwarts. And the Longbottoms were probably somewhat older than the Marauders.

(In such case, the Wiki's a useful resource, by the way.)

** I've seen Brown too, and I read something recently where apparently the author forgot they were still in school and not married yet and kept referring to her as longbottom.

**** Yeah, but the author alternated between whatever maiden name she'd chose (I think it was fortescue) and then 2 paragraphs later, it was longbottom and then Fortescue again

**** There's fic where the character is obsessed with ice cream, so you could have both.

*** Dan and Emma are canon in a lot of people's minds. I personally headcanon them as being Herman and Alision Granger.

**** They're Jake and Miranda in my head, from Vox Corporis, but I still think it's bizarre that we have to have Fanon names. (Miranda is a main character in The Tempest, and it makes more sense for only of her parents' families to have a tradition of Shakespeare names)

I like Dan and Emma just fine. I don't think I've ever seen Ian and Michelle, but those seem like a smart idea, since those are the names of the actors who portray them in Deathly Hallows.

It's especially galling we still don't have names for her parents considering all the post-canon pottermore stuff.

** I could have sworn I saw it in like one of JK Rowling's interviews or Pottermore that it was Fortescue. But now that I'm searching for it I can't find the source.

*** Yeah, after the redesign, pottermore became a disaster to look trough. Maybe try the Pottermore wiki? Not sure if it copied everything, but there's a possibility that they might have.

EDIT: did a quick look.Seems like nothings there.
