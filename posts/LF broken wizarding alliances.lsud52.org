So i recently read a fic where Harry realises there are houses allied to house Potter, and several of his classmates belong to those houses. Unfortunately Harry desides to forgive everyone.

So i want fics where Harry break whatever ancient alliances other houses has had with house Potter, after they have ignored him/bullied him at hogwarts.

Thanks in advance :D


** Hmm, I haven't heard of many of those. Can you link the fic that you read please? x

  Harry is found Guilty at his trial at the start of what would have been his 5th year at Hogwarts. As a result he is exiled from Great Britain. Possibly the wrong move on their part. One Shot at this time

** Oh, I've read at least one of those. I remember one in which Amelia Bones berates Susan for being hostile to Harry during the Tournament, because he breaks the alliance they had. I'll have to see if I can come up with a link.
