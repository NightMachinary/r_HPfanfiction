Years ago read a story that involved Harry getting transported to another dimension. With that 1 or 2 more people he was not aware of ended up coming with him. One of them being Remus. Anyway his parents are alive and he has a sister. Things go to hell and in the end himself Remus and his sister get transported back to the universe he is from. Any ideas of who which fic this was?

  Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH.
