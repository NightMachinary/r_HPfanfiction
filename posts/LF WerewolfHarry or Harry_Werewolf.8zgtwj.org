I think this would be interesting, particularly Harry/Werewolf.

Only thing I've read that fits at all is linkffn(12642061) which was okay. Similar fics would be interesting- particularly the bonding part, that was neat. I'm also up for straight up werewolf fics, though. Without all the chimera-hybrid business.

  After a brutal attack the summer before his third year, Harry discovers much about his family and his place in the world. The only question is whether he will get to choose that place or not.

  On October 31, 1981 two pivotal events changed Harry Potter's life forever. NOTE: Some liberties have been taken with the werewolf aspect in the HP universe. I've changed it a bit to better suit the story I want to write. And, yes, I use some werewolf cliches. The sequel Unity in Diversity has begun to be posted.

*** I wanna read that, but I also really dislike Ginny. Might give it a go anyways.

Thanks for the rec, anyways! Even if I don't read it, maybe someone else will stumble on this thread and read it.

**** Really different Ginny from usual. They also get away from Hogwarts so there's some new things in it. This was, after Yellow Submarine, my favourite Harry/Ginny fanfic. It also made me fall in love with Imagine Dragons, curiously enough.

It's way too late for me. I've been a huge fan forever now.

I will definitely give it a try now, though.

linkffn(7471751)

Only about halfway through but it's pretty good so far.
