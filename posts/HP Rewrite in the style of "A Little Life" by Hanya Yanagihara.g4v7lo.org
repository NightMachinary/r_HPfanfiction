I'm not trolling I swear. I need a long tear jerker read that's some how life affirming? Obviously I don't mean add a bunch of sexual abuse like Yanagihara's novel. What I love about ALL is that the only solace in the book is friendship. I'd love a gloomier Harry Potter but with powerful friendship, and in depth description of the everyday world. I'd love to read HP written as an adult literary novel


** I could write it myself but...I'm lazy
