Any help would be appreciated! I never finished reading it and would love to start it again. Also if you have any other Drarry suggestions ... I wouldn't be upset :3


** Are you thinking of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Turn]]? In this one they are living together with Frank the snake.

** The only fic I could find that sounded somewhat similar to what you're looking for is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5428438/1/Bleeding-Dragon][Bleeding Dragon]], but they're still in school so I'm guessing it's not the right one. Just thought I'd list it anyway, in case you're interested. I haven't read it (yet) so I can't speak to its quality.

As for other Drarry suggestions: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5400451/1/A-Sound-Like-Serpents-Singing][A Sound Like Serpents Singing]] as well as pretty much any other Harry/Draco story written by that author is quite well done. Also check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264616/1/To-Be-Back-Again-in-the-Rest-of-the-Room][To Be Back Again in the Rest of the Room]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10336891/1/Whatever-Happened-to-the-Boy-that-I-Once-Knew][Whatever Happened to the Boy I Once Knew]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720829/1/That-Missing-Something][That Missing Something]].
