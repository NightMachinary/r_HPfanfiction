:END:
I have been reading fan fiction for a number of years and have read load of stuff on fanfiction.net cause of the app on my phone. I read that AO3 has loads of better stories so I am prepared to receive recommendations. To help guide you here are my preferences;

Long focus, 80k+ Completed is preferred, I have been burned before, or at least regularly updated No slash, at least not as the main story Preferably darker stories Crossovers ok, I like star wars, game of thrones, ATLA Preferred characters, HP, Voldemort, Hermione, Snape, Fred and George I love world building

Please feel free to make recommendations and I will give them a read.

Thanks in advance


** I asked pretty much the same question a year ago, resulting in a thread with 94 comments. Taking a look there should point you towards a good number of good fics on ao3:

** - I don't know if you know [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] from FFnet (start with “Tales of the Battle” and then go on).

- My first long story I have read, which persuaded me that amateur writing could be worth reading was “Inner Demons by serendipity_50” linkao3(601124).

- Later I found stories by mzzbee starting with “Petunia's Letter” linkao3(11676102), but that's rather fringe story, I am afraid, but I liked it very much.

- Also, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][series]] “Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly” with very unorthodox next generation (and very unusual Harry).

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** This book is one of my all times favorites, there's some slash towards the end but it's not explicit there's no smut, it's kind of a cliche with Severus being his dad and all but I really liked it. Each chapter is pretty long it takes me between 30mins to hour to read each chapter.

Title:** blood *Rating:* M *Author:* the_lord_of_chaos *Characters: ** Harry Potter, draco malfoy, Voldemort, fumbled or, Severus, the Dursley's, hermione and Ron */Relationships: */ draco/Harry, hermione/ron, Ron/Harry (one sided, Harry has a bug crush on Ron) Severus/lily */Warnings: */ (if applicable) Internalized homophobia, gore, ptsd, werewolves (towards the end Harry becomes a werewolf) */Summary: */ Summary: “Harry's sent reeling when he learns that Professor Snape is his bio dad, and if that were all he had to deal with, he'd probably be all right, but he's got werewolves, escaped convicts, a stubborn Dark Lord, and his own inner demons to deal with. Starts third year. Rating mostly for violence. Story deals with mental health, bigotry and child abuse.
