** I don't know about this one. Usually fics with tags like (Child abuse, Suicide, sexual assault, and rape) are gonna be a huge negative, that will most likely make me feel worse after reading it. What use is magic if it can't even stop these atrocities

*** Not that I want to read it, magic is likely to make it much more common, especially with how little forensic style magic that has been shown.
