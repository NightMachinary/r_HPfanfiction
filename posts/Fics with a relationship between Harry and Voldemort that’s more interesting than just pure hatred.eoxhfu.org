To be clear, I do not mean any type of romantic pairing here nor necessarily even a friendship. Just a more dynamic, interesting relationship portrayed that has them talk in some way about this, that or the other. Anybody know anything?

** linkffn(Elsewhere but not Elsewhen) has Voldemort be a lot calmer towards Harry since he sent him on a one way journey to an AU via thestral. They still have a mental connection, but since Voldemort interprets the prophecy as "either must die at the hand of the other" as "If we don't kill each other, we live forever," Voldemort is much more relaxed towards Harry, since he's convinced he's now immortal.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Problem with Potions has them converse with each other, and have a sort of dark comic friendship. One of the few that's not a Romance. Lily and the Art Of Being Sisyphus also has some good fem Harry/Horcrux Voldemort dialogue, but that does become a romance.

** linkffn(12021325). Antithesis is kinda like this. Harry (or Adrian) has a really difficult relationship with Voldemort. He is adopted by Voldemort, and is “raised” by Bellatrix and other death eaters. He has a really fucked up childhood and is pretty unstable (mentally). He's incredibly conflicted about Voldemort and tried really hard to impress him. It's such an incredible fic, definitely one of my favorites. Linkao3(32915175) Ouroboros has Voldemort kinda protecting Harry from a young age and he becomes sort of a father figure. If you're ok with Tomarry, EclipseWing (on AO3) writes incredible fics. They always have such interesting relationships. Linkao3(15873207) has Harry suffering from Stockholm syndrome after being kidnapped by Riddle. Linkao3(17541269) Has a really cool premise where many wizard have been reborn/reincarnated as mutants (similar to x-men). Harry and Tom escape from a mutant rehabilitation facility together. Sounds strange but it's really good.

** Well, Limpieza de Sangre has already been recommended (which is absolutely amazing), so I'll fall back on some of my other recommendations.

linkao3(3136634) /grandloves/ is a fem!Harry/Voldemort fic. He realises that Harry is his horcrux in the graveyard, and takes her under his wing.

!linkao3(12983913) /Triple Trouble/ is a fic where a Dark Lord Harry from the future travels back in time, bringing the killed Voldemort and Grindelwald with him. All three are attending Hogwarts together, and Tom hates how friendly Harry keeps trying to be with him. It's hilarious.

linkffn(11358664) /Warning Signs Read Desolation/ is an abandoned but very good mentor!Voldemort fic.

linkffn(12492170) /Devil Take the Hindmost/ is another abandoned fic. Harry was able to mentally communicate with Voldemort from the moment that their connection was formed, so she's very affected by him. She even helps him get his body back far earlier than in canon and considers him to be her best friend. the fic technically pairs them, but it never got to that point in the story before it was abandoned.
