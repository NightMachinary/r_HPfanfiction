A large portion of the people killed in both Voldemort wars were pureblood both Death Eaters and in the Order or the ministry, entire century old families wiped out.

There were a lot of muggleborns killed too but since most muggles didn't even notice that something was happening the war didn't affect muggleborn births.

So if the birthrate of purebloods was reduced without that of muggleborns being affected it probably increased the percentage of muggleborns in the coming decades.

In Harry's year at hogwarts the muggleborn percentage was probably considerably higher than average.


** I would argue that it might have increased the proportion of muggleborns to purebloods without actually helping the muggleborns.

***** No, pro-muggleborn purebloods joined the Aurora and OotP, and many died. Anti-muggleborn purebloods joined Voldemort, and in a lot of cases were imprisoned or talked their way out, along with the Order being generally against killing. I believe their was a higher mortality rate among the good guys, which would have left more on the bad side left to make decisions.

** Last night I read an estimate based on Rowlings classlist for Harry's year that put it at: 40% Purebloods and 40% Half-bloods with 20% Muggle Born.

For this to hold true it should've been 50% Pureblood and 10% Muggleborn before the war. Unfortunately 1 school year is really too low a sample to say anything definitive about it.

Though as you say, the purebloods being killed directly affect the birth rate of purebloods, whereas muggleborn being killed would barely, if at all, affect the birthrate of muggleborn.

***** Interesting. I still think that 40-40-20 ratio, even if it applies for one year of Hogwarts' student intake, is still unrealistic to apply to the wizarding world as a whole. Just as unrealistic as there being 40 students split evenly by house and gender: works for the purposes of telling a story, but doesn't really sound like believable worldbuilding.

  "The pure-blood families are all interrelated," said Sirius. "If you're only going to let your sons and daughters marry pure-bloods your choice is very limited; there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are cousins by marriage and Arthur's something like my second cousin once removed."

More evidence on purebloods being rare:

#+begin_quote
  "The Death Eaters can't all be pure-blood, *there aren't enough pure-blood wizards left,*" said Hermione stubbornly. "I expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It's only Muggle-borns they hate, they'd be quite happy to let you and Ron join up."

  "Silence," said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy's wand, and Charity fell silent as if gagged. "Not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of wizarding children, last week Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defence of Mudbloods in the Daily Prophet. Wizards, she says, must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic. *The dwindling of the pure-bloods is*, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable circumstance ... she would have us all mate with Muggles ... or, no doubt, werewolves ..."

****** I just have to ask. What makes you think that Sirius or Hermione or Ron would be knowledgeable about every family tree in Wizarding Britain to such a degree that they can know who is or isn't a half-blood? Sirius probably knows a bit, but as he seemed to distance himself from his family and purebloods from as early as he could, I doubt he has a lot of knowledge in that area.

And then to take Burbage: Dwindling can be slow it can be fast. Most countries today have a dwindling population. anything less than 2 births per couple. To again take our low sample size of canon characters. We have 1 family of more than 2 children. 2 families with more than 1 child. As far as we know at least. But again, it's pathetically low to pull any full data from. But speaking from my own middle school class, I know that most of them had atleast 1 sibling. And a good few of them had 2 and some had 3.

So I think we can say that if W-B is dwindling in purebloods, well it has to do with them not having children. Now is that the only issue with them, probably not. But it's certainly not a massive drop in pureblood birth outside the lot that died in the first war, and Barbage probably had some projection of how many more were likely to die in the second war. Which is where and when it'd be more necessary.

** It is difficult to argue that a campaign of Murder and later genocide helped the victims. I find your claim about the blood status of the victims dubious since at least most of Umbridge's and the Snatchers' victims were Muggleborns and not purebloods.

** I would argue that it may ultimately have helped muggleborns in a more immaterial way, rather than demographic change: by showing how terrible and destructive the 'blood purity' ideology actually is, I think it would have had far less popularity and fewer adherents post-war. There are historical examples of this - fascism had quite a sizeable following in Britain (the British Union of Fascists claimed 50,000 members at one point and had the open support of some newspapers) before WW2 revealed the movement for what it was.

** Several comments mention the term genocide to argue what muggleborns lost in the war. The main difference between known genocides and the muggleborn hunt is, as stated by the thread opener, that muggleborn birth rate is not affected at all by the war because muggleborns cannot reproduce (what I mean is that the children of muggleborn are not muggleborn anymore). If we take that into consideration and the fact that many families that followed pure blood prejudice died out or nearly died out, the war actually helped future muggleborns because key members of the pureblood movement are dead and after the war the society can be rebuilt without any prejudices. Tl;dr: yes the war was positive for future muggleborns if you compare it to the state of wizarding society before the war.

** "Help" is a word that seems very out of place when used in the same context of "war".

The muggle-raised to wizard-raised ratio of students might have been higher, but they never received any benefits for falling in one category or the other. In fact, most muggleborns (with the exception of Hermione) were probably behind their studies, compared to their peers with magical families who could ask their Mum and Dad for support if that year's DADA teacher turned out to be shoddy, or when they were put under stress of being killed by the Heir of Slytherin in the 1992 school year.

** The percentage of muggleborns compared to purebloods/halfbloods may have increased due to the war not affecting the muggleborne birth rates while diminishing pureblood birth rates. But did the war help muggleborns? No.

Whatever small(compared to before) percentage the pureblood hold is a lot worse for the muggleborns. Because after the war prejudiced purebloods were more in percentage compared to their open-minded counterparts. These same purebloods make situations for muggleborns difficult.

***** Let's not forget that pre-holocaust, most nations were not well predisposed to jews. They were generally unwanted, "undesirables" one could say, a necessary evil at best. In the early years of the rise of Nazi germany, many countries refused to accept deported jews. What we now call "anti-semitism" was more or less normal.

​

Post holocaust, that is all rather different isn't it. Anti-semitism is now at the very least frowned upon, if not outright punishable. Israel exists, and I don't think people get refused entry into countries simply because they are jewish (that would be anti-semitic).

It's rather undeniable that in the larger picture, the situation of Jews worldwide was much improved by the actions of the Nazi's. That isn't to reduce the suffering of those who died or lived during the holocaust itself, but at the very least their suffering wasn't in vain. Their descendants enjoy a much more... accepting world for it.

​

One could see a similar effect taking place in the wizarding world after the second voldemort war. Marking muggleborns as a protected class, making it outright illegal to discriminate against them, etc. Not to mention the populations opinion in general increasing, which strengthens the effects of those laws and regulations.
