** This might be contentious. But if you haven't watched Fantastic Beasts, don't try to follow canon for America; it's pretty flimsy and unsatisfactory, and doesn't really work the way Rowling's Britain does due to her unfamiliarity with the culture. Also, if you're writing an America fic, you are probably not doing it to get a big audience - fervent canon compliance is not going to make a big impact on your readership.

If you're American, you're in a better place than Rowling to try to make sense of this. Try creating your own version of Ilvermorny - how would wizarding culture in America be different than in Britain? How would the schools be different? How would the names of your characters be different? Is Gringotts a global brand or do you want it to purely be a British thing.

Alexandra Quick is a great example of how to construct a really wonderful, original magical America. I really wish more people would take this approach, particularly if they're not locked into a canon-compliant mindset.

** Well I like to think American witches and wizards are a lot bigger on integration with muggles or no-majes then Brits. So there are no robes other than for very formal occasions like magical senate meetings. You won't ever find an American wizard wearing a nightgown in public. There are very few pureblood supremacist in USA because they are mostly descendants from British muggleborns who wanted to get away.

** Assuming the native Americans were treated much like they were in real life magical America would probably be a mix of all the people who have settled there over the years. Since it's just a blend of various cultures you can justify pretty much anything. I would imagine it would be more progressive and accepting of muggleborns/non humans since it isn't steeped in history like Europe. Keep in mind America is more spread out than Britain so there will probably be multiple shopping places and having everyone come to school on a single train would be super impractical
