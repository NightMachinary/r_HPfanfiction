Both are Snape/Harry.

1) Set in DH time, HBP Compliant, Dumbledore writes Harry a letter before he dies, and Harry recieves it at the Dursley's. He goes to Dumbledore's home and finds Snape sitting at the desk, Dumbledore's portrait on the wall. Ron, Hermione, Snape and Harry end up searching for and destroying the Horcruxes. It's complete. I think it was on AO3 but I could be wrong.

2) Set in DH, HBP Compliant. Harry begins to be interested in warding, and since he hates being in the Dursley's house he sets up Loyalty and Love wards around Mrs Figg's home. Moody and others step through the loyalty ones, and then Snape shows up. Complete. I think on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] but could be wrong, I only peruse [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] and AO3


** Sorry it took so long, but I'm pretty sure the first one is Critical Choices. Unfortunately I can't seem to find a copy of it, I'm guessing it was on hpfandom which doesn't seem to exist anymore? Oh, actually here (attempt #4 or 5)

linkao3(Critical Choices by Lilyseyes)

Someone save me from myself lol

If you can't find it, let me know. I give up, will research bots for dummies for future use for me lol.
