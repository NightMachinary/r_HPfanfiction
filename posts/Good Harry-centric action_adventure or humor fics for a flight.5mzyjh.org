Hi, just looking for some good fics to read on a flight. I loved jbern's linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle) series and his linkffn(The Lie I've Lived), and I'm looking for other action-y fics. I also enjoyed linkffn(ectomancer), linkffn(Seventh Horcrux), linkffn(Oh God Not Again), the whole series of linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation) and pretty much everything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/943028/BajaB][BajaB]]. I'd prefer to avoid fics that have cringey cliches like 11-year-old politics™, 11-year-old romances™, Harry reads like 5 books and becomes Lord Hadrian Harold Potter Black Slytherin, etc. If possible, minimum romance, but if there has to be some, I'd prefer H/Hr, H/G, or H/LL (i.e. no using Daphne Greengrass as basically an OC due to her not being fleshed out in canon). Thanks a bunch, and yes I've used the search function and kinda ran out of ones I'm interested in (though I'm up for reread suggestions). :)


** Have you read "A Black Comedy", linkffn(3401052), yet? It seems very much inline with your taste for humors.

"Delenda Est", linkffn(5511855), seems also to be a good choice, especially the second part. You want to read the deal about the Chicken and Dursleys.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** I'm not familiar with the non humour fics that you gave as examples so I'm can't recommend anything based on that, but I think linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) is a good super long adventure type story with lots of humour and action. It has only minimal background romance and doesn't have any Lord Potter political stuff that I believe you are talking about.
