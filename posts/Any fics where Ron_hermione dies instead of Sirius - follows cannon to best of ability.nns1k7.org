I think it would be interesting how Harry would deal with his best friend's death as oppose to Sirius's


** Awesome idea! I really think more fanfic authors need to have some of the kids die during the DOM fight, if just to show the Death Eaters are fucking seriously bad business in a world without plot armor. Ron/Hermione both dying there would do that, and also give Harry some great character development going forward.

Maybe it would make Harry reconsider the insane idea of bringing kids along with him to confront who he seriously believed was Voldemort himself torturing Sirius. Seriously what the hell did he expect they were going to do? Face off against Voldemort and win? Without plot armor, and if Voldemort really was there from the start, they all would have died.

Make it a disaster and have all his friends get killed, and Harry has to live with that being his fault. He could seriously reconsider his reckless idiocy in face of real deadly threats. Just because you get lucky before doesn't mean you get lucky again.

*** I think the interesting part is how would the sixth book pan out after the death- it can't just be like a few references about the deceased. Personally, I think it would be a way worse fifth year Harry, I genuinely don't know if he would be able to go on

  What if Harry's decision to go to the Department of Mysteries with four teenagers, and face off against a dozen murderous torturing terrorists, wasn't backed by plot armor? My take on the realistic results of the end of Order of the Phoenix. One-shot. Might become a full thing if enough people want it.

****** Yeah, thanks! Already got some ideas on how this would alter canon. For one thing, he smashed the prophecy in front of the Death Eaters, which means Lucius could use a pensieve to let Voldemort explore his memory of that moment and hear the prophecy in full - if Lucius didn't hear it himself (the only reason Harry got away is that he let him go because of that, maybe).

For another, sort of wondering if Harry wouldn't try to make new friends in a desperate bid to get back what he lost. Maybe turn it into a Harry Lavender thing. Or Harry Parvati. Not sure. xD After a major withdrawal and depression period, maybe. Except I'd want him to get actual mental health help for this shit...

Either way, it could be a nice way to have Harry make other friends.

******* I think it would be nice for him to make friends after he gets help- going though an angsty ‘am I betraying my friends' would definitely be in line with his cannon personality

** It's not instead of Sirius but Ron dies in HBP in linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar) which sets about many changes.
