Ron and Hermione get ready to go into the train compartment where Harry is seemingly waiting for them, when they locate Ginny talking with him about just how gullible her older brother and Granger are as she begins insulting them unaware that they're listening in on the two. Harry dons a smirk as he replies that fortunately he won't have to tolerate their inherent stupidity much longer once Dumbledore gives him the cue.

Harry wasn't even actually abused by the Dursleys, it was a sob story he told to Ron and Hermione so he could gain their sympathy. His skinny malnourished appearance is a glamour charm though he does still need glasses.

Basically, a partial inversion of the cliche "Weasleys are greedy evil bastards who only want Harry's money and are working with Dumbledore" plot.


** I don't think that this exists, but I would love to read something like this. I do remember reading a story where everyone was using Hermione, though I forgot the name or how to get it.

*** Sounds like linkffn(Rise of the wizards).

If it's a different fic, then I can help you find it with a few more details.

**** It's a different fic; if I remember correctly, it was one of those generic mid-late 2000s betrayal fanfiction. I didn't really enjoy it and I stopped reading about halfway through the first chapter.

****** Maybe. All I remember is that Hermione came into the common room, unnoticed for some reason, with Harry, Ron, and Ginny trash-talking her. Harry and Ginny seemed to be together.

Edit: I believe that the author was going to pair Hermione with Draco, which would explain why I did not continue it.

******* What was the logic behind pretending to be friends with a muggleborn? That's what I don't get. You can understand the other way around, Harry is the chosen one, and "vetting" his friends allows for more control. Giving Ron money, and promising the Potter fortune(which going by the rate of 1 Galleon at the time, and how many he had in his vault, is a decent amount at least) is a good way to guarantee compliance. What reason do they have deceiving Hermione though, and pretending to be her friend.

** linkffn(Renegade by 1991Kira)

Starts off kinda like this. Harry befriends Ron, Hermione, and Neville because it's useful for him.

Character development of course ensues.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
