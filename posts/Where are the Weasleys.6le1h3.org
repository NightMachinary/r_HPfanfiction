Now, now, now. Hear me out on this one. I am not going to expand on the Prewett side of the family, but take a look at this :

The Weasleys are a family noted of having more children that they can afford. You can see that. Arthur had seven. But Arthur also had at least two confirmed brothers.

No matter how much older they were due to the apparent tendency in Weasley children being spread across many ages SOME Weasley cousin of the ones we know SHOULD have attended Hogwarts at some point of the timeline we read through.

There was also a mention of a squib COUSIN of the family (no mention if he was a Weasley or Prewett). JK said that even if she didn't implement this in her story she thinks that this guy's daughter is a witch. So one more possible Weasley.

My question is : Since there are so many possible ways that Hogwarts could have been suffering a Weasley infestation... WHY aren't more Weasley children mentioned?

I get it why JK opted to not include them in the canon... Can't have too many unimportant characters belonging in an important (plot wise) family.

But no fanfics have a small army of Weasley cousins roaming through the castle. It's a really interesting concept and it bothers me that no one has used it afaik.


** Yeah, either the books ignore a ridiculous percentage of people in Hogwarts, or the losses of the first Voldemort war were of the "it's far shorter to list the survivors than the dead" magnitude.

*** I always thought there were more at hogwarts that were just ignored in canon. Some fan fics make it seem like there are only a few thousand wizards in England but I just don't see it. The amount of professional wizards/witches St. Mungos would need...or the amount of wizard each department in the ministry would need. Or the fact that there is an entire wizard shopping center and if there were only a few thousand wizards, surely it would be out of business. Or the fact that there is a whole quidditch league and you figure this related to English soccer so each team is presumably bringing in thousands of fans each match...

I truly think the world is much larger than what we see but when focusing on the pure blood ideology it makes sense that the canon stories only display a microcosm of what is actually out there

**** Both paths generate interesting worlds. Assuming we see only a small piece in canon lets you build a large and rich magical world. Assuming the contrary explores a fading/dying society, which also makes for an interesting world.

I'm working on one off the latter, wherein the causes and effects of that shrinking population inform the world and the plot, and are a consequence of the way magic works in the AU, with a touch of sociopolitical butterflies.

And when they ran out of children they wait for the next generation to re infest the school.

You mentioned 50 Weasleys AT Hogwarts together... If that happened they might as well have given them a corner of the castle for the Weasley Dorm.

What I was talking about would end up with a lot of Weasleys but not all at Hogwarts at the same time.

*** Well that explains the absence of graduated Weasleys, not of those in Hogwarts age. It is confirmed that both of Arthur's brothers survived the first war, though Bilius died at 84 or 85 after seeing a grim.

Also Bilius was single but that doesn't mean he had no children. And let's not forget about Arthur's other brother.

Not to mention that Arthur's father was a seventh son... Thus Arthur had six uncles (since Ginny is the only female Weasley in generations).

That's a helluva lot cousins that Arthur would have.
