  Harry is sure he's living in a fairy tale with himself as the hero. Really, what else makes sense?

** While it is a relatively short one-shot, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10280808/16/Little-Whinging-Pet-Shop][Unexpected Delay]] has Harry sort-of attend Hogwarts as a small child as a result of the Privet Drive Wards protecting him via putting him in stasis.

** Try [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/631214][the secret language of plants]] or [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/7693897][life skills outside the curriculum]] . Both are by the same author. Harry is gentle and kind. They are literally my fave fics in the whole fandom.
