Those ones that leave you dazed after reading, remain in your mind for days.

Fics that have great impact on you. Whether that impact is positive or negative doesn't matter.

Not specifically because of bad ending or something terrible.

I'm always looking for those fics, but rarely encounter them. I'll appreciate your help to find more. Thank you!


** linkffn(Blurring reality) I wouldn't call it haunted exactly although it has those elements, but I couldn't stop thinking about this fic after I finished it for a while. I don't know if it's because of its abrupt incomplete ending just when things were getting really intense or because it's just such a weird concept done in such a unique way, but I was impressed after reading this fic and felt like I had no idea what was reality by the end along with all the characters in it. A mystery with no answer.

I know the summary sounds really silly, but it's really good and well written. It's about a dance school putting on a performance called "the prophecy" thats basically the plot of canon events. There are strange parallels between the plot, the characters performing the play, their canon counterparts, the events going on in the dance school and canon events. As time goes on, the characters start losing their grip with reality and the parallels between them and their canon selves become more apparent. Has some great characterizations of both Harry and Tom Riddle.

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.

** I can't remember the name, but it was a groundhog style timeloop.

I think it was from Snapes perspective.

Hermione Would always die no matter what Snape did and the loop would reset.

There were two endings, one was happy, the other I found utterly horrifying.

I don't think any other fic has invoked so many emotions in me in so few words.

I actually cried. I don't usually do this, even in real life i'm rather detached and even more so from fiction but this story did it for me.

I couldn't read anything else for a few days because i was so fucking depressed.
