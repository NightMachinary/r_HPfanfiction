So, my newest OC Josephine Cracknell has a three-year-old daughter who is staying at her great-grandmother Ellen's while Jo is Romania working as a healer at Charlie's dragon reserve. Ellen lives on the muggle side of Ottery St. Catchpole. Molly Weasley( the First) and Ellen were friends since Jo used to hang out with Bill and Charlie during the summer when they were younger. Though, Jo wasn't fond of Charlie and his dragon obsession.

What's a realistic way for Molly and Ellen to interact again?

Edit: This starts in 1995, Jo and Charlie are in their early twenties, Jo went to Ilvermorny.


** Wait, which Molly are we talking about? I'm a little lost. Molly the mother or, Molly Percy's daughter?

**** I think Molly would be pretty cautious around Ellen. Molly is a pureblood witch, grew up in a pureblood household and married a pureblood wizard, she would be quite ignorant on muggle culture, but not necessarily prejudice (although there might be a sort of 'savior' complex going on like oh, the poor thing can't use magic, her life must be so difficult, how could she possibly clean the house using no magic, etc.)

Don't think Molly would talk about magic or Hogwarts, for that matter. She would refer to school, talk a lot about Ginny and her sons, how they're doing, what they're doing, etc. If it's 1995, then we can assume that she talks a lot about Ron (he was made prefect in his fifth year), so that's a good point of discussion. Molly, in general, would talk a lot about her family, leaving out all the magical stuff because she doesn't want Ellen to 'feel' bad (even though Ellen probably doesn't give a rat's ass.)

A lot of bringing over food (Molly loves to bake), a lot of tea, probably. That's how I could imagine Molly with a muggle woman about her age/a little older.

***** Ellen knows about magic but is rather wary about it. Jo's dad is a squib.

****** No, I understand that Ellen knows about magic, but I don't think Molly is one of the most open minded purebloods around. She's far from a supremacist, but I don't think she'd delve into it in the fear (as I said before) that she'd make Ellen feel bad (because she doesn't have magic).

******* Ellen is wary of magic because it was the cause of her divorce from her husband.

******** Okay, but your original question was what was a realistic way for Molly to interact with a muggle woman. I don't know enough about Ellen to tell you how her part would be, you can do a quick outline of her and I can come up with something quick, if that's what you want. If Ellen is wary, then I suspect that Ellen doesn't want much to do with Molly or magic? I suspect she would be a little cold to the idea, maybe even a little two-faced to Molly (since they were friends, she doesn't want to kick her out entirely, but also wants to keep her distance.)

********* Ellen is very wary of the Weasleys. She doesn't trust magic and is not really fond of the boys and her granddaughter hanging out with them. I thought of an idea maybe Ellen told Jo that Charlie or the Weasleys didn't want to see her. Jo and the Weasley boys haven't seen each other since the summer of 1989.

********** Oh okay, now I get it. That's a very important part then, the fact that she doesn't trust magic and isn't too fond of the Weasley boys, because from your original post, it sort of sounded like Molly and Ellen were still friends. Don't think they would interact voluntarily, but if they did, Molly would be very defensive of her own children. No matter what they did, she does not want to hear a bad thing about them from anyone else (unless it's like a professor or something, but that's a different situation all together). Molly isn't one to go out instigating and looking for fights, so unless they ended up face to face and Ellen actually said something insulting out loud, Molly would have no good reason to talk to her. Like if Molly finds out that Ellen lied to Jo saying that Charlie didn't want to see her, then she'd get upset with Ellen.

Eventually thouhg, and in any good story, you want a character arc/development. So you could slowly show Ellen and Molly becoming close again, and how something bad happens (let's say Charlie gets super injured or something happens to Jo's kid) that brings them together (Molly has super strong maternal instincts, even when it's not her own kid-- i.e. Harry)

*********** This is more a Jo/Charlie romance.

I totally can see Molly being defensive of Charlie (and her other children but Charlie is most important now). Even though, Charlie and Jo have a love/hate relationship. Though, Charlie didn't say that he was disappointed that Jo didn't come that summer.
