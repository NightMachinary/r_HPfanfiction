** I dont know about blood pureist, but there is one where he is a traditionalist. Theres even a good scene where he rants at hermione for drawing conclusions about the wizarding world without bothering to learn about reasons behind it. Its a pretty good length, I dont think i ever finished it. Linkffn(savior of magic)

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

*** A similar scene can be found in the /Perfectly Normal/ series, I think in linkffn(Parseltongue is Really Very Ordinary). In that scene, Harry compares Hermione to an annoying tourist, and it's really effective in shaming her into changing her behaviour.

  Harry's been learning about pure-blood culture, with Pansy's help, and trying to blend in as an ordinary wizard. But will all his attempts at seeming normal be ruined when they find out he can speak to snakes? His Slytherin friends take the news differently than the Gryffindors. Smart!Harry, Sane!Voldemort. Complete. Part 3 of "Perfectly Normal".

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12867536/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Homecoming][Harry Potter and the Homecoming]]

It happens at some point in the sequels of Harry Potter and the Homecoming. It happens slowly but he eventually accepts the entirety of Voldemort's agenda.

Warning: He literally becomes pure evil eventually , so if you don't want to read a fic where Harry is pure evil, then don't bother with this.

** This one might meet your criteria: Linkffn(12123765)

Harry holds some prejudices against Muggles and Muggleborns in this story. AU where Neville is the BWL. He's also paired with Lisa Turpin, which is a new one to me.
