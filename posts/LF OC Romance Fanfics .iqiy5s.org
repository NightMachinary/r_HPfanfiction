**** I'm so glad you're liking it. :) haha I feel like I'm getting a lot of attention on this subreddit these days which is awesome and also kind of shocking haha I've never really thought there was a lot of people reading it on here.

Working on 103 right now. Haha it's 32 pages I'm having problems with the last page - there is a few points I want to make and the flow isn't right :/ It's a bit too heavy on the monologue and I'm trying to adjust it. So provided I can get this adjusted (and still like it tomorrow when I'm not so tired) I'll be rushing it off to my beta to edit and hopefully I can post next weekend :)

  Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted and experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' power were enough to make Harry outright murderous. It didn't help that his girlfriend was a variant, & Harry really wanted to hang on to the only girl crazy enough to snog him. Eventual Dark Harry/OC
