I was rereading Betrayed today and I want to read something with a similar premise, Harry's daughter goes to Hogwarts, but doesn't know she's Harry's daughter. Harry can be alive and going by a different name like in the fic, dead, or something completely different. Also, I abhor abandoned fics

Thanks in advance!


** Man, this fic is weird. I have "I think I liked it?" written down on my fanfic spreadsheet.

Try some of sheriff1985's stuff, particularly Snake Bites. I think the general tone was pretty similar, a bit lighter in general. But maybe I'm only remembering that they both heavily feature school presentations. It's also better written imo.

linkffn(Muggle at Large) has similarly weird juxtapositions of random things, completely OC story though.

One of the first fanfics I read (before I started keeping track) had Ginny permanently ill in a nursing home after a Quidditch accident or something - I don't remember the title or genre at all but they felt similar in tone iirc.

  A muggle scientist stumbles upon the Wizarding World and refuses to let the discovery go. Technology meets magic in a dangerous adventure through the Magical Americas. She just might reinvent what it means to be magical... that is, if she doesn't get caught first.
