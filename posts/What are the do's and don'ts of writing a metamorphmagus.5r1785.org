I'm planning on writing a side character that's a metamorphmagus, but I'm really not sure what to do and not to do. Anything helps, thank you :)


** I'd start with discarding the idea of a 'true form'. While some people like the idea of metamorphmagi having a base form, others dislike it immensely because it's been overdone.

Set limits. Think about what you want a metamorph to be able to do and how it'll work with the rest of your story. Can they change gender? Do they age or can they simply morph the degradation away? Can they change their bone structure to be denser? Muscles to be stronger? It's your story so you can do what you want, but make sure you obey the limits you set. Make sure that all the limitations make sense when compared to each other.

** First thoughts, Tonks' clumsiness is likely due to her changing size regularly. If you have a growth spurt you're often uncoordinated for a while so its likely a common trend. Work out if you're limiting it in any way or if you're fine with magic being an answer to everything. The Harry Potter world has many things that could be overpowered but if everything is then nothing is. How much effort is needed or is it reactive? If someone can change everything about themselves and mimic whats around them then they won't have a 'true form' since everything about them in in flux their features like Plasticine where they can just shape it however they feel. Can you perfectly imitate someone? Are there limits to size and scale, or even creativity. Do you have to have seen something to copy it or is imagination enough?

**** I read a story quite a while ago that had either a fem!Harry or it was a story where methamorphs could genderbend and identified as female - don't remember which - where Harry discovered her abilities early in life and over several years slowly modified her appearance by removing imperfections one at a time and generally sculpting herself into her 'ideal' self.

It was rather interesting because the twist was that once she got to Hogwarts she realized she was almost supernaturally beautiful and couldn't remember how she used to look.

I thought it was an interesting idea, anyways.

** It depends on why you want the metamorphmagus in your story. There are implied consequences to whatever rules you apply to the talent.

In canon we see Tonks suffering from haircolour control issues not unlike a mood ring, and that's from someone who's been one for 20 years, successfully used it for stealth in her job as an Auror and otherwise shows up as a completely unrecognizable other person when needed. Her ability to form non-human snouts for the entertainment of the dinner guests at Grimmauld Place would indicate that the process of changing may take time and concentration, but probably isn't painful for surface-level changes.

Since most people who know of the talent don't 'ooh' and 'ahh' over it, it reasonably has only a few advantages to other kinds of self-transfiguration: that it's wandless magic and that the effect won't expire like a polyjuice potion.

If your side character is still in school, these sorts of capabilities may be difficult to achieve or control.

** Make sure they use their talent regularly like Tonks. Don't just say they are a metamorph and then essentially forget that they are a metamorph. This essentially goes back to the 'show, don't tell' philosophy. If it's a part of their character we should see that in their behavior, not just know it as a background fact.

** Hmm, since there is really little actually known about metamorphs, I'll just write a bit of the stuff that annoys me about some interpretations I've seen.

I think the most gripe I have with some fanon interpretations is the "Baseline Form" of a metamorph that so many authors describe. I always preferred to think that a metamorph doesn't have a baseline. Tonks looks like she does because that is how she feels comfortable. Its not a conscious effort that she has pink hair, its just how she feels good and her body reacts accordingly. In my mind a metamorphs would grow up, changing their looks according to what they see. Like normal people would change their opinions and personalities with incoming influences, metamorphs would change their bodies.

In one short chapter I once wrote, I even went so far as to explain why people like Bellatrix see them as an abomination. I wrote that they literally get born as some pink blob that eventually starts to resemble a human (or whatever they grow up with). You don't have to do that, but I feel like giving Tonks (or some metamorph) a baseline form takes a lot away from the coolness of the concept.

And this form also ends up nicely leading to the next thing I just /despise/. Metamorphs being super-uber-attracted to people who want their "natural form". I feel like, even if they have a baseline, asking to stay in that baseline form is just as insulting as asking for a different form. The only difference is that while wishing for some other form is just demeaning, asking to basically suppress the morphs to stay in the baseline is insulting their very nature (Tonks changes hair color when she's angry, happy,... it stands to reason that metamorphs would also morph during emotional or passionate situations, or just for fun).

A lot of what is expected of us sexually by society would have to be seriously reviewed for metamorphs. In theory any metamorph could be male or female, or gradient mixtures between the two biological states, as they wish. I personally am a fan of the fanon that metamorphs are able to have and sire children, depending on what kind of reproductive organs they morphed - but that goes with my "no baseline" preference.

Anyway, at the end you have to be satisfied with your idea, but maybe this gave you some useful input.

*** I agree with most of this, but you have to account for the fact that Tonks's shapeshifting was apparently weaker when she was depressed in Book 6. It's possible she was just feeling less creative about her form when she was depressed. However, my headcanon is that Metamorphs have an /approximate/ normal-looking base form--or maybe 2 base forms: one male and one female--and they roll down to somewhere close to that "ground state" if they lose control of their ability.

**** u/UndeadBBQ:
#+begin_quote
  was apparently weaker when she was depressed in Book 6
#+end_quote

I always just put that down to Depression/Grief dampening (other) emotions. But as I said, we really don't know anything concrete about it. We get some glimpses, like the depressed state of Tonks and the consequences, but in the end its at the authors discretion. Hence why I put down thing that I personally dislike. I'm just not a fan of the baseline form metamorph, not because of any tangible facts, but because its just the less interesting concept to read about. I mean... the fact that I wrote once that they're born as pink blobs kind of gives my stance away.

** The evil world variant:

Felt like this should be mentioned separately. In one of my stories, I used the idea that Tonks being a metamorph was actually the result of a curse Walburga cast on Andromeda as she was being booted out of the Black family. The curse would make her child a shape-shifter with weakened self-control and early sexual development.

The actual process of bearing the child was horrifically painful and Nymphadora was a terror to manage as a child. In this reality, they named her Nymphadora so that they could use it as a Compulsion keyword- whenever she hears the name, it sours her mood like an insulin crash. They chose a name unlikely to be used in common speech so that the effect wasn't applied inappropriately.

** So I am going to give away some of the stuff that I am thinking about using in my fics:

- They have a ‘base' form, which is what they feel that they look like subconsciously. This form, like the rest of them can change, but since it is based on their subconscious feels about themselves, it will not change very fast.

- As long as they retain around the same amount of physical mass, they can change their body as much as they want.

- Their are old magics (spells, potions, and so on) that were created by Metamorphs for Metamorphs.

- Hags are Metamorphs that were cursed.

The last thing that I want to put, is that I consider Metamorphs to be Magical Creatures in the same vain as Goblins and Veela.

** fannon metamorph concepts I find interesting: (1) they are of potentially of another/third gender; (2) they cannot die due to old age; (3) that they might have the ability bound in youth as it would be difficult to adhere to the statute of secrecy before they can control the ability, and therefore an orphan might not even know they were a metamorph until some traumatic event.
