A fic featuring Harry the spy. Please criticize me. I seek the item of improvement....

Editing kills me. I have nothing more to say.

Summary:

"The life of spies is to know, not be known."--- George Herbert.

"You know what must be done, Harry," Dumbledore said, his eyes dull.

"I do," Harry said. He looked over to his family. Mark was only a fourth year and Rose a first year. Was he ready to leave them behind for a life of suffering?

Then he saw his parents, standing before his grandfather's grave and rage filled him. The Dark Lord had to die, and if Harry could help in his defeat, he had to.

"Take me to Voldemort," he said to Snape. "I'm ready to be a spy."

** I read your first chapter and I think it has potential!

I'd want to know more about what makes this Harry so willing to give up everything. I'd also want to know how they're going to spin getting a 13/14 year old to spy (based on the idea that the basilisk happened the previous year).

I'm also a little wary about Mark's characterization based on Dumbledore's description of his survival as “sheer dumb luck” but it could work!

Overall I think there's a lot of potential and I'm interested in seeing how you develop this.

*** Thank you!

Harry's actually sixteen/seventeen at this point. I was planning on giving some background in the next chapter, including that. Mark has basically replaced canon Harry, with a few differences. His characterization is something I honestly didn't give much thought, though, so thanks for pointing it out.
