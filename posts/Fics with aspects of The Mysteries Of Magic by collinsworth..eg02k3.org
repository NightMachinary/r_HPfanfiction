I just read linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13116300/1/The-Mysteries-of-Magic]]) and I /loved/ almost every aspect of it. So I'm asking for fics like this, or maybe fics with similar attributes to this. Here are my favorite things from this fic -

I LOVE Dumbledore's and Harry's relationship. The casual mentor/friend/public apprentice is great. If not there relationship, perhaps just the fact that everyone knows that Harry is Dumbledore's apprentice?

I also really like the exploration of magic, (as you might guess from the total of the fic) it's great. Not much more to say about that.

I've always wished for more Harry/Katie fics, though this one isn't really focused on that. There's an obvious demand for them... I wonder why there's so little?

By far one of the most unique things, at least in my opinion, is Harry's /want/ for glory. It's so satisfying for him to enjoy his attention for something other than being the Boy-Who-Lived.

There's probably other things I'm forgetting, but that sums it up. I want more fics with one or more of those aspects. My favorite is definitely Harry and Dumbledore's relationship. If you haven't read The Mysteries Of Magic, go read it. It's great.

Thanks in advance!

  Saving the Philosopher's Stone opened Harry's eyes to a greater spectrum. Sometimes, all it takes for someone to grow is a dash of trust and a dollop of inspiration. Harry returns for his fourth year amidst the threat of the Dark Lord and a veil long parted---and his eyes are full of stars.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
