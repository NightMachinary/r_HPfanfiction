... Dumbledore asked, looking quite put out. “Well, I'm afraid Professor Quirrell ignored the warning. Apparently the troll he let in last night was a distraction so he could attempt to explore it. To his cost. Not even Christmas and I already need a new DADA teacher.”


** Hmm, I don't remember the story name, but it's probably a time travel fic, where Harry kills Quirrel by waiting for him (disillusioned) in the room with Fluffy, stunning him and then allowing Fluffy to eat him. Dumbledore announces something similar there

  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Warning: This story is weird and not for everyone.

Why is this allowed in the this subreddit /all the time/. This is blatant bullying. You could have clicked away from this thread and instead you put all this effort into being a jerk to OP.

******* They wrote a pretty good post about how prompts on this subreddit are just degrading into common ideas that can be found through a single google search or uninspired, boring plotbunnies nobody actually wants to read.

In essence, prompt posts are turning from "hey this would be interesting to write" into "haha, lol, that's a funny thought".

It's the classic reddit degradation curve: Every subreddit with lax moderation will eventually turn into a copy of [[/r/wtf][r/wtf]] or [[/r/funny][r/funny]]
