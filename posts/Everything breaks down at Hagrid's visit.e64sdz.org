Are there any fics where Hagrid's first visit to Harry deteriorates further and things go badly wrong? Maybe Vernon flips out at the disrespect being shown to him and disowns Harry, or he fires his gun before Hagrid can break it (and who or what does he hit?), or the transfiguration of Dudley has much more serious effects.

Hagrid's heart is firmly in the right place, but he is not known for tact or delicacy.

**** Well that was dark! Presumably, Harry starved for a while next to Hagrids' rotting body, before a burst of accidental magic saved him from dying of thirst. I expect he would be able to get some kind of message to Hogwarts, and be able to get in in time for his first school year. However, because of his family rejecting him, the blood ward failed, and he is now vulnerable to attack by Voldemort or Death Eaters.

The Death Eaters might follow a similar pattern to OotP, where they laid low for a year to re-gather allies and make plans, then they started making their move. Perhaps there would be a battle in Department of Mysteries during the events of CoS, ... Unless Lucius no longer feels any need to plant the Diary (no doubt Voldemort would keep a close eye on it), giving Harry a normal year, and unless Voldemort was only triggered to hear the prophecy at all by events in Little Hangleton. Wow, alternate history is hard.

**** Seems like an interesting way to introduce a darker/gray Harry, if not an outright evil one who hates magicals and muggles.

** Given that Hagrid is a half-giant, I imagine Vernon shooting him with birdshot(the only thing he'd be able to get in Britain) would just piss off the big guy.

*** Well, possibly. But given that Vernon was just about wetting himself at the time, and probably hadn't handled a gun in years, who's to say that he hit Hagrid? The recoil could have aimed it at just about anyone in the room, I reckon.

**** You only need to account for recoil when shooting multiple shots in a row. The recoil occurs much more slowly than the bullet leaving the gun, because the bullet is much smaller, and momentum must be conserved.

**** Not how a gun works. By the time tubby felt the recoil, he would have already fired and the birdshot left the gun. Recoil doesn't happen before the bullet is fired.

***** For the double barrel Vernon has, you are correct.

There are plenty of weapons that fire from an open bolt, meaning that a not insignificant portion the weapons weight is slamming forward before the weapon fires.

***** OK, wrong technicality, but the overarching point is that Vernon couldn't reliably hit the broad side of a barn at the moment, so he could easily hit someone other than Hagrid.

** Hagrid is not supposed to be using his wand since it was broked due to the Myrtle incident. It is well known that spells dont work properly when snapped but he still used it.

I can just imagine it misfiring the spell and slowly turned Dudley into a pig over the course of the day but it went so...so wrong. Imagine pig tail like growths starting to grow in various parts of the mishapen pig child. Imagine the Horror the Dursley feel knowing nothing they could do to help thier child. Imagine seeing them huddled telling Harry to do something. Blaming Harry for the incident, blaming his inability to do something about it.

** Can't remember the story but there is one where it turns out Dudley's struggle with obesity in his mid teens is because of the botched transfiguration. His intelligence and features are also affected by it, just not noticeably enough for Harry to notice at first.
