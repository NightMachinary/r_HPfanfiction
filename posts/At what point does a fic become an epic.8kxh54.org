** IMO Around 250k words that,

A) have been used to weave (and I use weave specifically here) a wholly involved story. Multiple plotlines, Sub plots And character development.

B) Steady, driven, pacing.

C) Finished.

** I'd say the quality of writing defines an epic, really.

The traditional definition of epic is "long story (technically poem) with a hero doing hero things." But to me, an epic needs to /feel/ epic. Prince of Slytherin, despite being long as all hell and having a ton of world building, lacks the feeling of vastness to the universe. On the other hand, the writing and atmosphere of By The Divining Light lead to an epic feel.

That was a lot of 'epics.'

** To me it's a combination of good writing + 250k or more words. That puts it at about OoTP length at minimum, and it has to be coherent rather than rambling to up the word count.

I'm pretty much in full agreement with the other comments here, I'm just also not inclined to count something at 100-150k words as an epic.

** I think this depends on what you speak of when you mean epic.

1) The word epic is actually used describe a long narrative, usually in the form of poetry. Examples of this include many of the staples of western literature, such as the Epic of Gilgamesh or the Homeric poems (ex. Illiad). Most epics tend to be lengthy, tell sweeping stories with multiple "mini-arcs" inside of a longer story (ex. Gilgamesh's adventures with Enkidu), and have one or more overarching message or theme that usually involves the main character(s) developing around (ex. Sun Wukong in Journey to the West). If you use these criterion, most fics can be discarded from this category by word length. OOTP caps out at just over 250,000 words, so that gives you an idea of what your looking for.

2) On a less precise note, I think when people consider a story epic, it is something that leaves its marks on a culture (or in the case of fandom more like a sub-culture). This is such that even if people do not know where an idea was derived from, they can recognize the idea or even parts of a story as familiar. An example: most people have an idea of what a Siren is and that it is Greek, but most people cannot identify they were made famous in the Argonautica or the Odyssey, two epic from ancient Greece. You know the idea because it has matriculated through literary and cultural history.

3) For HP, I would say a fic becomes epic when the story leaves a mark. Whether they are the best or worst, people remember them. People copied there ideas and plot points, because it resonated with them. And other people learned from these fics, until often no one can even be sure where it started. Examples include fics such as Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past linkffn(2636963), Taking Control linkffn(2954601), and The Lie I've Lived linkffn(3384712). While these are not necessarily the best fics ever (and I have issues with all of them), they each set huge precedents, or tropes if you prefer, for each of there sub-genres. Taking Control was THE indy!Harry fic; mistrusting authority, manipulative Dumbledore, wandless magic, it may have even popularized the panther animagus in hp fics.

Sorry for the long diatribe.

** Two criteria:

1. The fic is long.

2. The stakes are high (civilisation-ending or higher).

Incidentally, I generally consider "epic" to have negative connotations, especially in connection with HP fanfic.
