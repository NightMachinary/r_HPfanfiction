Sorry to be a bother, but I can't seem to find it no matter what I put into the search bar. The plot line goes something like... Hermione and Harry share a night together during DH when Ron leaves, and Hermione becomes pregnant and doesn't tell Harry right away because the battle. Afterwards, she goes to tell him but sees Harry kissing Ginny and leaves Britain. She comes back years later (five, four?) to attend Ginny and Harry's wedding and surprises everyone with a child. Harry learns that the child is his, etc.

Thank you in advance for anyone who knows what fic I'm talking about!


** The closest I've read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172243/1/Broken][Broken]]. It is Draco/Hermione, but she does get pregnant, run away to Italy, then come back to Britain after 5 years.
