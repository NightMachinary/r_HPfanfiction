I'm looking for fics where Lily was sorted into slytherin. It can either be mauraders era or just be a detail that Harry learns about his parents in a canon era fic. Added the caveat of not lily/snape because when I searched for already posted threads with that topic that seemed to be the focus of all the ones I found.

  AU What if Lily Evans was a Slytherin? Would James still fall for her? Would she still fall for the messyhaired Gryffindor who lived to taunt her? And what would Voldemort think of it all? LJ hate and love
