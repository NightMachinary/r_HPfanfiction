:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's driving me crazy not being able to find this fic I read /very/ recently. I've got no idea how to black out spoiler text on my phone, so read no further if you have potential interest in this fic!!! I THINK it begins after OoTP when V possesses H at the ministry, and H is able to read minds/emotions/thoughts- something at any rate and he notices that there isn't really anything going on with Ron and it turns out R has actually been technically dead for years with a childhood fuck up with him and Ginny and G is a natural necromancer and has just been animating/controlling R ever since. The fic eventually turns into H/V and G/OC and they both head over to V's side of the war, Hermione is a fuckwad and H ends up killing her in the CoS, pretty sure he also kills Rita down there. Im 99% sure the fic was on ffnet, any ideas??? It's driving me crazy not being able to find it.

  Something is 'wrong,' with Harry. He's hearing voices. or rather, a voice. Its telling him he's been on the wrong side since the beginning. Harry doesn't believe it. But for how long? Dark!Harry, eventual HP/LV slash. Don't like don't read. Complete with epilogue. Sequel up.
