Trelawney seems to be a bit like Snape when it comes to teaching but were Snape gets angry as student who don't understand potion as easily as he does, Professor Trelawney seems to drop her student in the deep end and expect them to swim.( a bit like if Mcgonagall decided to skip teaching teaching transforming a matchstick into a needle and skipped all the way to thrid year stuff, of course all but the most talented in the subject would fail at learning it if they skipped learning the basics)

are there any stories were Divination starts off small in there Predictions like predicting a Coin toss that only has 3 possible outcomes and happens only a few second into the future and slowing get harder from from there? like moving to a six sided dice and predicting what number you will roll at the end of class with it slowly getting harder with there becoming more possible outcomes and what they are prediction slowly becomes further into the future?

maybe the way Divination is taught the way it is up to Owl level is to weed out the People who have no respect for the subject or who only think of it as an easy grade( I tend to think that Divination was a core class before it started falling out of favour and it was replaced with transfiguration which is why there seems to be a rivalry between practitioners of the branches of magic)

**** Can't think of at that focus on changing divination or the way it's taught.

I do have a few general fics that have divination as a major plot point. linkffn(Flying (& Other Scenes); Harry Potter and the Weasley Seer; The Inner Eye of Harry Potter). The last is crack. Good one though.
