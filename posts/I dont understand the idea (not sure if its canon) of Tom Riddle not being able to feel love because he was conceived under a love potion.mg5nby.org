I think the only reasonable explanation for Voldemort being a psychopath is because he, neurologically, just happened to be one? And coupled with his horrible childhood, he was compelled to do horrible things? Why on earth would being conceived while someone is under the influence of a love potion render someone unable to feel love? People have loveless sex all the time????

** I personally think that it's just that children born under love potions don't have happy childhoods due to the whole, y'know, rape aspect of their parents' relationship. I think these kids just grow up with absent/neglectful parents and develop some sort of attachment disorder, a common symptom of which is to “not feel love” (they can, of course, if they get therapy). Attachment disorder is seen in children from orphanages, which is another point towards Tom having it. I was watching a documentary about orphans and my mind burst with all sorts of headcanons, mostly this one lol

** As another post says, the fact that Voldemort was conceived under a love potion is supposed to be symbolic, not an in-universe magical rule.

However, it's worth pointing out that sex under a love potion is not the equivalent of "loveless sex" that people have all the time. It's rape.

*** Sex under a love potion is sex under the influence of an intoxicant that makes it impossible to give meaningful consent while under it. But that doesn't make it necessarily rape every time, regardless of context. A married couple could consensually take love potions keyed to each other in order to enhance their enjoyment of sex, and there'd be no moral problem with that.

*** A bad childhood and perhaps internalised hatred for a certain group of people (such as women) can lead to serial killers, yes. Insert the Yorkshire Ripper, or countless others.

But not every kid that has an unhappy childhood turns out to be a genocidal maniac with zero interest in whether they'll burn the world down in their quest to make sure that everyone knows that they should indeed be revered like a god, rather than be written off as someone with a bad case of megalomania.

For there to be something inherently wrong with Riddle from the start would make it a whole lot more palatable.

Even in canon (or book 6, really) we see breadcrumbs of why Voldemort turned out as evil as he did, except, there is no story about downtrodden Tom Riddle's woes in a time where most people had to buckle up and deal with it.

Tom Riddle started killing human beings (Myrtle, his father and uncle) before be was out of school.

Even most of the fanfics where Harry turns evil because of the abuse against him are badly done because we don't see the slippery slope of morals, the escalation, and every step that turns Harry into a monster. (Except for Tiro's nightmare man, that was sublime).

The point is, lame or not, "just born that way" is more palatable than an abused kid in an orphanage that might not have been stellar at empathy and sharing things, and a lack of intervention from Albus "setting dressers on fire is a solid teaching/parenting tool" Dumbledore.

******* But if Merope lived, and Tom Riddle grew up with a mother that loved him, he'd still be anti-social, have impaired empathy or remorse, be mean and extremely egotistical, because love potions or not - Voldemort was written as a psychopath.

Being the child of a single squib mother & Muggle father he'd probably still have a chip on his shoulder about blood purity.

He'd still want to gamble everything and everyone to win at live because he'd think he's be entitled to it.

Merope was not in a position to provide for Tom properly, which is something that reflects in his upbringing and how he's view his mother.

For Tom Riddle to not escalate he'd need a sound and economically stable home where there'd be time for him and where Tom could be steered into a socially acceptable "boys will be boys" egotistical anti social behaviour.

I'd see a Tom from a good home become a ruthless CEO that'd have no problems with heavy exploitation of its employees. I'd see him become one of those BDSM club goers with no regards for SSC and torturing a sub to death and throw money at it with an "oopsie-daisy".

Or maybe just become a horrid spouse to some poor sod that made the mistake of marrying him.

Sure, nurture can do a lot, but some nature remains.

** I would imagine that Tom Riddle wouldn't be the first or the last child conceived with the help of a love potione. Love potions are nothing new in wizarding world,right?

I think he had a horrible childhood living in constant fear of Nazi bomb and plane attacks in an orphanage in the middle of war stricken England. Being ostracised for being different, bullied and possibly abused as well, until his magic started fighting back. Orphanages are not a good place to live in, especially in that time.

Finally escaping to Hogwarts, but still having to return to the horrible orphanage during summers.

I think he started losing his sanity and becoming paranoid and too sadistic was after his first horcrux and killing his father after being cruelly rejected by him.

After splitting his soul even more,he became obsessed with control,fear and power. Well spoken and charismatic with grand plans Tom , not so dissimilar to young Dumbledore, slowly becoming Voldemort. I commend him for managing to gain such following. It takes a lot of cunning for a poor half-blood orphan to have rich purebloods kneeling at his feet.

I believe love potion might have been a predisposition for his actions, but not an important factor of his path. He was insane. There are many functioning psychopaths or sociopaths in the world l think it is safe to say most of them are not evil dark Lords

He craved power which he did not have as a child. In the end, that same power lust brought his own demise.

**** You are correct, but wars don't just happen all of a sudden. There was time of the Great Depression , poverty, crime, disease, lack of food. Not too long after Spanish flu outbreak that killed millions. Both ww1 and ww2 and the time in between were not pleasant times.

When we learn of history, we learn of only major battles and attacks. In reality, it must have been much more dangerous and risky to walk the streets there.

It is all just theory and speculation. It seems a little silly to even discuss a fictional character like that, but it is interesting to connect Tom Riddle with actual facts.

** Personally, I didn't find his childhood all that bad. Yes, he grew up in an orphanage. But based on the (admittedly brief flashback) it was a fairly nice one. The administrators gave a damn and the kids didn't need for anything. Hell, they had field trips to the beach.

Tom was the one that decided to kill small animals and do untold things to other kids that scarred them them life.

Tom was a bad egg. He inherited the asshole gene from both sides of the family.

** I can somewhat reach towards a semi-logical conclusion. Well I say logical, it only checks out if you look at it from this particular angle. Love is more or less evolution's way of making sure humans reproduce, but outside of that is often detrimental to making logical decisions. A magical child conceived under the effects of a love potion /could/ theoretically evolve away from love, if your fanon universe uses genetic magical traits like family magic.

However, that in itself wouldn't really change anything for Voldemort, considering he didn't really go for love in canon anyway. He still has the rest of his emotions. There's a sizable amount of real life people who genuinely can't feel love, and their lives are pretty much normal.

** The love potion theory, and the idea that Voldemort absolutely /cannot/ feel love, comes from an interview JK Rowling did: [[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript/]]. There are suggestions that what she said was misinterpreted, and what she meant wasn't that the reason he can't love is because he was conceived under a love potion. Rather, she was saying that he grew up without love so he didn't know what it was, which goes more to your second question.

I'm not aware of JKR ever confirming that Tom Riddle was a psychopath. That one is more of a fan theory, as far as I know. I think there are studies that show that children raised in the kind of environment he was presumably raised in, without love and likely without much touch/interaction when he was an infant, are more likely to have mental health issues later in life. In addition, as people have mentioned, the in-breading in his family (which is canon) supports the idea that there might be something genetically abnormal about him. Psychopathy has been thought to come from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and it seems like TMR would have had the "perfect" background to create a psychopath.

In addition, the book does have a conversation between the orphanage matron and Dumbledore where its clear she think there's something wrong with TMR and has tried to get psychiatrists in to diagnose him. I think many people took that along with his subsequent behavior, at least as portrayed through Dumbledore's memories (being very charming when he wants to be which implies he might not feel emotions but knows how to mimic them, inclination to violence, feeling that he is special, etc.), to mean the illness Ms. Cole thinks he has and which he does actually have is psychopathy.
