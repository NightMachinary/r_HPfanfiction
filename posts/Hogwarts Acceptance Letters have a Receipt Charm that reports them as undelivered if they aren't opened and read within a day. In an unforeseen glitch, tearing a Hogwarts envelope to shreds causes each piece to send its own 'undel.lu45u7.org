****** That might be your headcannon, but we really know nothing about how he felt during his teenage years. For all we know he could have been all for the complete destruction of muggle society in order to control them better. Cannon only puts it down essentially as 'scheming with Grindelwald during his youth', we don't know which one was the extremist first, nor do we know how far they were down the rabbit hole.

And the best part? It's all from Rita. So really, Grindelwald might not have ever brought up his plans and Rita might just had thrown it in for controversy. The only solid thing we have(Which, unfortunately, is from Fantastic Beasts 2) is that they made a blood pact of some kind that would prevent them from harming the other.

That said, the blood pact both annoys and confuses me, as their relationship was meant to end in a battle with unforgivables being used, but this would prevent them from targeting one another in such a fight.

And a squeaky clean school record? I seem to recall an incident where his dorm caught fire at one point. Granted, he was a prefect and head boy, so he must have been a good student, I mean, it's not like we know of any head boy that killed someone in a bathroom, right?

He was noted as a wise and even kind person, but personally Dumbledore always seemed manipulative to me. That's not to say that he is, it's just my headcannon.

The blood pact, on the other hand, was made the same summer as them meeting and Ariana's death, afterwards Grindelwald 'fled immediatly', so it would have to be created prior.

****** "Harry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to look at the Dursleys, who seemed stunned into silence.

‘I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,' Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, ‘but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.'

A third twitch of the wand and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honey-coloured liquid into each of the glasses, which then floated to each person in the room.

‘Madam Rosmerta's finest, oak-matured mead,' said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at each other, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself."

​

The texts suggest that dumbledore deliberately enchants them to be annoying after the Dursleys are rude by not offering him a refreshment, to teach them a lesson and get back at them for how they've treated him, harry, and all wizards even if in a small way. Even Harry suspects Dumbledore is enjoying himself. I'm not sure where you're getting that he didn't realize they weren't drinking them.

Yeah, true, but even if he doesn't have that much political power, as long as some part of the law he proposes appeals to a certain amount of people, then it should be able to pass. Like say a law to harm death eaters when fighting them. the light and gray faction would likely agree, and that'd be majority, since fanon has seats hold different amount of votes.

The what factions? I highly doubt that the Wizengamot would split itself along such frankly childish lines. If anything I could see a socially conservative faction making up the bulk of the Wizengamot, mostly because they see no reason for change in the first place, but it's more out of complacency and societal inertia than any real desire to keep muggleborns down. Opposing them I imagine would be a loose alliance of socially liberal factions, each pushing for better treatment of their chosen minority group, likely with the pro-muggleborn one holding the biggest sway among their coalition, mostly due to muggleborns being the largest minority group.

On the fringes I suspect would be the political extremists, for example maybe a reactionary group who's political beliefs most closely align with those of the Death Eaters, though they might phrase their beliefs in a more socially acceptable way. Finally, I could see one or a number of groups of radicals seeking to overturn the Statute of Secrecy, possibly for the same or similar reasons as those of Grindlewald.

********* Or it could be like the POTUS or the Prime Minister. Yes, they're the leader, and the figurehead, but if the legislators don't want a law passed, it's not going to happen.

This could be through obstruction like not bringing the law to a vote, bribing Wizengamot members to vote the way you want, or just an upperclass that doesn't care about the immigrants in their country.

Yeah, Narcissa Malfoy will pay that mudblood sickles to magically shine her shoe collection, but to consider her an equal? Hardly. Look at racial, gender, and orientation equality, and look how far (and how little) we've come in fifty years. Now, add in the fact that the British magical society seems permanently stuck in a pseudo-Victorian aristocracy where the ones at the top stay wealthy while the immigrants (Hermione) are treated poorly.

As proven multiple times in the series, this bigotry and corruption is widespread throughout all levels of society and government, and Albus is facing an uphill battle from the word go.

Then think about the world events that happened between World War II and '97.

There were Multiple wars, at least one global health crisis (AIDs/HIV), and then you add in the fact that he's responsible for Britain's education and national government, and that he's, I'm assuming, the Secretary-General equivalent to the magical United Nations, and you have one man doing the job of three for almost fifty years. In the time he held all three of those offices, there were several different "muggles" holding the post of Secretary General of the UN.

Personally, I believe that he set out to change the world, but found himself bound with bureaucratic red tape.

Dumbledore isn't the end all be all of magical UK! He doesn't control their laws! Why are you obsessed with hating dumbledore? The books dont even imply he hated muggles or discriminated. What would be the thematic point of that?

The trace is a huge plot hole is all.

You don't know the first thing about what he lobbied for. Not the first thing. Your first presumption can't be that he didn't care.

And he wasn't 150. He was 110 and had a shit ton of hats to wear. Researching Voldemort was his first priority. Administrating hogwarts and advicing fudge on weekly bases are all full time jobs by themselves. The story has a discriminatory trace system and such, to SHOWCASE privilege! It isn't supposed to be a utopia. That doesn't mean the revolutionary is a bigot simply for not having succeeded. Dumbledore had to cave to the blackmailed governors and leave hogwarts when it was important that he be there. He is so venerated precisely for his humility and respect. If he shoved his way past doors he just looses his credibility.

******* We are not actually told that Dumbledore has all that influence to begin with. For all the talk about him being the chief warlock we are never explicitly told what powers and responsibilities come with it, our only indication is that Fudge didn't seem to have much problem in kicking him out of his positions back in OotP which doesn't really inspires confidence. My guess is that the position is more administrative and ceremonial in nature, with his only actual difference offered from the other members being that he would be the responsible for keeping the order each session. Plus we don't know to what extent he was actually involved in politics, no matter how many offices someone holds if they are focusing on something else, like running a school, running the order, their own academic research, having a semblance of a social life, caring for keeping their own health in top form and practicing on fighting to keep a dark lord in check... or maybe he just plainly didn't really feel like it, for all we know that is the society he grew up on and he doesn't really seem to have ever had any problem with those particular laws, if it makes sense than chances are that he wouldn't even think to question it (the most overt forms of discrimination like muggle-baiting or hunting are said to have been already made illegal and we are never actually shown the state of economy or the workforce's in cannon to be sure there actually /are/ differences in treatment or wage based on blood-status in first place, the very fact that Umbridge was prosecuting against muggleborns working on the ministry at the very least show that they /did/ find jobs there, and with cleaning spells available and house-elves there is really not much of a use in having anyone hired to perform cleaning duty), specially if he had no particular interest on politics or was weary of holding too much power after the whole Grindewald thing. And being famous or a renowned academic/warrior rarely translates in actual political power in the modern age (yes, unless there are people holding vast parts of the country, making their own rules and holding personal armies to fight among themselves with a religious institution profiting on the background at the same rate they indoctrinate the population then the wizarding world is not part of the Middle-Ages, if nothing else the very existence of a bureaucratic government is indicative of a modern government, and the lack of a standing national army semi-autonomous under the rule of generals fighting among themselves for political power also rules out most classic western forms of governments), the most involvement famous people are generally afforded in such societies is the one related to marketing in the sense that their endorsement of certain political figures or leanings have some pull among the masses, F ex.: Fudge being able to truthfully say that this or that move was approved by Dumbledore himself.

Plus, we are assuming that the reasonable restriction on underage sorcery is a British law, it could potentially be part of the Statute of Secrecy and Britain has to obey it unless they are willing to suffer reprisals from the rest of the ICW (and no, even in the unlikely case that being chief warlock grants him special powers over the laws and politics on Britain no country would ever allow a chairman from any international institution to unilaterally dictate their internal politics, that would be essentially forfeiting their sovereignty, international politics work when enough countries agree on something that the economic/political/social pressure they can collectively exercise on the ones not onboard is bigger than any reticence or protests those unwilling are capable of offering on the issue at a given moment) chances are that in this case the ministry would only follow the international guidelines on the decree with the only adjustments being to fit it with the particulars of their own society.
