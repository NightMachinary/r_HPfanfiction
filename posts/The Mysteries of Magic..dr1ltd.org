I stumbled upon this story a couple of months back and quickly reread it once again. Only 7 chapters so far but has a very interesting take on Magic and offers a refreshing take on Harry's fourth year. It was updated in early January of 2019 so I'm hoping the Author, Collinsworth, has not abandoned this story because it shows a great deal of promise IMO

** It does seem like an interesting premise. Although, considering their Naruto story hasn't been updated since January 2018, I would not hold my breath for any new updates. Then again, it did take them over 2 years to do those 8 Naruto chapters, so never say never.

** Yo, Collinsworth here. First, thanks for liking my story, I was hoping people would notice it even if the story still is kinda short! So, I've answered a similar question here in the subreddit -- saying the fic isn't dead and there'll be updates, which, due to some unforeseen factors (university, work, some personal things weighing on my mind) I didn't deliver.

But yeah. This story isn't dead. I don't know exactly when I'll be updating, but rest assured, I'll update.

*** Thanks for writing a great piece of fanfiction! I love the Dynamic between Harry and Katie and how you frame it. More or less how it could end up being as a potential Ship, but at the same time it could also be just temporary. Additionally I loved the scene where Harry became Salazar more or less. Very interesting stuff. Looking forward to the next update!
