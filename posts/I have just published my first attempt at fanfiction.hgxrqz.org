** There are a few missing commas here and there. The shift from an impersonal third person narrator ("little did they know", etc) to a limited third person perspective (Harry's) is a bit jarring.

The opening was good but I would combine the first and second full sentences. A reader knows the crowd is angry from the jeering and you can just tack on "especially from the Slytherin table." Trust your reader to recognize anger.

It should be "there were" because there were multiple "chaotic events".

Ron is OOC for the worse. I'm not a fan though I suppose a large contingent of readers will be.

Decent premise and there's some promise.

I would go through and tighten up the language. There's some repetitiveness and redundancy here and there but overall it's worth an attempt at continuing.

** Oh, yeah. This is definitely worth continuing!! I'm not good with constructive criticism, but I really struggled to find anything to criticize. Please keep at it, I loved the flow!

*** I read it! I liked it a lot! Do you have a lot of it written or did you just write the first chapter?

** It's definitely worth continuing. I like the premise and it is a solid beginning.

One piece of constructive feedback would be to develop character more through their descriptions and their inner narrative

** One piece of advice: Make sure the summary is free of mistakes, because that might scare people away from reading your story. ("strumbles")
