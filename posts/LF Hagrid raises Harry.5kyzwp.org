Is this a thing? He'd be a great dad.


** ...Dammit, I KNOW this was discussed just recently. I (or someone else, I forgot) raised the possibility of Hagrid adopting Harry after the whole thing with the island the Dursleys flee to to try and avoid him...where was the thread, I can't find it...

Wait, nope, I just found it: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5jxu4h/requestlf_fic_where_harry_was_adopted_by_hagrid/]]

But I'm the only responder and I only talk about my idea for a potential fic...we'll have to message [[/u/El_Hunters][u/El_Hunters]] if this gets anything.

*** Thanks! I'm not sure if I could wrangle it into a decent fic, I don't have much of a direction for a plot there, but it could be an interesting path. I like your idea of the justification for Harry living with Hagrid, and it makes sense because Dumbledore trusts him deeply.

**** I also asked for a story where [[https://redd.it/5k5bod][Hagrid is Voldemort's archnemesis]], I listed a fair few of his traits that differ the two from each other and some of Hagrid's heroic qualities.

Thinking about it, a lot of the stuff Hagrid gets up to could be considered Independent!Harry fare; quest to find Harry, raising a dragon, wrongfully sent to Azkaban and personal tussles with the law, questing to find and recruit giants, fighting death eaters...and before that, wrongfully expelled, taught himself magic anyway, has an innate gift that makes him more powerful than normal wizards...and yes, despite his checkered past Dumbledore trusts him completely and lets him get away with all kinds of shenanigans.

~makes a note to write a mini-fic on this if he ever gets around to it~
