I mean the Weasley and Potter kids are going to be celebrated for what their parents did and the death eater kids are going to be hated. I found one such [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5362533/1/among-velleities-and-carefully-caught-regrets]]


** Honestly it would make sense and be an interesting read if the Next Gen kids acted like Draco when he was young, and had to grow out of that behavior. The parents could try all they might, but constantly being hounded by reporters and adoring fans can have an effect on kids. While the reporters and fans would be focused on the Next Gen kids parents, they would garner quite a bit of attention for being the "Next Generation of Heroes" or something like that

  A moment or two in the library with the Burrow kids, and one unfortunate bystander. Drabble originally written for LJ's "Next Generation Drabbles" June contest.

** [[https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a28938435/arnold-schwarzenegger-kids/][Arnold Schwarzenegger has some diverse offspring, and with the addition of his bastard, his story is incredibly interesting.]]

I think the Weasley family is a pretty cool portrayal of how many kids from the same environment can turn out dramatically different. But no doubt, the idea of shame and pride, following in footsteps or rebelling is pretty interesting. And it's an idea that's super relatable, too.

** There's a oneshot where Harry is called to Hogwarts to pick up James after he's been suspended (maybe?) for bullying. Harry is furious and disappointed, but at first doesn't show any reaction and is struggling how to handle the situation without Ginny there to help. James apologizes several times, but isn't really sorry he hurt and humiliated another student, he's sorry for getting caught/being in the situation after, and it isn't until the end that he recognizes the harm he's done and really apologizes/has a bonding moment with his father.

If anyone remembers this, I'd love to read it again!

** Linkffn(Anything but Slytherin by IP82) isn't next gen, however it does have strong parallels, and is worth sharing regardless.

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.
