Romantic stories were Harry is a bit oblivious to romantic advances and maybe is the one getting wooed by the girl for a change? The pairing doesn't matter for me preferably het.

** Depends, I would say some could be considered this

Hope and Healing on fanfiction.net he was oblivious to his emotions for awhile, but did realize them.

Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift, also on fanfiction.net, is similar since both of them didn't realize their feelings for a small part of the story.

** I kinda wanna see this with someone like Katie Bell -- because more Katie/Harry is a good thing.

Although, I could see it as an amusing situation if, in some alternate universe, Narcissa gave birth to a girl instead of Draco.

Over time, other Slytherins and Gryffindors arch eyebrows when the she and Harry rant off about the other, with their noting that both seem to be obliviously obsessed with hating the other.
