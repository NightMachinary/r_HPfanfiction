Alright, so I am writing a Harry Potter fanfic...again. And for the sake of making my Hogwarts realistic I need a bunch of background characters to fill the four houses (some will play bigger roles than others). It would be a HUGE amount of help if as many of you as possible could comment with your own character. You can go as in depth in the character as you like I only request you give the basics. Name: first and last House: any of the four and Year: if your character has a specific or important birthday (like turning 17 before apparition lessons) please add it in aswell. Thank you so much guys! Sorry this took so much of your time :)


** Michele Montenegro. She's in Ravenclaw. Her birthday is February 9. Her family moved to England from Italy in the 1970s and she's the first kid to attend Hogwarts. She's a Metamorphagus and her favorite subject (besides Transfiguration, obviously) is DADA. She wanted to try out for Quidditch but her dad thought it would interfere with her studies. She has a wicked competitive streak that takes Gobstones to a whole new level.

** Hi, my name is Sarah Kettleburn. I'm in Ginny's year, but I was sorted into Hufflepuff. My birthday is on May 20th.

My mum breeds Kneazles and Crups and my dad works at the Ministry of Magic, at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. My granddad is Silvanus Kettleburn; he used to teach Care of Magical Creatures at Hogwarts before retiring in 1993.

My pet is a gorgeous grey-white speckled Kneazle. Her name is Victoria. She loves to follow me around the castle and helps the house elves keep the mice population under control.

I have a few favourite subjects: Of course I love Care of Magical Creatures, although I'm not a big fan of the way Hagrid teaches it. I'm also pretty good at Herbology, and I'm reserve keeper for the Hufflepuff Quidditch team.

** A couple that I've created but never likely to actually use in my own fics beyond background characters, so feel free to do as you please with them.

*Maxine Davis*, Slytherin, born 6th of May, pureblood. I'd planned to write her post-books so you can stick her in any year that suits your fic. Average student, decent grades, mousy brain hair, brown eyes, 5'6". Excellent flyer but terrible at Quidditch (can't hit/throw/catch a ball to save her life). It doesn't stop her trying out for the house team every. single. year.

*Bonnie Cadwyn Carew*, Ravenclaw, born 14th of November 1983 (puts her three years below Harry & Co.), half-blood. 5'3", average weight, pale skin, ginger-brown hair, green eyes. Father (Welsh) is a muggle, mother (English) died in '87 from illness. She has a non-magical sister, Valerie, who's five years older than her and extremely jealous and angry about Bonnie being magic when she isn't. Bonnie is a loner with no friends for the first couple of years, but from about third year she starts helping the younger kids with homework and eventually gets a reputation as the go-to girl for tutoring, which she starts charging for to earn some extra money. She has a long-held grudge against Dennis Creevey after he messed up a second-year potion that resulted in turning Bonnie's skin fluorescent orange. She excels at Charms and Ancient Runes, and plans to become a private tutor after finishing her education, whilst also experimenting with Charms and studying ancient languages in her spare time. She dies at the age of 120 without marrying or having any children of her own, but capable of remembering the name of every child she had taught in the last century.

OWL Grades: Ancient Runes - O; Arithmancy - E; Astronomy - A; Charms - O; Defence Against the Dark Arts - E; Herbology - O; History of Magic - A; Potions - O; Transfiguration - E

NEWT Grades: Ancient Runes - O; Charms - O; Defence Against the Dark Arts - E; Herbology - E; Potions - E

Sorry if I got a bit carried away; I created this character years ago and have never had an opportunity to use her. I've planned out her whole life but she's not the kind of character that's interesting enough to centre a whole story around. Anyway, good luck with your fic!

** Hey there! My name's Maggie Cho and I'm a Hufflepuff born on December 11th. I'm in Ginny Weasley's year at Hogwarts. I'm a halfblood who likes to read and write. I sometimes even write stories about the adventures I hear about the 'Golden Trio'. Heehee. I have a big crush on this Slytherin a year ahead of me, but I'm not saying who! :-)

** Looks like you might need a few guys.

*Gage Throckmorton*. I'm a Gryffindor seventh year. My mother was born to a minor branch of a prominent pureblood family (you might know my very distant cousin, Theodore Nott), and my dad, who was born to a muggle and a squib and was raised completely muggle, wooed her in secret before they were able to elope. I grew up in Hogsmeade, where my mother and father operate their own small apothecary. I am a dab hand at herbology, but too many of my chores as a child revolved around working in the garden for me to really like it. I'm no genius, but get decent grades. My real talent is on the pitch, where I am a starting beater for my fifth year running.

It's worth noting that I am about 6'6" and weigh around 235 lbs, almost all muscle. I have sandy blond hair and warm brown eyes, and freckles. People would be intimidated by my size but my friends tell me I'm too much of a teddy bear to scare anybody. My buddy Thorne, who is my fellow beater, calls me GG for Gentle Giant (and because my name is Gage).

*Thorne Blackwood*. I'm also a Gryffindor seventh year. As Gage said, I'm a beater for Gryffindor, and have been for the last four years. I am what you might call a pureblood, since my parents and all four of my grandparents are magical - but my maternal grandfather was muggleborn, and I have several muggle and squib relatives and cousins who I see over holidays. My parents are divorced, and I live with my mum but spend a couple weeks each summer at my dad's. My mum works in the ministry on the Committee on Experimental Charms. She's always coming home with crazy enchanted objects and new spells she's testing out. Our home tends to be a bit chaotic. One time when I was eight she accidentally turned my skin purple for nearly a week before she worked out how to switch me back. Dad calls himself a "researcher", but he's pretty much a freelance article writer for academic journals who lives off of his inheritance. It's a trial to get him out of his study when I visit.

I have a slight obsession with muggle classic rock music, and have been working for the last year or two on adapting muggle technology to magic so I can play music on something more updated than a gramophone. I have a soul connection with Eric Clapton and want to learn to play guitar. My favorite classes are Charms, naturally, and DADA. I am tall, but not as tall as Gage - about 6'1". I have dark hair, almost black, and slate blue-gray eyes.

*** Just realized - these were characters I came up with for a story I never wrote, which took place around our time, i.e. ~2012ish. So obviously none of the original classmates of Harry Potter would still be around (meaning the twins aren't the beaters). Just kick them off the team if that's a conflict! Gage won't be too sad.

Edit: Also, if you need any more OC's I have more you can borrow. Thorne's best friend Quinn Mason, Gage's girlfriend Amita Khan and her best friend Ruby Harwick. Thorne's love interest Winnie Snow, her best friend Olivia Parker. Winnie and Olivia's friend Howell Crane and his boyfriend Aubrey Harrow. Hit me up for the bios, or just borrow the names if you like.

** Morgan & Gavin Nisse.

Twins in Fred & George's year (their birthday was the day of the apparition test, Gavin passed first time, Morgan splinched her left arm)

Their father is a squib who works in the Muggle PM's office and Mother is a Witch who works at the MoM, they were brought up in a 'half and half' environment and can blend in equally well with the wizarding community or as Muggles.

Morgan excels at potions and non-verbal spells. Her favourite Professor is Snape. She's a Slytherin. She wants to be a healer.

Gavin is a Ravenclaw. His favourite teacher is Professor Flitwick and he does well at charms and wants to make Quidditch brooms when he leaves Hogwarts.

The twins get on ok - but aren't particulalry close.

If they had still been at Hogwarts during the battle - Gavin would have stayed... Morgan would have tried to make him leave - Gavin hopes she would have been the Slytherin who stayed, but isn't sure.

**** Not a problem - it'll be nice for them to get out of my head for a while!! Gavin really does have faith that Morgan is a good person - but sometimes, just sometimes, she lets him down. On other occaisions, she lives up to his faith - but mainly because deep down, she loves him really (he is her brother after all), although she's often too embarrassed to admit it!

** Marise Caufield (Or whatever last name you want).

*Background:* I was born on July 28th. I'm in the same year as that Potter kid. Related to the Lestranges and thereby the Blacks and Malfoys. My mother is the sister of Rudolphus Lestrange. Obviously, I'm in Slytherin because it's the greatest House ever. Also, I'm a Pureblood, as if you had to ask.

*Attitude and Thoughts:* I'd hate to be in Hufflepuff, how embarrassing. Divination is complete shit. I would like to be an Auror. I don't entirely buy into the whole Death Eater thing. Obviously, us Purebloods are meant to be on top, but killing off our race isn't going to do anything. Let's be sensible, people. Since I want to be an Auror, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, and Charms are some classes I must suffer through. I adore Potions though, isn't Professor Snape the sexiest? He has that whole brooding thing about him. Sigh.

*Appearance:* Fair-skinned with dark, mahogany hair and clever green eyes. This makes me look like one hot chick in my green Slytherin tie. About five foot six, so pretty much average height, though a little on the tall side. Stylish, but not overtly concerned with it.

Ashleigh Carlisle

*Appearance:* Blonde and curvy, with blue eyes and a pouty lip. Smiles a lot. Very bubbly and happy.

*Background:* Father killed by Voldemort recently (if applicable to your story). She's a Hufflepuff and loves it. Her favorite class is Care of Magical Creatures because she has lots of fun with the animals. Especially the unicorns! She's a bit on the dumb side, but will always make comments that make someone laugh. This can hurt her feelings sometimes, of course, but she always picks herself up and goes on her way. She doesn't take herself too seriously. She's in school to find a husband, preferably a rich one, but could also become a vet for magical animals if need be. Two years behind Harry and Co.

*Famous Quotes by Ashleigh:* "This is really good! What's in pumpkin juice?"

"The Golden Trio? Sounds like a band of superheroes!"

"God, that Harry Potter is so handsome, I wouldn't even mind if he wasn't rich!" Brief pause "But he is, so it's okay."

** Not sure if you still need it but-

Robin Tallo is a 14 year old girl in Slytherin. She's a pureblood and her mother is Japanese while her father was white and English (however he died when she was five years old while working at an Gringotts in America). As a result she knows both Japanese and English and visits her family members living in Japan every summer. Her mother works in the Ministry of Magic as a member Magical Law Enforcement Squad, dealing with day to day offenses. She's an only child born on June 11th.

Her favorite subject at school is Transfiguration, even if rest of her house dislikes McGonagall. Her worst subject is definitely Herbology. She's not that keen on Quidditch and will occasionally borrow one of Hogwart's broomsticks for a ride by herself but prefers to spend time alone reading in the school library, especially the Restricted Section.

She's very friendly by nature, even if she is a bit awkward and loves to spend time with her friends in the common room when she's not studying. However, she can also be very cold to someone if she doesn't like a person. She generally thinks before she acts or speaks but sometimes her temper gets the best of her and she does something that she later regrets.

She's an average height for her age, about 5'3 and has slightly slanted brown eyes that she inherited from her mother. Her black hair is a mass of curls (that she got from her dad) which frame her slightly tan face that she gets from lying out in the sun, reading.
