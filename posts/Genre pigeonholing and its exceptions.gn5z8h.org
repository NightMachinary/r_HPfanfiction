I've noticed we love categorization in this fandom, and there are a lot of really well-renowned fics that I've just never bothered to read because they're "this pairing" or "that AU" or "that character-centric." Sometimes taking the plunge into unfamiliar territory reveals a much more expansive story which is much closer to home than it would have seemed from both the way it's discussed on reddit/DLP and the fics with which it's often recommended.

This was my recent experience with linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and its sequels. It's not close to the top of my favorites list, but I enjoyed it despite my initial hesitance. I noticed that my general impression from reading recommendations, (i.e. the fic's "aspect"), was very different from my reading experience. For example, I was always under the impression that Pureblood Pretense was a primarily character-centric fic about pureblood Hogwarts and the complications of gender swapping. Instead I was blown away by the magic creep and the massive Potions element.

I'm looking to see which fics that you feel similarly contain a large, non-spoilery, important element that's not usually discussed or implied in recommendations, or a particularly well-done plot point that's unusual for the genre in which the fic presents. /Note that I'm not asking for fics that don't fit their description or genre tags on FFN or AO3/. Instead I'd like some opinions on fairly popular, often recommended and discussed fics which are often pigeonholed into one or two genres or sets of tropes, but may encompass other genres for which they're not known.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
