Maybe this has never been done before because of how horrible Umbridge is, but I'd like to see a fanfic where she actually improves the state of Hogwarts - getting rid of Binns, reforming the DADA curriculum, etc. Thanks!


** A well-intentioned Umbridge? Holy shit, that's almost more OOC than a good Voldemort or evil Weasleys!

*** I mean if you remove/change the dementor attack (which is attempted murder in canon) and change how she behaves during Hogwarts it doesn't seem like an insane divergence. It feels like exactly the type of thing you expect fanfic to explore.

*** Tom Riddle can have some beneficial goals, without really being /good/. Consider the Pureblood Pretense series, where he's pushing for a law that would promote marriage between half-bloods and pure-bloods, but forbid them to marry muggle-borns. He's both trying to preserve their culture /and/ trying to mix in enough fresh blood to stave off a magical illness caused by inbreeding, while disguising his intentions so the pure-bloods don't dig their heels in. Partially sympathetic goals, but he's genuinely bigoted and cruel.

Or what about a Voldemort who wants to become dictator of the world in order to end existential threats like nuclear proliferation, but still wields the Killing Curse like a flyswatter? Yes, he's from Methods of Rationality.

So it's not unthinkable that Umbridge could achieve some good things for the wrong reasons. All you really need is to tweak her prejudice against part-humans, so she's more objective about Hagrid and Firenze (and there are plenty of valid reasons to question Hagrid's teaching, although Binns is certainly worse), while keeping all her sadism and close-mindedness. And maybe dial back her "read silently and nothing else" classes so they include learning defensive magic that is considered to be totally safe. Eg "Harry is a Dragon, and That's Okay" has their textbook including a complex and difficult stunning spell that carefully measures the exact force needed to stun the target and uses no more than that, and a similarly complex shield that carefully neutralises attacks instead of letting them ricochet.

**** That'd be changing one of their fundamental character traits and creating what is effectively a new i.e. original character with the name of a canonical one.

***** I've read and enjoyed plenty of stories whose premise was "What if X behaved differently?" Eg linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff; Sympathetic Properties; Benefits of Old Laws). Seems like a perfectly legitimate basis for an AU to me. In the case of Pureblood Pretense, it results in a very interesting world, where Riddle is a dangerous opponent, who comes closer to ending Harry's life than canon Voldemort did, and yet he isn't usually /directly/ trying to kill people and can sometimes be the lesser evil.

Adjusting some aspect of Umbridge's behaviour seems like it has the potential to be quite interesting, too. She can still be convinced that Dumbledore is deluded and out to take Fudge's job, she can still be sadistic and rude and bullying and obsessed with cats, just taking away the prejudice against part-humans and making her a little more focused on actually improving the curriculum. Giving Hagrid some useful feedback instead of pretending not to understand his speech - while perhaps still making insulting notes about him. Zeroing in on Professor Binns, who really does need to go, while potentially still putting Professor Trelawney on the spot. There are things that can be done.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** Linkffn(insidious inquisitor) is sorta like that. Umbridge is allied with Amelia bones and only pretending to like fudge. It's a short one but isnt that bad. Honestly wish there was more
