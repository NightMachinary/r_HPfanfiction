So, recently I got back into fanfiction and decided to start writing again. I started writing up a world-building outline to reference to help keep things consistent. One of the topics I decided to include are the different categories of magic and spells. One of these is obviously the Dark Arts, something that I never felt the books gave a good, detailed explaination on. I've seen a couple of good fanon ideas, the most popular being that Dark spells are spells without a known/direct counter (Ex: The Unforgiveables, the only counterable one is the Imperius, which is just willpower, not a counter-curse, and Sectumsempra, as it's a spell created by Snape and presumeably only he and possibly a few others know how to heal it), spells that somehow damage/change the caster (Ex: murdering with the Killing Curse damages the soul, making Horcruxes turn you animalistic and insane, and most Dark witches and wizards are pretty mentally fucked up), or that "Dark" is a vague term for "evil."

While I was thinking about ways to categorize Dark Magic, my first thought was that it could just be any spell intended to cause harm to people. I know the whole argument about "well, the levitation charm could be used to harm someone because you can levitate them out the window and kill them," (a pretty common fanfic argument to justify using Dark Magic) and therefore many nornal spells can be "Dark" under that definition. So, I figured that harming someone should be the main/intended use. The main problem I ran into was that, should I use that definition, pretty much every offensive spell is Dark Magic, and I wasn't sure how to go about justifying how a bunch of school kids were technically performing the Dark Arts whenever someone started slinging jinxes or curses back an forth in the hallways. So I went to the HP wikia site to see if there was a clearer definition of the Dark Arts that came from somewhere outside of the books (like Pottermore). I figured if there was (I didn't think there would be considering the lack of consistency in fanfic and the lack of info in the books) I could either use it or change it to fit my story. It turns out that there's a fairly clear, canon definition to what the Dark Arts are.

They're exactly what I had defined them as. There's three levels of Dark spells: jinxes, hexes, and curses. Dark spells are just spells that negatively impact the victim. Jinxes have a "minor inconvenience," hexes have a "moderate inconvenience," and curses have a "major inconvenience" on the victim. So jinxes are the "least worst," and curses are the "most worst." So basically everyone in the series uses the Dark Arts. What's more is that very few Dark spells are taught in Hogwarts, so the majority of jinxes, hexes, and curses are self-taught by students.

So, what are your guys' thoughts on this? Do you think that JKR was just trying to give the Dark Arts a resonable definition after completing the series and accidentally made everyone a Dark wizard/witch? Or are the Dark Arts just not as big of a deal in canon as people seem to make them in fanfic? Personally, now that I think about it, I can't actually remember characters in the series being super anti-Dark magic, just more against the Unforgiveables and dangerous/deadly magic in general. I think I'll be sticking to this definition of the Dark Arts for my fanfics for the foreseeable future.

Edit: Also, if anyone has any examples they remember from the books where someone is vehemently anti-Dark magic or says something that conflicts with the definition, let me know. I'd find it interesting if they don't realize it's something everyone uses or if JKR didn't realize it herself when writing.


** I remember there was a bit of scoffing that Durmstrung taught Dark Arts instead of just DADA like Hogwarts, with the vague notion of it being old fashioned for allowing that, and of course Lily is deeply critical of Snape using dark magic, with the suggestion of them doing something terrible to Mary McDonald.

Tbh I like the fanon explanation better, since the way canon talks about the dark arts and the dark witches and wizards, it implies really messed up things going on, not just jinxing someone to dance or have pimples, but like the entrail expelling curse. Needlessly cruel, excessively violent, or something with criminal intent makes more sense as a definition of the Dark Arts.

** One way to explain it is to see Dark Arts and any other branch of magic as a qualification given to magic by the ministry. It stands to reason that use of the Dark Arts is regulated and prohibited in the law. It then doesn't become an academic debate, but rather just something that is classified.

There are other similar explanations you can come up with that doesn't necessarily involve the nature of the magic used.

** I think one of my favorite fanon descriptions of dark vs light magic, is that dark magic is based on emotions, and light magic on calculated logic - so for light magic, you would need precise wand movements, precise pronounciation and mental discipline to get a result, while for dark magic the most important thing would be to concentrate on the emotion the spell is taking power from very hard - like wishing to hurt someone for the cruciatus. I especially liked how this definition made the patronus into a dark arts spell :D

*** I strongly disagree. My headcanon tells me that all spells can be affected by strong emotions. By your definition the lightest magic would be a spell which required picture perfect precision and the darkest magic would be wandless magic as it only requires emotion/intent. The implication being of course that accidental magic and wandless magic would be considered dark. Additionally a person improving their ability with a particular spell e.g. Wordless -> Motionless -> Wandless would suggest that a spell can grow increasingly darker. Neither of those implications ring true to me

** I don't view Dark Magic as a technical term with one true clear definition, but a concept that exists in magical society, but is regarded differently by different people.

A lawmaker in the ministry might classify spells into dark and non-dark to define different legal consequences for the user of the spells.

A healer might make the distinction based on the reversibility of the damage caused by the spell.

A Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher might just classify Dark Magic as the methods used by possible attackers that students should learn to defend themselves against.

Another might make the distinction based not on the spell itself, but on the intent of the caster. In that view, Snape's use of Avada Kedavra, that is universally regarded a dark spell, might not be considered an act of Dark Magic.

** I like the idea of the tiered system of jinxes, hexes, and curses. I don't think you really need anything more. Think about it like the gateway argument with drugs. There is a school of thought that says you should never drink alcohol or smoke a cigarette because those act as gateways for further vice. Trying a cigarette leads to trying pot leads to harder and harder drugs as well as the ancillary crimes often found associated (violence, theft, etc). Some people buy into that argument completely.

But then many people scoff at it. After all, if everyone who enjoyed a beer or smoked a cigarette became a hardened criminal and hard drug user, the world would be a VERY different place then what it is. These people will argue that correlation does not equal causation. Just because the VAST majority of hard drug users "got started" smoking as children does not mean that smoking leads to hard drug use.

EXCEPT sometimes it does.

--------------

Going back to the topic of the Dark Arts....

Many, many, many students in Hogwarts cast dark spells. A Jinx here, a hex there. Sometimes a curse flies through the halls. For most of those who do, their use of the dark arts will never progress beyond those simple jinxes and hexes. Many probably stop completely once they are out of school and in the work place. Sure, every once in a while you might end up stressed out by a situation and need a fast response, in which case a jinx might fly from your wand. But just the one, then back to being a responsible adult instead of a rebellious teenager Hexing in the boys room (as it were).

On the topic of Lily and Snape, she was very against the Dark Arts (that is something criminals do) and against Snape practicing them (he was hanging with a bad crowd and engaging in the same sort of behavior they did). To Lily, Snape practicing the Dark Arts with that crowd was like seeing her friend who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks and had the occasional smoke he stole from his parents start hanging out with the stoners and trading smokes for joints. He didn't think it was that bad (it was basically what he already did), except Lily KNEW some of those kids also liked to snort coke and shoot up....and how long would Snape be able to hag out with them if he didn't also participate in the harder stuff.

Dark Arts don't have to be emotionally addictive or magically coruptive in order to be feared. All they need is an association with the wrong crowd, a correlation with degenerate behavior, and an easy enough way to flirt with them as a child.

Pot was outlawed in the United States primarily on the back of anti-Mexican sentiment and anti-black bigotry. In every elementary school in the country we have a DARE program (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) which teaches kids not to do drugs, starting with the "gateway" examples of alcohol and tobacco. All the kids go through this program, even through they have parents who drink and smoke, see it on tv and in movies, and probably know at least one minor (sometimes a sibling) who does the same thing.

AND THAT is the Dark Arts.

*** I find that JKs classification of magic was fairly lazy. It's a very ministry way of thinking. Dark magic in the books also seems to encompass most types of ritual magic, sacrificial magic, and even a lot of grey area spells.

I prefer a lot of fanfictions ideas about magic. Eg prince of the dark kingdom, out of the night, the golden needle, the lie I've lived, Hogwarts battle school, Harry Potter and the accidental Horcrux, and blindness.

They all have a lot of different ideas about magic and showcase a lot of different kinds/schools of thought. I think one of the major differences between these and canon though is that you realise it's very hard to classify magic. A lot is about intent.

Interestingly, I think that more recently we can see magic changing in JKs world too in the fantastic beasts series. It doesn't seem to be about spells anymore (or as much). Most characters now seem to just have the ability to wave their wand and make things happen. Although, there are of course occasional spells.

**** In reference to the movies I think it is important to keep point of view in mind. The books are firmly in Harry's POV with a more or less age appropriate perception and understanding of what is happening.

Even though Harry is the protagonist of the movies, he is forced to share the POV with the audience. It is still shaded by his age, but is fundamentally altered by the loss of the internal perspective and our ability to externally watch.

On the subject of Dark Arts, I have no problem with alternative view points and enjoy some of the named stories. That said, I really prefer it when a story is able to expand on the world as opposed to adding things out of whole cloth.

** Perhaps go with something along the lines of Dark Magic not being affected by healing magic, requiring a specific countercurse like Sectumsepra. That would leave plenty of useful combat spells for the light side while making a pretty clear distinction on why some spells are dark and some not.

Or, to quote my own "No Longer Alone"

#+begin_quote
  "The Dark Arts are mostly a catchy phrase for 1001 ways to kill a person painfully. Out of the whole lot only the killing curse, the Cruciatus, Fiendfyre and a few variations of the blasting curse are useful in a fight. Black Magic is part of rituals and usually comes with an immense cost for the caster. Everything else is just bloody showmanship. Why anyone would use a withering curse when he could just outright kill is beyond me." (Andromeda)

  "Because the Death Eaters are sadistic bastards who get off torture and mutilation. Mad-Eye showed me more than one memory which made me throw up. They had a few from Karkaroff and what they did to that little - " (Nymphadora)

** I always figured dark magic was particularly violent curses like entrail or sectumspra, or magic used for dark deeds like resurrecting people (LV in GOF).

Perhaps a better analogy is that dark curses seem like an AK47 compared to a knife or pistol of less dark, or non dark magic. If you get shot with certain types of high velocity/high powered automatic, or even semi-automatic, weapons in the leg and it hits your bone, it will rip the bone up into shreds and that leg will very likely never heal completely. You have a much better chance of recovering and walking again if it's a hunting rifle, or pistol that shoots the bullet that hits your bone.

TLDR: My friend in medical school was showing me an article about how extremely violent and destructive certain weapons are to the body and the x-rays were very disturbing.

  ‘Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?' she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. ‘You need to mean them, Potter!

I think Bella's explanation says everything we need to know, the truly dark spells require more than words and wand motions to work properly. I'd say the patronus is an example of a light spell, while most spells are probably "grey". Most can be used with either intent but don't have the emotional components to be classified as dark or light.

** One interesting thing regarding curses is that even they aren't really that much worse than jinxes and hexes. Hermione used the Full Body-Bind Curse on Neville in the first book when her, Ron, and Harry were trying to escape Gryffindor Tower to go after Quirrell. Yes, Hermione is the best in her year but nowhere in canon do we get the impression that Hermione's Full Body-Bind Curse was out of the ordinary for a student her age. Meaning that its not unusual or "above average" for even a first year student to know a curse or two. Harry and Ron had no qualms with it, and they are typically more anti-dark magic than Hermione is throughtout the series.

Yet hypocritically, Sirius of all people said to Harry that he should have used the Conjunctivitis Curse on the dragon's eyes. We know Krum used this curse because Hermione tells them (and us, the reader too) about what Krum did. Yet if most curses were really as dark as fanon makes them out to be, why would Sirius of all people be saying he would have suggested Harry use dark magic in the Triwizard Tournament? For all Sirius knew, such a move could have hurt Harry's reputation even moreso. What makes it worse is that Sirius (and James) bullied Snape for basically their entire Hogwarts years because Snape liked dark magic, yet Sirius is the one suggesting Harry should have used a curse to defeat the dragon rather than a charm (like what Fleur attempted) or even using Transfiguration as a distraction (like Cedric did).

I feel that fanon often exaggerates what dark magic is, making dark magic out to be this mysterious art form that isn't taught at Hogwarts whatsoever... even though Hermione and Draco knew a curse in their first year (Full Body-Bind Curse and the Leg-Locker Curse respectively). Not every curse is as dangerous or twisted as Fiendfyre or the Unforgivable Curses. I imagine most curses would be stuff similar to the Full Body-Bind Curse, a spell which doesn't wear off unless the countercurse is performed, meaning that if nobody undid Hermione's spell then it would last forever or until she died.

Unsurprisingly, Rowling is very inconsistent when it comes to curses. Hermione's Full Body-Bind Curse on Neville is considered normal and not a dark spell, yet Draco's use of the Leg-Locker Curse is considered dark despite being an objectively weaker spell that only binds the person's legs (rather than the entire body). The Unforgivable Curse are portrayed as an evil form of magic worse than other curses... but not when Harry or any of the good guys use them. When Harry needlessly uses Crucio on Amycus Carrow (rather than use Stupefy), its not considered dark. When McGonagall of all people uses Imperio shortly afterwards, its not considered dark. Yet Draco's Imperio usage in HBP is considered dark. When Harry or any of the good characters use dark magic, nobody cares. If a villain, or even just an dislikeable character uses dark magic, then suddenly the narrative paints them as being a dark wizard.

The ONLY exception was Harry's use of Sectumsempra on Draco, when McGonagall basically told Harry he could have been expelled, but even then, Harry doesn't face any legitimate punishment for nearly killing another student on Hogwarts grounds. If any other student had done that to Draco (i.e. Ron, Hermione, Ginny, etc), they WOULD have been expelled from the school. Remember that Harry never told McGonagall or Snape that Draco was trying to use the Cruciatus Curse, so as far as they know, Harry was the one who escalated the fight by spilling blood. Yet because Harry is the protagonist, the chosen one, and Dumbledore's favourite student, he gets off basically scott-free given any other student (especially a Slytherin) would have been expelled, if not arrested.

*TL;DR: Hermione and Draco both used dark magic in her first year. Every Hogwarts student learns jinxes, hexes and curses from their first year at Hogwarts. Sirius is a hypocrite for suggesting Harry should have used dark magic on the dragon. Ginny likely learnt the Bat-Bogey Hex at Hogwarts. The narrative only considers a spell to be "dark magic" when the spell is done by a villain or dislikeable character. If any other student used Sectumsempra or a comparably dark spell against another student and been caught red-handed like Harry was, they would have been expelled or even arrested.*

*** Draco's use of the Leg-Locker Curse was considered dark because he was using it solely to humiliate Neville for his own amusement, while Hermione just wanted him not to get in their way.

Harry's use of the Unforgivables is an example of their desperation and being driven to extremes by the war.

*** I really don't agree with your TLDR and don't get how you came to these conclusions? Of course it is still dark magic when Harry or McGonagal use an Unforgivable spell, but they were fighting a war at the time - it was hardly a usual day.

Also, when Neville returns to the Gryffindors after Malfoy hexed him with the Leg-Locker Curse nobody mentions Dark Magic or that Malfoy is a dark wizard because of it, or anything similar. When Harry uses Sectumsempra, Snape says "Who would have thought you knew such Dark magic." Then Snape gives him Detention once a week until the end of the year, McGonagal agrees and tells him he is lucky he wasn't expelled. Probably because Harry was the BWL and they kind of needed him around.

Similarly, Draco wasn't expelled in the same year, although he put Rosmerta under the Imperius and Katie Bell was in the hospital for a long time because of the necklace Malfoy had her carry. - Also because of the circumstances at the time. Just like in Harry's case above.

*** I think Lily was angry that Snape was creating spells like Sectumspera, which was the equivalent of an AK47 compared to a revolver. Even Harry is horrified at how violent the curse was after he stupidly used it. Also, using dark magic on a dragon when your life is in danger is probably different from creating dark magic to use on other students.

People on this thread are really downplaying how severe the effects of the known dark curses are in HP.

** You could sort them on the requirements to cast the spell. Yes, you can hurt/kill somebody with wingardium leviosa, but to cast it all you need is correct pronunciation, wand movement etc.

To cast dark magic, you actually have to want to harm them. We see this with the killing curse, it requires pure hatred to cast, cruico requires you wanting to cause severe pain.
