Actually I really don't remember much of it at all.

I know that Sirius and Harry play a large role in it.

The Fic has at least one sequel I think.

Harry is Dark but not evil.

Harry has a brother who is claimed to be the BWL and as a result James and Lily dislike him.

Eventually Harry kills James in the DoM.

Harry creates a third side in the war separate from Voldemort and Dumbledore.

If anyone has any idea, that would be awesome.

EDIT: I FOUND IT! [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5460551/1/Midnight-Sun]] and the sequel [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256924/1/Darkest-Night-Shadowed-Dawn]]


** You could try [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor]] by Lightning on the Wave. It has some of the same elements, and it's a good read.

** I'm looking around, but looks like we could use a little more help :)

Is Harry the main character? Is it first or third person? Are there any pairings?

Do you remember when you read this? Do you know what site you read it on? Was it popular/did it have a lot of reviews? Did the author write author's notes?

Was there ever an attack on Godric's Hollow? Was Voldemort defeated? Were James and Lily abusive towards Harry? Is the brother Harry's twin, or is he older/younger? Did the brother have a unique name? Do the brothers get along? Did Sirius adopt Harry? Is Sirius friendly with James and Lily? Are Ron and Hermione around? What about Draco? Is Harry in Gryffindor? Is the BWL in Gryffindor? Did canon events still happen (sorcerer's stone, reopening of the chamber of secrets, etc.)? Can you remember any events that occurred before/after Harry kills James (ex: was Harry a certain age? did it take place during a school year or over the summer? was it during the 5th year events at the DoM -- with the prophecy and whatnot? was it at the end of the story?)?

Does the story span all 7 years? About how long is the story? How many chapters are there?

Anything you can give is useful!

** There is also a fic I remember that is similar to that with Harry's brother called Daniel. I will think about the name for a bit, but that might help you search. Good luck!
