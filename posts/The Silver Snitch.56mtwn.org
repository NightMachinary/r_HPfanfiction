Does anyone remember that site? Was the archive ever uploaded anywhere? I was such a huge fan of it and I know some authors have uploaded their fics elsewhere, but I wondered anyone ever had an archive of it.


** Unfortunately I don't think it was ever uploaded anywhere after it went down. The most recent info I can find about it is a livejournal post from early 2012, where the owner said she's still having no luck getting the site back online.

And by that point people were already concerned about the archives being irretrievable, so sadly I don't think there was ever much chance of it being backed up and whatnot.
