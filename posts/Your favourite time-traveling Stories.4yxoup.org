  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

*** That was so entertaining. Like in a really nice wacky, kooky, and what-the-hell just happened sort of way.

I have a few hiccups with it, but it was mightily hilarious. I died guffawing when they were like /"We will, we will rock you."/

And seriously, in the epilogue they still don't have any inventiveness for names. Also where are Hermione and Neville. Or at least Seamus and Dean? Should had mentioned them, at least, since they helped Ron and Harry.

Thanks for the rec.

I also like Magical Relations linkffn(3446796) It doesn't involve time travel but it is an AU in which Dudley goes to Hogwarts as well. It still focuses on Harry, but his years at Hogwarts are different. It's definitely one of my favourites.

And two more of my favourite time travel fics focus on the marauders era:

James Potter time-travel - linkffn(10623702)

  Time Travel. It's the end of the Battle of Hogwarts but the price has been high. The Golden Trio dearly wished that they could have done more to save lives and fate decides to grant their wish. Follow them as they redo their years at Hogwarts, starting from First year and work to make a difference in the wizarding world. All while trying to keep their true selves a secret.

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. An accident throws Hermione back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now, with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over?

** Neither of them are complete but quite good fics.

Words fail <-- is the most believable Harry/TMR fiction I've read. Though it's not been updated since 2015 I still think it's a pretty good read!

A new life <-- has a Marry Sue-ish HP. However it deals with a realistic transition of Harry into the past and gives Harry's powers a believable growth than a super-powered Harry right from the beginning.

Linkffn(6592361) Linkffn(4345742)

These are not my absolute faves but still good...

*** Yay for slash :p

*Words Fail* is really enjoyable and believable. Their relationship is so heartwarming despite all of the twists and turns and semi-angst. I also like the friendship, too, since it paints that Slytherins aren't evil, but just complicated people and doesn't erase their qualities either. (All of those things make me dread for him becoming OldSnakeFace, though.)

Thanks for the recs.

*** Thanks, mate. I really like *The Lesser Sadness.* Especially its illustrative tone. When most writers spew spells left and right, but the author really describes the battle scenes. It's brilliant and captivating. [[/spoiler][But I don't see why Dumbledore is so quick to trust him...And Harry is so reckless with his new-founded powers and time. Or maybe the author just wants to speed up a little bit. The romance is pretty... romantic. Her appearance is a bit abrupt, but the manifestation from their conversation to their /thing/ is gradual as can be. In a short amount of time.]]

I'm curious to how the story will be unfolded since there's two more chapters, but it feels short. Maybe the length will be longer?

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Most of my favorite names are already mentioned. Here's a few:

Linkffn(5725656) - Tom Riddle & crew travelled to future. Has a prequel where Harry travelled to past.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Turning of the Sun) - Harry was sent to 70's after the events of OotP. So he has no knowledge of Horcrux.

Linkffn( To Shape and Change) - Snape travelled back. Probably my favorite Snape mentor fiction.

Linkffn( All Was Not Well) - This one is wish fulfillment kinds. Loved it.

Linkffn( Whiskey Time Travel) - has an interesting starting. Shame abandoned.

Linkffn( Chasing The Careless Traveller) - liked the beginning. Still very early to comment about.

Linkffn( 8149841) - do over fic. Slash. Interesting plot.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

  AU past OP-After Harry is thrust back in time, he has to survive his final years in Hogwarts and live his new life around people he knows will become Death Eaters. Can he beat his prejudices and give people a chance, or will he crumble under the pressure?

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

  Albus Dumbledore was too late. Someone else managed to defeat Gellert, leaving chaos and too many questions behind. Tom Riddle, who recently graduated from Hogwarts, was fully committed to become the greatest Dark Lord of all time, chasing immortality and surpassing Grindelwald's legacy. It's too bad that Unspeakable Harry Potter had something to say about that. HP/TR. Time travel

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?

  Harry was massively disappointed in how things were going after the final battle. Nothing had changed, it only looked like it on the outside. So he decides to change the past to prevent certain things from happening. Being the Master of Death has its perks. Time-travel, Harry / OC
