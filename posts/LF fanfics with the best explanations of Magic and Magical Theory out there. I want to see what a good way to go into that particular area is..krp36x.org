** linkffn(Blood Crest)

Does explain pretty different magics and how they work. It's done in a convincing almost real way. Plus it is a really amazing read.

** The bot seems to be down, but The Arithmancer is easy enough to find, and has a /lot/ about spell crafting, especially in the sequel.

The Pureblood Pretense series has a fair bit of advanced potions theory and techniques. Also delving into the nature of magical cores, which are a vital part of the story (if you dislike the idea of them, it's not for you).

And there's a fair bit about rune sequences in Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay.

** The fic that shall not be named, by Noodlehammer, while horrible for the racist and misogynist views, actually does magical theory stuff pretty well.

** A lot of Taure's fics.

Alexandria Potter and the rewrite Victoria Potter have excellent magical theory and explanations.

*** No, not really. I like HPMoR, but Harry doesn't actually discover much about the nature of magic (although he does discover that his initial guesses are off the mark). It has a lot about ethics and logic and a fair bit about tactics and strategy, but much less about magical theory.

**** Point taken. I suppose that it's more trying to figure it out, but failing.
