** While I'd like to have the subject explored a bit more in canon, I do not think it was necessary for Harry to do this.

Rowling created the character of Harry and the story very carefully. One of the messages she wanted to send is that love, not fighting eventually trumps evil.

If Harry had went on to become a dueler, she would either have him made really bad or really good (because in the end he defends the dark lord - average doesn't really work with that), beating opponents far beyond his age. This would have had many effects and generally changed Harry's image, especially in the first two years.

And being bad would have taken away from his victories against Voldemort, since they would have seemed even luckier as they already do.

And instead of being a boy going on adventures when needed fighting would suddenly take a central role in Harry's life, and I think Rowling wanted to avoid that.

Additionally Rowling probably wanted to strengthen the sense of 'belonging' inside Gryffindor, and being part of the Quidditch team instead of a lone-wolf-dueler helped with that as well.

So yeah, magical dueling would have been great, but actually I'd rather have seen /Ron/ doing it and be successful. That would have helped Ron's perception of usefulness and added to his character, while still giving us the details of dueling.

Honestly, good or bad, Voldemort is going to kill him in a straight fight, Harry could easily be average at dueling and it wouldn't change much. Voldemort was a genius at magic and very dedicated to it. Harry is neither of that. And that's not even going into the decades' gap of knowledge and experience between them.\\
Even if Harry was a genius, he wouldn't stand a chance, barring some external circumstances.\\
Having Harry killing Voldemort in a straight duel is just dumb.

**** Yeah, but you know how Voldy's defeat kinda feels random?

The more average in terms of fighting ability you make Harry the worse it gets. Rowling cleverly works around this issue by never showing Harry too much fight - so nobody knows he sucks.

***** It has to feel random. That's the point. Having Harry average doesn't change much IMHO. But you could have him not being average. You could have him being good or even very talented at it without excess, and the fight wouldn't go that differently.

I don't think it would hinder the point Rowling was trying to make. In fact, it would probably even strengthen it.\\
Look at it this way, despite all the training and talent Harry may have at dueling, it's still only (ok, mostly) the sacrifice of his mother, love, and contrived circumstances that lead to Voldemort's death.\\
Having Voldemort totally owning Harry despite Harry being very good at dueling would actually serve the plot if done right.

Of course, you can't have Harry slacking off to please Ron like it happens in canon if you have him being good at dueling since being good at dueling kinda means you're good at magic in general.\\
A passion for dueling could just be the catalyst Harry needs to actually start putting some effort into his studies.

But then we would constantly need to change POVs, there's also the fact that Ron's character is built up as a Quidditch fanatic, Harry really only gets into it due to peer pressure and the fact that his father was a Quidditch player. So you have far more to work with when Harry's the protagonist, as you don't have to take away the predisposed bias to Quidditch as he doesn't have one in the beginning.

Harry loves Quidditch post-philosopher's stone, but before that it was more of a "well I'm kinda good at it so I like it" type situation.

****** Harry first time flying.

#+begin_quote
  Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared, air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him - and in a rush of fierce joy he realised he'd found something he could do without being taught - this was easy, this was wonderful.
#+end_quote

Harry being /pressured/ into Quidditch

#+begin_quote
  ‘You're joking.' It was dinner time. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak-and-kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it.

  ‘Seeker?' he said. ‘But first-years never - you must be the youngest house player in about -‘

  ‘- a century,' said Harry, shovelling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. ‘Wood told me.'

  DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch pitch at seven o'clock for your first training session. Professor M. McGonagall

  Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.

  Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory, where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch pitch where he'd be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.

  Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling - he swooped in and out of the goalposts and then sped up and down the pitch. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.

  Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow.

  Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downwards after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too.

  Harry left the changing room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now - no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him on to their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.

When Harry gets ostracized from Gryffindor for losing so many points.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Resign?' Wood thundered. ‘What good'll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can't win at Quidditch?'

  But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn't speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him ‘the Seeker'.

That was just him flying a broom. You can dribble a basketball, doesn't mean you have to try out for the NBA. Do you enjoy using mindless anecdotes that don't mean what you say they mean?

**** The last thing was an afterthought that stemmed out of Harry simply not being the best fit in what I think Rowling wanted.

Of course, you can change this for your fics. I just wanted to explain why I don't believe it would have been good for the original books to add it.

** harry is good at DADA, but he is never shown as someone who loves fighting for the sake of it. basically, your first paragraph is akin to "why would some one play soccer when they could be a boxing" quiditch seems really cool, you get to fucking fly. one could just as well ask why would he rather stand on the ground and shoot flashes of light when he could fly.

That said I do think FF authors underrate the complexity and diversity of magic used in combat.

No, it's like saying why pick Soccer when your destiny hinges on a final Boxing Match to the death, wouldn't actually learning how to box help?

You can fly without Quidditch, there is no permit that says, "you may only fly this broom for Quidditch".

  . one could just as well ask why would he rather stand on the ground and shoot flashes of light when he could fly.
#+end_quote

I would choose the flashes of light mainly because a battle of Magic against Magic is more badass than using a Broom to speed towards a small little ball. There's also the fact that Rowling intended Quidditch to somewhat help Harry. She herself says "with the reflexes of the years of playing Seeker" multiple times, and I just think to myself "wouldn't it be more useful if he had the reflexes of a Duellist?"

**** Another misconception you are falling under: his destiny did not hinge on fighting at all (at least to his knowledge) until the 5th book when he discovers the Prophecy. He's just a school boy who sees things happening around school and investigates. It only happens to be involved with voldemort by chance, in reality. He doesn't come in in the first book thinking and knowing "I'm going to defeat voldemort in the future". He comes in and thinks "I am at school. I want to make friends and have fun". So he flies in class, realizes he loves this, then is asked if he wants to play the sport that involves flying, and his response is essentially "hell yeah, I want to do that. That looks fun".

Also, the dueling club was dumb. It was brought back by Lockhart, which means it didn't exist in his first year. It then disbanded that very same year. As far as I can tell by researching about it, it was never brought back (Other than in the video games). It wasn't brought back because they're wasn't really any interest, as far as I can tell.
