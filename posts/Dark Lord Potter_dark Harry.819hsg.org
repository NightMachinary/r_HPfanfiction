Looking for dark lord Potter/dark Harry. Not stories where he causes mayhem or just kills for the hell of it. But stories were the British wizard worlds need to ‘get with the times' but the Ministry is holding on to the past. Stories where he might be a Lord (Potter/Black whatever) and uses it to change the world, but is labeled dark by Dumbledore or others. Not the old lord Potter trope, but good stories where he tries to change the world. Please no Ginny pairing, slash is fine as long as it's not too graphic. Bonus if Hermione and/or Ron is still best friends with him. Recently read linkffn(2703901) and loved their take on Dark Lord Potter.

Please don't recommend stories like ‘the sum of these parts' or ‘emperor'. Tried reading those and just couldn't get into it.

Thank you!


** Hmm. I can't say that he's a Dark Lord, but he certainly is far from good. He has no moral compass and causes mayhem by [[/spoiler][turning the entire freaking world into a desert so that only the strong survive.]] It may get a lot of hate around here but linkffn(Worthy of Magic by Sage Ra) is well written, has a very unique character in Harry, as well as great characterization of Daphne. Overall a fic that I think you'd like, even though he isn't a "Dark Lord" per se but still manages to change the world just because he thinks its right because he can. Ron and Hermione do not have large roles in this fic, there is no romance in it either.

** Not exactly a Dark Lord (or labeled as one) yet, but he is a Lord twice over in linkffn(Made of Common Clay) who is planning to depose the Ministry and literally change everything because he believes the system is broken and eradicating it is the only way.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.
