Ok, so, is there such a thing as a novel length Post-HW HHr fic that doesn't also have any of the following: Weasley bashing (Ginny and/or Ron can be salty but that's abut the limit), Goblin culture and finance woo, lordship and politics woo, a re-hash of a threat of existential dread (i.e no Death Eater resurgence under a new leader, no "Voldemort didn't really die" or, if time travel/dimensional shift is involved, having to fight the war again).

In other words, just good old wholesome slice of life stuff starring normal people having normal (in the context of the Wizarding World) problems. Does it exist? Aside from the above caveats, anything goes in terms of plot, setting, other ships and so on. Non-Magical AUs also of interest.


** With [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/overall-post-on-breakfast-in-new-york.html][many caveats]] “Breakfast in New York” by Radaslab linkffn(5141159). I don't know why I have so love-hate relationship with it. I see so many problems with this story (see the linked reviews), but still I have to return to it again and again. The battered wife syndrome?

Yes, Ginny is the antagonist and Ron gets through rather tough growth curve, but I wouldn't call either of their sub-stories a bashing.

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
