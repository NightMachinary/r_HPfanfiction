** Check /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5490079/1/The-Little-Veela-that-Could][The Little Veela that Could]]/ (350 784 words, complete). I haven't read it all the way through, but what I've read seemed pretty nice.

Short synopsis: Harry dies protecting Fleur's little sister during the Triwizard Tournament, and his soul\spirit gets connected to her.

Also, can you link to the right Eye of the Beholder story? There seem to be several with the same title.

**** This is relevant to my interests.

Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/Equal-and-Opposite][Equal and Opposite]]? It's not Harry's sister, but close enough.
