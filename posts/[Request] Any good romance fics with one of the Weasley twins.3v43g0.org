  After the Unbreakable Vow incident which forever altered the state of Fred's left buttock George decides that maybe a slightly less dangerous vow might be just as much fun. Things don't quite turn out exactly as planned. FredxHermionexGeorge, but not twincest. Please remember, YKINMK. Ratings for language, mature content, some violence, and Umbridge.

  It took awhile, after Fred's death. It took awhile for George to re-open the shop, to admit he needed Ron's help. And it's taking the longest while for George to live again. -COMPLETE-
