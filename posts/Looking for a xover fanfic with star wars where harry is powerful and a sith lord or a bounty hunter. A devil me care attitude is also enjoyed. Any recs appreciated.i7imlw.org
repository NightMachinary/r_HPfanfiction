** Linkffn(The Havoc side of the Force by Tsu Doh Nimh) is a very funny (in a devil may care for I definitely do not kind of way) fair warning, the level of violence starts high and then progressively skyrocket.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

**** Well there is this [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][one]] if you haven't read it where he's a bounty hunter (kind of) but it's sadly not been updated for a while but more carefree (if that's the right word) then power of the dark side

** Um, Broken Chains. linkao3(4623819)

I'm not that familiar with star wars and ended up dropping it before I finished, so no idea how a fan would take it.
