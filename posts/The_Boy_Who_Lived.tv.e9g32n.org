In a universe where Grindelwald and/or Voldemort's shenanigans broke the Statute of Secrecy but, somehow, everything seems to be okay.

With tech and magic integrated near seamlessly, of course magic finds it's way to budding video sharing sites across the Internet that all the kids are watching. Spell tutorials, potions pranks, much of the Hogwarts/Beauxbatons etc. experience has been video'd and published online for the world to see. Honestly, and very quickly, the world was desensitized to the existence of magic and advanced tech and the Earth just kept spinning.

Until 1996, when a small group of Hogwarts students are sent a link to a livestream taking place...

The video quality is good, the audio a bit choppy. It is taking place outdoors at what seems to be a stretch of railroad track. The streamer a young man, uproariously scruffy black hair and the brightest, greenest eyes behind the glasses he carefully takes off and puts away. He's smiling a lopsided grin and proceeds to sit down on a foldable chair on the tracks and begins a casual conversation with his chat. The usual really: thanking them for follows, donations and subs whilst trying to tell a story about how his owl who stole his bacon at breakfast.

A bit odd but intriguing enough for most of the newbies to not click off and move on with their day. He has a pretty smile and oozed an odd charisma with his dry wit and snarky remarks, forcing a laugh out of a few of the confused new comers. Said newcomers occasionally asking the chat what the deal was and growing ever aggravated at the snooty remarks about "ignorant newbs" and the "just wait for it".

A tension is rising, an uncomfortable sense of apprehension that the new viewers are completely unable to shake or put their finger on.

Until the sound of a horn reverberates through their earphones, the boy's face splits into an excruciatingly large grin and he is flattened by a freight train barreling into him at 60mph. He and his chair dragged across the metal and stone; a red stain and shattered plastic left in the vehicles wake...

His smeared remains left on the tracks for the disgusted, horrified and morbidly intrigued patrons of the stream. Even in this day and age, livestreaming a suicide is not the most revolutionary of ideas and many are wondering why on Earth they were so vigorously encouraged to tune in. Well, the many who had not screamed, thrown themselves away from their devices and NOT returned to the screen.

The many left waiting...

Until, nearly ten minutes later when, dishevelled and caked in blood and filth, the boy returns with a goofy smile on his face, plops himself back down before the camera on another plastic chair.

And explains he's in the market for a cameraman...

《P.S. If you haven't, read two manga called Ajin and DeadTube, the idea is inspired from there.》
