*** My brain immediately went to The Mask, the Jim Carrey film. Just imagine Draco putting on the mask and turning into... Errr... A nice person maybe? It does bring out what you have been suppressing so...

He doesn't put it on. He knows he has enemies who think he's an idiot but Draco Malfoy grew up in the Wizarding World and knows that he shouldn't try unknown magical artifacts on himself. He'll ask someone, maybe Burke, for information on stone masks. Or maybe Imperio a stranger to try it on. It could just be a harmless curio but with his family's history, he seriously has his doubts.

*** That's... Actually what Dio did with the mask at first. He thought it would just be a really inventive murder weapon, but the random hobo he tried it on turned into a vampire and would have killed him if not for a stroke of luck.

**** Some time later...

So that was the secret of the stone mask. Draco seriously contemplates how it can be used to kill Albus Dumbledore, a task given to him by the Dark Lord. Perhaps he could send it as a gift in the hopes that Dumbledore would wear it? It's almost as bad as his cursed necklace and poisoned mead ideas but Draco is running out of time already. For a split second he thinks of putting it on so that he would become a vampire and gain the vampiric abilities to kill the Headmaster. The stone mask lies innocently on Draco's bed as though it were mocking him. Draco shakes himself to get the idea out of his head. There must be some other way for him to complete the Dark Lord's errand!
