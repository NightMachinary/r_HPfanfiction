I saw this Tumblr post about the chamber of secrets becoming a secret party room for students, I was wondering if y'all know of any fanfics where the chamber is used for something (besids Harry's training lair) kind of like the room of requirement. IDK it just sounded cool. ðŸ˜ƒ


** Alternatively, also looking for fics where the RoR is used in really creative ways

** I think I've read something where Harry wants to turn the Chamber into a club room. Maybe linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff)? not sure though

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
