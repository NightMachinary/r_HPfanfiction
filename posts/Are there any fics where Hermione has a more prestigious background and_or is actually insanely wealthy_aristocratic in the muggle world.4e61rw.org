I know the BBC Sherlock fandom has a couple of fics where John is secretly/actually related to nobility etc. and I was wondering if there was an equivalent here for Hermione.

I'm not looking for Hermione-is-actually-magical-through-distant-ancestry (but feel free to link those anyway if the option listed in the title can't be found).


** from the great Rorshachs Blot, Author of 'Lord of Caer Azkaban' has a story in the works called 'Watch' where Hermione is extremely rich, her parents are near royalty and her uncle is 'Uncle Jim' hinting at James Bond. She is also a Spark and mechanical/scientific marvel ala' PhilFoglio's Girl Genius' at the moment it is only available in the files section of the [[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/CaerAzkaban/info][Caer Azkaban]] yahell group. Story is up to 28 chapters at the moment.

***** If it were a few years ago I would have agreed with you but it has grown into a bit of a too repetitive, self- congratulatory hivemind. Outside a core cadre of old- timers those 15k members don't post much. And what is posted falls roughly in five categories, five updates by the old- timers, which are generally quite good but sometimes a bit samey; fics by newcomers, which usually are forgettably generic rehashes with a generous amount of bashing of the usual unliked characters there; praise for posted fics with sometimes a bit of spelling correction for variety; repeats of old arguments regarding some facet of canon reaching foregone conclusion in accordance with the well-known position of all involved; and off-topic tangents, which can go anywhere and turn quite interesting.

  An unexpected connection is found between Hermione and Professor Snape, but that's only the start of her headaches. Being her father's daughter is one thing. Being her mother's daughter is something else entirely.

**** you can wing it. English is not Tellur's native language but he does really well, some odd phrasings here and there, but readable. The Granger's nobility is a side issue, mentioned for a bit then not a big part.

This one is very Hermione-centric, and a Dramione romance. It's an 8th year fic also, and completed with a finished sequel as well. It's one of my favorites.

** Care of Magical Creatures! It's revealed in the first couple of chapters that Hermione's father is a Baron. I will note this is a Marriage Law fic with a union between Snape and Hermione. I will note this is one of the best Snape/Hermione stories out there, and has been recommended several times on this sub.

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=16930]]

"Voted Best New Author (Lumos), Best SS/HG Romance (Amortentia) and Best SS/HG Angst (Diffindo) in The New Library Awards. Seventh-year student Hermione Granger decides to marry the one eligible wizard who did not ask for her--the horrid but powerful Severus Snape. All is not sweetness and light. Be careful what you ask for. Or, as has been said by many a wise witch, "Marry in haste; repent in leisure." MLC"
