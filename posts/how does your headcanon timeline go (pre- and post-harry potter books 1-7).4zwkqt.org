How do you imagine the timeline developing in the HP-verse? What happens before during (from other POVs) and after the Harry Potter series?

My headcanon timeline goes\\
The Marauders year [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10754389/1/The-Marauders-Year-One][1]] & [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11476656/1/The-Marauders-Year-Two][2]] ->\\
Harry Potter books (with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3728284/1/In-the-Words-of-Ginevra-Molly-Potter][In the words of Ginevra Molly Potter]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] as alternative POV's) ->\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] ->\\
Dudley's Daugther year [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9827875/1/Dudley-s-Daughter-Year-One][1]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10330044/1/Dudley-s-Daughter-Year-Two][2]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12033213/1/Dudley-s-Daughter-Year-Three][3]]\\
*I will personally curse the unlucky git who mentions the Play-that-shall-not-be-named*


** The Voldemort Era - 1970s - Because a serial killing, mass murdering terrorist is much more of note than a bunch of pranksters.

The Lipstick on Pig Era - 1980s - Because peace was an illusion.

The Harry Potter Era - 1990s - Because Harry Potter was the most controversial figure of the decade.

The Harry and Hermione Granger Era - 2000s - Because Ronald Weasley was only an Auror for 2 years, and someone must have made all the changes to the Ministry of Magic that JK Rowling told us about.

I'm confused. Is this Cursed Child canon? I hadn't heard about Ron leaving the Aurors or any changes at the Ministry.

**** Ron leaving the Aurors to help run WWW was revealed in one of JKR's post-canon writings about the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Gcheung28/New_Rita_Skeeter_Article_from_J.K._Rowling_on_Pottermore][2014 Quidditch World Cup]]. It's a good little read if you haven't already done so.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

  Who'd have thought that the man who tore them apart was the one who brought them together? Head Girl Lily Evans is determined to keep her distance from the Marauders but that's easier said than done when James is Head Boy and in love with her. It also doesn't help that she becomes rather attached to Sirius during an eventful Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson...
