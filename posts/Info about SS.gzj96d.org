Since the Sarcasm and Slytherin series is now listed as authored by “orphan_account” I can only assume that it's never going to be updated again lol. Did it ever become clear which Potter is the BWL?


** It's been under orphan account for quite a while now, but apparently [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/anonymousmagpie/pseuds/anonymousmagpie][this person]] is claiming to be the author (sunmoonandstars) so... maybe in the future?

** No it was not made clear from what I remember. However there is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) which is way better than S&S.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** I like Prince better too. James and Dumbledore in S&S were one dimensional villians, which I'm not a fan of. In Prince they at least had some explanation for their actions and were a bit more developed than mustache twirling villians. And IIRC the Slytherin/Pureblood wanking was significantly stronger in A&S than it was in Prince.

**** Yah S&S turned into a DE apologist fic and also at least James's scumbag lawyer in Prince had a reason to be a scumbag.

***** ... the entire point in reading that kind of story is the pureblood stuff and rooting for that side. PoS fails precisely because it half-asses this and tries to be self-aware. I know when I start reading the story what I'm getting into. I don't need references /in/ the story telling me that the story actually is nonsense.

****** PoS is not trying to make you side with the DEs it is trying to show how a Slytherin would have fought them instead. PoS never pretends that the DEs aren't monsters. S&S for me failed on two counts it did not explain why Harry decided not only to not support the cause his mother fought and died (for him no less) but instead decided to work for the side that killed her and why Hermione Granger was happily regurgitating DE propaganda slogans.

******* Yes. Like I said. The point is for Harry to /not/ fight Death Eaters. That's literally the premise of the trope and the entire and only reason to do the "Harry gets abandoned" nonsense to begin with. Asking why the story does this is like asking why Harry doesn't get involved with Hermione in a H/G story. It'd not be /that story/.

Of course, in the case of S&S the other side is so braindead that any reasonable person would fight them, but rolling your eyes at dumb "light side" (terrible moniker) wizards is still more fun than whatever PoS tries to do.

******** I get that the point of S&S is to do that but it fails to explain why this is happening. What PoS does is focus on how Harry et all are trying to win a war before it starts (or at least put their side in the advantageous position before the war starts). Which I personally enjoy a lot.
