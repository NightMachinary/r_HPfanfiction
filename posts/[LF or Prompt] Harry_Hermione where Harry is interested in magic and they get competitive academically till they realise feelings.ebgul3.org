I've always felt that Harry, who'd been raised muggle, would have been a lot more interested in learning magic. Not theory and books like Hermione, but practical magic so like reading books to find spells and magic he could learn. It's just pretty fuckin stupid that he's so fascinated by all this magic world but then just lazes around with Ron and does nothing. What they learn in classes shouldnt be enough for him especially if it's easy for him to learn it. I get it if purebloods like Ron who grew up with it aren't interested in what's been around them all their lives. Harry though should be more. Cannon Harry makes no sense. Fix him.

I ship Harry/Hermione, sue me. Ron is completely terrible to Hermione from the get-go and then he's just using her for study help and acts horribly towards her over the years. Then being together makes no sense. Harry and Hermione though, they care for each other. Ron's also a terrible friend and influence on Harry.

I imagine with Harry excelling in practical, and Hermione in theoretical and each of them having favourite subjects they excel in, they'd get a bit competitive in a friendly way until they eventually realise they have feelings for each other. Could be for cute fluff after they get together. I'd imagine their competitiveness starts around the troll incident.

Honestly I could care less about the main plotline (Voldemort and all that), so if it's barely mentioned, all the better. I want happy cheesy lovey dovey studying couple with fluff and school drama/adventure shit


** Agreed - Harry's wishy-washiness whenever someone isn't possibly dying is rather irritating. Explained, but irritating. Such a waste to have a 'Stranger in a Strange Land' beginning but with a stranger that's utterly disinterested in exploring any of the strange land. No other reason why it'd take him four years to find out what a Death Eater was. If your family was killed by a terrorist, you'd actually ask to find out what that terrorist group was called rather than waiting until someone happened to bring it up. A fic that would meet that, along with the rest of your prompt, could be fun - unless it went full Indy!Harry trope-fest. :)

I've seen a couple of fics like this, but the academic interest usually tends to arise after an intervention from someone - most often either Sirius or Hermione - rather than being of Harry's own motivation and it tends to have him also being theoretical too. They're almost your request, but just far enough that I figured I'd ask if you were willing to bend on the practical Harry-theoretical Hermione partnership and competitive aspects before I bothered trying to find the links. I've read a couple ones where Harry and Hermione get competitive, but they tend to end up being Hermione-bashers or Harry-Daphne fics.

I think Stanrick might've written one or two with this kind of competitive tone, but I don't recall any particular focus on schoolwork - the one about the chair was quite fun, even if he's a little too wordy for, uh.., words.

*** It's not even that. I just feel like if at 11 someone told me I can do magic and I'm going to magic school, you'll find me buried in a library learning how to use magic for literally everything or anything cool. I'd hate the essays or reading too much theory but I'd jump at chances to do new spells. Harry and the rest of the muggleborns not doing that is frankly disturbing.

You're right about those fics with smartharry always being triggered. That's why I mentioned specifically what I think: Harry has the desire (he's practically muggleborn and has interest and curiosity in magic) and he has the talent especially for the practical aspect of magic (hello, patronus? Even Hermione said as much when she convinced him to start the club in 5th year).

But yeah I hate when they splash too much indyHarry or Angsty Harry. Actually maybe my prompt isn't clear enough. I really don't care for the usual plot or bad guys, I want fluff and magic school.

I've read a lot of the categories you e suggested and while I enjoyed them, I was frankly irritated at the hermione bashing. None of what I read came close to what I want. I want competitiveness but they're still friendly and eventually turns to romance on all the cheesy ways.

**** Agreed again - Jo's everyman-Harry/like-real-school-but-magic! thing really went overboard there. Both Harry and the other muggleborns should be way more enthusiastic about, or at least more interested in, learning literal magic. I don't know if I think it's stupid myself - Harry's disinterest being semi-logical due to his abuse and the book being written from his loner perspective meaning that disinterested obliviousness ensures he notices nobody else's enthusiasm - but it's definitely a missed opportunity on Rowling's part to flesh out her threadbare-patchwork worldbuilding.

I'm not expert in the terminology, but I think the term you're looking for there is 'slice of life'. I've done some googling elsewhere and it really seems to be a lacking category in HPFanfiction, which is a bloody miracle in and of itself in this million-million-fic fandom. It's really popular in the Critical Role fandom (a D&D podcast with famous voice actors), so looking there might give you some ideas on terminology to google/use in future reddit asks (or re-edits of this one).

You might try remaking this post on the Hermione-Harry fandom reddit (HPHarmony) since they'll be more interested in that pairing specifically. If you find anything elsewhere, please do post links here! You've come up with a great prompt I'd like to read some stories of myself. :)

****** Whoever said it was an insult? - That was a joke; it was totally an insult. :) And, oddly, one of the better compliments we can give 'ole Ro. All of us have something in canon we utterly despise - the worldbuilding, the characters, the plot, the character development, the near-complete lack of continuity, the horcruxes - but we love the series anyway. It's oddly appropriate, IMO, given the message it preaches. I can't really recall any other author who has managed that quite so well.

Thank you! Good hunting to you. :)

** Here, have a snippet inspired by the prompt and the subsequent discussion! It's neither here nor there, and I haven't really thought about how Harry and Hermione might evolve form their canon-ish configurations to this one, but hopefully someone will find it amusing.

--------------

They met in an unused classroom to decide the winner of their latest contest.

"On three, we say what we did to Malfoy in this round," Harry proposed.

"Okay."

"One!"

"Two!"

"Undetctable Flatulence Curse!" shouted Harry.

"Unending Flatulence Potion!" shouted Hermione.

Harry laughed. "Great minds do think alike!"

But Hermione was frowning. "Don't those interact?"

Harry's eyes widened in realisation. "Oh, right... And it should activate in about---" he scrambled to look at his watch "---ten minutes!"

"If they activate together, his colon will burst, and he'll die, Harry!"

"We have to find him and cast the counter-curse!" He laid out the Marauder's Map on a desk and waved his wand. "I solemnly swear I'm up to no good!"

"That thing is such a cheat!" she said, not for the first time.

"Hey, I promised not to use in our contest, and I don't! Anyway," Harry pointed, "He's in his dorm, in the Slytherin dungeons. /Colovaria!/" he started changing his uniform colour.

Hermione took the cue from him and started casting on her uniform as well, nonverbally. (Showoff! thought Harry. But then, he /had/ managed to cast the Flatulence Curse on Malfoy without alerting him.) She turned to the door to run, but felt Harry's hand on her shoulder. He was holding his shrunken-down Firebolt.

"/Engorgio!/ Get on!"

And then they were flying through the hallowed hallways of Hogwarts, protected from braining themselves against the ceiling or splattering into a wall only by Harry's reflexes. Hermione was maintaining the Disillusionment.

"Do you know their password for this week?!" Harry shouted over the wind in their ears.

"It would have just changed! Hey, stop next to that Slytherin up ahead!" She pointed with her wand.

Said Slytherin, a random second-year minding her own business, froze as she was hit by Hermione's nonverbal Full Body Bind Curse. Only Hermione's Levitation Charm on her clothes kept her from tipping over, as the witch looked her in the eye. "/Legilimens!/"

So she can't do nonverbal Legilimency yet, noted Harry as he waited. Of course, it could also be that she didn't want him to know that she could. He filed that thought away for later consideration, as he heard Hermione speak again.

"Got it. /Obliviate!/" Hermione turned back to Harry and grabbed the broom with both hands. "Let's go!"

Soon, they were hovering in front of the dorm entrance.

"The usual drill. Stay sharp and remember to duck. The ceiling dips in a few places."

Hermione rolled her eyes. "I know. Here goes... 'We must secure the existence of our people and a future for Pureblooded children,'" she spoke through her teeth.

Both readied their wands as the door to Slytherin dungeons creaked open.

--------------

They were back in the Gryffindor dorms, changing out of their disguises. In a few minutes, McGonagall would burst into the dorms and have Prefects perform a headcount, and it had to be at least plausible that they'd been in the dorm all this time.

"Curse reversed?"

"Check." Harry nodded. "Antidote administered?"

"Check."

"I guess we've saved Malfoy from farting himself to death."

Hermione giggled despite herself. "Such big heroes we are. Witnesses?"

"I counted seven."

She nodded. "I Obliviated seven. Portraits?"

"Spray-painted them on the way in. I think we're in the... Mfff..." Harry's legendary reflexes failed him as Hermione grabbed him and pulled him in for a kiss, one that he eagerly returned.

It was a good long time before they finally separated. "Let's call this one a tie."

"Yeah."

**** Glad you liked it! I still don't know how they'd end up in a pranking contest: Harry I could see taking after his father (in both good ways and bad), but how would Hermione get to that point?

One idea---going with your plan to minimise Voldemort's impact---is that Ron might still set Hermione off on Halloween, but without the troll in the dungeons, they never become friends, and Hermione is actually rather bitter towards Harry and Ron, annoyed with them for pissing away the House Points she works hard to earn. She ends up tutoring Neville and maybe hanging out with some Ravenclaws.

As the second year rolls around, she finds herself in an unenviable situation: after Lucius chides Draco for losing out to Hermione in marks, she becomes a target of Draco's bullying campaign in her own right, and not just as "Harry's mudblood sidekick". Around the same time, she makes the mistake on informing on the Weasley twins and becomes a target of their pranking campaign as well. When the authorities prove unable to protect her, she takes matters into her own hands and works to stay ahead of the bullying and the pranks and eventually retaliate to discourage future attempts.

Meanwhile, Harry has his own (much friendlier) rivalry with the Twins, as well as his own enmity with Draco; but whereas the Twins have each other and Draco has his Slytherin flunkies, neither Ron nor Neville want to get involved. So, both Harry and Hermione are on their own most of the time, and find themselves reluctantly trading favours and teaming up. However, they can barely stand each other, so they never form a permanent team, despite finding that they work together increasingly well, and are increasingly attracted to each other romantically.

I imagine the incident in the scene taking place around their fifth year.

That fic is a fic that I really, really want to like, but alas, not much actually happens in it, and all of Hermione's amazing feats are in the past.

#+begin_quote
  Although I think Harry having grown up being bullied
#+end_quote

Point of order: Ron was not bullying Hermione. Ron was reacting to two months of Hermione's condescention and hectoring. Every unpleasant encounter that preceded his outburst had been initiated by Hermione, when Ron would have preferred that she leave them alone. Indeed, he did not even intend for Hermione to overhear him, and it was the fact that his words were a genuine expression of his feelings, rather than an attempt to hurt her, that made them so powerful in hurting her.

#+begin_quote
  would have apologized much earlier. They'd still not become friends because of Ron being Ron.
#+end_quote

Ron or not, why would an apology make them friends? At best, they would go back to status quo ante, with Hermione a bit less eager to "help" people and Ron a bit more wary of badmouthing other people behind their backs. Harry's and Ron's lazy and reckless attitude---which irritates Hermione---wouldn't change, and while Hermione might (only might!) tone her hectoring down and try to be less of a "nightmare", she wouldn't be doing it to ingratiate herself with those two. The duo and Hermione would still have next to nothing in common and no reason to become friends.

#+begin_quote
  Edit: maybe 3rd or 4th they become a bit more friendly as Ron shows his petty jealousy streak?
#+end_quote

What's there to be jealous of? Assuming no Voldemort meddling again, Harry isn't even in the Triwizard---unless he manages to actually trick his way into the Triwizard, which is unlikely at that stage. (Hermione might have a better shot if she goes for it, due to being more versatile, but that wouldn't trip Ron's jealousy.)

If you want Harry and Ron to grow apart, just have Harry take after his father to get into pranking. In fact, say Sirius is exonerated in this continuity: he might end up pushing Harry in that direction. Ron, however, has spent his childhood suffering under his two older brothers, and wants nothing to do with it.

Not OP, but Hermione should have stopped being around Ron long before. In the early books, she is a bitch - towards Lavender. The pet fighting would have been bad if she had NOT been right. She handled the Firebolt wrong, but that doesn't go against Ron. Crookshanks never killed Ron's "rat". Ron was just accusing her and starting fights. We never see him apologize, nor is it even implied.

Ron's jealousy fit about Krum alone should have ended their friendship because he basically said that Hermione is stupid enough to be taken advantage of or is betraying her best friend, and he does so without any evidence. Nevermind him being rude to her before the ball.

Hermione goes brain afk in books 6 and 7, while Ron is at his best in 6, I am not going to deny that. And what she does in those books is wrong pretty much all the time (McLaggen, not believing Malfoy as a Death Eater, the birds). But Ron's earlier actions are unforgivable IMO, especially in book 4, and should have ended that friendship long ago.

The cat kept attacking him and Scabbers. There was ginger fur and blood on Ron's bed, and Scabbers disappeared. I don't know about you, but that looks like Scabbers was eaten or killed. Hermione even admitted that it's in cats' nature to chase rats.

Scabbers had been in Hogwarts for at least two years already (chances are he might have been there longer since he was Percy's pet) and there was no mention of cats or owls attacking him but suddenly you have a cat who is constantly out to get him.

​

They are prodigies. They study, research, experiment, publish their findings, and spend holidays abroad researching foreign magic. The whole time they are doing this, they are also pushing forward magical theory. A few parts are forced, but the horcrux situation is a unique way to do it.

​

Hermione is the more theoretical of the two, and Harry is the quickest to find the practical applications of stuff. But they are pretty much equal.

** So, basically, you want Harry with all of Hermione's talents and virtues but none of her flaws? :P

There is a fair number of fics like that, but I can't remember the titles at the moment. There's a fairly popular one that starts pre-Hogwarts, in which Harry and Hermione end up competing in a science fair. (Harry wins, of course.) It might be worth googling around for.

*** No no no. Hermione is Hermione. She loves reading and learning everything she can down to the detail no matter how boring. You couldn't beat Hermione at research or figuring out puzzles and clues .

Harry though loves doing cool new magic and will skim a book and kinda gets it and then tries to figure it out by doing it. If you ask him to explain how he did it he'll be like "I dunno, you just have to push your magic and feel it and then you do the motion and visualise what you want to happen"

They both still have their myriad flaws but they're both smart in different ways that actually complement quite well.

Honestly I think that without Ron or the constant death threats, this is what Cannon Harry is like. You can't honestly tell me a curious muggle raised 11 year old who's fascinated by magic just shrugs it off and only learns what's on the syllabus.

Isn't that even worse? You want your Harry to be so talented, he is able to do whatever magic Hermione can, but without putting in the hard work of studying the theory behind it. If you want them to be meaningful rivals, they have to be competitive /in the same domains/, and that creates a problem that either both have to do similar things to stay competitive or one of them has to be this amazing intuitive prodigy.

I can and I will, since that's exactly what an overwhelming majority of 11 year olds would do under the circumstances. IRL, we have amazing devices, like smartphones, but how many people (of any age) bother to learn more than the barest minimum needed to be able to make practical use of them? Especially when the first step to gaining a more than a superficial level of understanding is "Learn all these hard maths." By all indications, magic is like that as well. And, to an 11 year old, what was (literally) awesome quickly becomes ordinary.

Hermione's the weirdo who reads nonfiction books for fun and learns spells even if she doesn't anticipate having an immediate use for them (and we love her for it). Harry and Ron are the normal people---and, indeed, they get along with each other much, much better than either of them ever does with Hermione.

Speaking of Ron, the whole notion that Ron slowed Harry down strikes me as scapegoating him for Harry's failing to achieve some sort of uberwizardry that he was supposedly destined for. Harry's motivations are Harry's. He wouldn't suddenly stop enjoying Quiddich or start liking books if he never met Ron.

It wouldn't help that under a hypothetical rivalry, Hermione won't be nearly as helpful, so Harry's gains per hour invested in magical study and practice would probably be lower than in canon.

***** You raise some really interesting points that I'm inclined to agree with you somewhat. We do know that Harry was punished for scoring higher than Dudley so we know he had smarts and maybe that's why he matches his pace to whomever he's with.

Fair enough we don't tinker with smartphones but we do try to learn to use them in new ways with new apps and stuff. Surely learning new spells is like that?

I didn't mean an Uber intuitive Harry that can do any spell just like that! Although it's fair enough since that's how it came across. It's just I'm trying to drive across the idea that's pointed out in the books: Hermione learns by reading and perfection, Harry learns by doing and watching.

You're right his progress would be finished without Hermione there so maybe instead she finds them new spells and all and then they learn them together and sort of compete on who does it first and who does it better?

Also I always imagined Hermione has a talent for adapting and making new complex magic in New ways like those coins in 5th. Text messaging in the magic world haha.

About Ron, I still think he's a bad influence, a bad friend for both, and a bad match for Hermione. Sure, we all make mistakes but he continually makes them and it's disturbing how they keep forgiving him without real repentance.

******* Fair point about smartphones. I think I dated myself a bit with that post. However, even in the first generation to receive some newfangled thing, it'll still only be a tiny minority that will learn more than the minimum needed to use it.

As a thought experiment, if you took Harry and Hermione and kept their personalities fixed but gave them magical upbringing, do you see them investing significantly different amounts of effort into learning magic compared to their canon counterparts? I don't. Funnily enough, I see more difference for a Muggleborn!Ron, since he'd see magic as something that distinguishes him from his older brothers, whose Muggle counterparts would have all been valedictorians and gotten scholarships to prestigious schools.

I am almost certain that this is fanon. Harry outright brags about what scholastic achievements he has to Hagrid, before he knows that Hagrid is taking him away. Given how he interacts with the Dursleys, he'd probably study twice as hard just to spite them.

Sure, but, again, most people learn the minimum needed to make use of them---just like most wizards and Harry and Ron (unless extrinsically motivated) learn a spell well enough to make use of it (or at least not fail the class).

I don't think that's the case. Harry learns spells the way every student does, and in GoF, he's right there in the library with Hermione researching jinxes and hexes. Some specific ones (Patronus, Summoning Charm) we explicitly watch him struggle with and practice. He constantly complains about all the essays and similar work he has to do.

The only exceptions I can think of is Dark spells---Harry seems to have an easy time casting those based on just seeing them. However, I don't think it's a good domain for a friendly rivalry. Though, Harry and Hermione trying to outdark each other could be a hilarious crackfic in the spirit of Addams Family. (And, then, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ebgul3/lf_or_prompt_harryhermione_where_harry_is/][I went and wrote a snippet]].)

Also, this is more headcanon territory, but those strike me as a bit like the Dark Side of the Force: "Quicker, easier, more seductive." They are evil, corrupting magic that /wants/ to be cast. But, again, this is very much in the headcanon territory, though consistent with the plot and the spirit of canon.

Are there any other category of magic in which Harry displays this ability over and above his peers?

#+begin_quote

Now, I think that you're actually selling Harry short. Harry is plenty talented, and he'd do fine without Hermione, though probably not as well (assuming the same time investment) as with her. But, well, that's why students form study groups.

However, I don't think it could work quite that way if they are rivals. I can see a character dynamic in which they pass tips back and forth (especially from the most recent winner to the most recent loser), but what you are describing sounds like all the help is flowing one way. That's pretty much how it happened in canon, but they weren't rivals in canon.

I think that Ron and Harry reinforce each other's interests and habits, and one could make a case that Harry was the one who slowed Ron down. (It wouldn't be a very good case, but neither is the converse.) They are peers, whereas Hermione is a fussy self-appointed big sister to both of them.

That said, as far as matches for Hermione go, she could do a lot worse given what she wants to do with her life. Ron is a competent wizard in his own right, and his family indicates that he has good genes. She is physically attracted to him the way she isn't to Harry, and he to her. For political purposes, she needs a husband who won't overshadow her in the eyes of the public (so not Harry), while placating the old guard who didn't join Voldemort but still harbour some blood prejudice. By marrying Ron and taking his family name, she gets that.

****** Yeah except its an entirely valid view to have, even as someone who likes Ron. Harry liked books in canon, he literally was stated to have devoured his schoolbooks at first, and then that just stops. There are a few ways to explain that both in and out of the story, but its not even ‘bashing' to acknowledge him having a friend that doesn't like studying or reading might pull him away from it too.

Not all analysis of Ron's effects is bashing, not all critique of his actions are either. Folks whitewash characters all the time, including Hermione, but that is no reason to do the same to Ron.

******* There is a much simpler explanation. He was shown a glimpse of the amazing, exciting wizarding world, those books were his only contact with it, and he had nothing else to do at the Dursleys'. Once he got to Hogwarts, what was amazing became ordinary, the novelty wore off, and learning magic turned out to be a lot of hard, tedious work.

Children can ooh and aah at a soda volcano, but how many of them will actually stay interested long enough to study chemistry over and above what they have to do in school?

In short, /not/ staying preoccupied with something is the default human behaviour, no Ron needed. One may as well blame Harry for subsuming Ron's ambitions (remember what he saw in the Mirror of Erised!) by dragging him on dangerous adventures.

Well, to be fair, that analogy is kinda flawed. What an 11 year old getting a new smartphone will do is, start looking through the menus, tweak whatever settings there are, look around the play store, download a bunch of games etc. Basically, play with the phone for a while, explore it.

Learning a bunch of hard things is necessary to build a better phone, or create new apps for it.

It's not about writing new apps. Canon Harry never really does the magic equivalent of exploring the phone.

****** Granted, the smartphone analogy isn't the best one, and, like every analogy, has its limitations. In particular, tweaking the settings and installing apps is deliberately made as easy as possible, whereas writing computer programs or engineering electronic circuits is hard. I'll try to come up with a better one for future discussions.

That said, I think that the main point stands. Students are taught about what magic they need to know in class, and that's what Harry studies, unless he has an immediate need for something not covered in class. This is also the attitude of vast majority of students in vast majority of subjects---it is the typical behaviour. It is Hermione's attitude that's exceptional.

Now, this is me doing amateur group psychoanalysis, but I think that vast majority of people who wish Harry had been more scholarly and/or argue that Harry should have been more curious about magic actually have more in common with Hermione than with Harry; but because Harry is the lead character, and especially when the reader is male, there is a motivation to wish for or even believe in a more "scholarly" Harry. This sometimes even comes packaged with a resentment of Hermione, since she is what they wish Harry to be.

I used to seek out Smart!Scholarly!Harry fics as well. Then, over time, I realised that it takes a much smaller deformation of the character to make Hermione an action protagonist than to make Harry a scholar, so I switched focus to Hermione-centric and/or ensemble cast fics.
