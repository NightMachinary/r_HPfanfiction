Well, I've posted these in the challenge forum on fanfiction.net since I have no talent... At all... with writing, anyway if anyone chooses to write these, thank you for your time, if no one decides to or decides the ideas are stupid, so be it, anyway these are the ideas:

1.Harryy Potter/Doctor strange

Harry is raised in kamar-taj by either Doctor Strange or the Ancient One, how he ends up there is up to whoever writes the story, preferred pairing is Harry/Hermione, but will read any story as long as it doesn't have gay Harry (no offense towards any gay people, I just don't want to read it) the story could even be a wrong-boy-who-lived if the author wants it to.

1. Harry Potter/Venom

Harry goes to investigate a crashed ship near the dursley residence and finds out favorite symbiote.

Desired but not necessary:

Harry/Hermione pairing

1. Doctor who crossover

Harry is immortal (OPTIONAL) and ends up in the Doctor Who reality at Rose's workplace minutes before the auton attack How he got there is the author's decision but according to the Shakespeare code with the Harry Potter references,, it's not the same "reality"

How he got to the doctor who universe is up to the author

Pairing: doesn't matter to me, as long as Harry isn't gay

1. Fallout 4

Harry is immortal after the battle with Voldemort, and in an attempt to rid his immortality, he goes through the veil and ends up in sanctuary hills before the bombs. And due to his immortality, he survives the vault, Harry can't become a ghoul due to his immortality.

Author chooses whether Harry helps the sole survivor, or leaves him/her to his/her own devices

If the author pairs Harry with anyone, no gay Harry, please.

If anyone reads to here, thanks for your time, and if you decide to write one of these, please post a link in the comments so I can find it. Thank you for your time, and have a good day ðŸ™‚
