Think about it. The golden trio all go through the veil. Harry after Sirius Ron after Harry and Hermoine after both of them. They then have to navigate around Skyrim and Nirn in the midst of the storm cloak rebellion with the Dragons, forsworn, werewolves vampires and so much more. Harry could be Dragonborn or Ron or Hermoine or they could introduce a new character who is Dragonborn. It would be so ducking sick!!


** You could also have some hilarious moments with Nazeem and Camilla the whore

**** "It's you!" Yelled Harry after taking in the creature before him.

"Me?" Asked confused Nazeem.

"Yes you! Malfoy, how did you get here? Did you too use the veil?"

"What are you talking about, you barbarian. Clean your teeth first, it stinks of mud!"-Sneered Nezeem after taking in the three bedraggled ruffians before him.

But then he noticed something. Bushy hair, green eyes and crumbs of bread on his lips.

"Y-you!" Nazeem finally recognized the wizards before him.

Harold PotrÃ©r, the wizard on par with best of archmages.

Harmony Ganager, arguingly the person who knew the most spells in current Skyrim.

And finally Ronius Waslai...

The sidekick.
