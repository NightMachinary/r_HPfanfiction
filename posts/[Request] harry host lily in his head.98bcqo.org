title. Bonus point if tom is also in his head.


** Oh my God, /yes/. Perhaps the Love Protection works like a reverse-Horcrux in this version, with the caster leaving their soul (or half of it) with the target to protect /the target/ as opposed to /themselves/?

** There's a fic where he has all the Marauders (minus Peter) and Lily in his head and they help him overcome some sort of zombie apocalypse. It's an interesting read

  Post-DH, Pre-Epilogue. The Wizarding world is slowly recovering, and Hogwarts is re-opened. Harry Potter struggles to become a good DADA teacher, but it's hard when a large portion of his mind is commandeered by four familiar Marauders. Slash and het.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12760426/1/Her-Mother-s-Love][Her Mother's Love]] by inwardtransience has almost exactly what [[/u/Achille-Talon][u/Achille-Talon]] described, albeit with a fair amount of AU involved (also female Harry). Has tons of world-building as with most of the author's work, currently mid year 2.

  Albus still didn't fully understand what magic young Lily had wrought that night. At the time, he'd only been grateful her noble sacrifice had earned them peace, however temporary. He should have looked into it deeper. He should have done something. Unknowingly, long dead, that arrogant girl might just have ruined everything. (independent!GWL, black/white magic)
