**** I don't have THAT much of a problem with the name Hadrian. Names for mages are all rather odd by our standards, and a society with a major link to ancient Rome like they have through their pig latin likely would use more Roman names. You can't castigate Hadrian and excuse Albus and Severus.

I have a problem with the next part, which is the Hadrian Jameson Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-Gaunt-Stark-Ravenclaw. That's messed up.

EDIT: Albus Severus, however, remains an entirely stupid name for different reasons.

******** See, I never got that bit of fanon. For it to be a full thing that checks out, a real forced reproduction law and not just a reason for Harry to have a harem, the story would have to be very different already by the time Harry gets to Hogwarts. For example, one of the Weasleys would be a Prewett, while Bellatrix would have two children before Voldemort's fall - the second coming slightly before she would torture the Longbottoms into insanity, potentially leaving her unable to do that.

Like I really want to believe people use that trope for the plot, but deep down I know it's just the author wanting to write his own spank bank.

However, I am also a big proponent of "read and write whatever the fuck you wanna read and write," so I don't really care. It just throws me out of the story and I won't read fics that use that name cuz it's not what I'm wanting to spend my time reading.

** This pisses me off beyond words because, for a start, THEY AREN'T BLOODY LEMON DROPS. Dumbledore, in the first scene we meet him in, offers McGonagall a /sherbet lemon./ She refuses because, as the book says, she felt the occasion far too serious for frivolity such as sherbet lemons. That's actually a hilarious interaction which gives information about their personalities. But fic writers have turned "offers lemon flavour sweets" into Dumbledore's main (and sometimes only) personality trait.

And don't get me started on the "he laces them with veritaserum so he can catch out Lord Potter Black Peverell Slytherin Gryffindor Merlin King of the World." My god, they were a minor narrative device used by JKR to show that he was a) a bit eccentric and could be childlike and b) au fait with Muggle stuff to give a later contradiction to the characters of other wizards. They aren't ways of poisoning kids. It's not that deep fam.

In the American film release of Chamber, when McGonagall opens Dumbledore's office to send Harry there, is the password "lemon drop" or "sherbet lemon"? It's sherbet in the UK release, which always makes me smile as it's a callback to the start of Book One.

** It shows up in canon, and it's a quirky trait for Dumbledore. People like having him be a bit silly, again a canon trait and what we tend to see from Dumbledore in the earlier books. Through fanfiction osmosis, that has resulted in this being an easy trait to throw in and feel like you're capturing that classic Dumbledore silliness.

Additionally, the password to his office is almost always a treat/sweet of some kind, including the lemon drop/sherbet lemon one (I think it's in book 1 that he offers it, then book 2 it's the password to his office).

More practically, it's also somewhat flexible. As a headmaster of a school for children, having some sweets would make sense for more trying situations (eg, if Snape dragged up a student for some minor rule breaking, it might help them compose themselves a bit). It gives some more muggle connections (since it stands out as distinctly non-magical), which can sometimes come up in a story. And for those that want to bash him, it's an easy avenue to add in potions or something else nefarious.
