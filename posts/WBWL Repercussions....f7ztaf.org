On that fateful day, Harry's twin brother Charles was falsely marked as the Boy Who Lived.

At the age of fifteen, Harry silenced the world by completing the Prophecy and defeating Voldemort in the Ministry atrium.

Now comes the really hard part: the aftermath...

James loved both of his sons equally, doing his best to bring them in to everything when they were younger (even if Harry was far less outgoing than his brother) but drifting to Charles and letting his relationship with Harry fall to the wayside.

Lily was a paranoid wreck after the attack, focused entirely on Charles and preparing him for his destiny. She had no time for Harry, *and made that clear far too many times,* as he wasn't the one expected to face Voldemort. The only attention given to her other child resulted in a vicious argument when he was discovered studying the Dark Arts. Lily likening him to her former best friend and truly shattering what could have been their relationship.

And Charles, the */Wrong Boy Who Lived/* as the Prophet called him these days. The truth was out, his life was a lie. He hadn't reflected the Killing Curse, Dumbledore had made a mistake all those years ago. Years of duelling training, Mum's strict schedules and massive mood swings, the deterioration of his relationship with his brother when the worlds shoved him aside to get to him. All for naught. His childhood stolen from him with nothing to show for it.

/• James gave himself the title of a negligent father./

/• Lily is wracked with guilt for the suffering she levelled on both of her children./

/• Charles has been labelled a fraud by the media and his "friends", left a bitter pariah to the public./

/• And Harry, suddenly gifted the limelight (something he never wanted) by turncoats who wish to ignore years of bullying and abuse towards him in order to curry favour./

The Potter family is in shambles. The Summer of 1996 is a quiet one at Godrics Hollow as the four of them have to somehow pick up the pieces and try to be a family again...

...if that's possible anymore.


** I like how Lily is the one that's “bad”. In a lot of WBWL fics it's always James who is the evil parent and the idea of him just trying to be a normal father to both and treating them equal while Lily is the “worse” parent is very interesting to me.

If anyone knows any Good!James Bad!Lily WBWL fics that would be cool.

*** It's honestly a concept that baffles me tbh. James is shown to be super nice and empathetic to those in his life (e.g. Remus and Sirius, he all but adopts them as family whilst in the Marauders despite their personal circumstances) but everyone focusses on how cruel he was to Snape and translates it to how he'd treat HIS OWN CHILD.

I'm not saying it's more reasonable for Lily to be the bad parent (cause it probably isn't) but I think it's a lot less of a stretch to find a reason for her to mistreat Harry in a WBWL scenario than it should be for James.

*** I'd like some fics like that as well. Canon Lily comes across as a bitch to me. James and Severus could do better.

*** I mean, I'd rather have /neither/ of them as bad or evil, and instead misguided. Having either parent behave like in the OPs description just feels weird TBH

**** I always wish to find a story, where both give their best, but one child just gets a bit more attention because they fell like he needs it, as an analogy to a family with one handicapped child.

Where they try to make time for Harry, but it feels like the other child just needs them a bit more, that they just have a bit less time for him and are tied, maybe they even try to include Harry in the training, but the focus in those moments is just more on the other one. Like new lessons are not about how far Harry is with them (either because he managed it faster or still struggles with a lesson), but about the other one.

And that Harry just didn't get much alone time with them, but family time

** Negligentia linkffn(10639968)

Not quite, but touches on many of the same themes. Harry is not the BWL. The fic deals with the aftermath of being 'The other Potter'. Two sequels.

  Six years after leaving Hogwarts, Harry Potter shares dinner with someone from his past and remembers some of the more important moments of his life. My take on the "brother of the boy who lived" story.

** linkffn(Too Young to Die) has consequences , though not technically WBWL.

linkffn(Antithesis) has some definite consequence, though a bit less direct than here.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
