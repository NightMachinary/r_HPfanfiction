I'm writing a story that involves people going back to Harry's fifth year (cliche, I know) because their own time has been destroyed by war. However, I don't know how to make the time travel work without using the CC method which has no consequences. This /will/ have consequences, including that they can never go back to their own time. Any ideas?


** The beautiful part of Harry Potter is its /magical/, so you really have endless possibilities. I'll list a few that I've seen or thought about.

Honestly just steal an idea from any dimension travel story that already exists. Readers really won't care how they got there, /but rather what happens once they arrive/.

The Veil. Only the master of death can use this as a mode of transportation. Consumes the Deathly Hallows, without the hallows one cannot traverse it so he is effectively stuck.

A ritual of sorts. Rituals are never really explained much in canon, so you've got a lot of leeway here. All rituals have a cost (my headcanon), perhaps the cost does not allow them to use the ritual again.

Harry was an unspeakable and some experiment went haywire.

Delenda Est uses a [[/spoiler][Black family heirloom, a hairclip to travel back in time. One must impale themselves with it]], you could adapt it so the cost of returning is their future life.

Disorder of the Phoenix is a currently updating fic that had a singularly unique way of transportion back to fifth year. The plot is meh, (I ditched it when he tried to force H/Tonks) but it is a unique take on travel back to fifth year like you wanted. linkffn(12813755)

#+begin_quote
  Seven years after defeating Voldemort, Harry Potter has been raising his godson, Teddy Lupin with the help of Teddy's grandmother, Andromeda Tonks. What will happen when Fawkes the Phoenix pulls this happy, war-weary family back in time for a chance at a better future. Set before the breakout from Azkaban in Order of the Phoenix. No paradox.

** No one cares. Skip the useless first chapter of nearly every time travel fic and just start when they're in the past and explain as you go. Make the first chapter from an outside perspective, Dumbledore getting everything dumped in his lap, or whatever.

** You should make it so that the time travel method is not reusable or usable by others who they inform in the past. A lot of the time the mechanism is not thought through so the best choice for time travelers would be to immediately go tell Dumbledore that he can prevent the Holocaust by reusing their method. There are a few ways you can do this. You can make the time travel the consequence of an unreplicable accident. You can make it extremely unethical. You can give it extreme magical power requirements. You can make it so people can only spread a minimal amount of information from the future - this would require handwavy physics. You can give Dumbledore ethical qualms about time travel for weird Dumbledorian reasons. Or you can ignore the plot hole entirely, as many good stories do. But if you're trying to make the time travel realistic, figuring out how to deal with this would be a very good start.

Actually, I just thought of a really cool idea. You could have your travelers go back in time, tell Dumbledore that he can prevent the Holocaust by reusing their method, expecting to blink into nonexistence after he leaves, only to find that their method of time travel works via alternate universes, and they are now stranded in a universe with a Voldemort but no Dumbledore.

** Whatever you settle upon, explain it at the end of the fic, not the beginning. Stories should be a journey of discovery. You don't have to dump all the information about why and how things are happening at the start.

** Instead of a time turner, you could try writing Harry going to the exact place where time turners are made. Or you can try incorporating the Department of Mysteries. There are actually a lot of other ways as well considering it takes place in a world of /magic/. The ones I listed are not that original now that I think about it. How about setting off some sort of curse in the Catacombs of Paris or in the Pyramids of Egypt or setting off an old curse in general? I don't think I have read a story like that before.

** Harry attempts to return to an earlier time but finds himself instead yanked to the far future. There, he is told that his timeline was destroyed soon after his attempt, and they rescued him in order to give him a chance to be useful to a different timeline.

"Why should I care what happens in a different timeline?"

"Spend some time there and I think you'll decide you like the natives enough to help. Otherwise you'll just stay here and sit around, feeling like an untrained monkey at the zoo since you know nothing about living in this era."

** Maybe the Room of Requirement. You could even throw in a house elf to be quirky. Basically, you have unlimited possibilities and most people won't care unless it adds to the plot. If you're only going to bring up the time travel method when they time travel then just skip the whole bit and brush over it in flash backs with vague rituals.

** Collect 35 Erumpet Horns and place seven at each corner of a pentagram. Then levitate them all into the air and let them drop while snorting a pile of time-sand.

The Erumpet Horns will blast you out of the timeline into the new one. Consequence is, of course, that if you don't succeed you'll just die in an Erumpet Horn explosion.

** my time travel fic (draw the curtain back for Venus on Ao3) had that: - he died (i had it be the death in deathly hallows, but it can be wherever) - magical nonsense had previously weakened the link between body and soul/magic - i said that it was frequent use of the polyjuice potion, but it could easily be an animagus transformation, a curse, etc. - he was really fuckin' angry and managed to catapult himself into the past when he was in Kings Cross Station b/c its Harry Potter, hes just Like That.

this worked cause: - its kinda wishy-washy and symbolic, so it allowed me to do all sorts of wishy-washy symbolic nonsense later - we already know that Shit Happens in the potterverse when u die, w/ the trains and dumbledore and all that, so 'accidental time travel' isnt too far out of the question. - its got enough scientific-sounding stuff to it that it doesnt sound like i've pulled it out of my ass (I hope) - i talked about 'fully self-transfigurative magic,' and 'degregation of the mind-body link' which sounds fully thought-out
