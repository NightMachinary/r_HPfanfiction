** ... why was this downvoted? It's never been a problem before, has it?

Anyway, that last passage was a bit of a curve-ball, lol.

*** Probably because it was just a post with a link and nothing else. If there was a post for every single time there was an update to a semi-popular story this subforum would be nothing but update posts and people looking for hermione/draco fics.

*** I really don't know. It was at +4 in 5 minutes,then at +0,but I figured someone just didn't like me,or the story.

The chapter was nice,if a little boring. What I'm really excited for is the story arc that will follow,because of how much potential it has. The AN said the next update should be soon, and I'm hoping that's true.

*** Most likely the fluctuating votes was due to the up/down vote algorithm that reddit uses. I've seen it happen in many other subreddits.

** Can someone explain the premise of Hogwarts Battle School?

I remember reading it a while back and really liking the inner-school stuff, but I don't remember if anything outside the school was ever brought up.

*** It's a story that's reminiscent of Ender's game where Hogwarts has been turned into a school primarily for combat, Harry is a Slytherin who is often being challenged in a variety of ways by those behind the scenes, testing his limits. It takes places almost exclusively within Hogwarts to this point, Harry at times feels trapped due to those pushing him even as he attempts to prove himself, to always come out on top.

It's a great story in my opinion and well worth the read, I particularly enjoyed this update.

**** Yeah I thought it was neat.

It's just that I didn't understand what they were fighting for (there was no connection ti the outside world), as opposed to many HP stories.

So very Ender's Game-like now that I Think about it

** It was a good chapter. I wanted the chiffhanger to be a little more original... but I was just so happy to see an update, that I don't care.

** Well, I don't remember anything that happened after Harry Brought Lightning, so I'll have a think about rereading the whole thing.
