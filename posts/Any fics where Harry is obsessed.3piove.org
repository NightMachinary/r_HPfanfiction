  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

Nos Tres Reges pulled their account from fanfiction.net by their own decision. I think it had to do with at least one of them going pro and being commanded to disassociate from fanfics by their publisher.
