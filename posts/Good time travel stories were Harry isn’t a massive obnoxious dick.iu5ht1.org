I like the time travel trope but somehow either Harry is always angsty and whiny or he just bashes on everyone. So I would like to request some good time travel stories with Harry having a personality that doesn't consist on being a brat. Any genre is good I'm ok with it being gen/slash/het As long as it's not a daphne/Harry story or a harem story were he is weird and misogynistic.


** Here:

face death in the hope: Harry accidentally time travels to the past after giving himself up to Voldemort during the final battle. He saves Regulus from the Inferi cave, and teams up with him and a few other people to destroy horcruxes. Good characters,No character bashing. Harry isn't Dumbledore's biggest fan, but I don't think that counts as bashing. (Harry/Regulus Pre-slash) linkao3(5986366)

you belong to me (i belong to you): Auror Harry wakes up in the body of 14yo Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who ended his own life. He returns to hogwarts, where people realise that he was not the same boy as before. linkao3(11270490)

I can't remember much right now, so I'll add some more if i do.

*** Thank you so much I looooove you belong to me (I belong to you) Harry is such a badass who doesn't take shit from Tom. But I haven't read face death in the hope and I've always wanted to read a regulus/Harry pairing so thank you for taking the time to put your recommendations üíïüíïüíïüòÅ

  ‚ÄúWhat I find absolutely fascinating,‚Äù Riddle said, stalking closer, ‚Äúis you.‚Äù He marched forward, backing Harry up until he was pinned to the cool wall of the common room. ‚ÄúDo you know why?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúNo. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.‚Äù

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely pleased. ‚ÄúThat. Right there.‚Äù One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. ‚ÄúNathan Ciro was a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...‚Äù

  He leaned closer, ‚ÄúYou look at me like you want to stab me.‚Äù After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.

*** Duuude I started reading the story you recommended and it's great! I love that there is no bashing and that its gen. I like the Harry's disbelief in the beginning on how absurd the situation he found himself in is. Also I like that the characters don't take themselves so seriously (no pun intended). Damm thank you so much!

*** Oooooofff can't stand bashing and arrogance! Its like people forget how forgiving Harry was in canon. I like Harry's compassion, forgiveness, and ability to see the bigger picture but it's like authors see this as a weakness rather than a strength. I particularly don't enjoy bashing because it reduces everything to a black and white scenario with no nuance. Also in my opinion Harry has always been humble so the added obnoxious arrogance only makes him look like a dickish version of James. Instead of contrasting him as a better person.

**** Yes Harry was arrogant sometimes in canon, like really thinking he deserved the prefect badge over Ron, but he immediately felt awful about it and scolded himself for "acting like Malfoy" and "wanting to ruin this for his best friend"! Canon Harry had his flaws, but he still overcame them and was a good person at heart! I can at least tolerate a character like THAT. But not an outright static jerk who never changes or anything.

***** Couldn't have said it better. There is a reoccurring theme here two things can be true at the same time people are complex creatures and expecting them to be one certain way is silly. Like Ron can be jealous but also a good friend. Harry can be stubborn as a mule and sometimes yield to his ego but still be humble in other ways. Thank you for your insightful comments üòäüôè

*** I just can't with Daphne/Harry she is written like the archetypical femme fatale and while there is nothing wrong with it, I have yet to read and author depict her as something other than a 2 dimensional boring ice princess. And also for some reason Harry gets extra obnoxious in those stories. No judgement to the people who like the pairing though. Maybe I just haven't come across a good story

I've made her a shy fat girl before, I've made her a nerdy bookworm, I've made her a freckled fashion lover, and in my latest fic she's an exuberant disabled kid. :) I refuse to let majority fanon dictate how I use my blank slate name of a character!
