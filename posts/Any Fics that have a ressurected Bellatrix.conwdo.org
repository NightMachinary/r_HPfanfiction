Either she really returns to the Living like Voldemort in Year 4 (yeah, i know, actually he was never dead at all, but he couldnt act on his own as well), so with a (her) real Body or she returns as an undead.

â€‹

I dont know, what direction such a Fic would go. If Bella resign and remain in the Shadows, because "her" side lost or her persona changes to a gray or anti-hero persona or she leads the remaining DEs (not necessary to ressurect Voldemort aswell, but to terrorize the Magical society for murdering her idol) or whatever.

I dont expect any possible "romantic" stuff with her, but im not rejected either.
