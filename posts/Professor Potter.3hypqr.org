*** I can't recommend Yellow Submarine. It starts with an abused Ginny and an aromantic Harry, but they fall in love and that magically cures Ginny's abuse and Harry's aromanticness. Because love automatically cures emotional scars, and aromantic people are really just looking for the right person to fall for. Bleh.

There are a whole bunch of chapters specifically dedicated to Harry getting over his immense guilt for his role in Ginny's suffering and Ginny recovering from her abuse quite independent of romance.

#+end_quote

Yes, it certainly plays a large part in it. Or are you going to deny that love alleviates suffering? Especially in this case, where Harry and Ginny's problems are naturally related?

/Yellow Submarine/ is a pretty divisive fanfic for reasons that should be obvious to anyone who has read a few chapters of it. But your reasons for disliking it are completely retarded.

***** Love doesn't cure PTSD. There are thousands of war veterans with loving families who still suffer from PTSD. Unless you're arguing that they don't actually love their families, or their families don't actually love them.

I read blog posts from rape and abuse survivors. They sometimes post about how they are uncomfortable with the idea of intimate contact with people they love who did not rape or abuse them. I read guides to dealing with the aftermath of rape and sexual abuse. They emphasize not feeling guilt about not wanting to engage in intimate contact with a spouse or romantic partner, indicating that this is a common problem.

Too many people are dismissive about asexuality and aromanticness. Most stories are content to ignore the possibility of either, but /Yellow Submarine/ adds salt to the wound by starting with an aromantic character and then treating his aromanticness as just a minor obstacle, easily overcome by True Love.

****** I'm increasingly convinced that you read the first two or three chapters of the story and convinced yourself that it was indeed true love that fixed everything. Are you even aware what Harry and Ginny's problems were and how they were related?

This is brought up and dealt with in-story. You will notice that the only thing she allows herself to touch at the beginning of the story is Arnold, her pygmy puff.

Again:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This should be quite clear to anyone who read the story. Harry and Ginny's problems are related, and they alone know what the full extent of what the other suffered through and /why/, and that is why them being together helps them. Ginny building her confidence back and getting used to being around people and Harry's guilt complex are dealt with appropriately, and 'true love' is hardly it.

And which part convinced you that Harry was asexual? It is directly stated that Harry used to wank to mental images of girls well before Ginny came along.

Aromantic, not asexual. The text says he masturbated to the idea of /parts/ of women and not women as such, and that it was a shock to him when he thought of Ginny's face -- since he'd never thought of anyone's face before when masturbating. Did /you/ even read it?

I calmly inform you that you're being rude by denigrating an entire category of people, a category that people do not opt into and cannot opt out of, a category of people that is frequently abused and widely denigrated, and you think I'm just taking offense at something willfully. Are you so emotionally attached to your right to insult huge swathes of people that you must attack everyone who gives you flak about it? How do you have the right to insult people while nobody else has the right to be annoyed at you?

** Sorry for not contributing, but I will ask about something relevant instead. I remember reading at least two stories where as a student, Harry was made an official DADA professor for the lower years. In one of these fics specifically, Dumbledore had actually announced so during the welcoming feast, without even having asked Harry if he would accept beforehand.

Is anyone aware of any of those stories? Mind you, I came upon them ages ago when I first started on fanfiction, so they could be bad (or terrible).
