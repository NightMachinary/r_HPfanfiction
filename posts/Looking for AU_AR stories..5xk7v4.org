Hi.

I am looking for stories with Harry leaving for or getting sent to AU/AR's.

Some requirements:

- Must be complete.
- Preferably Strong/Super Harry.
- Must be long (I usually read upwards of 100 000 words in a day if I have the time so anything 100 000 and up is good, but I can take lesser word counts if it's a good story or it have sequels that are complete.)
- X-overs are OK as long as knowledge of the other IP's is not needed to follow the story.
- No Slash stories.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** 'Stages of Hope' sort of fits your request. Harry is not super!Harry although he is more powerful than canon Harry. It's slightly under 100000 words, but Harry does go to an alternate reality/dimension.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
