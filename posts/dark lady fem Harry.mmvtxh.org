Does anyone know any fics where fem Harry is a dark lady and isn't paired with Voldemort or anyone double her age


** Equal and opposite is not exactly what you're looking for but it does have a dark lady fem Harry from another dimensions , who causes Harry to go dark , and after you get past the whole Harry/Harry pairing it is actually a good read. Not exactly what you want but I would recommend it.
