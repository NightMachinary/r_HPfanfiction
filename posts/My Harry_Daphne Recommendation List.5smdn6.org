Admittedly I get the attraction of this pair but there's so many Harry/Daphne requests in the sub, it's a bit disturbing to see a daily "Harry/Daphne recommendation post". Also so many shit stories are written based on this pair. I get that why this pairing is an attraction for manipulative! Dumbledore, greedy Wesley's & in general bashing & bla bla bla. If one thing I despise about fanon, it's random bashing without regarding contexts of canon.

Lot's of fans including me, wanted to see Slytherin house as a bit more prominent towards 'light' side. Snape, Slughorn or Draco Malfoy's in general don't bode well. That's where H/D pairing came & it could have done a lot better! That was the first place why I was attracted to this pairing. But people's imagination always tends to extreme & therefore bashing. And therefore like every troop, H/D also went to absolute worst arc. And unfortunately not many good stories have written before it turning to worst.

There's so many requests for this pairing, it's incredibly boring to rewrite same comment everyday. In this post, I will list some of the stories of this pairing:

Linkffn(*Unatoned by SeriousScribble*): According to many, this is one of the best HP fan fiction has ever written. It's a noir style story based on novel - The Big Sleep. If you are yet to watch film with same name based on the story starring Humphrey Bogart, I'll recommend to watch it.

Linkffn(Contractual Invalidation by R-dude) - As far as marriage contract goes, this one is the best. Features classical fanon 'ice princess' Daphne & a bit manipulative Harry.

Linkffn(Days to Come by chris400ad) - Features adult Harry & Daphne. I, actually, could see this is a possible alternative of canon world if we disregard epilogue.

Linkffn(The Amalgamation Agreement by TheUnrealInsomniac) - This story features a Daphne who counters every characteristics of 'fanon' 'ice princess'.

Linkffn(The Reluctant Champion by TheUnrealInsomniac) - basically what the summery says - What A Difference A Father Makes. Lily died in 1981 but James survived as he wasn't at home when Voldemort attacked.

Linkffn(A Game of Style and Brutality by BarneyXII) - A post-DH story which has alternative history. Let's just say Voldemort was probably dealt 2nd time a lot better. This story starts after 7th year when Harry opts for professional Quidditch career. Actually a very good read if you are Quidditch fan.

Linkffn(White Nights by PotterforPresident1997) - canon-ish, short story. For me, it's one of top 5 of this pair. /sigh/ alert: Tragedy

Linkffn(Beltane Child by White Angel of Auralon) - Another alternative of Epilogue. Harry took a break while Horcrux hunting & unknowingly participates a wizarding ritual. A very well written story.

Linkffn(The Trial by reviewgirl911) - A non-BWL Harry story. He is three years older than canon. I like the idea of the story. Another story of similar idea - Linkffn(The Double Agent by bourkem). I would love to read more stories based on Double Agent Harry ideas.

Linkffn(Far from Perfect by fantasyra) - Very interesting premise. Even if Harry defeated Voldemort, he's exiled from wizarding world due to the methods he chose to defeat him. Harry actually very suicidal.

Linkffn(Death Before Dishonour by SuperNova26) - Another story with interesting premise. A non-BWL Harry. Neville is BWL. And Harry's parents got crucioed. But story is interesting due to different reason. Harry was sorted to Slytherin. And he's every bit bastard but not sided with either of Voldemort or Dumbledore. Actually none of their group is. Would love to read stories based on similar ideas.

Linkffn(Fraterculus by bloodsox88) - recently updated. non-BWL Harry story. His younger brother is BWL. I will copy-paste writers own word why s/he was motivated to write the story:

#+begin_quote
  My motives for writing this story were that I grew sick and tired of the usual underdeveloped trite that most authors put out these days, especially Harry-sibling fics. I don't know how the idea that James and Lily, especially how they are shown in the books, would ever be the abusive, attention-seeking jerks that so many authors display. I thought it was always pretty clear.
#+end_quote

Linkffn(Harry Potter, Rise From Dust by Bluezz-17) - non-BWL Harry story. His younger brother is BWL. But like most of non-BWL Harry stories, it has issues. If you look past, you will enjoy it. Besides, it's some OC characters which I enjoyed.

Linkffn(Dancing in the Green by Pheonix Dawn) - This one shot is a cute one. Just 4th year.

Linkffn(Uncle Harry by R-dude) - one shot. Married couple Harry & Daphne went to visit Dudley's.

Linkffn(Ruthless Revenge by Yunaine) - oneshot, crack fic.

Linkffn(A Cunning Slytherin by Rorschach's Blot) - oneshot, crack fic.

Linkffn(Harry Potter Mercenary by DobbyElfLord) - similar to last one. oneshot, crack fic. Probably has a sequel too where H&D part ways.

Linkffn(The Pureblood Princess by TheEndless7) - Many people likes this story. And I get why. But I always find first POV stories a bit tedious.

Linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerSpW) - A bit too long. Way too tedious at the beginning but the story did grow up to me in later chapter, after 50+ chapters. And I like Dudley here more than any other characters.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations By Jeconais]] - fluff stuff. One of your classical Dumbledore/Ron/Hermione betraying storing with secret girlfriend ice princess to rescue. It's a sequel too.

Linffn(Moving On by Xavras) - Post-DH. This story could have been Days to Come if it didn't have unnecessary Wesley bashing. And the writing is too weak. Have continuation issue. Another problem with the story the writer is in love with Draco Malfoy. But some of the adventure ideas in the story, I found interesting.

Linkffn(Paid In Blood by zaterra02) - this is probably one of the worst story I have ever read. Badly written. But I appreciate the imaginations of the writer. It's in the category 'it's so bad that I ended up enjoying'.

And lastly I have excluded most of fluff stuffs regarding H/D pair. Here's some: most of James Spookie's stories, Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Siren's Song by hermyd), Linkffn(Runic Animagi by Kassien), Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Connection Reversed by hermyd), Linkffn(The Marriage Contracts Redux by Clell65619), Linkffn(The Grass Is Always Greener by kb0), Linkffn(Partners by muggledad) etc.

** A lot of these stories have really terrible writing unfortunately. I think you have covered most of the decent ones but one story I would add to this master list is linkffn(The Little Child to Lead Him by BlueRosesAtMidnight). Mostly fluff (Harry raises Petunia's magical kid) and Harry/Daphne is more peripheral than central. But the writing and ideas are better and more original than many you listed, so if fluff is your style I think you'd enjoy it.

  The most disturbing thing was the pool of blood. The coffee table itself was literately dripping blood onto Daphne's tan carpeting. Judging by the amount on and around the table, the smell in the air, and her friends clothes, the first conclusion someone would have had would have been she murdered someone in her sitting room. This was not an unfamiliar situation.
