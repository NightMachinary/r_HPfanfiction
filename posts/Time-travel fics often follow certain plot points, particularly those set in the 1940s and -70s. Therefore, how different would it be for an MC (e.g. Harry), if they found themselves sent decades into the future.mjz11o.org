#+TITLE: Time-travel fics often follow certain plot points, particularly those set in the 1940s and -70s. Therefore, how different would it be for an MC (e.g. Harry), if they found themselves sent decades into the future?

Instead of being sent back to the 1940s (Tom Riddle's Hogwarts era) or -70s (Marauders' Hogwarts era), the MC is sent FORWARDS in time; e.g. 2040s, 2070s, 2140s etc. A lot of time-travel fics to the past follow similar plot points: the MC crafting a new identity for themselves, possibly enrolling in Hogwarts, meeting old faces young etc. There are also issues revolving culture, social views, and other things from being a time traveller.

So what would be different if we flip the 'direction' of time travel? What issues would the MC have to face, that may not be present in past time-travel fics? What would they (have to) do differently?


** If pre-Snape memories Harry travels to modern day, he will be traumatized by the fact he named his kid Albus Severus Potter for sure

** Time travel forward is easy because there's no paradox issues; cause and effect proceed in normal chronological order. You don't know what happened the first time round, you don't have special knowledge, there's no need to preserve the timeline. It's no different from waking up tomorrow, just that you skipped some days in between.

What that means, is that the time traveller is doing the ordinary sci-fi thing of adjusting to a new world. Maybe technology/magic has advanced, maybe social norms have changed - the author has to make these all up as part of the worldbuilding. Maybe it's more utopian, maybe it's more dystopian. This, at least, is probably more straightforward: if Harry departed from the timeline before beating Voldemort, then he didn't beat Voldemort, so the latter most likely came into and stayed in power. You can trace the effects of the character's absence forward to the new setting

For the character, they still have to find their way in an unfamiliar world, creating a new identity and finding somewhere to live and so on. But, again, this time without the advantage of future knowledge (both specific [what happened to his parents] and general [you have a decent idea of what society was like in the 70s). He may, however, be able to find people he knew, older now, who can help him. Or they might react badly.

** it depends on what happened to the timeline they were in. For example, harry could go to the 2040s in a world where the ministry, a world that continues as if harry was in the world, is struggling from muggleborns refusing hogwarts, or he could go to one where voldemort wins and he turns up having to hide his identity in a slytherin only hogwarts looking just like the blood traitor harry potter

** If you are interested, I would recommend linkao3(18851794) .

It's tagged as Harry Potter/Voldemort but so far there is no romance.

** Okay but imagine after he goes, after Sirius in the veil, he ends up in the distant future. Everything is so different, yet the same. The muggles have found out about the magical community and they somehow life in peace? However, the wise words 'peace is a lie, there is only passion' are as true as ever. Harry soon finds out there is a dark lord in the shadows, which isn't surprising at all but then he learns his name and everything gets complicated.. Harry Potter has to fight a dark lord who bears his own name and where is Sirius?!
