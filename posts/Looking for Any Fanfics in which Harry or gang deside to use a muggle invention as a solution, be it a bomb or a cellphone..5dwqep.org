  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Bomb: linkffn(Stages of Hope)

Cellphones: Useful cellphones weren't really a thing for anywhere from eight to fifteen years (whether you count from Harry getting his letter or the Death of Voldemort) from the series. Fics that move the timeline forward suck. Besides, /in canon/ there are portable, easily hideable audiovisual communication devices, and they have been a thing since at the latest *1977*. That is /decades/ before non-brick cellphones, smartphones, facetime and skype. So why the shit do they need cellphones? And if it takes place at Hogwarts, cellphones wouldn't anyways.

EDIT: Forgot a couple words.
