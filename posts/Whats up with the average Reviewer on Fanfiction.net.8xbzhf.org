** I've no idea about your fic, and trolls are an issue aside from critical reviews, but since some of the most popular fics are objectively /not/ well written, I will stick my neck out and say that an awful lot of reviewers are simply unable to tell good from bad. If it scratches their itch, then they like it, ergo it's good. That's not my view but I'm in a tiny minority.

** I suspect that you haven't actually encountered any 'average' reviewers, but a rather more aggressive subset. The average reviewer, in my experience, tends to leave short, one-or-two word comments such as 'nice' or 'huh' or 'not great' rather than diatribes against the story and/or author. I've gotten negative reviews, yes, but nothing on the level you've described. In my, admittedly limited, experience I've found the FFnet community to be supportive and encouraging on the whole.

Maybe try finding a beta who's natively English to proofread your translation? Reviewers might be reacting to slightly-off grammar or whatever, and someone more intimately familiar with the language could help alleviate that. Your first sentence in The Greatest Good, for instance; "One does not wake up some morning and thinks" probably should be "One does not wake up some morning and think" or "No one wakes up in the morning and thinks".

*** Alas that may be true. As it was pointed out to me in this thread already, some of my fanfictions may be part of a certain niche that has only a small amount of readers.

Thank you for the suggestion, should I need to translate any of my German Fanfictions again, I will attempt to find a Beta. However I might need to point out regarding your example, that I felt the need to translate the fanfiction in a way that nothing was lost. The way the Fanfiction The Greatest Good is written in German and English represents a deeply disturbed persons way of thinking. If you were to read Hitlers Mein Kampf, you would find that I attempted to imitate his way of thinking and writing.

However I shall go back and re-read my translation as time permits me. Thank you.

** No. Its not that your fics sucked donkey balls. It sucked horse balls.

On a more serious note, there are two points here. One, whats up with the reviewers, and two, does your story suck.

For the first, you have to understand that most of the people here who right real in depth reviews not just for lols usually wait for more than 10k words on a fic (so much abandonment...) before making a decision that its worth reviewing. The rest are mostly shippers and brief passersby in the fandom.

For the second, thats harder to answer. If you want some advice, check this sub's search for "good/great/well-written" fics, as well as for any of the potential thematic elements in the story. Consensus is not the best way to find out what is good/correct, but it would give you other stories to compare the quality of your work.

If you want to risk it, another idea would be to post something on here where there is a bit more moderation and get some opinions. This however is risky for some reasons.

*** Hi, I dont know which balls are bigger. I will defer to your wisdom regarding the size of balls.

I am fine with negative feedback. If you were to tell me that you did not like how I portrayed Harry, or where the story is heading, that is fine. Because it is a legit opinion. However writing "please stop writing" or "Shit story" are just plain attempts at ruining the fun for other people. Or am I wrong?

I have decided that I will keep the fanfictions which will end up being longer (the ones I have deleted from FFnet for now), offline as long as I havent finished them. Dont know if it makes sense - but I feel like I got burned because I was too excited about having written a few chapters that felt "good" altogether. Only to get slapped in the face by some idiots who didn't it or wanted to troll.

How may it be risky, if I were to post something on reddit?

**** First, nice comeback. Well played.

Second, anybody who is an artisan of sorts, whether you are writing, painting, or sculpting, needs to be prepared for criticism. Especially on the internet, where people are generally anonymous. It sucks, but I know that feeling. And you are right, they suck, but thats not just for writers.

When it comes to creativity, my opinion is tell the world to screw itself until it wants to give a reasoned opinion. Plus, most people are not able to type a lot, so it requires shorter statements.

Its risky in that while this sub and [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]] have more moderation the [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]], there is always the same risk of getting flamed. Additionally, most of the regular commentators are people (ex. myself) who have read a fair amount of fanfiction already and have thus seen the high bar set by some of the best fics. My opinion is this makes many of us perhaps more critical than others deserve, but again this is an opinion.

Also, as you can see if you check the recent survey (should be at the top of the feed), certain things are gravitated to by the people on this thread. Ex. people like political or cultural exploration fics, but generally dislike rich Harry fics. This is likely to make others, including myself, more biased against your fic regardless of quality.

Hope this helps.

***** I saw the opportunity and I abused it! :P

Truly, people seem to have too much time on their hands when they can waste it, writing nonsensical negativity on the internet.

I will attempt to handle future negative comments in a similar manner and simply delete it. A Block Options for FFNet would work wonders though.

Ah, yes. That would indeed present a certain risk of getting a ton of criticism.\\
Maybe I'll ask for feedback when my current projects are completed. Then I wont have the urge to go back to previous chapters and rewrite them.

Political / Cultural Exploration does seem to be one my favorite topics to write about, even if I prefer to leave the British Isles behind and write AU.

Thank you, it did indeed help :)

** Eh, as someone with similar experiences, I'd say just hold your head up. The shit-talkers have probably never considered writing themselves and are unaware of the work that goes into creating stories.

Deleting the stories only makes it impossible for you to receive positive feedback. It is rare to get feedback on writing quality, usually it's nitpicking. I would recommend spending time on [[/r/writing]] or [[/r/destructivereaders]] - there are many good resources to learning writing and storytelling, but if you can find a community online (like DestructiveReaders) who are oriented towards providing criticism, then you'll steadily improve to the point where you know when your writing is good and when it can be improved.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/destructivereaders/wiki/]]

I'm sure I've read of a few cases where a fanfic author has copied/pasted chapters from the canon JK Rowling Harry Potter books, and then people have commented saying their writing or their story is terrible. This just illustrates the point that most casual readers know nothing about writing.

Honestly I wouldn't care about it. You're writing your stories, you're getting readers. Who knows if a reader who never commented or favourited wants to re-read your story and it's no longer there?

I myself am native English speaking/writing. I've never had to deal with the language barrier issue. Here is something nice I found about a Pro author who had similar problems. [[https://www.readitforward.com/authors/writing-in-a-foreign-language/]]

** i just want to tell you that i found the style you used in your work Ein hehres Ziel extremely interesting. Its obvious that you really tried to emulate an older writing style and ideology and in my opinion your text seems pretty authentic (you could work on your interpunction though). Of course its not the way 11 year old canon Harry would talk but i dont think thats what you tried to to. Hooray for fanfiction. I would like to read a longer fic from you !

*** Thank you!

Hooray to Fanfiction indeed.

On a side note: punctuation has had a different meaning the old fashioned german. You would set a Comma, not where the rules force you to set one, but where you would want the reader to take a break, or where you would want to make a quick pause. Hitler was infamous for his multi-clause sentences, which are quite hard to read.

I learned German as the rules want you to. Proper punctuation and all that. However I also learned that sometimes you have to bend the rules to convey a certain impression. Of course it is strenous to read, there is no denying that.

I shall aspire to finish my current project when it reaches approximately 100k words. It will be in English though.

There are plans and plots I have written down for later projects, in English and German.

***** As I mentioned, that applies to old german only, as far as I know.

Commas were designed as short breaks in speech or to structure a sentence. Nowdays there are proper rules when to use a Comma.

I never bothered to learn English punctuation as I would most likely get it wrong anyways :D

** A lot of the people on FFN are definitely dicks. Even the nice reviews are aggressively entitled a lot of the time. Probably because the general pool of users skews a lot younger and, frankly, more male than some other sites.

Try AO3. Out of the 200+ reviews I've gotten on that site, only one of them was bad, and even that seemed more like the reviewer was trying to be helpful in a delusional kind of way, rather than actually malicious.

I was frankly amazed at how considerate all the feedback I got on AO3 was, considering my previous experience with FFN. (Granted, I last posted to FFN like a decade ago, so maybe times have changed - but judging by your post, probably not.)

***** Seconding that - the story in German sounds as if Harry were born in the 18th or 19th century. And that doesn't sound like Harry to me. It also felt far too advanced for a 11 year old kid.

****** Another agreement from me. I can deal with the sentence structure and grammar, although it sounds way over the top, but the word choices are incredibly outdated and off-putting for a story that's happening in 1991. I cringed especially hard when you used Bub and Mädel when even my 97yo great grandma wouldn't use the word Bub.

Then there's the way you've shoehorned a lot of divisive political opinions - that's always going to cause issues with many reviewers. It's especially questionable because there are so few mentions of magic, the story may as well not be in the Harry Potter universe at all.

Most bizarrely however, the writing is incredibly jarring because of the contrast of sounding like a fanatical centenarian, yet also reminiscing about when he was 11. An 11 year old going to magic school for the first time wouldn't give a rat's ass about "furthering the magical race" and "becoming a proud contributor to the Nation" or be "convinced by the triumph of corruption".

Obviously the kinds of reviews mentioned are awful, but the story certainly is divisive.

******** I knew someone would come forward and say that :) Either way, an 11-year-old in 1991 definitely would not say that in normal conversation (unless they were copying something from a Brother Grimm story?) so I'd extrapolate that a 70-year-old in 2050 wouldn't either. The exception would be someone purposely adopting these speech patterns and word choices but so far in the story there is no reason for this to happen. I can sort of see what OP is trying to go for, but there's been no jumping off point for this AU. No point of divergence that explains why 11-year-old Harry would think and talk like this. Perhaps it's supposed to be a mystery which will be revealed later...

I felt quite reluctant about releasing that story. As you may or may not have noticed, it resembles heavily the way Adolf Hitler wrote Mein Kampf. I hoped to display through the (what you call "unique") type of writing that I used, how disturbed a person must be, when he sees himself as a type of savior that needs to change the world.

******* Indeed. Which is why I found myself needing to digest what I had read.

Since Mein Kampf was forbidden to buy in germany, for quite some time, there had been a mysticism going on. A forbidden fruit, so to say. And when I encountered Serdar Somuncu reading Mein Kampf on stage and explaining how utterly stupid Hitlers writing is, I had to read it myself. You dont walk away from reading Mein Kampf without having the need to discuss or work through what you have read. And for me writing that fanfiction helped.
