I'm looking for some Harry and Fleur stories to read; I'm not opposed to some smut but hopefully the writing is up to par. I'm looking for an actual story that's well written.

The most recent fic I read that had this ship was The Lie I've Lived by jbem. (I've anybody knows what has happen to the planned sequel I'd love to hear it)

The story doesn't need to be during the GoF time frame but I'm looking for a story I can get hooked on for awhile. If I'm not looking in the right place send me to the right direction. Thanks for your help!


** a) that question is asked every other day, so you should find plenty of stuff if you search for it.

b) I just gonna quote myself from the last thread:

#+begin_quote
  linkffn(Euphoria) is propably the best Harry/Fleur fic that is focused on the romance. Albeit the start of the story feels a bit too close to canon, the grade of divergence increases with the time and the romance between the two is simply beliveable, something most Harry/Fleur fics are missing.

  linkffn(Wastelands of time) is an extremly well written AU wich has a Harry/Fleur pairing, which however is never the focus, not even in the sequel heartlands where the pairing becomes a bit more important.

  Than there is [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][jeconais Hope]]which is decent if one does not have a problem with overly fluffy stories.

  That pretty much where the really good ones. Else I can "recommend" linkffn(The British Reformation) is not completly terrible, but the moral choice done in this fic are hilariously retarded. linkffn(What You Leave Behind) does not feature H/F yet, but has promised to to so in the future - if the fic will ever continue, that is.
#+end_quote

And if you search for smut [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10191925/1][How Fleur Delacour Seduced Me AKA: I'm a Lucky, Lucky Man (revised)]].

edit: Take note that Hope is Harry/Gabrielle.

*** I highly recommend How Fleur Delacour Seduced Me AKA: I'm a Lucky, Lucky Man. It's a hilarious story with pretty good writing as well.

All of fanfiction.net's Harry/Fleur stories could be cobbled together and used to write /Harry Potter's Guide to Getting More Pussy Than You'll Ever Need - AKA, You'll Be A Very, Very Lucky Man/.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
