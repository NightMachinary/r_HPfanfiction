** The rebel and the chosen by chelseyb

is one of my all time favourite she deleted everything she had written but you can still find the ePub or a mirror version on the internet.

On a side note, also by chelseyb: Harry potter and the half blood auror is also quite good it's also pretty long but unfortunately it's incomplete I however still recommend it

** Breach of Contract - 12 Signs is good. I'm not somewhere I can check the wordcount, so it may be shorter than I remember.
