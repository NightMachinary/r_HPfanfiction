After war, Luna is the only one who accepts Draco and helps him out of his depression/helps him make friends. Bonus if Draco is gay. Triple bonus if Drarry.


** I just recommended this in another thread but [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4173777][The Girl in the Kneazle Nightie]] is great and sorta fits your request if you squint. This is a Harry/Draco fic told entirely from Luna's POV. Luna, Harry and Draco all volunteer at children's home and Luna plays matchmaker. The best part about this was how Luna was written - I did not have a strong head canon for Luna before this fic, but after reading this I feel like I GET canon Luna so much better. It is a wonderful character study of Luna and I really think you'll like it. Linkao3(4173777)

Also, though not the main story arc of the fic, iirc in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/473335/chapters/819506][Twist of Fate]] Luna and Draco are friends during her imprisionment at the Manor and she sticks by him when everyone else hates him. Linkao3(473335)

  Draco asks Harry to help him beat the Imperius curse during 4th year. The lessons turn into more than either expected. A story of redemption and forgiveness. Pairings: HP/DM (Slash) Timeframe: 1994-2002 Goblet to 4 yrs post-DH EWE Rating T for language, high angst, content.
