I'm looking for a oneshot that I read a while ago about Fred and George during Harry's second year. It basically talked about how they kept an eye on Harry and watched out for him when people were trying to curse him for being the Heir of Slytherin. It was really good and I was wondering if someone could help me find it? Or if someone knows which story it is?
