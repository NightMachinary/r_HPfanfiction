Dumbledore decides to do the right thing for a defenseless child. He not only hides the fact that there is a prophecy, he tells everyone Lily stopped Voldemort but died in the process. He never mentions to anyone that Harry was hit with the killing curse. As far as anyone is aware the scar is just an injury from the backlash of whatever Lily did. Harry is raised by a wizard family with no fame. Dumbledore retires from several of his positions to free up time to hunt down why Voldemort is still alive. When Dumbledore finds the last horcrux (while Voldemort is still a spirit) he has Harry destroy it thus fulfilling the prophecy.

Any fic along this line where Dumbledore does everything he can to shield Harry.


** If you spin this right, the entire story could be about the traumatizing dilemma that faces Albus, since Harry has a horcrux in his head and must therefore die for Voldemort to be destroyed.

*** True. And there is the third path to consider:

Let us dispense with the Scar Horcrux for the moment. Since horcruxes were described as needing a ritual, an accidental horcrux that specifically targets a baby is not the most probable outcome. So, let's say Harry is not a Horcrux. In fact, he's a perfectly ordinary boy, albeit an orphan born to war heroes.

Boo-hoo! Voldie is dead! Quite a few of his most high-profile followers have been incarcerated or even executed, and Death Eaters as a faction are gone. But the problems remain. People like Lucious Malfoy, who hedged their bets and avoided explicit Death Eater activity or being identified remain, and so do the problems at the root of the Blood War, as it came to be called.

Wizards are celebration in the streets, but the Ministry is still corrupt, the Minister is available for purchase and doing bare minimum to hide it, laws are a Gordian knot of contradictions and discrimination runs rampant. But in the shadows, the war continues as Dumbledore, whose supporters wish to celebrate their victory, fights a new campaign in the brightly lit halls and cozy living rooms. The present has been secured, the future is under siege - and the foes are as numerous as they are indistinct, clad in a veneer of civility. Obscured. Ready to seize the world.

Now Dumbledore has to juggle his many positions, possibly raising Harry and maneuver the political shifting sands as Blood Purists, Muggleborn Nrmalization Party and Greedy Opportunists Associacion tear his world apart.

**** That was the precursor to linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts), but it's mostly just talked over instead of being its own story. They tried reforming the wizarding world and HP realized it wouldn't work because the underlying causes that allowed LV to rise in the first place were still there. So he decides to make change happen in another way.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** Always wondered why they couldn't bypass this whole thing by just imprisoning Voldemort somehow. Their society has a spell to turn rats into chalices, I'm pretty sure they have some way to bind spirits into some type of magical cage.

Just have Harry fire an AK on himself when he is close to dying of old age.

*** But Harry is mortal. He will, eventually, die. There's no hurry.

Dumbledore could target the systemic issue of blood prejudice and, if he's ruthless enough, methodically assassinate the free Death Eaters. Without them, Voldemort is not that big of a problem. Delay his resurrection and deny him resources he needs to overthrow the government. Destroy all his horcruxes and eventually when Harry dies (hopefully of old age or whatever), so will Voldemort.

***** Two Death Eaters may be able to resurrect Voldemort but they cannot overthrow the Ministry. It takes far more manpower and resources to conduct a war. I'm sure that sacrificing a child is easier, but it's not the right thing to do.

****** Lmfao resurrecting Voldemort is all they need to do because he'd then free incarcerated Death Eaters. There are also far more adult sympathizers out there than just those who took the mark. Rowle, Selwyn, Gibbon, Jugson all seem to be newcomers. Those free Death Eaters have children and, if nothing else, would want revenge for their parents. You also forgot about the creatures Voldemort had on his side.

At no point did say anything about sacrificing a child. What I said was that your plan was flawed.

Incarcerated Death Eaters can be executed.

There is no /perfect/ plan. Every plan we make will have flaws since we simply don't have enough information to go on, and in canon they won thanks to deux ex machina and author's fiat, not to mention child sacrifice. The point is that Dumbledore should actually fight a war using adults instead of throwing children to the wolves.

******** He didn't throw children to the wolves. In fact, there's a whole book dedicated to Dumbledore making the mistake of keeping a child in the dark for the sake of keeping him a child.

The every plan excuse doesn't work for your plan because yours ignores all the people Voldemort had on his side and how they got there.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** In The Accidental Animagus ( linkao3(14078862) ) Dumbledore is very much a Good Guy. He starts off considering the standard manipulations, but catches himself in the thought process and decides that "No, manipulating things wouldn't solve much, I have to make things /right/ no matter how many times that involves admitting I was wrong and fixing mistakes I made."

As a more general tip, the "Good Albus Dumbledore" tag on ArchiveOfOurOwn is pretty much what you're looking for - a Dumbledore who may not be perfect, may play at chessmastering, but genuinely wants the best for everyone involved.
