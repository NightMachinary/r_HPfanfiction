"Dumbledore! You misplaced your dentures so you could pretend to be distracted while I fought dementors in your toilet didn't you!"

"Yeah, sure, let's go with that, Granger."

"But I'm Harry-"

"Shhhh, Obliviate."


** Something like this happens in [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope by Jeconais]] - Dumbledore's had dementia since before Harry graduated, he uses a potion to keep the symptoms at bay (but he gets addicted to it, so Snape basically gets whatever he wants as long as he keeps brewing it).

The story was written before Book 6 came out, which should be obvious by the fact that Dumbledore's alive after Harry's graduation.

*** Harry'll die in the forbidden forest during the battle of Hogwarts. That is going to be a really dark fic, though.

But what will RAB's locket be with the note for Voldemort replace? What nasty little trinket has Kreacher been trying to destroy?

If written well, the denouement of that fic might be brutal.

Edit: Plot twist, HP is a self insert and JKR's books were all a lie, only HP's parents were murdered because they were members of the OotP, and Harry got his scar from the house coming down on him that night. While noticing more and more jarring differences with reading JKR's books and actually living in the world, the SI-HP has been trying to listen to Dumbledore about Horcruxes, but Dumbledore's turns out to be senile, and Horcruxes never existed to begin with. At the end the SI-HP ends up in Azkaban, rightfully so.

** I remember reading a time travel fic where Harry ends up sometime after Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald, and Harry discovers by accident that it left Dumbledore's mind completely in shambles, and only the quick and timely medical intervention keeps it from being permanent. Which explained a lot of Dumbledore's decision making where Harry was concerned. I can't remember for the life of me what that fic was called, though.

*** In fact all characters are Dumbledore's split personalities. Everything actually happened in his head while he was locked down in an asylum. Also, Magic in fact doesn't exist. Voldemort's death is actually Dumbledore winning against his dark side.
