Has anyone written a fic where Neville and Harry are both ineligible for the prophecy? Like both born in August or early July, and Voldemort and Dumbledore race to find a Muggleborn. Defying Voldemort could be accidental, like maybe a squib parent who did something, or maybe his grandparents were at the orphanage with Riddle, (after all, being born to grandparents still counts, right? ) or maybe they didn't slow down as Voldey was jaywalking and tooted at him, or refused to let him line jump. Just something really.


** I remember a one shot where Hanna Abbott was the chosen one, because her parents were rude to Volde at the dry cleaners and his only retaliation was cursing their unborn daughter with an ugly birth mark because he was in a hurry.

** There's one where Dudley is the BWL. The Ministry is aghast at the very thought and suppresses the details when announcing Voldemort's death.

  You-know-Voldemort? He's dead

Despite it being a robst story, I'm enjoying it for the nonserious story it is. I thought at first that Dudley would be a Muggleborn wizard, but nope, not even! The Daily Prophet's editor is funny. "All powerful wizard my arse! ... prick got taken out by a muggle toddler"

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

**** I used to read robst a lot back when I came back to the fanfiction community. This one is my favorite and the only one I can still read after all these years.

Pretty funny and lighthearted :)
