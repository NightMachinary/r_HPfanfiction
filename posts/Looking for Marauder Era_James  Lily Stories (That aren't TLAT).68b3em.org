Been looking for something decent for awhile and have grown tired of glancing over old threads, and reading opening chapters so said id ask.

Really quickly these are what I have read/tried to read(meaning more than 1 chapter): "The Life and Times" - loved it ofc (We can only hope Jewels5 is still working on it) "Tears on the Balcony", which I disliked for a variety of reasons that I wont get into. Tried to read "The Ride and Fall of the Stag and the Doe", but just didn't get into it for some reason. Iv tried "Commentarius", but I just don't really like that writing style. Other than that iv not read much in the Marauders Era.

Id prefer fics set in the Hogwarts and the 5-7th years if possible, but if there good stories set in the early Hogwarts years/After Hogwarts in the Order then do link them also!

Plz no One Shots - its not that i don't like them, i'm just looking for longer fics - in fact the longer the better. Also i don't really like Slash but if its not the main focus I may be able to over look it.

Thanks for the help.

  A hasty decision and a bet they never should have agreed to result in James and Lily spending a lot more time together in October of their 7th year than they ever anticipated. A story of growing up, identity, and falling in love.

** It hasn't quite gotten up to real Lily/James and there is a fair bit of focus on OCs (original characters-but they're so well written it never bothered me), but Not Fade Away is my favourite marauder era fic. It's incomplete at the moment, but updates are regular.

** I love TLAT. I just reread it for the third time.

Another of my favorites: linkffn(7305052). It's called "Against the Moon". It's about Remus's years at Hogwarts. She's only made it through year 2, so there's no Lily/James. However, there are over a HUNDRED chapters to read, and it's extremely well written. If you like stories about the Marauders, then you definitely have to read it. I know it's not finished (like TLAT), but it's one of those stories that stays with you long after you finish reading it (like TLAT). The moment where James/Sirius/Peter confront Remus is probably one of the best scenes I've ever read in fanfiction.

Can I do a shameless self-promotion? linkffn(11440239). It's called "Flowers in Winter". I haven't gotten very far and it's going slow, but I hope to get there...eventually.

*** No problem at all. It's been awhile since I read the fic so i hope none of this is off but..

I don't know how deep you got, but towards the middle the story gets repetitive like nothing I have ever read before, it literally goes in circles for about 10-12 chapters (maybe longer), it's the same cycle over and over, arguments that are really over nothing, characters act like they hate each other and then are friends in the next chapter, especially James and Lily... it just feels really forced and like it was shoved in for more drama, and it goes on for far too long, I get that the whole story is supposed to be long winded but in the middle it really drags.

Not to mention James and Lily are terrible to each other at times, if i'm remembering right some of the stuff they fling at each other just wouldn't be forgiven as easily as it is in the story. I actually enjoyed the secondary storyline between Sirius and Riley a little more, they had the same kind of relationship but it wasn't as bad.

Lily's characterization was an issue for me as well, I don't think calling her a Mary Sue would be fair but there was this kind of "Lily can do no wrong" feeling throughout the whole story, whenever there was an argument it was always the other characters fault, especially James. Again it just feels like we are supposed to root for Lily when half the time she was just being a straight up bitch. I did like her somewhat mysterious background and her worrying about people finding out etc, but then again I just like some Angst, and she really has that ‘goodie goodie' portrayal aswell which I really dislike.

And I don't really want to spoil it (Is it a spoiler to talk about when James and Lily get together in a JL fic?) but when they do eventually start going out, they may aswell have been married for 40 years, it's an issue I have with loads of Marauder Era fics, the characters are 17 they should act like it.

Americanisms, like dialogue, word use, names - this is something I really don't mind that much normally, but here it was kind of overpowering, I recall characters called Brite and Lance, they just felt off and kind of dragged me out of the setting - but it's the Author's right to portray the world as they wish so I can't blame them for that.

It's not a terrible fic, it has its moments but overall there are far better long fics out there that don't have you questioning whether or not you are wasting your time reading them. It's been so long since I read it that I probably forgot a lot of what really annoyed me but this post is already pretty long so there you go.

***** Hopefully i'm remembering this correctly, basically Lily's parents died in, I think a car crash and Petunia has abandoned her so she lives in an orphanage during the summer. - so I suppose it's not really canon compliant. Thats a huge factor in why she is basically a bitch, she doesn't want anyone to know and I don't even think her best friends know, so she's always really defensive about it and terrified of anyone getting close enough to figure it out.

As for James and Lily being a golden couple, they only really get together by the end and I assume you'd see more of it in the sequel, but it certainly appears like they are, like a lot of fics it's straight into the love phase, they basically live together since they are head boy and girl, spend all their time together, they sleep in the same bed (though no sex ofc Lily is to goodie goodie for that), James has a girlfriend for the majority of the fic that essentially gives Lily her blessing (because god forbid Lily ever be in the wrong) which was a really strange scene, all in all yes, the whole world revolves around the two of them kind of - at least from what I remember, I think they are only together for about 2-3 chapters at the end.

I don't remember James being overly stupid, but Sirius certainly is, it's probably one of the best examples of the stupid, goofy Sirius trope. James is worse though in my opinion, again a perfect example of the obsessed love sick James, he is treated like shit and still goes after her, when they argue the story always makes out like he was the one in the wrong when he almost never was, and ofc he's the one groveling and apologizing, ugh, it's really tiresome, especially during the mid-section where it's in every single chapter.

As for Lily being top of her year - yes and no, its one of these stories that has next to no magic or class stuff going on, she's definitely shown as the golden girl, which again is just tiresome.

Even typing this out i'm remembering more and more how bad this fic was in parts, even if you never intend in finishing it, id read something else.

******* I agree 110% I don't think iv read a fic that is true to my own impression of Sirius Black!, its just so hard to find a fic where hes not a stupid goof, or a womanizer or both!.

Head Dormitories to me are a just a cheap cop out to force two characters into close proximity, I do think the Head boy and Girl might have had a room for meetings etc, but their own common room and that just seems stupid to me. At a push I can understand the likes of the Life and Times where it is a separate room in Gryffindor tower but... yeah I mean... what happens to those two rooms if the head boy and girl are not in Gryffindor?...

I don't even remember specific examples of how Lily was a bitch, in all honestly everyone in the story was terrible to everyone else, at some points they honestly all would have been better off not talking to one another anymore. Lily was always just kind of.... i dunno protected by the story, at one point during their millions of arguments throughout the story, James says something to the affect of "you are going to be alone all your life" or something, and of course her having no family, take it really hard and goes on a tear of ripping into James for everything and anything for a couple of chapters.

Another part, James and Lily are getting on well and James is trying to reassure his Girlfriend (who is jealous/nervous of Lily) that she means nothing to him, and he says a lot of things, like she cant break rules, is a loner, is always angry etc, ofc Lily overhears all of this and then becomes a super bitch for a long long time leaving James wondering what he did wrong, she never ever tells him or gives him any hint whatsoever, its just all so bloody stupid.

********* Yeah that first example is kind of more justified for Lily, in all honesty its hard to pick out one, they were all assholes to each other at some point.

Its a shame you didn't read all of The Life and Times, but i can understand your reasoning.. if you haven't then maybe give her other story a shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2429621/1/I-ll-Take-it-Shaken-Not-Stirred][I'll Take it Shaken, Not Stirred]] its more of a mystery than the Life and Times, and has a lot more action while having that great characterization, its James and Lily focused though and in seventh year, don't remember much of Sirius in it. I don't really know any good Order focused stories i'm afraid don't read that setting much, mostly due to finding it hard to find good ones.
