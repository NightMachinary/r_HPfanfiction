Hit me with your favorite H/L stories. I'm in the mood after recent topics.

No smut, please.


** Some of these I've recced in previous threads . . .

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1500318/1/Luna-s-Year][Luna's Year]] by michelle-31a is the oldest of the lot. The world-building is nothing spectacular, but it's a neat little story with some interesting ideas and characterization, and dates before Horcruxes were canon.\\
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5241798/1/Pathetic][Pathetic]] by A-Kubrick-Spent has a whole host of content and style issues, but there is a lot of good to say about its ideas and imagination. It's also the only take on a darker Luna I've ever found remotely engaging, but your mileage may vary.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][Conlaodh's Song]] by enembee should not be read before reading its prequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By the Divining Light]]. If you haven't read them before, you should do so---not because of the pairing, but because enembee is one of the finest authors in the fandom.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=116462][Harry Potter and the Hogwarts Rift]] by Illyich follows a somewhat cookie-cutter Year 6 template, and the characterization of Harry is a little wonky in places, but it is elevated by some incredibly compelling moments and ideas. (Again, YMMV.) One of the best pacifist!Luna characterizations.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862145/1/Contemplating-Clouds][Contemplating Clouds]] by Tehan.au is simple but intelligent fluff, and worth reading despite standing abandoned at 8,000 words.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11201910/1/Different-Together][Different Together]] by Hippothestrowl is an intelligently humorous GoF story that relies on a Rowling-like grasp of character voice and comedic beats. Unfortunately, it kind of goes off the rails in the last chapter, and some have found Harry's characterization to be off-putting.\\
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1075603/chapters/2160140][Tomorrowland]] by winterfool is a slow-burn post-war romance.\\
- [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/delicfcd/SITBB01a.html][Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast]] by delicfcd is a sweet oneshot, featuring a well-realized Luna point of view.

****** Tomorrowland is probably the best H/L fic imo. Just needs to be updated! If you want something complete I'd highly recommend The Quidditch World Cup that I listed in my other post.

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.
