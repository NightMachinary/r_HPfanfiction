#+TITLE: Discovered this amazing Tomione fic that’s well-written, literary, keeps close to canon details but still has great worldbuilding. More importantly, it reads in a style similar to JKRs at least in the early chapters and certainly gets the feel of the 1940s. A little angsty, but no woobie Tom

As I've mentioned in the title, it's a pretty great time travel fic with the usual Hermione travels back in time and goes to school with Tom Riddle fic. While it does have some cliches (mentor Dumbledore, being friends with the Malfoys) it has a great writing style, sounds grounded in the world of the books, and Hermione stays relatively in-character. Tom is still a scary psychopath, and they don't really fall in love in a normal way. It's more of a cat and mouse one-sided obsession that turns into mutual respect, and some attraction. It happens organically and it seems plausible. It poses the interesting angle that Tom might be a blood supremicist, but he primarily used Muggleborn extinction as an excuse to gain power, not even caring that he was destroying a group of people as long as it was for his own benefit (Which understandably horrifies Hermione).

The romance bit is a little silly. Honestly, I enjoyed the fic more for the concept of dealing with having to live through your time travel up to the present. It filled my void for The Long Journey Home, and the Pureblood interactions and school intrigue reminded me of Six Pomegranate Seeds. Plus, this Hermione spends a lot of time making up for her lack of interest in muggle literature in her teens by reading, so the story is rife with references to TS Eliot, Milton, the Brontes, Fitzgerald, and there's an interesting scene with Tom and Hermione discussing Paradise Lost.

Edit: Also there's an great subplot with the Grey Lady and Hermione learning more about Ravenclaw mythos while studying in Ravenclaw in her new cover

It updated yesterday, and it's giant at 46 chapters. To skip the romance, I think you could read up to chapter 23 and skip to the most recent chapter but you'd miss some plot details.

** Hmm...\\
I'm on Chapter 4, just passed Hermione and Tom's first meeting on the Hogwarts Express, and am unsure what to think. Hermione is somewhat close to her canon counterpart though not entirely so. Tom, on the other hand, has me weary of reading the rest of the story. In no way, shape, or form would I ever imagine Tom Riddle winking at Hermione, no matter how innocent it may have been. In fact, I don't see a young Tom Riddle winking at anyone. Reading that was like the author slapping me right out of the story.

​

Does Tom Riddle keep winking at Hermione? Does he ever turn remotely serious? And the way they talk (especially Hermione and Tom) is rather jarring. I understand the story takes place in 1944 and their word usage is much different from ours but it feels...childish to an extent, and it's something I don't enjoy reading. How is the dialogue as the story progresses?

*** About the same, I suppose. No more winks though, I think there is flirting later on, but it didn't seem too ooc. I guess I thought the wink was part of a persona, and it didn't see an issue for me. However, if you aren't into it that's ok. We all have different tastes even in the same genre.

** Yeah, I found this one a while ago. Maybe chapter 20? It's a nice spin on the Hermione as a pureblood idea.

#+end_quote

Oh no. The least these authors could do is pay tribute to the fact that Hermione is a muggleborn and force Riddle to reconcile their relationship with his political platform.

Tomione is already a pretty dumb idea, but why make it worse thematically?

**** But she is a muggleborn in this fic. Really, give it a try before assuming the worst of the tropes. It includes them in a unique way.

***** I mean, you just wrote that she's a pureblood, so I don't think I'm at fault here.

So I guess she's pretending to be a pure-blood or whatever? And Riddle finds out or doesn't. I already read a bit from a random chapter and I'm not interested.

  When you can't change time, but you can't go forward, what is left? Hermione learns how to be the protagonist of her own story. [EWE] [Tomione*] [*mostly]
