When I look for crossovers with the Potterverse, a few series come up a /lot/ as recommendations - Percy Jackson, Marvel/DC Comics, Supernatural, Sherlock, Star Wars, Dresden Files et cetera. All of which can work quite well, but I've pretty much come to "expect" them as answers.

I'm kind of finding myself in a mood for some crossovers between Harry Potter and something completely out-of-left-field - something that you wouldn't really expect to work as a crossover but it does.

Preferences:

- No Bashing.
- Neither side of the crossover is there to just "solve" the story of the other side (ie, no "Harry becomes an Avenger, casts the Killing Curse on Thanos the moment he shows up, that's Infinity War done").
- Ships that make sense (in other words, aren't Massive Age Gaps or good-person/unredeemed-villain) and keep Preference 1 in mind (ie, no bashing canon partners to get them out of the way).


** I was impressed by the thought and care taken to fit the two shows together in linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon), a Serenity cross.

A crossover I find incredibly fun (and reread fairly often) is linkffn(Big Trouble in Old England by meteoricshipyards), in which Jack Burton, working in England for a time, happens to be lost in Little Whinging when Death Eaters attack #4 Privet Drive.

linkffn(The Traveler in Black Meets Harry Potter by meteoricshipyards) is a cross with the John Brunner novel, The Traveler in Black, and uses the main character from that novel and his task well.

in linkffn(The Spider's Web by Merrick Mayfair), auror Harry is assigned to work with Natasha Romanoff to foil a Hydra plot.

In linkffn(Fates Be Changed by The Homing Pigeon), 6-year-old Harry apparates to India, where he gets adopted by Bruce Banner.

linkfn(Harry Potter and the Key of Dagon by Don Sample) is a nice cross with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and the first of a series.

A Disney cross I like is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Alternate Tournament by twistyguru). It contains some passing references to slash, but is otherwise pretty fun.

In linkffn(Plantagenet by HiBob), a cross with Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy stories, Harry accidentally trips over an injured young man who turns out to be his analog from the Lord Darcy universe.

It's unfinished, but I quite like the Sherlock cross linkao3(The Case of the Missing Wizard by IshtarsDream).

** I usually hate Harry Potter Twilight crossover stories and when I saw the tags I was like hmmm. But I can guarantee you that this is one of the most well written nuanced Master of death type stories I've ever read. It's well written, at times humorous and even existential in some ways and definitely very unique. Highly recommend it.

1)Another Life, Another Love, Another---oh, whatever AverageFish

Summary: On her first day in Forks, Izzy Swan walks into Carlisle's office asking him to be her shrink. On her second day at school, Edward realises she smells of lightning---and that she's crazy, because no, no he does not have an identical twin called Cedric. Watch events unfold for two people who have better things to do---but fall in love anyway.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19222216/chapters/45703825]]

2) The Eyes » Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash

You don't have to know anything and I mean anything about Lovecraft or cthulhu to read this in fact I recommend you not to. This is one of the best fanfics I've ever read ever. If you like Existential Horror and an incredible experience please read it. Definitely unconventional Excerpt:

"They do not blink," Harry continued. "They do not breathe, drink, eat, properly talk or walk. They walk, but not well enough. They are not real. They are more than real. I see them," he whispered. "I see their shadows at night dance under the pale light of death's candle, and I'm afraid. Afraid..."

A sixteen year old would have been able to speak in such a way. At eleven with his shoddy and gaunt appearance, the words that Harry Potter, the saviour of the wizardry world, spoke were starting to make the back of Dumbledore's beard rise.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6870892/chapters/15678928][The Colours of the World]] is a cross-over with the anime Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood (FMA:B) that I enjoyed reading recently. I really would like to know if someone without prior FMA:B knowledge can enjoy it as much as I did.

Flame Alchemist [[https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Roy_Mustang][Roy Mustang]] is sent by the entity known as "Truth" into the Harry Potter world to deal with a wizard who has escaped Truth's judgment for so long. The story explores the differences between the alchemy of Roy's world and the alchemy of HP's world.

My other recommendations are crossovers with book Sherlock Holmes, which are sadly few in number. Most of the Sherlock crossover stories tend to feature the BBC (Benedict Cumberbatch) version that I think didn't manage to capture the OG Holmes spirit.

/Sherlock Holmes and the Ravenclaw Codex/ is set in Sherlock Holmes' true timeline, the Victorian Era. As such, Harry Potter technically isn't in here, but the magical world is very much alive. We meet wizards from this time in history and see how they react to the great consulting detective's methods of solving crimes.

/A Study in Magic/ is a story that brings book Sherlock Holmes forward in time. Dr. John Watson, back in his original role of chronicler, recounts the events surrounding the adoption of Harry Potter by the detective until the time when the point of view shifts so that Harry's Hogwarts days could be better told.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.
