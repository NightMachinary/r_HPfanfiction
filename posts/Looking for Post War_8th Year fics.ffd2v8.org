So been reading a lot of fics similar to this idea, basically takes place right after the deathly hallows or a couple years down the track. Read some good one but if people could just chuck in their favourites that would be awesome!!

Preferably non cannon pairings, dunno just for post war fics they seem to work best :D


** My favourite in the Year Eight category is Rebuilding by Colubrina. This is a Dramione with more-realistic-than-usual progression, but I'm aware that Dramione is a bit of a red flag for most. For detractors, I have good news: the stars of this story is the supporting cast, not the primary pairing. Since it was written originally as a series of oneshots/drabbles that exploded, it has an alarming number of chapters FYI. PTSD, trigger warnings, yada yada. War sucks and child soldiers suck more. linkffn(11439594)

I have a couple more stories sorted as year eight in calibre, but I have mixed feelings about most of them. Rebuilding though? Rebuilding is basically the gold standard of post war stories, imo.

She and the other summer resident - and eventually their friends - have to come to terms with how the war broke more than just the walls of the building. Follows multiple Hogwarts students through '8th year' and one additional year of early adulthood. COMPLETE.
