:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi everyone!

I'm new to this subreddit, but have been enjoying reading some of the discussions and I thought I might be able to find a fic that I've been looking for for a while now.

Okay so this was a Harry centric fic. I don't think it was exactly Dumbledore bashing, but I don't think he was seen super favorably. In this fic Harry is able to manipulate magic and is able to cure lycanthrope. At one point he was taken to a meeting with a bunch of wizards from around the world and proves that he's able to do this. He also manages to heal Neville's parents (I think his mom more that his dad due to the different lengths of time they were under the spell). I'm also pretty sure that he was no longer living with the Dursleys....I want to say he was with Sirius but I'm not sure.

That's all I can remember, if anyone has any idea what this might be I'd really appreciate it.


** Dumbledore is flawed (as all humans are) but ultimately a force for good. Harry has a natural healing ability because of his parseltongue. And also a "slumbering mage" in the parlance of the story. The meeting to prove the werewolf cure is in front of the ICW. One of the people presented as a candidate for testing the cure isn't s werewolf, the actual werewolf is a delegate representing one of the ICW nations. I hope this all rings a bell.

*** Ooh this is one of my favorites. It does have Snape being Harry's dad instead of Sirius but that's okay. I also really like his familiar.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** It sounds a bit like something by Teddylonglong, but can't say for sure. At least Harry can heal lycanthropy on many of their stories.
