Luna is everything; an abused, crazy little girl, warrior woman, seer, nymphomaniac, insane, genius, pop culture spouting...literally anything you want so long as it's QuIrKy.


** I think the 'uber-Luna' stems from her (and Harry) being the only one to walk away from the Ministry battle unscathed.

The seer thing I am not sure about, but I agree it's a bit frustrating. My personal fanon is that Luna actually /is/ damaged, from the trauma of watching her mother die, resulting in the desperate reliance on her father (thus accepting his worldview).

She was one of my favorite canon characters, and besides the hardcore 'smut' Luna, I am happy whenever she is a main character in fanfics.

*** I don't think she's damaged, I just think she's a bit skewiff in how she looks at things. She probably genuinely believes those creatures exist, but that does not stop her from being remarkably clear sighted, which someone using such things only as coping mechanisms wouldn't always be able to do because they would constantly have to be confirming their biases. I also think she's fully aware that she's a weirdo and often leans into it just out of spite.

** I tend to base my Luna as a mix of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13360465/1/Satisfied-Mind][Korpsmenofkrieg's]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13613828/1/College-Sweetheart][Brokenwingshealed]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6862426/1/The-Quidditch-World-Cup][Theendless7's]]

To me she's a girl who mainly does what she does to cope with her mother dying. She agrees with alot of her father's conspiracy theories not really because she believes in them but her father does and she wants to make him happy.

After the war she stop talking about them as much because her trust in her father is shaken because of him betraying Harry to save her and so their relationship is a bit strained.

She's a smart girl who has trust issues because of how she's been treated by others, but she has a good heart and is a good friend to Harry even if she's a bit weird.

I do agree though that fanon Luna needs some work.

** I can't say Fanon Daphne is all that consistent. I am pretty sure I have read her as the prejudiced pureblood that is as cold as she seems; a contrary shy kid that only starts to seek Harry out after Slytherin tells her she can't, a magical Friends-Rachel kind of shallow rich girl who is defined by her love for shopping, or a girl that suffers under the yoke of pureblood misogyny that knows she'll have to spread her legs to pop out the next gen, who may or may not defy her 'fate'. Not often I read a Daphne that has hobbies, passions or interests that make her seem a person, rather than a cardboard character.

The Luna I know is fairly consistent. The canon Luna at the very least is an incredibly creative girl that paints, makes her own jewelry, (and maybe clothes?) writes for the quibbler, likes her crosswords, with clear weird quirks, an animal lover who also talks about animals no one is sure exists, suffering from the trauma of losing her mother, bullied, and competent in a duel. Also, she is written as a compassionate person. That is a lot to base a character on.

The fanon take on the nargles etc is sometimes the x-files kind of 'I believe', sometimes fairly straightforward metaphors, sometimes plain crazy, and sometimes bullshit just because she can say it and leave everyone guessing.

Frankly I don't mind that canon interpretation because at the core she stays the same kind of friend for Harry. The amount of fics where Luna is a traumatized rape victim from her stay at the Malfoys or a nymphomaniac and the best girlfriend a guy can wish for are imho more outliers than the amount of flavours I have found in Daphne.

But if you miss out on some of Luna's quirks, or overemphasize others, people immediately categorize it as OOC Luna and aren't as receptive. Not to mention most fanon depictions of Luna are either mystical seer who's remarks about strange creatures always have hidden meanings, or nymphomaniac as you've pointed out, both of which get stale fairly quickly.

** I don't think we can really talk about an "Universal Fanon Daphne". Of course, pretty much all fanfications will talk about a Slytherin girl in Harry's year, but oustide of that her character can change a lot between fics :

- Her appearance goes from really plain to bombshell, I'm pretty sure I also read one or two fics where she is ugly. We can't even determine if she has black or blond hair (though other colors like red are pretty unheard off).
- For her beliefs, most fic make her "Neutral" (no matter what it's supposed to mean), but you can also easily find fics where she is fully opposed to Blood Purity or a Death Eater, and any possible variantes between them
- Academically speaking, sometimes she is dumb, sometimes average, and sometimes she is fighting Hermione for the top spot of the year and the so called title of "Brightest Witch of her Age".

Daphne character change as much as any other characters in fanfics, the only difference is that since she doesn't have any "Canon Character", you can't read a fic and say "Hey, she is completely OOC there".

At the same time, Luna is a complexcharacter. Sometimes you feel bad for her, sometimes you think she is adorable, and sometimes she is talking about how the Minister is killing Goblin to eat them in a pie so you just slowly back away without making eye contact.\\
And like all the other "complex" characters (Dumbledore, Ron, Snape . . .), fanfics writers try to simplify them and to "fix" them. Dumbledore become a Manipulative Old Coot, Ron a representation of Greed, Gluttony and Sloth (at the same time), Snape a hurt man who hide a 6 pack under his billowing robes, and Luna becomes . . . something.\\
Most of the things you mentionned are either writers attemps to write Luna, or attemps to "explain" her strangeness. But since her character has a canon base, it's easier to see when she is OOC.

In canon, Luna says the rotfang conspiracy is working to bring the ministry down through gum disease. The fanfic author (can't remember which one and I might be filling in holes too) said rot fang stood for death eater, and likened pure blood supremacy to sweets. You get rotfang, or gum disease / dental decay, from sweets. So the rotfang conspiracy is death eaters working to poison the ministry from the inside out by subtly turning people to their beliefs. It made more sense when I read it and lent credence to the idea the quibbler sometimes put articles in code.

** Luna is impossible to turn into a main character. The problem is her quirkiness and the key question it raises: does she believe in the things she says?

If Luna is a side character, that question never has to be answered. She can just appear for light relief now and then before disappearing back into obscurity, no character development required.

But if you want Luna to be a main character, with a proper character arc and meaningful relationships with the other characters, then you have to address the question of what her belief system /actually/ is. And there's no way to do that well.

If she /does/ believe the things she says, then she's a conspiracy theorist nutjob; the wizarding world equivalent of an anti-vaxxer. She would literally believe that there is a conspiracy to take over the wizarding government through gum disease. It's impossible to like such a character, and impossible to read the normal, non-insane characters interact with her believably and still be friends with her. In real life these people are shunned in normal society and forced to live in remote cabins, the comments section of the Daily Mail, and San Francisco.

The other option is to have her believe the things she says because /she's actually right/. But this turns the wizarding world into a crackish joke just to save one character's arc.

If she /doesn't/ believe the things she says, then you have a completely different problem. Firstly, Luna's defining characteristic is now a front for something else, basically turning her into a blank slate. Secondly, you then have to confront a further question: what is the "something else", and /why/ does Luna constantly proclaim things she doesn't genuinely believe? There are three options, none of them good:

1. She's psychologically damaged in some way. This just leads you into a dull angst-fest and into the well-occupied realm (mostly by abused!Harry) of endless armchair psychology in which mental illness is treated as a substitute for a personality and character arc.

2. She's got some kind of magical insight that makes what she says true in some symbolic sense (seer!Luna). This rescues Luna's characterisation but at the expense of the wider story. Much like time travel, making accurate divination/magical insight available to the protagonist breaks most conflict. It also (a) makes Luna /too/ important a character, to the point where she might subvert Harry's, Ron's and Hermione's roles, and (b) has the ring of super!friends to it.

3. She's just an arsehole who enjoys hijacking people's conversations and derailing them. This Luna just comes across as disingenuous and annoying.

Tl;DR: it's impossible to write Luna well, except as a side-character.

***** The question, however, isn't whether or not what Luna says are true. The question is whether Luna believes it or not. And that, is a spectrum. You can believe something with various degrees of certainty.

You can also say things metaphorically, or as an inside joke. Example: Every bad thing that ever happens is connected through absurd logic leaps to the Rotfang conspiracy. The fact that she connects everything to a conspiracy can be seen as an inside joke.

If I had an acquaintance who acted like this for years for shits and giggles I would absolutely find them insufferable.

It's not an injoke when you are the only one in on the joke. You're just an asshole, a real life troll.

EDIT: Actually, no, I thought of a reasonable scenario to (somewhat?) justify this. Say 1st Year Luna gets picked on as 'Looney' solely because of her out-there father and not anything she actually does herself. Then she decides, well, if she's going to be labeled nutso anyway she might as well have fun with it. Fast-forward a few years and she's stuck with it partially as a defensive mechanism and partially because she's become the mask.

I'd still find this behavior obnoxious, but Luna would actually be a sympathetic character.... it just wouldn't really be the quirky Luna most HP readers like. I'd read the hell out of this, though.

Of course, she was very skeptical of a whole bunch of other things - I remember one lesson where she compared something about the storm-section of The Tempest (basically, everything before people start waking up) to some Urban Legend about The Roswell Greys and how that was faked to draw people off the scent of the lizard people thing.

*** I think it's possible, you could write about the process of her learning her father isn't a healthy person to look up to and how she moves beyond the wreckage of her family or something similar. Children breaking free of parents is somewhat unpopular in the fandom though for whatever reason and there are far more obvious subjects for a similar story (Malfoy the most so). It's also likely to devolve into an angst-fest as you mention, although I think that the subject being more concrete than just ‘trauma' means that's less certain

e: if I were to write a Luna-centric story, I think the trick I'd try would be to make Xenophilius the actual subject. He's got a much longer history to work with, and the experience of his wife dying is a more complex background than anything you can reasonably give to a person as young as Luna. The story would then be about his failure to cope and how that led to him failing his daughter, seen through her eyes

**** I have a HC about that, in that I think the Quibbler probably started out as a satirical publication like the Onion, or as Xenophilius hiding and passing information during the war without suspicion from the heavily infiltrated authorities or possibly both, and/or, considering that it was the 70s and the 80s, he was very stoned. Then the war was over and he continued with this whole thing, and he and his wife often joked around about these things in the house or used it as code around their kid to talk about serious stuff, as they do, which then led to it all being part of playing make believe with their daughter.

If things had gone normally, Luna would probably have outgrown this phase like most children who believe wholeheartedly in very outlandish things, but at around the age when that happens, she lost her mother in a highly traumatic fashion. Xenophilius, who's also grieving, uses this make believe world he created to reach his traumatized child, but by the time he realises the damage done, it's too late and he doesn't not have the strength to disillusion her anymore.

** Problem with Luna's character for me is that despite being rather present in the canon, she is incredibly sheltered person. So, it seems that friendship is rather important to her, but she is never friend with anybody, meaning being vulnerable about her feelings and sharing her true life with somebody. Do we know what she is afraid of, what she fears, etc.? No, we don't, because she never shares anything of her true personality with anybody (that phrase “it would be like having friends” is more true than is nice, she is NOT true friend with anybody), she has just that perpetuate poker face, behind which she hides her true persona. She is exactly the type of person, about which it is said, that she didn't loose her friendship because somebody would find her true character, but because they got tired trying to find out.

A lot of the imperturbability of her persona is probably a reaction to bullies. And either way, we do find out a lot about her personality without her having to spell it out, which means Harry does too. At the time she's introduced, she doesn't seem to know how to have friends or how to share herself with them, but you'll find that she's better at it by the end, in her own way.

  This starts somewhere in between chapter 37 and 38 of “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” by J. K. Rowling. Harry just learnt about the Prophecy and wrecked Professor Dumbledore's office, but wounded members of the Dumbledore Army are still in the hospital wing of Hogwarts. He thought that the mysterious prophecy is the last surprise of that summer. How wrong one can get? One of those stories of “the summer between the fifth and sixth year, Harry gets his issues together”, but hopefully less tropey and with a twist.Response to my own challenge at Reddit.This is very much Work in Progress, so you can expect changes even to the published chapters.

​

The main difference is Daphne is used for a narrow set of narrative purposes, while Luna gets more potential roles.

Daphne is basically either part of a Romeo/Juliet tale, (Love across divides), or does the "The conflict is more complicated than you ever imagined, there is more than just two sides" thing.

​

Luna (And well, every pureblood female, and some male characters) also does the second, but you also have broken!bird harry protecting younger abused character, you have sentient magic/magic connection, you have "further proof that all wizarding adults are incompetent", you have the whole seer/touched by magic angle, and you have 'just a normal little girl with vivid dreams'

** So in my opinion, Daphne is a blank slate you can manipulate and pretty much do whatever you want with because she isn't a prominent fixture in the books. She barely exists, we don't know her. What she looks like, how she acts, what side of the war she was on. Her last name is on the Sacred 28 list but we never hear Greengrass as a Death Eater, so it would be safe to say her family wasn't one. And the fact that Malfoy married her sister because she was pro Muggleborn and not a racist pig, may mean that Daphne wasn't one either. MAYBE...

Luna on the other hand, is a hard nut to crack, if you're looking to crack her. Again in my opinion, Luna is us. The fandom as a whole. She believes in things that aren't there, laughs at random things in her head, makes people uncomfortable with the uncanny things that sprout from her head and out of her mouth. Have you ever said something that was completely wonky about the Harry Potter universe in a random conversation? Like it really had nothing to do with the conversation at hand, but that didn't stop your lips from forming the words. For example; last night my sister was telling me about the ivy that was growing around her house and for some reason I asked her if she tried putting a light on it to see if it would go away. It's not Devil's Snare...its freaking ivy. I'm Luna Lovegood.

** Daphne is a shoehorn in for people who don't want to pair Harry off to any of the other canon girls. Because she's got no canon personality she's essentially an OC Slytherin girl that is easier for people to accept than a straight out OC pairing because she is canon in that a character named Daphne Greengrass does exist in canon.

It can be done terribly or great. All of the best fanfictions I've read have used her as a main pairing. And all of the worst I've read have used her as a main pairing.

** Characters that are well written in canon are difficult to maintain in Fanon (Ron & Luna are great examples). On the other hand, characters that are basically blank slates (Daphne, Susan Bones, Astoria, etc) can be written in any way possible because their personality and traits don't exists in Canon

** I thought the book version of Luna was annoying and I was not looking forward to seeing her in the movie. The movie portrayal changed my opinion. What that ultimately means is Luna was not well-defined and is pretty much anything you or an author care to make her.

** I've done a video essay looking at [[https://youtu.be/4mSD-GAmz1I][the fandoms version of Daphne]]

I think the so many different interpretations of Luna come from a mass misunderstanding of her character - she's just weird without reason. Take Neville - we at least know his backstop and what makes him the way that he is, but Luna just appears weird for weirdness sake. As result, the rules of her character seem very nonspecific and can have creative freedom applied

** Others have already dismissed the idea of a universal fanon Daphne so I'll look at the second part.

The trouble with Luna is that people pick up on the "crazy" part and just roll with that, making every other sentence a reference to some stupid-sounding creature. For me that makes the typical fanon Luna one of the most irritating and pointless characters going. There are a few exceptions: linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup by TheEndless7) springs to mind (I swear I'm gonna start making him pay me for every link...

Luna is far more nuanced than that. Yes she has some odd beliefs but that's largely because she lost her mother when she was young and was then brought up solely by her father, who undoubtedly *is* a bit odd. By the time we reach The Deathly Hallows, she's become pretty much "normal", whatever that means. The influence of Harry and the others has helped her immensely, and she's fully aware of that - the painting that Harry finds on her bedroom wall testifies to that.

The trouble is that so few writers can take a character and make it change realistically over time. Even some of the better stories out there, like murkybluematter's Pureblood Pretense series, have main characters who talk and act pretty much the same when 16 as they did when 11. When you have a character who changes as much as Luna, it's all the more difficult to pace the change right and make it believable.

The best examples of Luna I've seen have been post-Hogwarts. I linked one above, and although I'm not a huge fan of the story, I'll link linkffn(The Granger Principle by Starfox5) because I think the Luna there is a good characterisation in that particular AU world. I'm struggling to think of others though.
