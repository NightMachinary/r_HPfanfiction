  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG

** This fic linkffn(9855330) is really great. It's a series with 3 books, of which two of them are complete. The author is quite active tho.

** Quite of a few fics that i've read that are like that usually have a voldemort/harry pairing, but i know that turns quite a few people away. Let me know if you still want me to link them though!

** I know a fic where he went to an orphanage and pretty much became what Riddle could have been. I don't think I can link it though, iirc there are rules here about certain Harem fics.

***** Thanks. You don't by chance know any others with a dark!Harry along these lines or completely different that are worth noting? Never heard of this fic and thought I have read them all. Curious if there are more

****** You probably haven't heard of this because of the Harem aspect, which many people find disgusting(not nessesarily this fic, just in general). I mostly skipped those scenes in favor of the plot, it wasn't even that difficult.

***** Actually I have read this one unfortunately. It was kind of a let down in my opinion no matter how much I enjoyed it. From what I remember Harry sort of became less and less dark to the end. I hate when authors do that personally
