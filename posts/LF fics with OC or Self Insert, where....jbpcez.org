The OC/SI joins Hogwarts as a Transfer after 4th year.

The OC/SI is light, but hates the golden Trio, and especially Hermione.

He or she is a Slytherin and is on good term on Snape.

One of those teenagers who is depressed and stuff.

Actually I read this type of fic one but have forgotten the name. I was hoping to ask for it but felt like asking for all the Fics out there that are similar to this.


** Hello! Since nobody has replied to this I'll direct you towards mine - my OC joins Hogwarts in HBP year, although she's a Ravenclaw and the GT don't feature except glimpses of them. Does that sound like the kind of thing you're after? It's a Snape x OC fiction, so 'good terms' is one way of putting it...!

Not quite what you're after but f it sounds like it might scratch the itch then it's here:
