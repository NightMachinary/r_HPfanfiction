I mean the Voldemort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][this story]].

SPOILERS AHEAD!!

[[/spoiler][He accidentally kills all his forces at the end of year 4, and tells Lucy to fetch him, his jailed DEs, which results in the addition of Hagrid in the DEs, but Hagrid is completely oblivious]]

[[/spoiler][Also, he believes that Sirius Black is also, his right hand man because everyone else keeps saying it, and hence Sirius is also hanging out with him during scheming and stuff]]


** That story is my favorite HP fanfic. It's just so hilarious. I love that graveyard fight scene.

** Yeah, as someone else had already said, “Volde!Harry is best Harry”.

And the same thing goes the other way.

Although personally I think that Voldemort and his forces as a whole in “Biting the Hand That Feeds You” (the story with Alfred the Loremaster) comes close.

*** I like that one's Voldemort better, though it's less funny. would have been better as a want of a nail fix-fic at times- not that i didn't love it, i just would've liked a harry who's bribing voldemort to work with them instead.
