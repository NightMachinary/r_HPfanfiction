preferably with both of them going back in time just one is good too


** I would love to read a good one where they both go back in time, but I haven't found it yet. I will be following this thread in case someone else recs it though!

A great fic that is pretty new (it is being updated weekly-ish) is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6255499/chapters/14333560][The White Pawn]] by Soupy_George. In this fic, a post-war Draco accidentally time travels back to 5th year right before the Dept. of Ministries stuff and he decides to tell Harry it is a trap and not to go. This fic is still in the early stages and I think it will be a monster in length because it is already at 25K and barely into the meat of the story. This author also wrote One Hundred Sixty Nine which is a common favorite "fix-it" time travel fic, so I am optimistic that this fic will turn out really great when it is done. linkao3(6255499)

One where Draco time travels 10 years into the future (from the last battle) that I liked was [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/245875/chapters/379160][Fast Forward, Two Steps Back]]. This was a really unique time travel/romance fic. Usually time travel fics are told from the perspective of the time traveler, but this fic is from 27 year old Harry's perspective as a professor at Hogwarts when 17 year old Draco comes from the past. linka03(245875)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082/chapters/6126311][Tea and No Sympathy]] is a cool "groundhogs day" fic where Draco has to live the same day over and over and slowly falls in love with Harry. It isn't a typical "time travel" fic as much as a time loop fic, but it is really good. One of the first fics that got me into HP/DM. linkao3(2734082)

Lastly, a fic where Harry travels back into the past that I liked was [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1875756/chapters/4040178][Tempus]] - Linkao3(1875756). I loved this fic and definitely wasn't expecting to based on the summary. Most basically, it's an EWE canon-compliant, tightly written, time travel fic with a (somewhat) believable Harry/OCDraco romance. Also there's an mystery, a bunch of action and other plotty awesomeness. The Draco in this is Canon Draco's great grandfather, and is very much an OC, so it isn't a true H/D, but it is still really good so I would recommend it.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

  When eighteen-year-old Draco Malfoy finds himself back at Hogwarts on the eve of Voldemort's infamous return, he is confronted with the most difficult decision he's ever had to make: Relive the 6th year at school he's tried so hard to forget, or do the unthinkable and ally himself with Potter's lot...

  Did you ever wonder where the Hogwarts disappearing corridors go--or when? When Harry Potter finds himself at Hogwarts in 1927 he never expected that the first person he would run into would be... Draco Malfoy?? 85,000 words. Written for the "hp_cliche" challenge in 2006, run by ReganV. Beta-read by Miraba. Harry is magically transported back to Hogwarts in 1926, and until they find a way to return him to 1997, he is enrolled as a student. The very first student he meets is a blond Slytherin named Draco Malfoy. A time without Voldemort gives Harry the chance to learn things about magic and himself, but that era is not without certain evils. Mixes mystery, romance, action/adventure, and first-time smut. Nominated for a Multi-faceted Award. Additional warnings: Corporal punishment, teacher/student, consensual BDSM as well as dubious consent, torture, alcohol consumption.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

****** You'll love The Printed Press then! It's a really awesome fic where Draco is a journalist and Harry hires him to write his memoirs. What's so good about it, other than being very well written, is that they go chronologically through Harry's life and talk about their conflicting view points of the same events. It's really cool and well done.

Okay, there are just way too many fics to rec so I'm just going to [[http://my-drarry-recs.livejournal.com/tag/contains:%20time-travel][direct you to Capitu's H/D timetravel recs]]. She's a great reccer, and this particular list is awesome.

Also, a while back someone here recommended [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/the-war-mages-trilogy/][The War Mages Trilogy]] by Keira Marcos to me. It wasn't my cup of tea, but it seems to be pretty popular in the fandom. :)
