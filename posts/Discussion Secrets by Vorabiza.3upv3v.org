Alright, so I really want to talk about this one because it's my all time favourite HP fic and I don't have anyone else to talk about it with (my one friend who also reads fanfiction refuses to read HarryxDraco, which is fair because I refuse to read HemionexSnape which she enjoys).

For those of you who haven't read it and want to:

Let's spoiler the spoilers and away we go!


** Secrets is one of my all time faves too! And I have way too many fave scenes. Let's see... I do love when Harry [[/spoiler][reveals that Snape is on the light side to the Malfoys, and Snape removes Harry's silencing charm when Draco insists on discussing it with Harry]] actually, any of the times someone removes a silencing charm is fun lol. I also love the very beginning when Harry cares for Victoria and [[/spoiler][gets so overwhelmed and tired until he gets help from Winky.]] It seemed quite realistic to me having dealt with real life babies before. I also love the way vorabiza portrayed the twins. I thought their characterization was spot on. so much to love about this story.

*** I quite agree. There's really quite a lot of good bonding between characters. I love Harry's defense of Snape and their growing relation.

And the Victoria plot line, the baby plot that a lot of fics (but fan and canon) can get horribly wrong, is handled so well in this.

** Alright, I'm catching up - I am now right before the big show-down, where Harry, Severus, Remus and Draco are visiting Hogwarts and [[/spoiler][Severus and Harry talks to Dubmbledore's portrait]].

There is just SO MUCH to love about this fic! The whole portrayal of Harry as this more or less ordinary bloke, who just has to rely on his contacts and to keep secrets - very Dumbledore-esque style.

The handling of the baby issue (although the more sappy stuff, like she just [[/spoiler][happens to look like a blend of him and Draco]] is not really my style - but in this fic it is handled beautifully.

Narcissa is a bit too MS for me actually - I miss her little passive-agressive, snidely commenting side, that other authors have shown in wonderous ways. She's a bit too nice for me in this.

The twins are wonderful (as always) and I am SOOOO looking forward to the big reveal and popcorn scenes!

Thanks for reminding me about this - I will come back with more, when I've finished reading :)

*** Glad to remind you, it is, again, my favorite fic.

And yeah, Narcissa is a touch too nice but I don't mind all that much.

** I'll start us off then, I really and truly enjoyed the reveal scene it is by far the funniest thing I've ever read in a fanfiction. I love the twins and their popcorn, I love the order of reveal, I love the reactions. It was simply fantastic.

There are a ton of other things I'd like to discuss but I thought I'd start off with one point before launching into a thousand.
