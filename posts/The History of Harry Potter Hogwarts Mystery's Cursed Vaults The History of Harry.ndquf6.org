** Hogwarts Mystery has such a cool story (far better than anything canon that has come out post-DH). It really takes you back to the whimsical world that JK initially created. However the game is so tedious to play without paying that I think many people just drop it within the first few days.

*** This. I'm not paying 30 dollars to play a mobile game, just give me a god damned full priced game and let me enjoy it at my leisure.

** Mediocre and generic 'mystery' that tells a mediocre and generic story.
