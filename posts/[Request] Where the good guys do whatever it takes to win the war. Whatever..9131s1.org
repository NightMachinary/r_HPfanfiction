  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war?

*** Reddit in general has a hard-on for utilitarianism, but the philosophy you're espousing is also [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantian_ethics][a very legitimate one]], backed up by centuries of scholars.

I'm a pretty strong utilitarian myself, but taking an ethics class in college really opened my eyes to how many different Moral Philosophies there are. People much smarter than me have debated these theories for decades, so I always find it really funny when Redditors speak in absolutes about a "correct way to think."

One of my favorite character-dynamics in fanfiction is between Prince of Slytherin's Dumbledore and Scrimgeour, and their disagreements on Utilitarianism vs Kantianism. For example, when discussing if it's ethical for Harry to kill people

#+begin_quote
  The two men remained silent for several seconds. Finally, Scrimgeour spoke softly.

  "It is a hard thing, I know, Mr. Potter to face the burden of doing what must be done, especially for someone as young as yourself. I am not surprised that you feel ambivalent about what almost happened. But I will encourage you to take comfort in the fact that on this occasion you were spared from having to do what was necessary for the Greater Good."

  At those last words, Dumbledore made a sound that was not quite a grumble. Harry looked up at him, wondering if the Headmaster was disappointed in him, but his expression suggested he was more unhappy with Scrimgeour.

  "I would not have put it quite like that, Harry," he said. "To be perfectly honest, I have long thought that "for the Greater Good" were the four most dangerous words in the English language, as there is almost no crime they cannot excuse when used by one who believes his cause is just. I will only say that I am relieved that [you did not have to kill] SPOILER, not just for SPOILER's sake but for your own."

  "My own, sir?" Harry asked.

  "For one wizard to take the life of another causes fundamental changes in the soul, Mr. Potter," he said. "Even when doing so is necessary and unavoidable."

  "That doesn't change the fact that sometime such killings are necessary for the public good," Scrimgeour interrupted. "During the last war, the Wizengamot gave special dispensation for aurors to use the Killing Curse, and I am not ashamed to say that I did so on occasion when my life or the lives of others depended on it. But I cannot deny that doing so affected me, and not just psychologically. Something happens to wizards who kill. It's part of the reason that spells which require the sacrifice of a human life to cast are so heavily proscribed by our government."
#+end_quote

<SNIP>

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore sighed and shook his head. "Anyway, Mr. Potter, I am pleased for all our sake that you were able to avoid resorting to lethal measures in dealing with SPOILER, and I hope that circumstances will continue to favor you in avoiding such measures in the future.

**** *Kantian ethics*

Kantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory ascribed to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. The theory, developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism, is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will; an action can only be good if its maxim -- the principle behind it -- is duty to the moral law. Central to Kant's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative, which acts on all people, regardless of their interests or desires. Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways.

The dropping of the atomic bomb is without a doubt morally wrong. Even though it was done with good intentions it was still incredibly evil. Whatever the cost means setting your morals aside.

It comes down to this: war is not comprised of good and evil. The US dropping the atomic bomb was evil. The Nazis were evil. The Japanese were evil. Compromising on your principles is often a casualty of war, however you are still accountable for your actions.

*********** The thing is that the moral rubicon you describe had been crossed long, long ago in WW2 before the nukes were used. Focusing on the nukes as some kind of decisive moment is stupid - doubly so when far more civilians were killed with far less defensible motives in the conventional bombing campaigns in Europe and Japan.

********* Except there's a rather big difference between killing a Death Eater and dropping a nuke. It was a war, they even called it "Wizarding War" so apparently people recognized it as a war and not just some criminal activity, and people die in wars. There's /nothing/ wrong with killing enemy combatants in a war. What the good guys did was akin to shooting with rubber bullets in a firefight.

If you want something like a nuke in the wizarding world, imagine something (a curse or whatever) that indiscriminately kills all Death Eaters and all their relatives (which would include many innocent people). And even then, if such a horrible thing was the only way to end the War, or the way that caused the least civilian casualties, it might be justified.

I think if the nukes in WW2 had actually been necessary, if the leaders of the Allies had concluded that the nukes would kill less civilians than continued fighting, then the nukes might have been okay. But that obviously wasn't the case.

********** I agree. Killing combatants in war is not in question. The post above specifically wants them doing "whatever it takes".

My main point is that when you are willing to do whatever it takes you are no longer doing things that are morally acceptable.

******* If not dropping the nukes would have meant a greater escalation in which more lives would have been taken and global society further derailed as a result, maybe even resulting in the necessity of dropping even bigger or more nukes than initially could have sufficed or, worse, not doing that and having some more ruthless party win control over them with the sole intention to use them of all involved and thus either destroying part of the world intentionally, or the whole of it as an indirect result or holding everyone else hostage to them while creating a worse than Orwellian society in the process, I don't think you would be quite as quick to presume to know with absolute certainty the nature of your own moral truth.
