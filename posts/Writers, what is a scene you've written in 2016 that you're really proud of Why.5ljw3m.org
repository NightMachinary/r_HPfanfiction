** The climax of my Aurors fic, which is just this really tense conversation in Harry's kitchen. Its the slow recognition that something is horribly wrong, then villain has Teddy on his lap and is being very threatening, and no one can do anything but listen to him. I had lots of reviewers mention they had to put it down halfway through because it was too anxiety inducing, which is pretty awesome.

A close second is from my current WIP and is the whole other end of the scale. The Marauders are camping. They swim in a lake. They drink beers and have a campfire. They drunkenly all decide to join the Order. It's packed with nostalgia and if you could put a fic through an instagram filter this would be it. The whole idea is that it's the last time Remus will truly be happy until the birth of his son - this scene might seem needlessly fluffy but it's going to be referred to throughout his life. I guess I'm just really pleased that it came out as I imagined and hopefully at some point it will make people cry. :p

** For me, it has to be the scene I wrote about Rowena Ravenclaw creating the house-elf. It was a cool concept, and I'm proud of the way it turned out. A close second would be the scene called 'Three Dumbledores' which involved Dumbledore using the Time-Turner to make sure that a student was petrified and not killed. The concept I knew had been used before, but the execution was hard, and I was really proud that I managed to pull it off.

** I was doing an edit of my WIP and I had totally forgotten about that scene. It's almost unnecessary, I could've skipped it an implied the developments within elsewhere, and the POV character is one.of the background players, but it just flows so well. I touched it up a bit and really think it's some of the best writing that has ever come from my fingers.

It's from Percy Weasley's POV and there are a few other characters who do most of the talking, Percy's just the audience. The conversation is about political manoeuvring and stuff like that, you really need to know what's going on to catch everything. No remarkable plot twists or anything, just writing that seems pretty well constructed.

This was third place. Second place is a very long scene wherein Harry meets his mentor of sorts to ask for help in carrying out a plot. At the end, Death Eaters show up and I cut off before spells fly. In someone else's words, the scene goes from zero to a hundred real quick, but it was well-enough set up that immersion held everything together.

First place is the most recent piece, a scene where Harry and Snape are being dicks to each other, which leads to the trick from OOTP where Harry uses the Shield Charm to reverse Snape's Legilimency. Here, Harry finds out that Snape was the Death Eater who had given Voldemort the prophecy and Harry gets very angry. Probably the best cliffhanger I've ever written.

**** Many thanks, kind sir. Btw, the Percy scene is the one in CH7 P1. If you could take a look at it and confirm my impression, my ego would appreciate that.

***** Well, I'm not any level of talented creative writer, but I really enjoyed that section.

***** Oh lol, for sure. Funnily enough, that scene actually struck me personally, having been the inexperienced but eager fly on the wall more than a few times.

** My fave scene to write last year would have been when Harry (who had travelled into a different dimension) was facing Voldemort in the headmaster's office and because his magic has been sucked out by Grindelwald, he had to use various objects to escape Voldemort and the Death Eaters without spells. It was exciting to write. :)

** For me, it's all the Quidditch scenes in what I've written in A Year's Time so far. Until that story, I had never written sports fiction. Those Quidditch scenes were the absolute hardest to write, but I think they are some of the best scenes I've ever written. The first Quidditch scene where Katie is trying out, I spent about 6 hours straight writing it and was up until 2 in the morning. I've gotten a lot of praise and positive feedback on those scenes.

** Haven't been writing for long, currently writing a psuedo-SI (I know, but I've always liked a good self insert) and one scene I really like was my character just completely making Rita her bitch. It's dark, twisted, and I just loved writing it haha :) Really felt like I'd finally managed to nail the characterisation.
