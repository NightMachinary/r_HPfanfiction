Vampires. Werewolves. Dragons. Goblins. A lot of the species in HP have a long literary history. What are your favourite interpretations of these (or any other species in HP)?

For me:

- Werewolves: I think the Alpha/Beta hierarchy can be useful narratively, but I prefer when the pack is presented as a dysfunctional family. They /can/ have a single leader, a la Greyback, but normally a pack will feel like a family unit. They should be weak to silver, feel a pull towards the moon, and look like actual wolves when they transform rather than human hybrids.
- Vampires: I've never been too sure about these. I get the impression they should be sophisticated from the little seen of them in canon. I agree with the general look (bloodless looking skin, fangs, etc). I'm curious what your opinions are on this.
- Dragons: I like both JKR's interpretation and the tales of old, intelligent dragons hoarding gold. I thought that they could be reconciled perhaps; the dragons seen in canon are essentially children and have not developed the intelligence that elder dragons possess.
- Goblins: Swarthy, clever, but bitter with their position. A cool logical mind most of the time, with an underlying ferocity and bloodlust which can be brought out. Not friendly to wizards as a rule, but individual wizards can gain a measure of respect over time. They keep their word, but wizards must be careful of what exactly it is they are agreeing to. The reason why they think that goblin-forged objects should be returned to the maker is that they believe that putting your magic into the object is putting a part of yourself there.
- Ghosts: the main thing that bothers me about ghosts and paintings is their capacity to learn - I don't think they should have it, but ghosts definitely have some sort of capacity to learn and paintings are sometimes portrayed that way in fanfiction.


** - Werewolves: it seems paramount to me that in the Wizarding World it's /just/ a disease. It turns you into a murderous wolf once a month and that's /it/. /No/ mental side-effects when you're not a wolf. Greyback and his gang are just desperate nutters, no more rational about their "wolfish" behavior than weird cultist hippies who'd ramble about totem animals.

- Vampires: Something I feel very strongly about is that HP vampires should be a separate species like Goblins and Veelas, as opposed to cursed humans like werewolves. It seems to me like otherwise they'd stick out like a sore thumb in a world where only the very darkest of dark magic can /possibly/ allow you to be immortal. Beyond that, yeah, it looks like they have a pretty sophisticated culture.

- Dragons: I've seen attempts to reconcile sentient dragons with HP dragons, but I'm sorry, it just doesn't really work. That they be children cannot possibly be true since the one in the Triwizard Tournament is a mother. The only way it works that I've seen is the recent story /Fight for Rights/ where dragons used to be sentient and powerful but caused too much chaos and were put under an inherited curse that stunts their intelligence.

- Goblins: Not particularly different from wizards save culturally; you could adopt a goblin baby and raise him as a human, and once he was grown up you couldn't possibly tell he was a goblin from his behavior. I /will/ allow that the average Goblin I.Q. may be a bit larger than the human one, though. As for why they believe objects belong to their makers: interesting headcanon, but an important point to remember is that this belief is not a wide-spread dogma but an extremist, conservative belief, which not all Goblins subscribe to by far.

- Overall I think ghosts shouldn't be particularly different from living people except that they don't have physical urges and can't affect the material world. They definitely /should/ be able to learn stuff, though not with more accuracy than living people, meaning that after a hundred years their oldest memories as ghost will start to blur together, and very, very old ghosts couldn't tell you a thing about what they were doing a thousand years ago unless that was particularly remarkable.

- Paintings definitely can learn too in canon: how do you suppose the Fat Lady knows what she's supposed to be doing? I think of them as fully sentient beings, but they're canonically /not/ a perfect imprint of the person they were based on; their personality upon inception is only a realization of what the artist /thought/ the person was like. From there on the original model can teach the Portrait to be better like them, or transfer some of their memories through Pensieve. Portraits put much pride in mimicking their original-selves as well as possible when they have an "audience", but they are ultimately different people and they know that deep down (though it's considered taboo for a flesh-person to discuss the matter with a Portrait).

*** I always look forward to your comments, they are really well thought out!

- I agree with you about werewolves, for some reason I forgot to write about the disease aspect and focused on what they were like when they are transformed. I think there must be some kind of subtle pull on them during the rest of the month, or Bill's appetite would not have changed.
- I agree about Vampires being a species rather than a curse. I think as a culture they are really very ancient, as the earliest recorded stories date back to 4000 BC (Sumer). I really like the word "Dhampir" for half-vampire, so I would like to think they can procreate with humans in a similar way to Veela.
- With Dragons, perhaps children was the wrong word. The specific idea I had in mind was the Japanese myth about objects gaining a soul after 100 years (I think). I thought maybe that dragons had to actually get to a certain age before their intelligence awoke, but it is incredibly rare for them to live this long due to hunting, squabbles over territory, and a spate of dragon hunting which led to Elder Dragons being made almost extinct (the origin of all the dragonslaying myths in mythology).
- Goblins: I think the way their minds work is a bit more than just cultural, I really like the idea of there being a dichotomy between a cool, analytical mind and a raging inferno of bloodlust when they lose their tempers. I thought the belief about makers owning their creations was common to all goblins, not an extremist belief - is this your headcanon or have I forgotten something from the HP books?
- Thanks for your ideas on ghosts, that makes me a lot more comfortable with them tbh. I think they should be able to retain their original memories, though. Not in perfect detail, but I think it's a really important part of who they are. What comes after is fair game, though.
- The paintings... make me uncomfortable XD I'm not sure how I feel about being able to create truly sapient objects. I thought that there might be methods to make a portrait more life-like, by transferring memories to the painting or through particularly detailed enchantment, but that it would still not be truly sapient in the way that people are. I do like to think that there is some essence of the original person, though, so I'm not sure what I think about the portrait knowingly acting as a person. Gah. The ethics of such objects makes me feel weird when thinking about how they work.

That's canon; there's a famous Wizarding rock-singer called Lorcan d'Eath who's Half-Vampire.

It's canon. Perhaps I phrased this wrong; this is definitely how it works for everyone /in Goblin society/, but only a few extremist take it as a central commandment and try to apply it in their dealings with wizards.

The ethics /are/ a bit weird, but I don't see them as moreso than House-Elves. The Wizarding World is bad at treating nonhuman sentients well, end of story. Presumably once Minister Hermione has sorted out House-Elves and the other such very pressing issues, she gives more rights to the Portraits and gives them representatives. That sounds absolutely bonkers, yes, but that's precisely why it fits perfectly for the Wizarding World.

And it's canon that magic can create sapient beings willy-nilly whether or not you classify Portraits as such: cf. the Sorting Hat, Acromantulas.

Wait what? Magic can't create life like that. I always thought of portraits and the Sorting Hat as sort of AI s, you know? Programmed to act a certain way (and maybe even learn) but not really sapient creatures.

What do Acrumantulas have to do with it? Am I forgetting something?

****** It is never said that magic can't create life, whatever gave you that idea? Portraits' /personalities/ are kind of "one-dimensional" (as Rowling amusingly puts it), but that doesn't mean they're not /people/, and Rowling speaks of them as such. They fear for their own lives, as seen with the Fat Lady when she's attacked by Sirius, and mingle amongst themselves. The Sorting Hat has never been treated as anything but a /character/, either. Note how he spends his time composing the Sorting Songs: that's a shining example of original artistic creation from such a magical-AI (the fact that he doesn't sing very /well/ is neither here nor there).

As for Acromantulas, they didn't evolve naturally: they were created by wizards in Borneo to guard their treasures, but rebelled against their creators and went into the jungle to live as barbarians. So magic was, at the least, able to turn something as unfathomably dumb as a spider into a fully sentient, talking race.

You know, you may benefit from reading my story. It's kind of all about this type of thing.

** *Werewolves*

I like the approach that canon takes - it's a debilitating curse, and doesn't come with any special powers, its own society, etc. Not much more to say as they're pretty well covered in canon.

*Vampires*

My preferred interpretation of vampires is the classic one: aristocratic, lurking in the shadows, dangerous in a predatory/seductive rather than warrior-like way. I picture them as very rare because vampire-hunting is legal around the world, due to their needing to hunt humans to feed. As such I imagine there's no more than a handful of them left in Europe, but those who have survived are the craftiest, most dangerous ones.

As for their powers, I would stick with the original: undead and therefore ageless and invulnerable to most physical harm, plus powers of hypnosis and other mind magic. I'd have them stronger and faster than regular humans, but not superman levels, and the smart ones avoid fights. I would keep the original weaknesses too, except for the religious ones (religion doesn't fit well with HP). Crucially, they cannot use wands.

As with werewolves, I would have it so only wizards can be turned into vampires - Muggles just die.

*Goblins*

I view them as not only culturally different to wizards but also having significant biological differences which result in cognitive differences. In particular, I view goblins as being fundamentally more bloodthirsty and cruel than wizards.

I also imagine goblins as the most populous of magical beings after wizards.

** - Werewolves: I hate the whole Alpha/Beta hierarchy thing as its based on disproven theories regarding pack dynamics and is almost always an excuse for bad writing. My interpretation is that the Wolf Totem is cursed, spreading like a disease and driving those affected to madness. Lockheart is implied to have stolen a story of a wolf animagus driven to madness in a similar manner to a werewolf. The curse is also much more insidious than most people think, that's why Remus forgot to take is potion and why most people are rightly wary of them.

- Vampires: are an artificially created species that didn't really work out in Harry Potter. Lots of allergies, weakened magical power, longevity but not immorality, and the whole craving and/or needing blood thing. Hate the SoS as they were able to use their greater longevity more effectively to influence muggles before it was implemented.

- Dragons: are simply magical apex predictors. That power has probably always been valued so wizards who made use of them as gloried guard dogs. Stories of this eventually grew into tales of intelligent dragons hoarding gold and lusting after princesses.

- Goblins: are a mainly subterranean species which is why they've tolerated wizards as long as they have. Power and position is a big thing to goblins, and most are bullies or tricksters. Ironically thet have a highly regimented society to curb there excess. Goblins delight in petty cruelty against acceptable targets and maintain the majority of the slave trade in the magical Briton away from the eyes of wizards going after easy targets such as muggles and other non-humans. They would love to have a bigger piece of the pie but don't want to risk a major confrontation with wizards to they mostly keep to themselves underground, Gringotts is basically an embassy.

- Ghosts: are lingering souls capable of little more than sustaining themselves with what magic they had in life. Generally magic that can affect ghosts is by definition dark because it can harm souls or magic. The Killing Curse doesn't leave behind ghosts making it a choice murder spell.

Most humanoids in general were created by wizards. Some where recreations of myth, while others developed there own mythology over time. They are all innately magical, but do to the majority of their power being used to support their own existence most are relatively weak compared to wizards.

** Oh, say, Another thing on dragons; I have seen a fic series which has them be intelligent; [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire by esama]].

In that one, it's explained that with all of the useful things that can come from harvesting dragons (blood, hide, heartstrings, et-cetera et-cetera), it wouldn't do for them to be discovered as highly intelligent creatures. That and feeding a baby dragon brandy has about the same effect as feeding brandy to a human baby.

** I like this question! So I'll be honest that my interpretations on some of the magical species are pretty limited because I haven't thought about them as much as others, but here goes...

Werewolves: I agree with you that the alpha/beta/family system is a neat interpretation and am content to assume HP wolves have similar limitations to traditional werewolves.

Vampires: I always thought these were just so barely touched on that they could essentially be made into /almost/ whatever you wanted. Rowling's portrayal left them kind of mysterious at best and enigmatic with a touch of hungry mixed in.

Dragons: They strike me as very different from the old-school hoarding and intelligent creatures you find in Tolkien and other lore. I see them more as animalistic rather than intelligent because they're kept in herds, tightly controlled, and can be “trained” to respond to certain stimuli. I don't see them being open to a higher level of intelligence.

Goblins: As you were describing your interpretation of goblins, for some reason I was reminded of the historical view of Jews. I don't intend this to come off as rude, but some part of me wonders if Rowling took a look at how Jews were treated long ago in her design for goblins. Examples: Jews were relegated to limited roles in society for jobs (i.e. banking), were shunned for their so-called greed, were seen as less-than by many members of European societies. Goblins get much the same treatment by being the bankers of the world, shunned and excluded from the use of wands because it would give them more agency, and relegated to the lower class fields of wizarding society. It's just an interesting comparison to me.

Ghosts: I find ghosts fascinating because they tend to be tied to a location. I've often wondered about Nearly Headless Nick and his affiliation with Hogwarts. I understand the Headless Haunt can move to different locations, but in my interpretation, they would require a form of magical permission and be limited to being gone only for a certain time period. The implication that people become ghosts who are afraid to face death is interesting and makes me wonder about the ghostly characters of Hogwarts who have chosen to make those imprints so they aren't forced to the afterlife. Nearly Headless Nick discusses this briefly with Harry after Sirius's death, IIRC, and he mentions Sirius would not have made ties to the world to stay in ghost form. So I do wonder what those ties would look like. Any thoughts?

Portraits: I LOVE this one, probably because my first longform HP fic explores the world of charming portraits. I've got an entire theory of the work that goes into it, but I highly doubt any of my ideas relate to canon. I think of portraits as sentient and like the idea of having portraits in a “sleeping” position (or fixed/arrested motion) until the portrait's human counterpart has died. In addition I imagine that knowledge the human held can be added to the portrait periodically throughout his lifetime, so if a portrait were painted while a person was in his youth, that person could submit to having his memories magically added to his portrait over time. Thus we get a portrait of Dumbledore that has knowledge of things the human version would have been aware of even so close to his death. I imagine portrait charming as a very closely protected field in the wizarding world and think most people involved would go through apprenticeships to learn to carry on this tradition. But I also imagine there are people who have gone down dark paths of trying indecent things in charming portraits, which is where the fic I'm writing gets a lot of inspiration.

(For reference, the fic I'm writing has combined the HP world with The Picture of Dorian Gray, and that's where I got quite a bit of inspiration for my own headcanon!)

:o SteamycutieAngel! In my story, I reconciled the issue of muggle fairy tale sapient gold-hoarding dragons and modern "real magic" HP canon dragons, by actually making it so that it's like the Merlin and Philosopher's Stone myths being historical reality! :) I made it so that dragons of centuries ago actually /did/ used to be sapient, gold-hoarding and village burning chaos-bringers like in the fairy tales, but that the old wizarding societies got fed up with it and finally came together and placed a super powerful curse on the whole species - which also carried on through their children - that turned them all from sapient beings into the mere beasts they are in modern Harry Potter. :)

** Dragons, in particular, strike me more as a cousin species to the intelligent ones of myth. Kind of like the difference between humans and gorillas. Same basic template, vastly different details. Wizards, naturally, rendered the intelligent ones.extinct, or close enough.

** You know, I wonder; about the dragons who hoard gold in classical mythology; Fafnir, Beowulf's dragon, Fucanglong...Smaug and Eustace Scrubb, even...are those dragons that hoard gold natural? Or are they artificially created, or transformed from humans in some way?

That'd be an interesting take; 'normal' dragons that are somewhat unintelligent, lay eggs, have a normal lifespan, and 'monster' dragons, smart and powerful creatures created by dark lords or transformed from overly greedy witches/wizards. Maybe Harry, hungry for Golden Snitches and gold gobstone sets and gold cauldrons, inadvertently finds that when he tries to follow in his father's footsteps and become an animagus, his desire for wealth influences his form...

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.
