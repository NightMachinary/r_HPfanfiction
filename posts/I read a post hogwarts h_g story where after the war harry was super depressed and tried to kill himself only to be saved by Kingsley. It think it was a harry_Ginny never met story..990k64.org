**** Alright then... I stumbled upon it posted by you on a thread a few months ago, it wasn't in private there so I assumed this was cool (you must have responded in public without realizing or something).

edit, here: ( [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryandGinny/comments/7y071z/hgfan1111/]] )

***** It's actually not an “official” archive. It takes fics without permission of the author and posts it somewhere else. That site takes works without authors consent and posts it.

****** Gellert99 isn't the one stealing stories he was just helping me find a story that I forgot the name of on a pubic archive. Take it up with the website moderators not a helpful Redditor.
