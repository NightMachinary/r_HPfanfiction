I'm in the midst of reading All the Young Dudes by MsKingBean89 on AO3. We know that Walburga is extremely abusive - she slashes/cuts Sirius, uses a silencing spell, "magics" away his hair, and even uses the Cruciatus curse. Around chapter 143 (I don't remember, I read it today) we find out that she is also a legilimens. In canon, we know that Sirius later lives at Grimmauld Place and Walburga's portrait is still hung up on the wall. Her portrait screamed whenever the shades were open, often yelling cruel things about muggleborns and half-bloods. I was just thinking about the pain that Sirius had to endure after being kicked out at 16 to have to move back into his childhood home. Not only that, but have to see his mother everyday, someone who was so abusive and hateful towards him.


** This fic does a really great job at giving us a sense of why Sirius hated his family so much. They're downright terrifying, and Sirius loses almost everything before coming back to his horrific childhood home.

Enjoy reading the rest of the story!! I was in a depressive funk for a week afterward because I was so sad it ended, and I still get teary listening to Bowie because I'm a sap lmao. Also, there is a very short fic "Out of the Blue" that is a sort of epilogue that you MUST read after you are done!

** I adored the writing in All the Young Dudes but couldn't finish it. When the bad stuff starts happening to the characters, I had to stop. This is one of the reasons why I don't gravitate toward Marauders fics (unless they're super AU); it's because you know bad shit is gonna go down sooner or later to them.

*** The only downside about being so into the Marauders - they all die and it is unbearably sad. It's a little pathetic how sad I am over fictional characters, oh well
