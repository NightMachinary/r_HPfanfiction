Let's assume they're the exact same films as we got in this reality. How does the HP fanfiction scene change?

** There would be absolutely no Harry/Ginny shippers.

The films weren't truly horrible, but if we just had the films they probably wouldn't have inspired much in the way of fanfiction. So the community would be pretty tiny and only have a fraction of the stories.

I've literally been stuck on hhr because of the movies even though the books make HG much more plausible but my inner fanboy doesn't accept it.

** 100% more Draco in leather pants fanfics.

Likely significantly fewer Marauder's Era fanfic. Did they ever explain in the films who made the Marauder's map? (I've only seen each film once, as opposed to read the books approximately 1 zillion times)

*** They never explain it, but they have Peter being adresed as Wormtail and SIrius as Padfoot. I guess you could eventually connect the dots... But without the information that James was a Stag animagus...

*** Yeah, I think a lot of the fanfic would be trying to fill the holes and explain the things that were not explained in the films....

Also, any spell could be made more powerful by tacking 'maxima' on the end, so we'd probably see things like 'Legilimens maxima' to overcome an Occlumens's defences or something....

I was about to say people would just make it so Expelliarmus Maxima takes away all you clothes (because that what people would do), but I just realized without the books there's not even anything to tell us that Expelliarmus is ment to be a disarming spell.

Harry collapsed onto the ground in a fit of insanity, letting his eyes [read: orbs] roll back in his head while imitating a snake.*

** What fanfic scene?

The movies were damn good and I will never regret seeing them on opening night but the books carried the series to popularity. By the fourth or fifth movie the series wouldn't be special anymore.

** There would be almost no Harry/Ginny shippers, even if the epilogue stayed the same as it did (which, let's face it, it wouldn't, the only reason H/G ended up in the movies was because it was already in the books). Harry/Hermione and Harry/Luna would dominate the fandom, there would be much more Draco and Snape worship.
