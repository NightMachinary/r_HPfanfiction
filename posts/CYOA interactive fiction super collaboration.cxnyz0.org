** Read up on disliked tropes in /HP/ fanfiction first, /please/, especially if you think you'll hook people onto the projects with calm statements like "Harry can go into Slytherin" and "Harry/Hermione shipped". But in theory, the idea of such a project has merits.

Not sure what a Slytherin Champion in the Triwizard Tournament would be for; if you're doing a Slytherin Harry, that would mean two Champions from the same House. Bit boring. Whether or not one likes Cedric, his status in /Goblet of Fire/ has the merit of meaning someone from one of the "NPC houses" gets prominently featured for a change. ...If you're doing this at all, I'd recommend overhauling the Tournament completely, really. Different Tasks, different /number/ of Tasks perhaps, different Champions altogether --- perhaps three teams of three?

*** For slytherin champion it would force division among the mini death eater kids when Voldemort “killed the spare”

Instead of following along, they grow and realize they shouldn't be magical nazis

But yeaaaah, complete cannon friendly ish overhauls

** CYOA are banned from FFN. No idea why that's in the story guidelines, but it's there.
