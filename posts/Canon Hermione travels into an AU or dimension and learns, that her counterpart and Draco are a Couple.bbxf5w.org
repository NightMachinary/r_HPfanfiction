she travels accidently or getting dragged into the other World and is shocked to witness, that this World counterpart of her and Draco are a Couple. But this Draco isnt like the Canon one, but in fact a kind Gentleman and soon (fast or slow) or over time, she learns to know, that they are a good fit...or something like that. A Mistaken moment that Draco kiss the Canon one could also happen, but doesnt have to. This Fic is no Draco/Hermione fic, atleast not for the Canon one.

(Though it should be noted alternate universe Draco is more of a rogue than a gentleman. But your request is extremely specific and I doubt you'll find anything that meets every particular without writing it yourself.)

  Hermione thanks Malfoy for the stories that weren't. An angsty little canon-compliant fic that came to me while I was musing over particle physics.
