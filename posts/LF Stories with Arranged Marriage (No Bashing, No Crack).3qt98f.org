Looking for stories with an Arranged marriage/s that take seriously, not just for some cracky plot. I heavily dislike bashing in general, it feels like cheap writing to me. Would also like to avoid any Dumbledore super eveil dumb shit or other super misses on characterization (basically dislike both 'Ron the Death Eater' & 'Draco in Leather Pants' tropes)


** Ooh, I love the arranged marriage trope!!

"Knowing You" is a good Dramione one that I absolutely adored; the character development and depth is stunning. 10/10, brilliant fic. linkffn(Knowing You by dulce.de.leche.go)

"Doomsday" by flying-cars is a pretty good Fremione arranged marriage fic, but the author decided to end it quite poorly in my opinion; they wrote an alternate ending that is much preferable, though the "original" ending kind of lowers my overall opinion of the fic. Probably a 7/10. linkffn(Doomsday by flying-cars)

  Fred and Hermione's relationship was never a close one, but they might have to get to know each other sooner rather than later. With the war now over, it seems they have bigger things to worry about. Doesn't look like there's any end to the Golden Trio's bad luck. Marriage law fic.

  A dwindling magical population, a community divided, one panicked Ministry, and a forced marriage law that swears it has paired citizens with their most suitable match. What do you do when your spouse is your most loathed compatriot? Well you date them, of course. Dramione. Post-Hogwarts/War, EWE format. Rated M for language and sexual themes.

** There's literally hundreds of fics like this for SSHG, they have the best and the worst marriage law fics. I'd sort by the genre and ship on AO3, or you can take my word on Care of Magical Creatures by Mia Madwyn, which I adore!
