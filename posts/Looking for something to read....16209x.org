I'm looking for fan fics that take place after the end of DH. I really prefer canon compatible stuff but I'm ok with a small bit of AU. I also like completed works as I hate waiting when it's a good story.

Thanks!


** Damn - wish I could suggest one of my own, but all my post-DH stuff is still in the works :p

** I have a few absolutely brilliant choices:

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=232569][Learning to Live Again]] - This is the story that originally got me into fan fiction. It's brilliantly-written, heart-breaking in some places, and all the ships are canon. It also has an amazing little sequel called [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=264951][Thirty-One Bottles]] that will melt your heart in places.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War]] - Also fantastic, although not quite as polished as Learning to Live Again. It has a terrific sequel called [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Harry Potter and the Winters After the War]]

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304679][Evolution]] - Full disclosure, I beta read for this one. Still, it's one of my absolute favorites. It's still a work in progress, however.

** The Golden Age - great, fully canon compatible, completed [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age]]

The best description is

#+begin_quote
  take canon and mercilessly extrapolate it to its logical conclusions
#+end_quote

from one of the reviewers.

*** Perfectly valid question, but for god's sake, it's "H/D".

***** I've always left off the second letter unless it's necessary. H/D Doesn't have much ambiguity if you mean HP/DM, but if you mean HG/DM, then you need the second letter. Of course, traditionally men come first, so that could just be D/H, but I agree that less ambiguity is preferable to shaving off two letters.

****** It's a question of having a standard form to write all pairings that is easiest and quickest to decipher (an that's why I loath the 'Drinny's, 'Drarry's and such); Personally I'd rather write their whole names: Harry/Draco (as no one comes to mind that has the same first name, but I could be wrong)

**** Sorry :P

I would recommend Reparations by Sara's Girl followed by the sequel Foundations. It's a bit weird at first but stick with it and it's well worth the read.

Double edged by roma sword starts in Hogwarts but he's about to leave. It's about 900k so a huge read. I reckon it should have been split into 2 after a certain point but mostly a great read.

Turn by Sara's Girl is probably my favorite post Hogwarts and a very inspiring story.

That's all I can think of, for now :)
