**** They're not portrayed as wrong. If anything, they're portrayed as having made the sensible decision to protect their children. The problem is the main characters don't immediately understand that an alternate universe results in different causes, effects, events and reactions, and while Arthur and Molly fundamentally have not changed, they aren't the same people that the three protagonists once knew, because they've been through very different things. And unfortunately, the story is painted from our three protagonists' POV so it's similarly coloured. But as they eventually realize, "I can't forgive you because there is literally nothing to forgive. None of it was your fault, no matter how badly you feel about it." (Paraphrased)

In fact, I'd say it's more of a testament to how loving and wonderful they are that they tried for so long to make things right the moment they actually understood what was going on.

** This sounds like a great premise and i wish i had a good recommendation.

The prompt rings some bells, i think I've read some unfinished fics that use this. The issue has been that 'things spiral out of control' is a very hard premise to keep the reins on. As the story progresses, they all feel the need to keep expanding the loss of control, adding threads to the story without knowing how to tie them together, and then the fics get abandoned.

There was one I read but abandoned for being bad. I dont remember the name but some of the elements fit. It had Trelawney, who was also a dryad and part of a harem, go back some 20+ years in time to become the queen of the Caribbean. There were 4 elemental items: a 'cauldron of plenty' that had to be cleansed of evil, the goblet of fire (which manipulative dark lord dumbledore used to enslave fawkes, making people think he was light)... And the author was angry. So angry. I remember being bored with how often they used 'stupid' and its synonyms.

I like lunar harmony... usually, I loved the fablehave xover. But this story bugs me.

Also, the insistence that vampires are broken non people who have to kill is fine, but he based it off Dracula. Especially that Dracula needed to study harker to learn how to fit in to modern society, when a person could figure it out. As some one on the spectrum, who needed study guides to fit into the society I was raised in? One, oof, man. That hurts. Two... did we read the same Dracula? Because loads of bitten people get better. It takes lots of visits to kill them. It's like half the story.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding.
