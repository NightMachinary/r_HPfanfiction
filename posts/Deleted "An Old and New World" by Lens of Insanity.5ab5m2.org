[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2468907/Lens-of-Sanity][Lens of Insanity]] on fanfiction.net. One somewhat popular story, "An Old and New World" seems to be gone. None of the links I've found are working and it is gone from the author's list of works.

Did it violate some new policy?\\
Is the author deleting their own work?\\
Are the website's links simply messed up?
