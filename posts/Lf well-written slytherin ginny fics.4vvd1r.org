I loved the Changeling by Annerb and am looking for something similar


** I hope someone posts this story that is a series of each chapter being a year of her schooling as a Slytherin.

The only thing I specifically remember is that in one chapter Ginny talks to her mom about making a french dish for Fleur because Ginny could relate to Fleur feeling outcast and out of place. It was such a nice story and I hope someone has the link!

  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. In-progress.

*** Hmmm I think that same author wrote The Green Girl (Slytherin Hermione fic). Are the stories similar? I liked the idea of Green Girl and enjoyed it for the most part but some of the writing/plot seemed really lazy, like Hermione getting everything without really trying and some plot points being identical to canon for no reason.

**** It is the same author. I'd say they're very different stories though. I mean, Hermione and Ginny are very different characters (or at least should be, and they are here and that plays out in how their times in Slytherin go).

  Ginny's resentment at her family's poverty explodes while shopping for school supplies. Under the cover of her mother's embarrassment, Lucius Malfoy slips a diary into her cauldron and suggests she'd be welcome in his home. Throw in a sorting into Slytherin and let the dark games begin. Slytherin!Ginny, Dark!Ginny, AU.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.
