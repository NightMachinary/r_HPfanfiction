** I cannot remember the name of it but that is the basis of a rather good fanfiction. He winds up bring his soul back together and realizes his insanity was a side effect of the Horcrux's. He somehow winds up as Harry's guardian under his Tom Riddle name. He actually is rather likeable overall.

It is a great Mentor!Tom Riddle fic. Now I want to read it again actually lol.

*** I remember a similar Fiction, but Harry has Time Travelled and made a Truce in exchange for the stone. He also gives him the idea that he should put his soul back together and it is a Harry/Riddle Fiction instead of Mentor.... it was a good one

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** I'm reminded of GIJoe vs Transformers 3 where Serpentor is an advanced BAT who's programming has been influenced by Megatron. He takes control of the Decepticons and manages to beat down Optimus and rip the Matrix of Leadership out of him. He uses the Matrix and gains the ultimate wisdom of the universe... he's a dick. He realizes evil is bad and starts to give the Matrix back to Optimus. Decepticons are all, "Uh, boss... You ok?"
