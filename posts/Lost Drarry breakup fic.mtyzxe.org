Hey all!

I read this story years ago that I can't find now. It was a Draco/Harry story with them in a relationship or marriage and had kids. Draco was mentally de-aged (I think!) and Harry was researching the cure in a potions company they started. When Draco recovered his memory his time as a "child" made the relationship weird and they separated. Harry went to go teach at Hogwarts for a while and they eventually ended up back together.

I'd love the chance to re-read the story if anyone knows it.

Thanks!
