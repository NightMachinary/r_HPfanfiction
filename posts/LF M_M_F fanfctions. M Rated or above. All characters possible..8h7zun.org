Good evening,

I've got on the M/M/F kink a few days ago and so I looking for everything I've can find.

I don't prefer a specific fandon. Storys should be rated M (if possible) and can have smut/lemons. It should be a true threeway too, not only 2x M/F. If it is romance, that would be great. :) There is no range limit in length, but it's shouldn't be one-shots.

Thank you very much for your help and your recommentions.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is often recommended here. It's an excellent fic all by itself, even though it doesn't go explicitly into their romantic relationships.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), goes explicitly into their relationships, but the main plot is about fighting zombie battleship BismarckMort, with the help of a recalled HMS Hood.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/955771/chapters/1870387?view_adult=true][No Boundaries]], linkao3(No Boundaries), is pure Trio smut.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620), has a Slytherin!Harry and substitutes Theo Nott for Ron. It's a very good story though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/16/The-random-craziness-file][Chapter 16]] of "The random craziness file" by Darklooshkin features an evil Trio. It could have become a great story.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.

** H/Hr/Ron most of the story. This is a very dark fic, not dark as in edgey, but just flat out dark. Well written and worth a read. One of the better recovery fics, Harry is tortured rather severely and the rest of the fic deals with him coming to grips what has happened, with Ron and Hermione helping him along.

Linkffn(What it Comes Down to by greycie)

There is smut (quite a bit of it), but the plot comes first here. Certainly fits your request of M/M/F.

  On the hunt for the Horcruxes, the trio are captured and subjected to horrors at the hands of the Death Eaters. This is more than just a torture fic, it chronicles their lives, their struggles, and their relationships in the aftermath. Warning: This fic depicts violence, rape, torture, suicide,etc. Both HET & SLASH. It is intended for a mature audience.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle
