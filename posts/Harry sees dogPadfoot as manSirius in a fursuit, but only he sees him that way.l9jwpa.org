So, there's a weird Australian TV show called Wilfred with this basic idea - man meets woman, man meets woman's dog, man finds that woman's dog is a man in a badly-made fursuit, man finds that everybody else (including the woman) sees the dog as just as a dog. Confusion abounds. Also the dog keeps trying to sabotage his relationship with the woman.

(Yes, it's exactly as weird as it sounds).

So, I'm curious - are there any fics where Harry sees the dog Padfoot as Sirius in a dog costume, but is the only one to do so? They can be friends, antagonists, whatever. I'm just genuinely curious if this is a thing.

Imagine if everyone else saw Padfoot, and Harry saw Sirius in that costume.
