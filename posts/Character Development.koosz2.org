Some word soup related to a potential OC in an AU story I am working on, as well as adding some more detailed backstory to the Lovegood family.

Pandora and Xenophilius Lovegood are closer to Molly and Arthur Weasley in age than to James and Lily Potter, and have always wanted children.

Their first pregnancy they are SO excited, they add a baby's room onto their house, they know its a boy and they choose to name him Sol, since they know that their child will be the center of their lives.

They have a miscarriage. They are devastated. Xenophilius becomes more eccentric, trying to retreat from the world into conspiracy theories and myths, while Pandora starts experimenting with magic that is just a little more advanced than she is really proficient to deal with.

Eventually, they conceive again, but this time they are much more hesitant. They don't decorate. They don't pick out names. They don't celebrate or tell anyone until they are much further along. Late in the pregnancy they learn they are expecting twin girls.

When the times comes, one of the twins is still born, but they name their new daughter Luna.

In an alternative timeline, both girls are born healthy, Luna is the "older" sibling by a few minutes, Terra is the "younger".

The two don't get along very well. Luna is lighthearted and curious, and loves to learn about her father's theories and her mother's experiments. Terra prefers to distance herself from her eccentric family at school and in her social life, is more reserved and self confident, preferring to be around people but keeping them at arms length.

When the girls are 9, their mother is experimenting with a piece of magic that goes wrong, killing her in a horrible way in front of the twins.

Luna copes by becoming even more aloof, and tries to turn her grief into positivity, helping her father with his magazine and expeditions for evidence to support wild theories.

Terra instead is angry. At her mother for being reckless, and her father for letting her be so, at her sister for putting on a happy face, and at herself for being angry instead of sad. She become more withdrawn and distant, preferring books to friends, and always putting herself in a position of advantage or control in any social setting to protect herself from any further surprise losses.

When the two go to Hogwarts they are both placed in Ravenclaw. Terra is popular, going as far as to join the house Quidditch team. Luna is less aloof and whimsical, having grown up with a sister and not just her parents. While she tends to be an optimist, full of curiosity and excited about unlikely theories, she is much more grounded especially where her sister is involved.

As a result of their mother's final fatal experiment, both girls were effected in similar but different ways, that they both keep to themselves.

Luna has a sort of second sight, that let's her see some abstract things as physical shapes, some even as creatures depending on complexity.

Terra instead can hear these abstract concepts, as sounds,, as music, and as voices.

This has given them both an unnatural ability to read and predict the world around them, how people are feeling, what they are thinking, what is happening and what has recently happened. Luna prefers to use her sight for people watching, conflict resolution, or avoiding trouble. Terra prefers to use hers to manipulate people for her own amusement and get away with whatever she wanted.

Luna loves her sister and knows that her dad doesn't like to think about the reality of his children not getting along, so she mostly tries to just stay away from Terra, but she is also sad and hurt that her sister became so heartless and selfish after their mother's death.
