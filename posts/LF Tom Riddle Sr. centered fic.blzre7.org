:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remembered it was recommended here very recently, no more than a week or two ago, but I must have forgot to bookmark it and in spite of my efforts, I haven't been able to find it again.

I /think/ it was about him trying to con the wizarding world, but I'm honestly not sure, it might even have been about him trying to avoid the wizarding world...sorry I can't be more specific, so any Tom Riddle Sr. fic I'll accept. Double bonus if it was a recently recommended fic. Triple if it's actually the one i'm looking for.

Thanks in advance!


** It's "In the Bleak Midwinter".

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
