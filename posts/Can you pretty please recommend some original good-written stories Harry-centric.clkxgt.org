  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?

** This one is amazing. The idea is very original and the writing incredible. One of my favorites.

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable.

** I'm not exactly sure what you mean by original, but I shall try nonetheless.

Azoth, linkao3(1049966) is pretty neat. It's about Harry who, after the war doesn't really know what to do with his life, until he decides to take up potions.

Then there is [[https://lop.shoesforindustry.net/]] (yeah, it has its own website for some reason, I don't think it's on ao3 or ffnet) I've been rereading it recently and I'm taking every chance I can to recommend it. It's not Harry centric, but this one has a pretty original premise and it deserves all the love.

These two are slash, and you asked for our favourite ones so I hope it's ok.

I wanted to add something nonslash and Harry centric as well, but looking at my list all those that qualify are either not that great, or are the usual suspects which get recommended every other day. So I'll leave it at that.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.

** I'm also confused what you mean by "original" because original fiction doesn't use pre-made characters created by other authors...

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
