Request ~~~~ Read a fabric on fanfiction.net a while back. McGonagall rescues harry from dursley and hides him in hogwarts with the help of Snape and poppy. They all fool dumbledore. She later opens her own school and voldemort and Lucius confront them their. If someone can help me identify this


** Hmmm... could it be one of Stargon1's fics? I remember that Harry ends up founding a school at one point, but thats pretty much the extent of my knowledge. If she rescues him in Book 1 of the authors series, I don't know anymore.

  Sequel to The Cupboard Under the Stairs. Even bars on the window, locks on the door and a demented house-elf can't keep Harry away from his friends. The Ministry hearing, though, might be a different story. And then there's that letter from his dad ... A second year fic.
