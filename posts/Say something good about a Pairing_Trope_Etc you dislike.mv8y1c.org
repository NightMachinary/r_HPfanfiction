It's time to be positive. I'll start.

Mpreg supports gender equality.


** Trope: I dislike the whole ‘Pureblood culture/traditions' trope because it tends to victim blame Muggleborns.

But the authors often come up with interesting magical customs and explore magic in a deeper way than other fics. I do enjoy reading about the alternate, ritual methods of magic that crop up in those fics.

*** It depends how you view it. Often in universe it is all explained by somebody who grew up in Pure blood society and so in character thinks of if as 'everyone knows and the muggleborn are just ignorant', which is probably quite realistic. However, it should also be clear that objectively there are at least parts of the pure blood community who actively work to suppress the ability to learn this stuff outside your family and enforce the most Byzentine and illogical customs specifically to gatekeep 'their' magic and obstruct newcomers.

**** Authorial endorsement- most writers of that trope implicitly/explicitly endorses the blaming of Muggleborns because of the way they portray the situation. If it was an ‘unreliable narrator' sort of story then it would be different but often the author presents the main character (normally Harry) as ‘seeing the truth' when the Pureblood explains it. Then they change around the whole canon universe to justify Muggleborns discrimination and make Purebloods more sympathetic, often by exaggerating Hermione's worst qualities- for example, once I read a fic where her ‘know it all' trait of always putting her hand up was actually massively offensive to Purebloods because it meant she was implying that everyone else was stupid? The author really did everything to justify the Pureblood's dislike of Hermione.

**** I think the problem is a good chunk (not all, to be fair) of the pureblood stories go on about muggles "destroying culture norms by coming into the magical world" which...frankly sounds straight out of a hard right winger anti-immigration standpoint in the real world. I know it's obviously just fan fic, but the closeness of the rhetoric makes me deeply uncomfortable.

Also there is one author who doesn't ever delve into the issues with "pureblood culture" and describes Lily, Hermione, etc. as dirty, ignorant, etc...and it basically just turned me off all pureblood culture fics because of that one awful author

** I normally dislike Slytherin Harry stories. I do think the "one house is bad" trope is dumb, but I also think fanon goes too far the other way and ignores that in the books no Slytherin speaks up against Draco's blatant bigotry, that the password was mudblood, half the kids had death eater parents and while kids aren't their parents it's unlikely it'd be a welcoming place for Harry, and more.

That said, I have seen some really interesting, unique takes that have a pretty nuanced view. I can't recall the fic, but one was where 3/4 of the house gave him shit but his quidditch skills earned him a sort of "protection" from the older years who valued him on the field and then his parseltongue earned him a further sense of protection. Some of the older years who played quidditch began to begrudgingly like him and taught him dark spells, as they'd knew he'd need them for protection, but he was also aware that this bond they had could be frayed as they'd likely join Voldemort when they left.

Unfortunately, as the series developed, the outline remained the same. She didn't change it as the series organically outgrew it; hence why the last few books felt so railroaded on the romance front.

IIRC it also drove Harmonians nuts for a while when she admitted that Ron/Hermione was a mistake of her own hubris (via interview) and that Harry/Hermione made more sense by the end.

It is deep, intense, and complicated, both their individual characters and their dynamic informing each other. It always frustrates how harmione writers remove the conflict and complexity that defined their relationship in the books.

Sometimes Hermione does not understand Harry and often does not know how to approach. Sometimes Harry is a neglectful friend to Hermione and often chose Ron's side because Ron options were either more fun or the path of least resistance.

And these things are all okay.

Incorporating these canon conflicts within fanfic would have made them infinitely much more interesting to read, especially if the story revolves around how they solve and grow from these conflicts together.

My point was that “Breakfast in New York” could be really interesting story, if the author treated their characters with respect (and not /magic ex machina/) and let them make one big mess of their lives, and they would be then putting it back together (and cut the story to approximately one fifth of its length). First pregnancy may be just random occurrence during stupid one-night stand in the overall stress and distress of their situations (and yes, I know personally couple of pairs where the Pill failed rather spectacularly ... including one unexpected pregnancy on the wedding night, which was their first time), the second one was completely unnecessary for the story.

** I can't really begrudge the whole Indy!Harry trope too badly, since the basic theory makes sense. Canon is a bit of a general fuckup where things don't quite connect logically, and I can't be too mad about their solution. After all, Dumbledore is supposed to be protecting and educating these children. From a Watsonian perspective, the events of canon are either caused by systemic failure to provide a safe environment or deliberate action. Which means either Dumbledore is completely senile, or he's manipulating events.

The main problem I have with most Indy!Harry fics isn't the premise, it's the lack of writing experience and time taken to think through the logical responses of the world. (Ironic, considering how the ENTIRE GENRE grew out of JKR's problems with those exact issues.)

That said, a good Manipulative!Dumbledore is fun. None of those "Haha I am evil Dumbledore mind control lemon drop inheritance test my boy pay friends" monologues.
