In which turning Harry into an accidental horcrux caused the soul piece inside Harry to be jumbled up. Lord Voldemort, or as he knows himself, Tom Riddle, has been active in Harry's head ever since the fateful Halloween.

Harry doesn't hesitate to seek help from his "twin" Tom, and Tom overthinking things tricked himself into thinking he was a Potter spirit stuck in Harry's head.

Cue Hogwarts, where Tom and Harry Potter gets sorted into Slytherin, and now they are stuck trying to navigate the house of the snakes.

Seriously, why couldn't they be Gryffindor?


** Tom Riddle is like Tyler Durden from Fight Club. In his childhood, Tom is the only friend Harry has and the only kid who dares to stand up to Dudley's gang of bullies. In Hogwarts he is always the man with the plan, he punishes Snape, Malfoy and Filch when they bother Harry, he is the charismatic inspiring leader of the DA and he doesn't know that he's helping Harry bring about his downfall.

Alternatively, he's disgusted of what his true-self has become and wants to take over Harry's body and destroy the current Voldemort.
