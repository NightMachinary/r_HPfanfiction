*** One Puffskein as caddy, one as Harry's competitor (who routinely beats Harry at the game). The tee is a well trained garden gnome (hey, if they don't mind being grabbed by the ears and yeeted enough to not come back for more, they won't mind the occasional tee-hit). The school has a bag of normal golf balls somewhere, as shown in first year when Wood uses them as practice Snitches.

** To Malfoy's great surprise, Harry's reaction to the latest Daily Prophet article wasn't so much indignation as it was a chuckle of amusement.

The article described, in detail, how Harry was seen in the Gryffindor Common Room, a pair of knitting needles in his hands as he sat in the comfortable chair - sure, the accompanying photograph had been specifically timed to show Harry at his most elderly-lady-like and it was a decidedly un-Gryffindor-ish hobby, but frankly Harry had been photographed in worse situations.\\
An unwanted shoot with a certain Defense professor came to mind - the only Defense professor to be a match for Umbridge in sheer lack of teaching ability, and that category included a stuttering fool with Voldemort on the back of his head.

Honestly, Harry thought, this was by far not the worst thing they could have tried to ridicule him with. He was actually rather proud of his hobby - and both Dobby and Albus Dumbledore had certainly appreciated the hand-knitted, thick, comfortable woolen socks they'd received for Christmas the past three years.

At Malfoy's further needling, Harry went in for the kill. "Well, Dobby seems to like the /socks/ I've been giving him for Christmas, about as much as he did the one that your dear old dad gave him after the whole Chamber fiasco. Did you know you have to be an /especially/ bad master to make a house-elf happy to be freed? Because I found that out last year, thank you Hermione..."

No idea why my brain went straight to knitting, but there we go. I tried.
