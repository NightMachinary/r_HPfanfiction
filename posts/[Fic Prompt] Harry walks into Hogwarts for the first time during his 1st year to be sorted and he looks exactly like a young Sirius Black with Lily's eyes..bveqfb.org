**** Given that Sirius was the one who sent him to his near-death encounter with Remus in transformed state during their schooldays and was later believed to have betrayed the Potters to Voldemort - though I can't remember whether Snape would have been party to that information at the time - I would think rather less, if that were possible. Poor Harry.

***** He definitely wasnt privy to that info. As much as he despises Sirius he would have told Dumbledore info like that. He would have wanted to fuck wormtail up because wormtail actually pretty much killed lily.

****** Exactly this. At the end of PoA, Snape was practically salivating in anticipation of watching Sirius getting a Dementor's kiss. It was likely because he was still convinced Sirius was responsible for Lilly's death.

*** IRL it's possible to have twins that had two different fathers, so i can't see why with magic you couldn't have one baby that has two fathers.\\
Technically, it's even possible via biology, albeit unlikely - twins of different fathers, where one absorbed the other in the womb resulting in one child with mixed genetics, with magic to keep him from dying of autoimmune response.

******* All of your mitochondria is inherited from your mother (the ones in the sperm cell die). So while this is an interesting idea, it would mean that only witch/muggle relationships will give magical children and wizard/muggle relationships will not. Unless there's some other factor from the wizard which mutates the muggle's mitochondria... hmm.

**** Maybe biologically but then again biologically speaking it really doesn't matter for him anyways since both his parents are magical anyway. It's a cultural thing and derived from , afaik, nazi genetic beliefs. I.e. if your grandparents were non-aryan then you are not Aryan, even if your parents are. ( Fun fact: in most beliefs of Judaism you are only "really" Jewish if you can prove that your mother was Jewish. Doesn't matter if your whole paternal family was more Jewish than a bagel with schmear)
