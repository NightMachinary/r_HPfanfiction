Hi, I just read ‚ÄúThe Green Girl‚Äù from Colubrina, and it is the best thing I ever read! Not only was it intelligently written but the idea was super interesting and the characters were really good and believable/lively. Is there anything else similar? If not I'll just have to read it again. (Ah I don't know how I can link the fic directly here, sorry)


** >Hermione is sorted into Slytherin and is immediately liked and accepted by everyone while the Gryffindors are the ones calling her mudblood and Harry is the one that doesn't show at the midnight duel

*** Hmm, that's wrong, so having the URL [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20452025]] we have the story ID in the end, so certain link is linkao3(20452025).

  Hermione Granger is not your typical muggleborn student. First off, her first day in the wizarding world finds her catching the attention of one Lucius Malfoy who makes a split second decision to take her under his wing and educate her on all things wizarding world. Second off, she ends up being sorted into Slytherin House, which is notorious for its pureblood mania. As soon as she's sorted into Slytherin, the entire rest of the school is against her, as nobody cares if she's a muggleborn or not, she's a Slytherin so she must be evil. One of the rules of Slytherin House is to present a united front, so Hermione is immediately defended against the other three houses and accepted into Draco Malfoy and his first year friend group. Follow Hermione Granger through her years as a Slytherin student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
