*** I find it hilarious, myself. Especially when they go all Lord on us poor plebs and Harry either discovers his real name is Hadrian or he renames himself that way.

Never mind that Harry and the related Henry are names fit for the lineage of the Crown, and Hadrian was used quite a few social strata lower than that.

**** Hadrian was the name of a Roman emperor though, which puts in in the same strata as Henry. Might make sense if Harry had lineage through that, and if the particular fic had wizards proud of their Roman roots, but canon HP had much more distinctly British roots, with Merlin as the greatest wizard of all time.

Henrietta and Henry make sense for the actual name of Harry/Harriet, given that they are the proper form, but it is the height of pretentiousness to actually have them going about with that name. Even the royals don't do that.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

****** For several reasons, and poncier is just one of them. Hadrian is older (there was a Roman emperor named Hadrian who built that 3 ft wall and is known for a generally peaceful reign that saw a lot of rebuilding and stabilization of an empire) for if you want to add hints of magical history, variations of it are present in more cultures (I've never heard of Henry as a name until I learned English) for if you want Harry to not be so stodgy British. The most famous king Henry is not exactly someone I want to associate my kid with, especially if you use Anne Boleyn as a witch in your head canon.

** It's one of those great ideas that became shit over time. A good idea that works wonderfully, but it is then poorly copied and overused to the point where even the original usage that is good is cast in sickly shade due to it.

** I'm not a big fan of prongslet; I feel like nicknames or terms of endearment should be easy or fun to say. I can understand Sirius calling him pup, it's quick, easy, and shows Harry in relation to Sirius. Prongslet however, gets stuck in your mouth and you have to fight it to make it come out in some semblance of smooth. No to Prongslet.

** prongslet sounds like it would rhyme with bralette. It was never said in the books so it's not as if we can blame them like we can for so many fics that have people calling Hermione "Mione" all because Ron called her that when his mouth was full.

** .... You know, I honestly have no problem with the petname "Pronglet".

No flames, please! Let me give my reasonings first!

1) Since James Potter's animagus name was Prongs, it would make sense that Pronglet would be Harry's petname until he got his own animagus name.

2) Nothing says that it would remain an affectionate petname for him. Once he does gain an animagus form that DIFFERS from his father's in some fanfics, it generally changes to something else.

And, last but certainly not least: 3) It's something that will just stick around. Get used to it. At least it's better than some other petname that he's been given in fanfictions.

Those are my reasonings. Besides, I'd like to see any of YOU create a better petname that correlates with his parents and/or him WITHOUT referencing his scar, hair, or eyes.
