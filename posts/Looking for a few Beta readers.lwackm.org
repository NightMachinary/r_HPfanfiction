A few days ago, I responded to a prompt on this post:\\
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/lt7j4h/harry_had_always_wanted_to_have_a_loving_family/goyqwpm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]]

I liked what I wrote, so I started putting together an outline for my first full-length fic of my very own. I've been writing almost constantly since then and I just got through the introduction and Harry's time in Durskaban.

I'm working on the 9th chapter right now and I'm at 25,000 words.

I would like to find a few people to help me edit and build the story as well as get an initial response.

My ideal beta readers would have a knowledge of British vernacular to make the dialogue sound a little more authentic. Past experience as a beta reader or writer would be super.

Knowledge of the flora and fauna of the Philippines would be excellent. Any knowledge of monkey or gorilla societal structure would be perfect. Though these two I highly doubt there will be many to match this.


** I have some knowledge of Gorilla and Monkey social structure, and have experience writing. I could do with learning more about Philippine flora though.

*** Is this sub a collection of people with random knowledge or what?

**** It probably is. The only other thing we all share is an association with a particular fantasy book, so by definition, all other knowledge we have is random.

*** Awesome, never thought I'd get one of those. There will be a lot of interactions with Demiguises in the fic and I want some similarities or just flavor from that.
