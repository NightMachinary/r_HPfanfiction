:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic three years ago that was from Ron's perspective. I believe it explored if Ron and Hermione had gotten together before it was announced in the book. I remember an author's note saying it had been released before the Deathly Hallows book had been released, and that many people suspected that Ron and Hermione had gotten together without Harry knowing, so it had to be from before 2007. A Reddit thread recommended it to me but I can't find it anymore. Also sorry if I flaired incorrectly, this is my first time on this sub!


** Is it this?

  Or, Ron Weasley's Year Six Diary: the whole of Half-Blood Prince from Ron's point of view. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to shake him.
