I'm writing a fic which starts when Harry is eight or nine, and I'm having trouble writing him as a believable kid. He's currently going through a lot of emotional turmoil, but if I write him as an /actual/ young kid (throwing tantrums, whining) its irritating. If he's mature about it, it comes off as Harry being older than he is. Anyone have any tips?


** If it's 8/9-year-old canon Harry being thrust into a new situation (e.g., being rescued from the Dursleys), keep in mind that life with the Dursleys has trained Harry to play his emotional cards close to his chest.

So if we're talking about a Dursley-raised Harry

- He's not likely to throw tantrums or make a scene when he's upset, because in his childhood that would just make things worse. He's going to go off on his own to sulk over what happened and cry in private if needed.

- If he's suddenly being raised by someone else, he will be cautious about upsetting them and might worry that he'll be sent back even if the person is saying repeatedly that he won't. Unlike most children, Harry doesn't fundamentally trust that adults know what they're doing.

- He's independent. He's used to dealing with his own problems without any help from adults.

- He's learned not to show weakness in front of the Dursleys, so crying in front of someone else would be involuntary and only when he was basically at a breaking point.

It might help to know more about the fic and Harry's environment.

*** The situation is actually pretty complicated, now that I'm writing it out. Basically, the soul piece within Harry has a bigger impact than in canon (in subtle ways, he doesn't have a voice talking in his head). Therefore, not only is Harry earnest and straightforward, but he's also manipulative and perhaps verging on a personality disorder. The Dursleys' unfair treatment of him has only encouraged his darker traits (stealing things from them, lying) and also early on in the fic, a trusted figure betrays him, causing him to be distrustful of everyone (more so adults).

Another thing is that Harry is smarter than in canon due to TMR's high natural intelligence essentially having bled onto him, so he thinks on a higher level than most kids his age, but I still want to make it believable since he is still Harry at his core, not LV.

I'm trying to fit this all together without Harry coming off of as unbearably angsty, narcissistic, or annoying. Also trying to make him seem realistically kid-like. I've written a good bit already, and I /think/ I've got him down pretty good, but some extra advice wouldn't hurt.

** I work with a variety of children in a psychological/educational setting. When it comes to acting out emotional turmoil, you have two different kiddos: externalizers and internalizers. Externalizers are the ones that throw tantrums, misbehave, exhibit noncompliance, etc. This is the most common, and therefore they are the ones who get the most (often negative) attention from adults. Luckily for you, I don't think Harry would fall into that category. He is definitely an internalizer. Internalizers are often ignored/missed because they seem at the surface a well behaved child. These kiddos are anxious, they worry a lot, they have low self-esteem, etc. They pull in all the bad stuff and keep it inside.

*** Thanks, this is really helpful! Do you have any tips for writing an Internalizer without having the story delve into angst?

**** Yeah, no problem! I'm glad you found it useful. Normally we try to use screeners to pick those kids out. Teacher answers questions about each student, and then a computer program flags the ones that are significant. When you don't use that kind of stuff, you have to rely on your own interactions with the kids. You think everything is completely fine, and then there will be a moment where a light bulb goes on in your head. Like they will say something vague, and then you realize, "Oh shit! This kid is homeless!" or something. So, if I were writing a story, I would make him seem like an obedient/quiet child until the climax reveals his distress. I'm not sure how your story works, but use descriptive phrases like "turned away", "avoided eye contact", "spoke quietly", etc...and then have one moment where it is glaringly obvious that he's hurting inside.

There are small details that signify an internalizer, but usually we, as care providers, tend to focus our energy on the kid that's flipping tables and screaming. Both are equally important, but one often goes unnoticed until it's a huge problem.

(As you can probably tell, I'm passionate about this kind of stuff.)

** Kids are bloody difficult to write. It doesn't help that as a person, I did not have an exceptional childhood (mostly just boring and somewhat lonely) and thus not much stands out to me. This is what I've gathered from others, though:

- Kids lack knowledge. This is a big thing, even with smart kids. They don't know certain words, they don't know certain pop culture, they don't know the consequences of a certain act, they just don't /know/. They've never come across it, they've never heard of it, etc etc.

- In the same vein, kids lack experience. The difference between an adult and a kid with the same attitude in the same situation is past experience. The adult will be less surprised, more prepared, have a better or worse response, etc etc.

- kids are more emotional. They're also more impulsive because of that emotion. Often they do something that "sounds like a good idea" because they don't bother to think it through, or because they lack knowledge of the consequences.

- In the vein of experience, kids lack empathy. They can do sympathy just fine, but in most cases kids are off in their own little world, and they don't even know it. They simply don't have the frame of reference. I remember when I was a kid, the word "introspection" held no meaning to me, even if I knew what the word itself meant.

Of course, this is not a definite list. There are plenty of kids who don't follow a word of what I wrote here. But in my limited experience, and from what I gathered from others, this is a big part of being a kid.

** If you really want to have him be a kid, then there are three ways to go at it: leave the scene as it is and play on the readers' irritation, shorten the scene as much as you can and only allude to whatever details you need later once Harry gets more mature via flashbacks, or fit something into the story before that scene that makes him a bit more mature in that particular regard.

Outside of that ... well, it depends on what exactly you are writing, especially since in the original story Harry did not appear to have been the sort of kid who'd keep on throwing tantrums and whining outside of specific situations and even then not for long.
