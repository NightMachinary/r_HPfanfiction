I'm looking for a fic where Voldemort's soul being acquired opens up a lot of vulnerability, because if it can hold him on the mortal plane, then it can still affect him. Like, someone uses a ritual and Voldemort just gets rekt.


** Theoretically speaking since horcruxed souls are connected through some kind of link such as with the scar crux ( and how regret can nend the soul back together), you should be able affect the main volde soul by tampering with a horcrux.

Emotional manipulation is just the start of it.

** Or Horcrux becoming independent and challenging Voldemort's position openly, like in our sub favorites [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(3401052;10677106).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/][Patron]], linkffn(11080542), is one fic in which his enemies exploited that link to absolutely devastating effects.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
