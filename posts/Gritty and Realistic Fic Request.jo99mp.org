As the name clearly states, I'm looking for gritty and realistic approaches to Harry Potter, preferably focused about Harry without him being overpowered or if he is, justify it. Thanks y'all.

  One tiny change makes all the difference in the world. When Harry discovers a small box in his vault during his first visit to Gringotts, he is hoping for a memento of his parents. Instead, his discovery starts him down a path of intrigue and suspicion. Not sure who he can trust, Harry will have to learn to rely on himself. Book 1 of The Cry of Freedom. Updates every Tuesday.

** Behind Blue Eyes is more Bleak than Grit, but it's certainly a very grounded approach to Harry Potter. Lots of running away from "Real life isn't like that." type sentiments.

** I actually just finished reading a series that does a decent job of depicting a full-scale war, but it's not Harry-centric. And not only is it a million words, but it's a spin-off of the linkffn(Pureblood Pretense) series, so you really do need to read that first, and PP is Harry-centric but is not particularly gritty and is also (more than) /another/ million words.

If you're not scared off yet, you can take a look at [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1722145][The Revolutionary Arc]] (but you really do need to read Pureblood Pretense first, at least books 1-3).
