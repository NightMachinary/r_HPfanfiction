Noticed this a couple hours ago. Anyone else having the same issue?

** FF has been having some issue with its database for almost a day now. It goes on and off. It looks like you can access the site normally now but maybe the mail still isn't working properly yet?

Yes, I'm also having email problem, and there are still 2 reviews on my story that haven't appeared yet.
