Doesn't have to be HP fanfiction; anything well-written will do.


** I'm sure there are others, but this is the first one that comes to mind:

** The sequel to linkffn(Child of the Storm) is actually episodic and labels each chapter by plot arc (ex: Red Son I-VII)

Linkffn(Ghosts of the Past)

The first one only sometimes fits your criteria though

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...
