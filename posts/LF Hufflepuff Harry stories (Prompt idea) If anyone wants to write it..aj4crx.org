I feel like Hufflepuff is so under used in stories, especially for Harry being sorted in it. There's stories of him being sorted in Gryffindor, Slytherin and even Ravenclaw. But not that many with him being sorted into Hufflepuff.

I'd like a multi-chapter story the most, and would like things to change; instead of just re telling the story, just with Hufflepuff Harry. Maybe Harry being friends with people other than Hermione, Ron or Draco as well.

I would love to see Harry being friends with people other than Ron, Hermione or Draco in the story. But I don't like/want bashing, so as little actual basing as possible, or non at all is preferred, personally.

If he's sorted into Hufflepuff, his kindness and more nice behavior and similar stuff should be shown more than his brash behavior from Gryffindor.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** I can't find it (pretty sure it's out there), but there is a fic where Harry lives with OC orphan girl without going to Hogwarts until DUmbledore finds him by pure chance and essentially abducts him to Hogwarts. He is sorted to Hufflepuff, gets trained by Sirius and Remus who stand by him, renders Draco Malfoy into a vegetable state, escapes with a broomsticks with Sprouts' help, and falls in love with Fleur. I liked it a lot. It might be seen as Ron Bashing due to in-story circumstances, but it's a very minor part of the story.

** linkffn(Correspondence Interrupted by Rawr1983). Covers year 1 plus a little.

linkffn(It Isn't Easy Being A Hufflepuff by trillium248). This one is a "wake up younger after winning in an AU" fic.

linkffn(The House of Badgers by phoenixgirl26). Harry transfers to Hufflepuff during the Tournament.

linkffn(The Sound of Silence by birdwoman95). Harry is sorted into Hufflepuff, where his abuse is discovered. One-shot.

  Harry's treatment at the Dursleys didn't make him -- it broke him. At Hogwarts, broken children make their way to the home of the badgers. No one protects like a badger. The outcome? Heads fly. This is the trial of Albus Dumbledore. Rating due to child abuse mentions. Format is weird.
