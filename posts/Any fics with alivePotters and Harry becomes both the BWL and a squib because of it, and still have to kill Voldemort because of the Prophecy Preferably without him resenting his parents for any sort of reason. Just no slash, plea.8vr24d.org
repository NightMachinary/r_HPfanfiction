Dunno if I was clear, but what I want is this: You know the trope where Harry is a "squib" and sent to the Dursleys even if he isn't actually one (in alivePotters fanfics) and ends up hating his parents because they gave him up "for his best".

What I want is sort of like this, but instead of him not actually being a squib and hating his parents, I want him to stay with his parents and despite actually being a squib, having to train and fight to kill Voldemort, using whatever is possible for a squib to use magically, most likely runes and potions.

I don't want any sort of hating or bashing for Lily,

James I don't really care, there has only been maybe 4 James's that I enjoyed while reading fanfic, even if he's doing what's acceptable, he just isn't a character I like. I hate bullies even if they "grow up". Not to say that someone can't redeem himself, but its rare for me to find a fic where it shows he's actually grown up.
