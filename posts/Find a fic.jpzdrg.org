:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Fic where Harry Potter wakes up on the day of the third task, thinking he is dreaming. He follows along but gets to the ritual alone and interrupts it. He goes to flitwick for some mentoring, I think he pairs with Luna. I remember a line where Sirius asks Harry to tell him something that happened "in this timeline" to get him mad at Dumbledore. He tells him about the cupboard and so he goes to Hogwarts and punches Dumbledore yelling

"Stay away from my son"

He also turns to Snape and says

"Did you love her?"

I would appreciate it if you can help me find it.


** Easier than falling asleep by Jacob apples the formatting is really off now since the author got mad because of reviewers. Now it's only 3 chapters for the entire story
