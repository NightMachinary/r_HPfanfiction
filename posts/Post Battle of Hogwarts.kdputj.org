Anything which falls under this category? Something which follows on directly from the final battle.


** Almost every author has tendency to write chapter 37 of DH, because obviously it is very much missing. So, just randomly:

- “Grave Days by Northumbrian” linkao3(3301733)
- “The First Year, an Almost Happily Ever After story by JetLaBarge” linkffn(8011494)
- “[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War by Mrs_Granger]]”
- “Chapter 37 by illjwamh” linkffn(4495536)
- “Aftershocks by StainedGlassSkyscrapers” linkffn(11858501)
- “Starting Over by serendipity_50” linkao3(571142) and especially its sequel “ Inner Demons by serendipity_50” linkao3(601124).
- “proof by novensides” linkao3(15687453)

  The Battle of Hogwarts is over. On the third of May, 1998, Harry wakes to a changed world, to a future he did not think he would have. This is a story about those first days after the battle. Days of mourning and funerals, love and loss. Grave Days.

  PLEASE NOTE: The warnings on this story are strictly precautionary in case of triggers. The violence is not exceedingly graphic and the rape/non-con is attempted only; both occur in later chapters.Harry and Ginny lived happily ever after...eventually. After the war, things didn't go as easily as they should have.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

  Fairy tales end "And They Lived Happily Ever After," but good stories continue on "one season following another, laden with happiness ... and tears." The first of 4 stories covering the 19 years until Albus goes to Hogwarts. I have a rough draft all the way to the finish!

  Like many Potter fans, I enjoyed book 7, but was perplexed by how there seemed to be a chapter missing at the end. You know, right after the climax and before the epilogue. This was my solution. I'm a year late in posting this.

  The Battle of Hogwarts took many lives, and left many scars. In the wake of tragedy, one young witch searching for answers and healing finds a new beginning on a path that could lead to her ruin, or her salvation. A prequel to my upcoming Harry Potter/Avengers crossover story 'Not a Hero'.
