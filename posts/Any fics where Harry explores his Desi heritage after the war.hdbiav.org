** I've generally found most attempts at making Harry an Indian to be half-baked ideas without fully being fleshed out. Quite often they change the name of Harry to Hari, but never change James Potter to something else. I've even seen Fleamont and Euphemia being named the same! The name James sounds pretty English and Christian to me. But they argue James was celebrating Diwali - a Hindu festival.

As an Indian, I get too boggled down by the logistics in these stories even though I was initially excited to see this trope.

Honestly, I would be glad if fic writers stopped spelling /Parvati/ as /Pavarti/ (sounds too much like /poverty/ for my comfort). I consider dropping fics because of it but remind myself to be kinder since I mispronounced Hermione for years.

Sorry for the rant! Couldn't help myself üò¨

** The "dark" part is because Harry's hair is black while most of Book!Dursley's were blonde(I think Petunia was blonde too).

Harry doesn't have Indian ascendancy as far as the books are concerned, I now finally understand why some people draw him with darker skin, despite the fact there's nothing in his family tree to indicate that. Heck both his parents where white, all pictures and drawings we have of them are like that.

When JKR chose the actors she knew exactly how the should look like, even if she decided to allow Hermione to change later because it would earn her points and it's not like it would matter to the plot anyway.

I honestly have never heard of this theory before, nor have I seen any fic that even claims this, some of them claim he has Spanish blood(because Salazar is a Spanish name) or even Irish due to his mother's red hair. But Indian, lol.

It would be interesting, maybe a way for him to connect with the Patil twins.

** I like the idea because it'd be unique/interesting to read in a fic (compared to the billions of other tropes that are cringe-worthy now), so I'm interesting in recs too, but /canonically/ Harry having Indian heritage? Uh, that's... uh, it's bull built on 'evidence' (read: coincidences and wafer-thin conjecture) so flimsy it makes Lockhart canonically look like Dumbledore, heh.

Plus, I've heard from people in passing that those who are either Indian nationalists or those who think Indian culture is the greatest thing since sliced bread are the ones who rabidly believe this 'theory' (I'm not calling you one of these people OP, just that it's a massive thing with them).

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~‚ÄúAre you trying to get killed, Potter?‚Äù Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. ‚ÄúThis is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.‚Äù Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, ‚ÄúPotter, what the hell--‚Äù~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
