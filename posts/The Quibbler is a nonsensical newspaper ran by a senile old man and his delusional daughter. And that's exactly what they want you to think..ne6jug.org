I was thinking along the lines of the Quibbler being used like the radio in the French Resistance. Where there would be some nonsensical words spat out at the end. Nope, turns out, its code from the Order of the Phoenix.

** Nargle= Death Eater

Crumple Horned Snorcack= Voldemort

Wracksprut Infestation= Dark Magic

Heliopath= Ministry Worker

It works out!

For example: Reports of Nargles gathering in forbidden forest appear to be unfounded. In other news. a crumple Horned Snorcack has been sighted in Gibraltar.

Translation: Death Eater activity in forbidden forest is a misdirection. Voldemort is doing something in Spain.

** "And now for the Quibbler's Runic cross-section puzzle from three days ago!" Hermione said cheerfully.

"The main five Runes are Crossroads, Evil, Mound, Wind, Sword. If we arrange them with the lesser 'bonus' Runes, we get The Sword of the Mound Encounters Evil Winds at the Crossroads. Now if you look at today's Prophet, you get a report of a Death Eater Inferius summoning being interrupted by the Dark Forces Defence Leagues' graveyard patrol task force on the English-Welsh bordertown of Witch's Crossing, where two magical highways are known to intersect. They know!" Hermione exclaims. "I bet you both a galleon that Luna and her father are covertly publishing intelligence on the pureblood supremacist movement and have been doing so for years!"

"Blimey Hermione." Ron said. "That sounds barmier than Xeno when he gets going! Tell you what, I'm in on that bet."

"Me too." Harry said. "I really hope I lose too, because that would be worth anything."
