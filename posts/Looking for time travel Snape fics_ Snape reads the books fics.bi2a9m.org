Like the title says!

I searched for the first one and only found ones where he goes back to his childhood/Hogwarts years but I'm looking for ones where he goes back maybe just before Harry gets to Hogwarts or sometime during Harry's Hogwarts years. If that makes sense

And for the second one, what's your favorite read the books fanfic where Snape is reading them too? Could be before or during Harry's time. Preferably more than just a few chapters


** I really like linkao3(14041326;14082594) --- the first is for HPPS, the second (unfinished) is HPCoS; Dolores Umbridge whole-school reading of the book provided to her by the Room of Requirement. Nicely written.

  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
