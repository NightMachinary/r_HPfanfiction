** Linkffn(one step forward two decades back) might be it. Not Tomione, but it's SS/Hermione and I could see how those could be confused ¯\/(ツ)//¯

  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius & Regulus Black, & member of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.

** this isn't quite what you're looking for but it does involve Hermione as a Black. fic is still in progress but i don't think the end pairing will be Tomione; it's still good, though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23187961/chapters/55506400]]

this one is semi-rebirth, semi-time travel. it's not Tomione but is a very good read; i'm going to reread it next week. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1339873]]

  Bellatrix Lestrange wasn't always mad. There had been something, in fact one thing in particular, that tipped her over the edge. Fifteen years later, Hermione must come to terms with a startling truth and become someone she never thought she'd be: a perfect Death Eater's daughter.
