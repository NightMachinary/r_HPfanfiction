In the first book, they sing the Hogwarts song to the tune of a funeral march to start off Harry's Hogwarts career, and in book 7, Harry's Hogwarts career needs in one of their death. Has anyone else noticed other creepy foreshadowing in the series?


** That's not really foreshadowing. They were just being jackasses by holding out as long as possible. It's way too much of a stretch to say that was an indication of anything that came later.

*** I realize it probably wasn't intended as foreshadowing, but it's a pretty creepy coincidence. For all that Rowling didn't give divination much credit in canon, there were times when characters accidentally foretold the future, like Harry's final exam in 3rd year where he insisted Buckbeak flew away or Ron telling Harry he'll come into unexpected wealth (could be either the Triwizard winnings or Sirius's inheritance).

** In Order of the Phoenix, when 13 people are sitting around the table in the kitchen, arguing over how much to tell Harry, Sirius stands up first to argue with Molly. Then after he sits down, Fred stands up (followed by George) to keep arguing. I don't think all 13 sit down again.

I have no explanation besides seer ability for their bet on the quidditch game in Goblet of Fire.

*** They knew the Irish chasers would curbstomp and that Krum was a far better seeker.
