** Linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) - probably the best Harry Slytherin story ever written. Sadly abandoned.

Edit: this story I'm currently reading:

**** I feel like occasionally coming back to a story every couple of years doesn't stop it from being abandoned so much as it makes it an abandoned story whose author occasionally thinks of it and writes a chapter.

I used to have a dog, but I couldn't keep it anymore so my father and his girlfriend took it. Every once in a while I'll be at their house and I'll pet the dog for a minute. In this minute, taken in isolation, it looks like this dog is still my dog, and I'm still enthusiastic about it. But I have't so much as though about this dog for a couple months, and once I leave I won't think of it again until I happen to see it and pat it on the head for a few seconds, and it turns out that it still isn't my dog.

  A story about Harry in Slytherin house wielding the elder wand and the powers of an elemental. Features annoying Weasley's, an OFC, a flawed but good Dumbledore, an indifferent Snape and lots and lots of twists.

** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin is my favorite and (as a plus) it's regularly updated. The 3rd volume (it's a planned 7 book series) is coming this September.

A bit of a warning: the first book starts off very clich√© and over the top, but the last half and entire second book subvert the cliches and are very well written.

**** While it appears that way at first, reasons are eventually provided as to why they left him with the Dursleys. Believable ones as well, at least in my opinion. You have to get pretty far into the fic for that though since it isn't properly addressed until part way through 2nd year.

**** I'm still confused about what exactly is bashing? Is it bad if they did something that they most certainly shouldn't have that repercussions happen, and people are unhappy towards them?

Most stories don't always have normal ideas. Also some people could get caught in the fame of having a child who defeated Lord Voldemort. Just because it's rare doesn't mean it would never happen.

******* Not really, this story is bad because it is poorly conceived and the changes are contrived. The reason that fans dislike stories like this one is that its conceit, and many like it, are not believable. Harry is dropped off at a relative's house for a decade for a reason that is utterly nonsensical, and then...

A good story of any genre that has elements which are unlikely in the real world is written to allow the audience to (easily) willingly suspend their disbelief. A poor story in any genre asks the audience to stare in disbelief at its Willy suspension.(Please note that willingly was used in the above sentence to make a better joke, and pay homage to the Blackadder, a well conceived storyline makes internal sense and the well developed story around it helps the audience stay involved, look at good fiction for confirmation)

Finally, there is very little in the way of new plot ideas or novel adaptations to be found in a realm as well explored as the Harry Potter universe. Instead there is a dearth of stories that are well written, well conceived, and original in terms of thoughtfulness in both character development and plot. People "hate" stories that offer nothing of value, and a poorly executed storyline about the trodden path of the "WBWL" so common that it has its own acronym, is one where there is little value added. It is in fact a waste of time for fans who have read better, and also many iterations of the same old regurgitations.

An Unfound Door linkffn(7552826) is a wbwl fic that is pretty cool but still hard to swallow because of the cliche inherent in the concept itself. It even starts later on, quite cleverly, so as to avoid the cringing, whinging, unpleasantness that this sort of fic often entails, yet still falls on its face.

Sometimes a story is bad because it is poorly written, poorly conceived, or has nothing new or valuable to contribute. Actually when a story is bad, it is always because of one or all of these pitfalls. Sadly even when we find a story that to us seems to avoid these issues, others, whether through their over indulgence, differing tastes, or differing expectations, may still find within that beloved story-execution one or all of these issues.

This one is just weak, but it should be noted, in reference to your point, that a great part of what makes a fix worthwhile is the execution of its own internal changes to the established world.

***** I don't really find its reasons for why James and Lily sent harry away and never checked up on him that great, or at least it still paints James and Lily in a poor light imo. They should have at least checked if Dumbledore's theory was valid or not first, and even if it was they should have at least visited him occasionally to make sure he was ok. I like the story still though and while James/Lily make some bad decisions I also wouldn't really call it outright bashing.

**** Sorry, what is WBWL? I know it was in OP but I don't know what it means. I'm guessing "wrong boy who lived"?

Also, it gives a good reason for James to abandon Harry (I can tell you if you don't mind spoilers). So they're far from heartless child-neglecters.
