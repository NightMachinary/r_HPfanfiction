Some fics that fill this description that I've read: linkffn(Amicus Protectio Fortis), linkffn(Harry Potter: Dark Memories), and linkffn(2954601)


** This makes me think of Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness, and really the DAYDverse as a whole.

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?

** Linkffn(Harry Potter's Army: A General's Lament by Sharptooth) this is a pretty good one imo. Thought there are a few character deaths some major.

** I forgot the name but i read a fic where the Golden Trio, The Carrows (mainly Flora) and Ginny build an army and they call them selves the wolverines. They use guns and shit and also at one point the dark mark is cut in the skull by a knife

And people were happy about that
