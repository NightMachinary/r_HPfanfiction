Preferably fanfictions consisting of Indpendent Harry and Dumbledore, weasley, and Hermione bashing. Also either Manipulative or Neglectful Dumbles. I'd also like it to have Harry/X romance going on, but it isn't needed. So then requirements are -Must be at least 100k words -Must be completed -No Post-Hogwarts Other than that, run free with it.


** Post some new fics please :D

** I'm honestly just curious. Why do you like fics that bash characters like Hermione, Dumbledore and Weasley bashing? Again, not judging, just curious.

*** Firstly, Hermione seems to be the type of person to ridicule people who are below her, yet get jealous or mad when someone does better. Secondly, Ron is always jealous for some reason or another and only seems go grow up before the final battle. Molly seems to be aware of Harry's situation regarding his relatives and doesn't do much other than feed him, and practically treat him like a child even though he's faced Voldemort more than probably 80% of the order at least. Arthur just seems to be a good man, but a big pushover. Finally, Dumbledore placed Harry either knowing that he wasn't going to get treated well, or thought the best of a family of muggles that Lily probably said hated magic. Furthermore, he continues to place him there, because of blood wards, yet a Fidelis would've been much smarter. Also everyone else just pretty much shrugs off the abuse and neglect like as if it's nothing, while he probably had many problems stemming from that like sight or height loss.

**** I feel like people blow up the flaws of these characters to ridiculous proportions. Hermione is just an insecure, socially unadept person. She wants to help people and makes friends but doesn't know how so she comes across pushy and rude. Ron is also an insecure person because he has 5 older brothers that outshine him. He wants to become his own person and not just 'another Weasley'. He is definitely jealous, but more often embarrassed and saddened by his financial situation. Malfoy definitely doesn't help by antagonizing him every chance he gets. Molly is definitely not 100% aware of Harry's situation. She has an idea, but Harry is a very closed off person. If she knew the extent of the emotional and physical abuse that Harry has dealt with, I'm sure she would've done something. She treats Harry like a child because he is a child. She doesn't want him to lose the little childhood that he has left. And I don't really want to justify Dumbledore because that would take a while and I've typed way too much already, lol. But to summarize, Dumbledore is not omnipotent and is far from perfect.

Anyways, flaws are what make characters interesting. If they were perfect people the story would've been extremely bland. I just don't like how people take the flaws of these characters and warp them into a caricature of who they are.

** linkffn(11446957) I don't know if they really get bashed but I do know that Harry isn't friends with Ron of Hermione. And he's obviously also not friendly with dumbledore since he's a dark wizard.

linkffn(4545504) Has bashing of all three and fits your other criteria quite well.

linkffn(6254783) Has bashing of Ron and Hermione and I don't know if Dumbledore gets bashed but Harry is very much against him so it should be okay.

linkffn(8303194) I just recommend this one so you can see that there are other ways to portray Dumbledore. Still has Ron and Hermione being assholes so you can be happy with that.

I don't know why people hate bashing so much I mean Ron is pretty much in-character in most fics and Hermione has to get away from Harry because you can't have an independent and powerful Harry and then say that Hermione is "The greates Witch of her age".

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
