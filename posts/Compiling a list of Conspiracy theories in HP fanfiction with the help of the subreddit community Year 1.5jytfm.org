** - Ron was bribed to keep most people away from Harry.
- Troll was specifically sent to kill Hermione to keep her from influencing Harry.
- Both Ron and Hermione were picked to keep Harry from wanting to excel in school.
- Third floor trials were designed for the trio to get through as a test or to ease Harry into the adventuring lifestyle.
- The invisibility cloak is charmed so Dumbledore can still track it.

** The Philosophers Stone was given to Dumbledore as a final gift of the Flamels. Think about it - why would the Flamels give their stone away to someone else when they've kept it safe on their own for over 600 years if their intent wasn't to give it away? Dumbledore kept it for about a year because he was fighting his temptation to use it.

- Harry matched with the holly and phoenix wand because of the horcrux scar

- Dumbledore used Legilimency to see what Harry saw in the Mirror of Erised; also that he placed the mirror in that room for it to be found by Harry, and put a Compulsion on Harry (or the Cloak, or the letter that came with the Cloak, I suppose) to go find it

** Here are some of my Dumbledore related conspiracy theories:

- Dumbledore made up the whole prophecy thing, setup Snape on a guilt trip (I find it hard to believe that Dumbledore would interview Trelawney and a well known death eater in a pub on the same day; I find it incredible that Dumbledore didn't know to put privacy wards during such an important event; I find it even harder to believe that Snape was not intentionally interrupted exactly at the right moment), and tricked V into blowing himself up.

- Dumbledore confunded Sirius in suggesting Wormtail as the secret keeper, fully knowing that Wormtail was the spy. He knew Lily would do everything to protect Harry, and might have even suggested the blood protection ritual to her.

- Dumbledore intentionally gave Harry a lousy childhood so he could show up as Harry's savior and guide Harry to self sacrifice.

- Dumbledore knew of Sirius' innocence, but instead let him rot in Azkaban so that he couldn't interfere with Dumbledore's plan for Harry.

- Dumbledore instructed Snape to treat other houses poorly, in order to unify them against Slytherins.

** - Dumbledore arranged for Harry and Quirrelmort to collide in the mirror room to force the prophecy into completion and try to minimize collateral damage;

  - the rooms guarding the stone are designed to generate a ritualised story telling narrative /(imagine that, right?)/, to focus the magic's reality warping properties and make the prophecy more likely to come true;

- Dumbledore edited the prophecy's true statement before releasing it to VD\Potters\Ministry;
- Dumbledore sealed Potters' will to prevent their trusted friends (Sirius, Lupin, Augusta, etc) from gaining guardianship over Harry;
- Dumbledore was rewarding Harry for reckless behaviour (and making his life miserable otherwise) to make him get used to the idea of self-sacrifice;
- Dumbledore arranged for Hagrid be the one to introduce Harry to the wizarding world so that Hagrid will influence him with his biased opinions on Dumbledore, Slytherins, purebloods, wizarding politics, etc;
- (for WBWL stories) Dumbledore knew that Harry was the BWL, and arranged for him to be living with Durslays precisely because of that;
- Dumbledore convinced the Potters to liquidate their ancestral possessions in order to support the war effort, which is why Harry's now poor;

  - Dumbledore decided to get rid of the Potters when they started arguing with him, and stole their money through a secret deal with goblins;

- Dumbledore feared that Harry's stated ability to fight on equal terms with VD meant that Harry was likely to become another dark lord, so he tried to make sure that Harry would die after killing VD;
- +Dumbledore is an OPed idiot who somehow manages to survive on a daily basis+
- Each time something traumatic happened to Harry during his stay with Dursleys, he hurt them back with some accidental magic, and then obliviators showed up to make both him and the Dursleys forget about the incident and be returned to square one;
- Fawkes is a wizard (Merlin, actually) who transfigured themselves into a phoenix and couldn't reverse back to human form;
- Flamels faked their deaths;
- Philosopher's stone has some hidden negative side effect, similar to unicorn's blood (featured in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][/Reverse,/]] to some degree);
- Prophecies in general have probability manipulating and free-will negating properties (e.g. Sacrifices arc, used as a plot device whenever a character or group of characters needs to act OoC);
- Lily was the one who obliterated VD's body;
- Lily was a dark witch, dark lady, ruthless person, evil person, etc;
- Lily and James faked their deaths and were currently happily living somewhere safe and hidden away with all their /other/ children while the prophecy was still in motion.

  Flamels faked their deaths;
#+end_quote

That one makes sense to me, just to get away from Dumbledore's incessant 'the next great adventure' nagging. I mean, 600 years gives you a lot of time to get good at manipulating people, and with Dumbledore basically giving you the button to manipulate him with, it wouldn't be very difficult.

#+begin_quote
  Lily was a dark witch, dark lady, ruthless person, evil person, etc;
#+end_quote

I like this one too; James was an asshole for a while in canon, but Lily was apparently flawless. It adds a nice element or aspect to her character, that Lily could actually be ruthless or have a temper like a dragon. In regards to the dark arts, I don't think Lily was ever noted for being against Snape's pursuit of the darker arts, just against the blood purity bullshit. It's not unthinkable that Lily let the pressure of the war make her turn to darker arts in desperation to keep her family safe.
