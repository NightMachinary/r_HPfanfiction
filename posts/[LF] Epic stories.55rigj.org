I'm looking for high quality, epic length stories. I've been reading hpff for at least 10 years, and I want to see what gems I have missed.

I'm not looking for stories like Harry crow, where everything goes his way, nor am I looking for MOR which is a pile of hippogriff shit with added political posturing.

One of my favorites was the Defiance of the Hero trilogy. I also liked Harry Potter and the fifth element, though it is extremely long. (not a bad thing) I like long

I've read emperor, and my all time favorite, the lie I lived by jbern.

I'm not opposed to star wars crossovers, though I've read many by Darth_Marrs and the like. Katarn was awesome. I'm also not opposed to avengers crossovers, however many were left unfinished.

On that note, I don't really want a great long epic that the author just stopped updating. It makes me sad.

Please send me all your favorite stories, if you are interested I'll link some of my favorites below.


** linkffn(3766574)

But yeah, you should list what you've read of the epics, to minimize useless suggestions.

The official sequel is linkffn(Animagus at War) spans years 5-7 and could be just as long.

** I don't know any of the ones you mentioned (except Crow and MOR), but if you like next-gen, I can definitely recommend the Albus Potter series, which is a 7-part series, basically a mirror of the original HP format but following Harry's son Albus, complete with an overarching plot. IIRC, it starts with linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation)

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts!

Some WIPs are on pace to become epic too:

*Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw*, linkffn(11574569), has lots of tropes, but has done them exceedingly well. It's the first time I start liking 'the Ice Princess of Slytherin' Daphne Greengrass. This fic features a very powerful Harry still facing an uphill battle, which is quite rare among fanfics.

*Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994), already passes 250k words, and I feel the real war hasn't even begun yet.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*Innocent*: Sirius raises Harry from age 7 AU with single point of divergence. First part is almost 500k, and currently the fourth book is a WIP. Iinkffn(9469064)

*A Black Comedy*: Harry follows Sirius through the veil 10 years later. Wacky hijinks occur. Not DH compliant. About 250k. Pretty commonly mentioned here though. linkffn(3401052)

*The Seventh Horcrux*: A Book 7 fic written before DH came out. Over 300k words. linkffn(2818538)

**** By epicness, maybe also linkffn(Circular Reasoning), but it's not finished (though not abandoned AFAIK). By length there are the usual suspects which get linked all the time, so you can just check out previous rec threads.

There's linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) which deserves more recognition, but it's also a WIP. And because I'm shameless, here's a self-plug: Linkffn(Lesser Evils). Planned final length is projected to be about 240k.

******** Once the summer after 4th year hits, the story dramatically drops in quality, and squanders the potential it had.

******** I have to disagree with the other comments here, while the story changes in tone towards the second half, the writing is not actually worse. However, the main character i.e. Harry changes dramatically over the course of the fanfic, which may have put some people off. In the context of the story, the developments are gradual and make sense, so I don't really see the problem there.

Without spoiling anything, the character development is kind of the whole point of the story, and in my opinion done well enough to stand out. In fact, Cadmean Victory was one of the few Harry Potter Fanfics where I was actually somewhat invested in the characters, which made some of the later scenes all the more heartbreaking.

However, my opinion seems to be in the minority here, you will have to read it and decide for yourself, I guess.

********* I just got to chapter 90. At no point did Harry change unexpectedly.

He did some hard things

But he was not inexplicably different

********* I feel like that was kind of the point though. The fic was about how the Portrait influenced Harry's thinking, how people can change in war and how we are influenced by the people around us.

Harry isn't supposed to be the super like-able god-like good guy. It's about the transformation of the kid that was hesitant to kill an enemy in order to save himself into the killer that he later became.

It has been a while since i read the fic so i can't really comment on specifics but i thought it was overall well done and aside from the final fight i enjoyed it.
