Looking for a fic where 9 year old Harry receives memories of future events, all the way to epilogue, only to find out he wasn't the only one.

Everyone else receives them too.

Including the insane misty roaming soul of Voldemort, Quirrell who changes his mind about going travelling and remains muggle professor, Dumbledore does not use the philosophers stone as bait, Sirius slips away to hunt for Pettigrew in the Burrow after contacting Lupin, Snape quite literally confronts Dumbledore with the future memories and they both devise a plan, etc. Quite literally everyone. Characters don't have to react the way as I just described but it'd be fun wouldn't it?

Hilarity/crack is okay since this whole situation sounds surreal


** I dreamed about this once, it was ruddy brilliant. Something like it would probably be a total rehash of cannon or so AU it is unrecognizable. Would definitely require some thought, though, with everyone knowing - especially the deceased Head of the Auroras and the no longer dead, very dangerous people like Mad Eye or Bellatrix who would have a vendetta and know who to avoid. Lucius, though, after everything that happened to him under Riddle, I wouldn't be surprised if, with some amount of madness tinging his perception, he burned the diary himself.

The surviving Death Eaters would probably know that their magnanimous leader wasn't everything he claimed to be, causing dissent; that is if the disembodied wraith ever got his body back. If he did manage to posses someone or some such, it would probably be a mad dash for the horcuxes - since Tom probably knows they know.

Then you have an entire generation of children who are much older than they appear, which would cause so much trouble with the schooling system. There would be 7-10 year old magical children who have already finished their entire education, who have aged a decade in a moment. Depending when he ended back up at, you might have people like Pandora Lovegood who never die. That alone is enough to substantiate some AU stories.

tl;dr - It would be so much to think about but almost certainly amazing.

** Voldemort would be so fucked in this scenario. He starts with an incredibly weak foothold.

*** Oh, yes. Just Imagine what Malfoy will do with his future memories of being humiliated, tortured and his son being set up to die for Voldemort. Or Fudge. Or Crouch Sr.

** Lets take the assumption that literally everyone travels back in time. Here is a list of events what I think that would happen.

1. Harry goes back in time, doing a ritual but something goes wrong sending everyone back in time.
2. Rita skeeter publishes an article with information she is unaware everyone else knows. (Sirius is innocent, Crouch escaped, Dumbledore's past).
3. The government is already in chaos with everyone knowing what has happened.
4. Pettigrew is caught by the weasleys and Sirius gets free. He goes out to find Harry.
5. Two days after the time-travel, harry sees Sirius and is perplexed that he is free. He quickly discovers what is going on.
6. I have no idea what will happen with education, etc but I guess we will see worldwide changes in laws. This is not only in the wizarding world but also in the muggle world as literally everyone traveled back in time.

If this is written, I guess it is best to start with scene 1 and 5 and do the rest in flashbacks.

If you want to write a less crack-fic story, I would advice having only key-players have knowledge from the future and have a rule that you can't tell others you traveled back in time. Finally, balance the time travel between the good and bad side. This would add more suspense and would create a more engaging story. After all, you never know who traveled back in time.
