I know everyone hates these fanfics but I like reading them every now and then. As long as it doesn't get too convoluted, I can enjoy it.

Please no harems, I hate them. Slash is ok but not preferred.

Thanks


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and The Return of The Heritage;Harry Potter and the Peverell Legacy;Harry Potter and The Riders of the Apocalypse).

The first two are well written Lord Potter-Black fics if I do say so myself. The last one is a Gary-Stu version with lots of actions scenes. The author is in a break from posting though. The author said that they/he/she will be back in november/end of november, but with the rate that they/he/she was pumping out chapters, I think the author suffered from burnout. Let's hope that by next year that the author comes back with a fresh start.
