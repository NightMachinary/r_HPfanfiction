A librarian created a virtual HP Escape Room in Google Forms a few weeks ago that got quite a bit of press [[https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/04/03/librarian-creates-virtual-harry-potter-escape-room/][coverage]] over the last few weeks.

The escape room they created is a fun quick distraction, but surprisingly didn't feel very Harry Potter-y to me (you literally go to Alcatraz, not Azkaban, at one point), so it inspired me to dive a little deeper and create a slightly more...in-depth... choose your own adventure game.

Hoping this can serve as a nice little 1-30 minute (depending on what choices you make) quarantine distraction. Designed for kids and adult fans as well ;-)

** Ok, so I got to the point where the first one explodes, then I choose the second one and it sends me to an unrelated ending? What was that all about?

*** Oh no! That's a mistake. Was the first wand the first one you selected?

**** Happened to me too. Picked the first wand, it exploded. Picked the second wand, was sent to the ending where you went down the stairs, went to sleep, led a boring life and died of old age.

**** After I got to Luna's I relieved my life, previously I Apperently chose the proper wand the first time the second time I chose the oak wand, the when I selected the second wand I ended up back home after an uneventful day. Hope this helps you.

***** Choosing the second wand without choosing the oak first does not make the mistake.

*** Ahh! What part stopped? The current ending is when you raise your wand to say a spell. Did it end then?

** I went to Weasley's Wizarding whizbees, stuck my wand in an explosive, and woke up in the hogwarts infirmary, presumably. The page that came up after ‚Äústay in bed and wait for them‚Äù had something like Poffery instead of Pomfrey?

** If you pick the third wand immediately, it'll start to refer to it as 'the unbroken one' for no apparent reason. I'm guessing the other two can explode? lol

** Okay, so it's amazing, even if a bit too railroady for my tastes, at least at the beginning.

Seriously, I must've gotten all the "bad" ends by trying to act as if it happened to me in real life.
