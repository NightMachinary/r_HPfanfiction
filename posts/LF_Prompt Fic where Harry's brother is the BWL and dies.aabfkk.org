I'm looking for a fic where Harry is miss treated/ ignored and is sent away. At some point before Hogwarts the fake BWL dies causing everyone to realise harry is the real saviour. This causes his parents to try to get him back and he is having none of it.


** linkffn(7053661) starts with the death of the supposed BWL, before the focus turns to Harry, so it may hit some of the notes you're looking for. It doesn't quite go where you expect, however.

  For years, the world has hailed Arnold Potter as the Boy-Who-Lived. For years Arnold was said to be the one who will throw down Voldemort. But now Arnold is dead, and the world turns its attentions to Harry. Mostly H/Hr/L. Finished.
