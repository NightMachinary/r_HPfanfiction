Preferably one where the characters who betray them actually feel sorry and aren't retards that think they're still in the right.

  Looking for a Harry that has been betrayed by almost everyone as for pairing any pairing possible but no slash and no Harry/Gryffindor

  I have a thing for betrayed Harry, through the Goblet of Fire, Azkaban, etc. It's suprisingly difficult to find fics where Harry is COMPLETELY alone. Authors tend to feel the need to shoehorn Neville or the Twins in.

  Romance because of this isolation is welcome, but not mandatory.

In these threads this is discussed as well, you can look there for some inspiration :)

  What if Harry refused to fight and die for a society that he couldn't claim as his? A one-shot of Harry deciding it's too late for the Wizarding world to make amends.
