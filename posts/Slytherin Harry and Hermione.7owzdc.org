** linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectere) is a great read -- it centers around Harry and Hermione, but Snape also has some amazing moments. ffnbot!refresh

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy. However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

** It's very Hermione-centric and, in my opinion, is a great read. linkao3 (The Anti-Heroine) I think there's a few others that meet your criteria but I can't think of any others right now.

*** Just how does Tom Riddle fit in that relationship? Because a sixteen-year-old Dark Lord buggering Harry is not the kind of fic I want to read.

**** Sadly, later on in the story, Tom Riddle and Harry do have sexual relations. I don't really like the relationship myself, so I skip over the smut and the plot, thankfully, doesn't suffer for it.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU
