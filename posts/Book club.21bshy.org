It's been tried a couple times in the past but never lasted. Would people be interested in an official monthly book club?


** Is this reading a novel-length piece of fanfiction each month, or is it stuff that's of interest for people here?

** Sure, I'm game. Can't promise that I'll finish the fanfic if I don't like it (I'm the picky sort), but I need to break out of my tiny circle.

*** I'm thinking of picking a different theme each month (genres, pairings, generation, etc.) each month to try to cover a wide range of interests even if each month's pick doesn't appeal to everyone.

** How would it be structured? Would there be some kind of voting process for recommendations?

I'm pretty game either way.

** A suggestion that may improve longevity of the project:

With whatever story you pick it may be best to try to find an active author and reach out to them. I know that if I received a message of 'hey we're discussing ______ on reddit around ______ I'd probably check it out.

As a whole we're mostly interested in what people say about our stuff. So something like that could help spur discussion and keep things around longer.
