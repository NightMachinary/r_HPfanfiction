In canon, Harry buys Snape's memories without even questioning them or their contents. And at least to me, it seems like a cheap set-up, cherrypick certain memories he wants Harry to have, leave that pensive out in the open, and no mention of any misdeed beyond a racial slur (and conspiracy to commit murder, but that one is completely ignored because he feels bad that Lily is targeted).

So are there any stories where Harry does not immediatly lose his wits after coming out of the Pensive? Where he thinks something like "well, if he was anything like his present self back then, he had it coming"? Or thinks about the Shady friends mentioned by Lily. Or questions Snape's mental capacity after learning about the werewolf incident?


** I'm no Snape apologist either (stuff he did and stuff he let happen were inexcusable) but Harry never actually relays what he thinks about Snape immediately after. Snape had to tell Harry what to do next, he wasn't looking for sympathy. He didn't like Harry at all, he just wanted Voldemort dead. That's what Snape's story is to me; not a redemption arc, but a twisted revenge scheme. He must have HATED Voldemort for killing Lily, and that hatred (coupled with the time he had to spend pretending to love Voldemort) consumed him and made him an awful human being. Anyway, the point is that Harry didn't name his son after Snape the day he saw those memories, it was 7 years after the fact. You gotta assume some internal struggle ensued. A fanfic of that? I would pay for that.

Harry went to a mindhealer, as surely they are therapists for magical people...

Mindhealer told harry he didn't have any problems, or simply noticed some legimency-lesson-caused damage healed that and sent Harry back with a clean bill of health. (Therapy? what that muggle mumbo jumbo... just like stitches)

** I don't have any recommendations, but I just want to point out something to Snape-apologists:

1. Mulciber is known for using the Imperius Curse.
2. Mulciber attacked Mary McDonald. Three guesses what he did.
3. Snape laughed off rape, or at least an attempt at rape. Says a lot about his character.
4. All of this occurred before James and Sirius hung Snape upside down and washed out his mouth for using racial slurs. I'm not excusing potential sexual harassment but I can understand their desire for revenge.

**** - Igor Karkaroff specifically namedrops Mulciber as one of the Death Eaters who specialized in using the Imperius Curse. This betrayal goes nowhere as Mulciber is already in Azkaban--which Karkaroff was not aware of.
- In /The Prince's Tale,/ we see a memory where Lily snaps at Snape that while Potter and his friends are arrogant bullies, they don't use Dark Magic, while some of Snape's friends do. Mulciber is specifically described as "evil" and did "something" but it's not specified what to Mary Macdonald.
- It's never actually specified what Mulciber did to Mary--but whatever it was, it was enough to significantly fray Lily's friendship with Snape, though Mary was still attending classes afterwards. Snape does try to describe it as just a laugh, but Lily doesn't buy it. Whatever it was, we can reasonably assume it was far crueler than anything James and Sirius, or Fred and George, would do.

I hate Snape as much as the next person, but you're jumping straight to the Imperius curse and rape here. It could be any Dark magic, probably one that Albus forgiveandforget Dumbledore condoned. That memory seemed like it was from fourth year, and I don't think fourth years have the magical power to cast the Imperius curse - it could be a lower level of the Imperius curse (like compulsion), for instance. Or just using run-of-the-mill Dark curses, like practice for Sectumsempra (in its creation), or similar ones that inflict bodily harm.

Granted, Albus will condone pretty much anything (since none of it is actually aimed at him), but if rumours (Lily knows about the incident, which means others could too) about students using the Imperius curse and getting away without expulsion and imprisonment get back to parents, Albus would be booted from his posts.

Technically not true - the school was about to close, but at the last moment, the "culprit" was caught by Tom Riddle. We only know that Hagrid was expelled, since it was framed in a way that that petrifications and the death were purely accidental, but maybe there was more to his punishment - maybe he did serve time in Azkaban for it, since he seemed so frightened of the idea in CoS.

They publicly state that Harry's story is false, and yet there is no investigation into what /did/ happen (as presumably Harry would have been interviewed by an Auror or something if there was), and it should have been clear from the body that nothing in the maze killed him. So in that case it does seem like a student died on Hogwarts grounds (ish) and the Ministry just shrugged it off as an accident.

**** Your comments have several downvotes so an upvote won't really be shown, but I agree with you at least. Bit weird how people interpret Snape's Worst Memory scene with James and Sirius approaching Snape literally because they're bored and turn it into them attacking him to avenge an imaginary rape. Then they declare anybody who says that isn't what happened a 'Snape apologist.'

The Snape/James dynamic was obviously more than that single memory with I'm sure Snape causing his fair share of trouble, but Snape was literally minding his own business reviewing his exam that scene. No reason for James and Sirius to approach him.

Also a bit of a stretch to assume a 4th/5th year student can successfully pull off an unforgivable. Fake Moody doubts that the entire class combined can give him a nosebleed if they used Avada Kedavra and that's them in 4th year. Harry struggles to use the Cruciatus in 5th year, so I doubt the Imperius is any easier than those two.

Snape was also a very proud person and would absolutely loathe being seen as a victim, so that definitely wasn't his intent with the memories like OP says.

And even then it still had an affect on Bellatrix. On the other hand, Imperius seems canonically to be the easiest of the three Unforgivables, since Harry pulls it off successfully in Deathly Hallows on an innocent goblin on his first time even using it.

Crouch Jr says that it takes a powerful bit of magic to cast the killing curse, and since all three curses are labelled unforgibable and unblockable, I'd say that they're about equal in terms of magical power required.

But when we see HP struggle to cast the Cruciatus in fifth year, but see Crabbe do the killer when he's 17/18, we sort of get the image that there is some sort of increase in magical power between the ages of 15 and 17/18. This increase is considerable, since even though Crabbe is one of the worst students in the school, he still does better than a 15 year old Harry does.

I think the other fellow's impression was that 4th or 5th years would not be able to cast the Unforgivables because of lack of magical power, purely due to age. That does not mean that they weren't using other dark magic similar to the Imperius, however.

(1) to get harry to understand that he is on his side (including the how and the why. so that (2) he can relay Harry what he needs to do next and be trusted.

He wasn't necessarily trying to get Harry to like him, somehow this cult of snape has grown out of that scene, but i don't think snape expected Harry to feel sorry for him.

*** This. I do not understand how anyone can frame the werewolf "incident" as attempted murder. High key stupidity with a cruel streak, but not murder. Not even manslaughter.

The only way, the /only/ way that scene makes sense is if Sirius laid the rope and Severus put the noose around his neck. Sirius dropped the clues, knowing full well Severus was sniffing around and would follow them. He's not blameless, but that reads as though he was trying to scare him. And the the result was significant enough that James felt the need to intervene.

But, to imagine it as having occurred any other way, that somehow Sirius straight up told him to approach the Shack on a full moon (or, shoved him down the tunnel/Imperiused him/drugged him, or whatever else madness Snape apologists use) is totally OOC for all involved: Snape is too smart and too wary of the Marauders to meet Sirius /after dark by himself/ and Sirius cares too much about his friends to use Remus like a murder weapon. His actions seem to have resulted in that possibility, but I think it was from an idiotic failure to predict consequences, and not an intent to fuck Lupin over.

** I don't know of any stories like this. But, I can't think how it would change the plot. He still hates Snape after that episode.

I'm sure Snape's memories were totally biased - all memories are. I think it just showed his perspective, his regrets and motivations. Whether they redeem him always seemed a bit irrelevant to me. But, to cast him as completely and totally bad certainly makes for a more boring story. And, to cast James/Sirius as totally good and just is equally boring,

EDIT: I misread OP. Thought he was referring to 5th year incident, not 7th year.

***** That is true. But do you really think it is likely that Snape put a specific memory in here and then left the room knowing Harry would go into it, and then pretend to be upset when he gets back?

****** Hah, definitely not. Which is why I probably should have known that wasn't what OP was referring to. Though it seems unlikely he'd have the control to cherry pick his memories with his dying breath too, now that we're talking about it.

Don't you know? Severus Snape bravely died protecting his one true love from the Dark Lord at Halloween. Thanks to his brave acts Harry got to live with his mother and not be an orphan. What a bro!

He sacrificed himself and to this day his magical love-protection dwells in Lily Potter, the woman who lived.

*** He couldn't buy into being a Horcrux, Harry doesn't do the suicide walk, Voldemort gets another out of body experience, all Death Eaters are executed due to the threat of another war, we are therefore spared CC.

Or Harry could get a harem for all we know. The butterfly effect is a bitch.

*** One thing that never made sense to me when it comes to Snape's memories is why he shows Lily's confrontation with him about the Mary incident.

It is in his best interest to depict himself as a good person to Harry -- whether for shelfish reasons, or simply to convince him to take the memories seriously. Showing the memory about Mary doesn't serve either purpose. Unless it happens to serve a narrative purpose as showing the turning point where his friendship with Lily starts to fall apart, but this is unclear with the limited selection of memories shown.

I read this ages ago, but I remember that it had some hardcore Snape bashing. You've probably already read it though.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
