If you think of all the Harry Potter AUs where someone gets send back in time to their younger self to make the future right they make alot of the same connections they did in the past. But can you imagine how lonely that is?

You go back in time and you see your best friend but they are missing years of bonding even if you are still friends its a very different relationship than you had in the time you were sent back from.

You are constantly waiting for that intimacy to return instead of just being friends. It would still be lonely having no connections and having to start over but at least you can enjoy the new connections. You aren't just waiting for a relationship to come back to what you remember it being in your own time.


** Yeah, your best friend not having the memories of your friendship that you do would indeed be lonely.

But he's not going to get that friendship back with Ron or Hermione by getting himself sorted into another house and making friends with other people is he? Ron and Hermione are Harry's family. They're the first people who ever loved and cared for him (that he remembers anyway) and there's no way on earth he wouldn't let the friendship play out again.

"I really miss Ron, as he was at 20, and all the history we have. Oh well, fuck this, better go and make friends with Malfoy" makes absolutely no sense as his thought process. Of course he's sticking with Ron - even if Ron doesn't realise yet what Harry means to him (Ron), Harry damn well understands what Ron means to him (Harry)...

*** Well my point more he not going to get that friendship back at all. He not the same person he used to be. The person Ron became friends with isn't the friend he is now. They could still be friends again now but it not going to be the same. And that friendship will seem hollow because the Ron he cares so much about isn't here now. That Ron he is friends with came with years of development this Ron doesn't have yet. Like if you have a best friend and you've been friends for years you know that best friend was very different when you first met. And you probably get along way better with the person your friend is now than who they used to be. To the point they may actually feel like a different person all together

**** I understood your point.

But if he's going to live that time again, why wouldnt he want the friendship he had? As Ron grows and they share experiences again, the friendship will deepen. Like happened before. Harry and Ron weren't the ride or die mates they become in the beginning of the canon timeline. All friendships take time to build, and yes it may be frustrating for him as it takes that time but ultimately Ron is still the same person aged 11 in timeline B as he was in timeline A, so the potential for the same friendship is there. Plus, as I said, Ron and Hermione are more than just his friends. They're his family, the only family he has. Why on earth would he give up the opportunity to have that again to go and play nice with someone he hated (Malfoy) or someone he barely knows (the Hufflepuffs)? Any friendship is hollow at first, intimate relationships take time and work. Why would he put that time and work in with someone who he doesn't even know he will like long term when the two people who mean the universe to him are there and available for friendship?!

He knows Ron and Hermione. They don't know him at this stage, but he understands what the potential for a lifelong friendship is with them, because he's lived it before. They're so important to him I just can't see him not trying.

***** Well basically my point is it's far more painful to try and constantly miss what you once had. Have constant reminders of things you remember about them that aren't true anymore. Feel guilty about secrets that you know but they chosen haven't disclosed yet. And keep waiting instead of living. You can't function like that the new relationships are necessary.

The new relationships don't come with pain they are an escape you don't long for what once was with them and can enjoy them in the moment. And because of that they may end up becoming closer relationships. Because you are just having a relationship. Not trying to recreate one .

Course I'm kinda hand waving the whole you aren't 11 on the inside and they are and it may be difficult to have a friendship on equal terms cuz of that with anyone.

****** I do see that, but why take a chance on an unknown instead of the people you know will support you?

Plus I feel as much as he would be comparing "new Ron" to "his Ron" to an extent, it's still the same person really - he's just yet to have the experiences. Ron in 1991 in timeline B is the same person as Ron in 1991 in timeline A was. And tbh, I don't think even avoiding "new Ron" would make Harry miss "his Ron" any less, and like Ron and Hermione are so important to him that I think he would rather have some version of them than none. Going off and making friends with Ernie McMillan or Draco Malfoy isn't going to make him miss "timeline A Ron and Hermione" any less, and even without the experiences shared in his "first life," Ron and Hermione (Ron especially) were from the beginning "Harry's kind of people." He liked them for who they were from the start, and the adventures they shared only /deepens/ that. So logic states go with the people you know you like, and know that the experience will happen again because you know who they are and that you can rely on them, and eventually the deep friendships will come. Because all the ingredients are there, he just needs to bake the cake. With other people, he doesn't even know the ingredients are right, if that makes sense?

From Harry's perspective, if you know you've got to maybe do all the dangerous shit over and over again, who do you want by your side? The guy who proved over and over again last time that he's prepared to go and face down a basilisk with you, or someone who you don't know if they'll abandon you at the first sign of danger? Harry has pretty serious trust issues, it's logical to assume that he would go with the people he has concrete proof he can rely on.

******* He will miss his Ron always for sure but seeing Ron and its still so cold for him. Its so lacking in everything they had. He can't even have the relationship back even when the person is still there. And you don't really not yet. They aren't there yet you can't share with them the way you used to yet. You can tell your friends everything after knowing them for years. But he doesn't know them for that long yet. To them he's still the kid they just met.

So avoiding Ron won't make him miss his Ron less. But I genuinely think being around Ron will make him miss his Ron more. The ones who this might be less true for are friends he wasn't as close to in his own timeline. If he was only ever say casual friends with Neville them its not going to be painful being friends with him. Sirius and Remus he spent limited time with before they died so while he cared and missed them they weren't as close as Ron and Hermione. There is no bittersweet pain that there is with Ron and Hermiome.

******** That's the point though - it's bittersweet. And that makes it worth it.

There's no way on earth that if I went back in time I wouldn't engineer things so I still meet my best friends and my husband! Just no way. Yes at the start they wouldn't be the people I know today and those relationships would still need to deepen. But I /know/ that these people are "my people," so why would I swap them for an unknown when it's going to be difficult either way?

Ron and Hermione aren't just special to Harry because of what they went through, they're special to him for who they are. And unless it's an AU where Ron and Hermione are drastically different, I just can't see him not wanting to at least try. He loves them for who they are, not what they've done.

********* Well there's that too the part the engineering the fact that you can orchestrate with knowledge they don't have recreate them to the person you befriended is that ok? Ya maybe they'd want the same thing maybe they even told you but they aren't there anymore you have all this knowledge power craving for a thing that no longer exists and the person in front of you has none of that. They aren't your people not right now and when they become it this time around you are guiding them. They aren't choosing to become your people anymore. Can you have that relationship again when these are the circumstances?

And thats still not discounting the years you are left still waiting and not living not enjoying the relationship. Because you aren't trying to create something together anymore. You alone are trying to recreate something that once was and can never clue them in.

********** These are all good points, but I guess with some people - and Harry and Ron are an example - you click with them immediately. Because yeah, they're not "your person" with the shared experiences yet, but they are a person who is very compatible with you, and with an eventual range of shared experiences (even if not the identical ones to the first time) has a /known potential/ to become a person you'll love deeply. You'd have to do some separation in your head, certainly. Harry would have to think "ok this isn't my Ron, but it's Ron as he was the day I first became friends with him, and there was a lot that Ron and I clicked over even before we started having mad adventures." But I deffo think he'd take "probably Ron" over "stranger like Justin or Ernie" or "known arsehole like Draco."

Plus I think what annoys me about fic where Harry goes back and befriends someone else, it's never for the reasons you've stated here. It's not because it's too hard and sad. It's 99% of the time because the author decided to bash Ron and Hermione and have Harry going back because he "realises" Ron was "using him" and he "should have taken Draco's hand." It's rarely an emotional exploration of what friendship means and is anything ever the same in differing circumstances, it's just a bash fest. A fic about this from your perspective though could be interesting, even though I do think Harry would always choose Ron in every possible universe and situation!

*********** Oh ya my point wasn't that Ron would be a bad friend for a older Harry or others would be better inherently.

Just that time travel fics kinda glosses over the impact it has on relationships and you can just dive right back a friendship you had from 10 years ago like you are that age and don't have a life time of experiences that would impact how you feel about loosing so much meaningful connection. Things would be way more complicated trying to recreate the more familiar relationships basically. It might not always be healthy or good to try because you can't be equal in them anymore even if this was like older characters.

** I think that instead of trying to regain what was lost, time traveler should be the big sibling of the relationship. You know their potential, and you know they can be great friends. But it is important to disconect who was to who is.

In a fic having them stumble on those thoughs would be natural, but also accepting that it can not be because he and his friends changed, the dinamic needs to do so too.

** I totally agree!!!

Ive seen a few fics where Harry goes back to repeat his life and makes friends with Hermione and Ron and its all happy and they go one their merry way. But I find that unrealistic.

Harry is old. He's survived a War and the death of friends and family. And Ron and Hermione are two children who are so far removed from the future that its not even funny.

Hermione is still bossy and insecure and stuck up.

Ron is still lazy and annoying and a bit selfish and jealous.

I honestly dont think that Harry, however old he is in the fic, could make friends with either of them and not constantly feel the loss or frustration that these two blank-state eleven year olds would bring.

In the same vein, I honestly cant see Harry going back to Gryffindor. Hufflepuff maybe for his sacrificing side, Slytherin maybe for his ambition (redo everything right, saving lives, stopping the war), Even Ravenclaw for his sarcasm and wit and out-of-the-box thinking.

But not Gryffindor. Not only do I see Harry getting less and less Gryffindor as the books go on, but I also would think it too painful. An personally? While brave, or chivalrous, or determined; i think Harry would like a new start or fit somewhere else better.

*** I mean being say like 20 something and having to only be friends with 11 year olds would be hell imo even if they were 11 year olds in a different house. I mean you could try to be friends with adults but to them you are still 11 they won't treat you like a equal. But handwaving that ya absolutely i think alot of people would be in different houses if you sorted them later in life again. Personally I think Harry might end up more Hufflepuff. Valuing Fairness and loyalty.

**** I agree!!!

I just assume that he needs /some/ friends even if they are immature 11 year olds. I thought befriending someone he barely talked to in his first life might make that less painful then sharing a space with a Ron and Hermione who would never turn out to be the same ones who would have died for him.

Yes Id definitely agree with Harry being placed in hufflepuff!!!

**** Not having the same relationship doesn't mean he wouldn't want to stay close to them. And also, keep in mind that everyone is a kid at Hogwarts, who is he going to be friends with? Why doed Susan Bones, Draco Malfoy or Daphne Green grass suddenly make more sense as friends? They're also eleven.

I think an old Harry would try to stay close to those he loves. Enjoy Quidditch talks and chess with younger Ron and similar age-neutral conversation. In other places he'll just roll his eyes internally and pretend to be 11 year old (if he's aiming to not being discovered) and be done with it. Those people are important to him. And he is all about stoic self sacrifice. He can endure some childish or boring conversations.

***** I think he'd still care about them but im saying that relationship is bittersweet now maybe even painful. They are right there but you can't have the intimacy anymore. Ron is right there and he's familiar but its not his Ron. Its like he suddenly got amnesia and forgot years of your friendship. And being around him can make you remember what once was and you are just stuck waiting for it to come back. And it might never come back. Because Harry isn't the same person he was at 11 either the connection he forms will be different and he's still left mourning the loss of his friendship even though he has it. If those kind of relationships are his only ones that's very lonely. You need others and those others may feel better because they aren't bittersweet.

I'm assuming this is a situation he has to grow up again like most of these fics are not just fix a event. If it's fix a event its different. But if its grow up again he needs to do more than just fix the event. He has to actually live this life . You can't just wait for years for life to start again you have to live it in the meantime too.

****** It does require character work on Harry and there would be longing sure. But I still don't see him preferring to spend time with other eleven year olds rather than his old friends.

Guess Harry won't have the connection he is looking for here until he meets Lupin again. Because Mentor Snape is totally bonkers

******* pretty much Lupin would be easier i think because ya they were close but not as close as say Ron or Hermione. He can actually get closer to him and that might feel less lonely. Plus likr he died i imagine this as a older Harry going back so he's had way more years with Ron and Hermione than he got with Lupin and Sirius.

** I don't mind a timeline jumping Harry having the same friends at the beginning it's one of the ways a writer could show how the now AU Harry Potter world changed. Have Harry befriend Hermione earlier with Ron. Because of that Harry and co don't fight the troll. Does the troll attack another group of students or staff? How would Harry, Ron and Hermione friendship or personality change without the troll incident? Hermione wasn't saved by either of them and Ron didn't get his first nudge into maybe thinking before speaking.(Ron could have felt sorry for almost getting Hermione killed in otl) Would Harry want to put this Hermione and Ron in danger over the stone? Would be forgo the bonding search to go alone or take his friends with him. Should Harry try to have Voldemort kill him now to remove the Horacrux (assuming he destroyed the others) killing Voldemort year 1 still leaves the free death eaters as bad guys.

** Well you can try the story HP: Dolen Amser by Jonn Wolfe. It's a Harry/Tonks story where via spell interaction Harry ends up going back in time to his first year but the original Harry is still there. So this older Harry is not allowed (swears on his Magic) to change the time line because of dangers of creating a paradox. Of course, that is easier said then done.

Being older he doesn't really build that relationship with Hermione, Ron, Neville etc.
