** Not really, because [X] reads/watches [Y] fics are almost always bad.

linkao3(A Dramatic Reading by White_Squirrel) is the only decent one I've ever seen, and even it had a major drop in quality in its sequel.

  One shot. AU by both means and intentions. Featuring Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco. Special appearance by Severus Snape. It's too serious to be a parody.

*** Is it the only one that actually had the good sense to do minimal quotations?

I mean, you could do an entire "Reads The Book" of Stone and not quote any of Rowling's words besides names and maybe "Mimblewimble" and "Or worse, expelled!" and could still be a fine "reads the book" story.

**** Yeah, that one doesn't include many quotations. But more importantly, I think, is the fact that it actually has a plot happening outside of the books, and that plot is actually serviced by the reading of the books.

The sequel loses that connection between the books and any external plot, and it suffers for it.

*** To be fair, he didn't write the sequel, so the drop in quality makes sense. Great author though, sad he's winding down his writing.

**** Ahh, I didn't realize (or I just forgot, since it's been months since I read the fic) that he didn't write the sequel. I know that it has a second author listed, but I thought it was more of a two-people-writing-together sort of thing, or at least a "here is my outline, go fill in the details" arrangement. But if the original author is basically just a consultant on the sequel, it does make sense for it to be completely different.

***** Yeah, I think that sequel in particular was just a free-for-all, he basically just handed off the rights to someone and was like "have fun." Hogwarts Houses Divided had a similar situation with its sequel.

I think what he's doing now is finalizing his outlines and having people write them up a la James Patterson, as I don't think he has much time on his hands. But the plot elements for his stuff are probably all coming straight from him.

  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.
