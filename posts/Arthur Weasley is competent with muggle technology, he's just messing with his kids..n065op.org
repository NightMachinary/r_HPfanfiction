It started off as a minor thing, when one day a young, 6 year old Bill asked what a 'fellytone' was and amused Arthur made a choice that would define his childrens lives, 'how far can I take this?'. The "function of a rubber duck" scene? that was him checking to see if Hermione or Harry would call his bluff.

I mean, come on, the twins must have got it from somewhere


** My dad called a phone a fellytone for years. We'd park in the par cark, etc.

** The function of a rubber duck is that you explain algorithms to them, and then receive divine inspiration about why your algorithm isn't working. If runes work like they do in a lot of fics, then runecrafters would benefit from rubber ducks just as much as programmers do.

"Ah, well, you've heard about those? It's a ... toy. Just a toy."

"Some even have /batteries/, I think?"

"Yeees. Well, you see, it's an (whisper) /adult/ toy."

"Adult? How so?"

The kitchen gradually goes quiet as Harry visibly fidgets.

"Well, adults need to relax and have fun too, you know. So, weather's been nice lately..."

"But I don't understand, how am I supposed to play with a rubber duck?"

"Errr, it's mostly females. Could you please pass the..."

"But, but, how would a female play with this that a male wouldn't?"

The kitchen is silent. Nobody says a word, while eggs are dying a smoking death in the frying pan.

"Ah, heh, sometimes, when the husband ... errr ... and the wife still has ... unreleased tensions ... then the rubber duck relaxes tense muscles ... you're a married man, I'm sure I don't have to explain..."

"/Arthur!/ Perhaps..."

"But /children/ play with these!"

"Well, yeees..."

Mrs. Weasley faints while Mr. Weasley looks horrified.

Later Harry is cornered by Fred and George.

"Is that really true, that bit about rubber ducks? Mum's fainted three times now, and Dad hasn't said a word since breakfast. Ginny's been really weird, too. So, is that really true?"

"Don't be daft. I'd have thought you two would have realized."

"We've been pranked? Damn."

"Though there /are/ adult versions that looks /exactly/ like the regular ones, but they're really expensive and sold only in specialty stores."

"Damn. We've been double pranked. So, where are these "specialty stores"? Asking for a friend, of course."

"Of course you are. Wait, you have friends?"

**** Eh.. I think it makes some sort of sense in canon.

You grow up in the wizarding world... there's literally a spell for everything. Magic just obliterates the mundane in terms of usefulness.

Toasting bread? There's a spell for that. Cleaning clothes? There's a spell for that. Tidying up? There's a spell for that.

Arthur's fascination with muggle tech and lack of knowledge about it also acts as a stand-in for wizarding culture in general. Wizards don't view muggles as fellow humans, they view them with an Attenborough-esque fascination or a Hitler-esque disdain; something to be studied or exterminated.

Arthur asking about rubber ducks? Sure, paint that as fatherly banter, or do whatever to his character, it's fan fiction, that's the whole point, but I think his curiosity and lack of knowledge is a legitimate portrayal in canon.

I remember one scene I read who knows where that had Harry asking Arthur something, and Arthur revealing to him and Percy that he used "magesight" in his job (finding cursed or hexed muggle artifacts being part of what he does) and Percy being really impressed because it took so much skill and dedication to learn to use.

Have no clue what that was from though, which really sucks.

** Maybe it sounds like I'm jumping on the bandwagon, but I always sort of assumed this was canon. Arthur is basically the walking embodiment of the goofy dad sterotype. You can also clearly see that there are traits from the Prewett side of the family and traits from the Weasley side present in all of the Weasley children, but the making jokes and having people on thing doesn't visibly belong to either. I'm not suggesting that a sense of humor is genetic, but the twins obviously didn't learn it from Molly or Aunt Muriel.

Arthur, Bill, and Charlie are the only real sources it could have come from. And Arthur is upstream of Bill and Charlie.

Seeing how actually competent witches and wizards like McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Shacklebolt seem to be fully aware of how to dress and pass themselves off as muggles (though I imagine Dumbledore insists on wild colors just because he knows no one can stop him), I have difficulty imagining the Department Head of the division of the Ministry that deals with muggles is actually that stupid.

A certain amount of the obliviousness is real, probably, because Harry Potter runs on Monty Python logic, and that's canon. I'm entirely willing to believe Arthur does not understand electricity, just to give one example. But I'm pretty sure at least a portion of it is exaggerated. He's just doing it to have people on.
