:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello,

Looking for a specific fic. It has been recommended here before, but I can't find it for the life of me. James and Lily set up a protective spell that transports Harry to Sirius the night he is abandoned at the Dursleys. No one realises this until his Hogwarts letter is written.

During his encounter with Voldemort in first year, Harry is told he has an Aura of Rationality.

It's not Through the monsoon, which is a similar fic.

Thanks


** That is [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1057502][The Quiet Ones]] series. The first book is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15068012][The Child of Azkaban]].

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

*** The first chapter was crazy!! I can't wait for flashbacks to show why the death eaters were acting that way.
