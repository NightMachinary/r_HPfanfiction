I remember reading this last year, but the name has slipped out of my head. It's a relatively long story, with Snape needing to have intercourse with a muggle so he can keep low when he's with death eaters. So, Hermione is chosen and she has to have intercourse with Snape once a month. She also has to learn how to shapeshift. It is kind of like "The Love You Take" but not the same? Any idea what it could be?
