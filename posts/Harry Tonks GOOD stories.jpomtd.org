Most Harry/Tonks stories I have read till now are usually the same story: Harry is depressed after Sirius' death, Tonks turns up at his house, he bangs on about how Dumbledore is manipulating him, they go to Grimmauld Place for a confrontation, some of the Order sides with Harry, they decide they are in love and find out Harry was left a lot of money and is the Heir of Merlin and the founders and is really rich, and he is really powerful, and blah blah blah.

So I could find very few stories that actually showed the development of a relationship between Harry and Tonks and the pairing doesn't jump out of anywhere like it did with Harry/Ginny. And many of them are incomplete as well. So please send some stories that show the development of a relationship and are COMPLETED. A younger Tonks or older Harry is ok.

  Tonks thought that things would be good after the war, she had her son and her husband. But her husband had issues, issues she thought he had dealt with but had only brushed under the carpet. When it all falls apart, will Harry be there to support not only his Godson, but his mother as well. Harry/Tonks one-shot

**** This really was a breath of fresh air. Such a simple yet different way to tackle HONKS pairing. Really enjoyed the way the story progressed. it seemed realistic and the motivations behind the actions of the characters really rung true for me.

I also agree with the authors take on Remus as he never approached harry in his third year which I never understood.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

Another one I enjoyed was Teddy's Excellent Adventure. Teddy goes back in time and proceeds to matchmake for his adopted father and his mother. linkffn(13021745)

I'm also following a current one Family Matters linkffn(13651842). Jury still out on this one, but it has potential (Tonks misses the final battle, and they find solace in each other in the aftermath)

** Jacobapples has a great H/Tonks story, where after the war Fawkes forcibly time-travels Harry, Andromeda and Teddy to Harry's fifth year (incidentally killing their younger counterpart, lol).

It's kind of angsty and overdramatic but I enjoyed it a lot.

  At the reading of Sirius Black's will several shocking revelations leave Harry Potter and Nymphadora Tonks reeling. How will things change for them? And what about that crazy, drunken contract between James Potter and Sirius? What will this mean for Harry and Tonks? AU after Order of the Phoenix. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.

  "That date was the reason I was shocked to death when I saw that troll. Of course my hero Harry then came to save me and defeat the big bad troll." Tonks ended dramatically, placing a sloppy kiss on Harry's red cheek. He would die before he admitted this to her, but when she said that, he felt rather proud of himself.
