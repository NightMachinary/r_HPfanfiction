I'm looking for some long fanfics (at least 350k words, or added up if it's a series) where the focus of the story isn't Harry. Can also be OC-centric, but please don't recommend some of those stupid fics where there's an OC that simply follows the trio and doesn't change cannon at all.

Also, I prefer stories with a more realistic and dark-ish view of the Wizarding World. It doesn't have to be rated M but I rather stay away from humor and light stories. And please, NO SLASH main pairings.

The latest fic I read, and easily one of my favorites, is Fate by TheTrueSpartan ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate]] ). It is currently 2.3M words long and follows Ron as he has some visions of the Future and tries his best to change it.

Another fanfic that I loved is You'll Be The Death of Me by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4480473/Dominikki644][Dominikki644]] ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9738656/1/You-ll-Be-The-Death-of-Me]] ). This one has 683k words and focuses on Neville and an OC (Graces Malfoy, Draco's sister).

I'm searching for something similar to these 2 fics that I mentioned, please help me find something to read in this quarantine.

** Would linkffn(3912184;4236594) do the trick? However, if you like good Malfoy, then this is not it.
