I don't even know why I thought of this but I'm curious as to how people think the dynamic would have worked. Preferably they would all be in Gryffindor together but it doesn't really matter to me.

I don't know if that's the right tag because I've never posted on here before. Let me know so I can change it if it's wrong.


** Draco: /Getting to know you, getting to know all about you/

TBH I think Draco in Gryffindor is an unworkable idea, but other than that a story about that particular trio going on adventures and teaching Draco how not to be racist could be a lot of fun.

*** I understand that, I personally think it could work if he was SLIGHTLY OOC. But, I do agree, them helping him stop being an asshole blood supremacist would be hilarious, exactly why I requested!

** Linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat)

The Dursleys abandon Harry and he's taken in by other muggles. It changes Harry's nature and canon events enough that he's put off by Ron's attitude towards him when they first meet.

** It would be something like James and Sirius, replace James with Harry and Draco with Sirius.\\
Hermione is here then Remus also has problems once a month, only she has always bushy hair. Bonus resemblance Draco's mother is also a Black and would be Walburga ... or Lucius would be. ;)
