  "For crimes committed against the wizarding and Muggle world while underage, I hereby sentence you to one year without magic." Draco stood stiffly, his knees locked to help keep him upright. So many spectators. Potter and Granger were there, Weasel-less. His knees finally buckled and he crumpled to the floor in a faint. Chapter 41 posted.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

** I felt like I missed out the bit where we [[/spoiler][learnt why Hermione couldn't fix her parents. When did that happen ?]] Maybe Draco will fix it for her.

I'm enjoying it. Someone should have given them a cook book for Christmas. Pretty well written, a bit of magic, realistic character and relationship development, not heaps of action.

** I thought 'Mugglefied' was /okay/. I didn't feel as if there was much character development. Draco and Hermione start off pretty neutral to each other and then grow to like each other -- in fact Hermione is nice to him almost immediately! I would appreciate a bit more struggle and angst - surely they should have more residual negative feelings towards each other.

That said, if you're bored of angsty Dramione, this fic should do just fine. It's simple and not too fluffy.

** I enjoyed it. Neat idea that has great world building that doesn't need to feature new magic prominently.
