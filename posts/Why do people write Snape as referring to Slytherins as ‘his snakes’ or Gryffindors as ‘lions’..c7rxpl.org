** Because it helps reinforce Slytherin's image as being an exclusive clubhouse if the members get a special name to call themselves, to other Slytherins and outsiders. Sports teams use it too.

It's also canon, according to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/49vvji/pottermore_house_welcome_messages/][Pottermore sorting messages]] if you get put in Slytherin. If prefects say it to the new kids, then it's not out of the ordinary for Snape to say it too.

** I don't know if it's all that OOC --- Snape has a flair for the dramatic the size of Mount Everest, and we do know from the whole "Half-Blood Prince" thing that he is no stranger to nicknames and aliases. I don't use that trope myself but it's a pretty harmless one.

*** I agree, it's pretty in character for Snape. Although I find it super cringy when McGonagall starts calling Gryffindors "my cubs".

****** To be fair it's also what happens you make the animal of a house called "ravenclaw" an eagle instead of, ya know, a raven lol I feel like they're had to be some wacky debate between the founders on that one

******* I liked the theory that it was tied to a patronus, animagus form, or pet (though in that last case, how Godric found a pet Lion in 10th century Britain I do not know)

******* To be fair, the same thing happens with Gryffindor---the house animal is a lion, despite being named after the griffin.

** Seems like a completely reasonable shorthand/slang that would pop in Hogwarts. All the houses have totem animals that make for convienent nicknames (except ravenclaw, because fuck that eagle).

Saying "snakes" or "lions" saves you from having to say "students" afteer the house name. This is convenient because the house names embody physical locations, philosophical concepts, historical persons and ancient bloodlines possibly continuing to this day.

Imagine having to say "Slytherin students" several dozen times a day, working a job you hate.
