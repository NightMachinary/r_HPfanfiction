Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length. Can be old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes (Doesn't have to focus on any pairings).

Would rather not have any Weasley Bashings at all, if possible.


** Linkao3(Lily Evans, Death Eater by Chelonie)

The premise is dark, I warn you (read the tags!), but the story itself is /hilarious./ The first chapter or two are probably the darkest, since they set the story up, but they're fast-paced and don't linger on the uncomfortable stuff.

Instead you get imagery like Voldy washing between his toes in the bath, and a Death Eater meeting in which people propose having a singles mixer and setting up a suggestion box.

  Lily hated that toerag James Potter until suddenly she didn't and they were madly in love. What if it was a love potion?What if she was set free the moment James died?What if that was enough to make her switch sides?(Starts angsty, then gets a bit cracky)
