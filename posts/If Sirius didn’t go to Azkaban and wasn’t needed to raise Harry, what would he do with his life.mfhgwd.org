I have an AU I'm brainstorming where Lily and James live and so Sirius doesn't go to Azkaban. What does he do with himself in the years before 1991?

How would he respond to his mother dying soon and possibly getting the house?

But what I really want to know is how he'd make a living without the fortune because in this AU Regulus lives too and isn't very fond of Sirius.


** He'd live fast and reckless. I don't think it would be partying, though. More like a dangerous job. I can see him trying to handle some beasts as a career.

He received a nice sum from his Uncle Alfred and I'm sure his surrogate parents gave him something.

** Sirius wouldn't necessarily be poor if Regulus survives. His uncle Alphard Black apparently left him a "decent bit of gold" in canon. Also, Sirius is a highly skilled wizard, not an immature womanizer, nor does he run around making stupid jokes all the time. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/anvuxx/fanon_sirius_vs_canon_sirius/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_body][This thread]] sums up the difference between Fanon and Canon Sirius quite well.

An overused but believable option is to make him an Auror. He could also be a DADA Professor and continue the noble work of being a pain in Snape's ass.

How would Sirius inherit the house but not have a fortune?

** I think he'd mind his own business. Maybe develop a similar passion as Arthur for Muggle vehicles and enchant them. Honestly I don't think he would become an Auror like most say. That job is over-romanticized by fanon because we see a cool retired Auror in Moody and a really competent one in Kingsley but most of the work (in times of peace) seems to be rather dull and mostly a desk job. I don't think he's the crazy constantly partying womanizer that fanon makes him out to be. Not all pretty boys turn out like that and even if he might have had a phase in his late teens - early twenties... he would get over it.

** He would party recklessly untill something forces him to change. He is changed after Azkaban, but he doesen't have that experiance here. His partying is a responce to his familys conservative nature and all that. If you want him to settle down/grow up then have him become a single dad to a kid he had by accident.

** I think that he would have tried to get into the Auror Corps or be a Hit Wizard.

Alternatively, he might have been disowned by Orion and Walburga, but it doesn't look like Arcturus did (who dies in 1991 IIRC). I find it equally plausible that he could have convinced Sirius to be Heir Black and taught him to politic with the best of them. Although it would take a while; in 1981, SIrius was in full blown rebel mode and probably wouldn't have been too receptive.

Possibly both. And Sirius could be equally charming and provocative, so I could see him having fun in the Wizengamot. And James might then try for a seat like his (great?) grandfather Henry and the two of them would be a real force.

As for money, I believe it is canon that he inherited something from his uncle Alphard, so he could have had enough to get by for a short time (more if you want to go the goblins do the full financial services route). Add to that the elder Potters probably left him something when they died in 1979/80, considering that they took to him so well. One story I read had James' father buying up most of Grimmauld Place and giving all of it to James and Sirius, partly to provide an income and partly to be one in the eye of the Blacks at number 12.

I doubt he would mourn Walburga very much. He might feel her passing as the end of an era, but he would keep it very much to himself. There would be a gap in his life (who is he going to rebel against now?), but ultimately not a negative one. The house and Kreachur would probably go to Regulus between Walburga and Orion's wills. (There has to be at least one other property as there is no indication that Arcturus ever lived there. If Sirius becomes Lord Black or whatever, he'll get that as well as the vaults.)

** I've actually read a wolfstar fic like this. An Au in which Remus never went to Hogwarts. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6454192]]) But there is still much to explore. I think he would perhaps be tad less reckless than he is in the books. I think he would want to work something that is fun but he was also said to be very intelligent. He made the map and was an Animagus.

I would always love to see Sirius as a professor in Hogwarts though I don't know if this would be his profession if choice. I think he might be an Auror for a while but I could see him finding that boring after a while (paperwork and rules) so I think he would end up in a profession like Bill, who works as a contracted cursebreaker for Gringotts and raids tombs and stuff.

#+begin_quote
  Post-Hogwarts, Sirius Black is searching for something, he's just not sure what. James has moved on-married and a newborn baby to content with. So deciding he is going to find out for himself what's out there in the world, he packs up and heads to a Muggle University in San Francisco. There he meets Remus Lupin, the mysterious Teacher's Assistant, who very clearly, has some hidden secrets. At first Sirius wants to sate his curiosity, but eventually finding out what Remus is hiding becomes a near obsession.

*** I could see James going for a seat on the Wizengamot (not hereditary, since per JKR, only 2 Potters have ever had a seat there) if Sirius had one--or vice versa--and being a real force for change. Lily and Remus being major advisors.
