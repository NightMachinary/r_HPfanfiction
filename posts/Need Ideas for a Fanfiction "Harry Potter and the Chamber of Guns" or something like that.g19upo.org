/Disclaimer: I apologize in advance for being kinda rant-y?/

Yesterday at 3 am during a caffeine induced rampage, I somehow ended up with a semi coherent somewhat decent idea for a fan fiction, "what if Harry Potter somehow ended up in Stereo-typically Texas-y Texas, with Clint Eastwood as his adoptive father." Basically he says "yeehaw" and has a hammer space (pocket dimension I guess) filled with guns. Anyhow, I need ideas to make this into a somewhat coherent piece of fiction I can look back at in ten years and regret the making of immensely.

/Random Ideas I had for the Fic in bullet point format./

- Harry Potter eventually "accidentally" Kneecaps Snape for being a right twit
- Incessant swearing of the southern variety
- The ole trope where someone takes away his gun only for him to pull out another repeatedly
- Story begins with a Mexican Standoff
- Its definitely going to be a crack fic
- Tons of Tropes

Yeah that's it thanks. Cheers mate.

***** Quite possibly, of course what is the impact of casting the flame freezing charm on a wizard body? Normally the charm is cast on already existing flames and with WP munitions you have an explosion that forces metal and pieces of White Phosphorus into the body where it then reacts and starts burning. It's extremely painful so it's doubtful a wizard would be able to cast a counter after being hit. (It's also very toxic).

So any WP that's outside the body i would agree that the flame freezing charm should stop the flames but i think the side effect of using it on something inside the body mat be worse. (unless of course the WP was charmed against that üòÅ. I remember a story where some surviving Magical SS joined Voldemort and fired a round that was enchanted to disallow all magical means of repairing the damage, summoning etc and that only muggle means of going after it would work).

This is just one of the examples of why a lot of fans don't like fics that use mundane military weapons. Too much open for conjecture etc.

As long as you keep away from like, trying to blend magic and guns - maybe it's like wariness after the last time, but I get red flags when people try to spin guns into magitek-adjacent stuff. reminds me of my teenage years reading shitty isekai web novels - I'd 100% read this.

** Skip the crap at the beginning and start the story with Draco and Harry having a Mexican stand off instead of the duel in the trophy room, in which Draco bewildered by his metal wand. Readers can fill the gaps of how Harry came to be there themselves.

Or even skip to second year and Lockhart's Duelling Club? Up until then Harry's weird traits were only swearing.

Every time someone Vanishes his gun he pulls out another.

Monsters don't scare him bc they have worse in the Wild West. He's used to riding horses but hippogriffs will do!

Ron probably would adore this side of Harry. Hermione would be horrified.

Think about teacher reactions/the press/his school mates. How would Fudge react? Molly Weasley? The Weasley Twins?

You've got potential for some good laughs!

** [[/u/ZePwnzerRJ]] mentioned it so here's the HP 1911 copypasta:

Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

"Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1."

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

** According to canon there are (or at least were) Potters in America. The early MACUSA had 12 Aurors, one of which was Abraham Potter the many times great grand ancestor of HP.

It's entirely possible that Abraham had kids before he died and some of them moved to Texas. Perhaps Harry was raised there instead of being sent to live with the Dursleys? Maybe Sirius and Lupin brought him? I also like the idea of Hagrid going with and turning into a giant biker who mumbles and only Harry can translate. I've been pondering this very topic for a year or two. Hit me up here or in the Discord server (Squirrelly Dan) if you wanna talk about it. I've got tons of ideas we can pass back and forth.

I was thinking of making it a 4th year fic for the Tri Wiz (Harry being magically summoned from America or willing going as an exhibition participant) and Harry just 'MURICA!-ing the hell out of it. Harry takes out the dragon with a belt-fed anti-aircraft gun like a M167 or a pair of Browning M2HB's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1N-BI1fUjI][(like this)]] . That kind of stuff. Maybe after the graveyard scene Harry drags the bullet riddled corpse of Voldemort back to Hogwarts and he's cursing up a storm and is all like "Why the H-E-Double Hockeysticks did no one tell me there was a fourth task?! Why did I have to take out this Voldie-Knockoff?!"

** Hedwig should have a big role! In Westerns, the hero has his horse, but Harry has Hedwig and the Firebolt. Sirius and his motorcycle should also feature.

Ron will basically be like a Sheriff's Deputy to Harry, except that Harry is not in law enforcement because he is a kid, buy they'll have that same kind of comradery. Ginny will be a Calamity Jane or Annie Oakley type (personally, I like Jane's comedic film representation in "Pale Face" better than the "Annie Get Your Gun" musical), which is shorthand for she bucks tradition and is the spitfire wearing pants and shooting guns just as good as the boys (but not in a negative "not like other girls" trope kind of way).

Dumbledore is the judge character and Hagrid could either be the Sheriff or the mountain man. Snape is, of course, the Apothecary owner and a massive asshole. Madam Pompfrey is the widowed doctor, who lost her husband in the Civil War and had come to Texas for a fresh start and hopefully less sexism. (Fun fact: the "Wild West" towns became actual towns because of brothels and the smart women who ran them and put some of the profits towards improving the community, doing things like building schools, etc. Source "How Prostitutes Settled the Wild West" on YouTube by Adam Ruins Everything).

  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.
