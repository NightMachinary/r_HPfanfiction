Just a random musing I had. Another idea, vanished objects go into an alternate dimension. That could be a fun prompt.


** So, I can't believe I'm saying this on a Harry Potter subreddit but....

Physics doesn't work that way.

No seriously, it is HARD to make a nuclear explosion. It is much more than just critical mass. Even with criticality events, you usually just get a localized dirty bomb. Actually setting it up to maintain an ongoing chain reaction isn't simple. Turns out nuclear events are pretty good at disrupting conditions which might allow for a chain reaction (see: Expanding the fuel).

The example I recall being told to me was how all of the "super tense nuclear disarmament" are pretty unrealistic. You can "disarm" a nuclear bomb by something as simple as shooting it with a gun. Sure, you are probably dead, and the area around you irradiated, but doing so would have disrupted the precise series of events needed for a nuclear explosion.

Maybe you can say vanishing it right as it is exploding. But even so, you wouldn't need a nuke. If vanishing something caused its energy to be everywhere, you would be able to do a massive amount of damage vanishing a simple match. Or if you take the view that energy is limited (thus distributed over everything), in the grand scheme of things, a nuclear weapon isn't really that much energy. Depends on how 'local' the energy is distributed over. Maybe that would have more luck saying vanishing a sun. Or a black hole.

*** Lol It's been a while but I know my science is not there. It's just a random thought I had honestly. I did enjoy your explanation though and the fact that you explained Physics in a Harry Potter forum honestly made me cackle with glee. I like the idea of causing damage my vanishing things with massive amounts of energy, I'm imagining Seamus Finnigan causing explosions by vanishing things

*** I agree with you but since it says everything, it means unless you can somehow erase 50% of the universe resulting in sudden doubling of the remaining things not much will happen. So even vanishing a star or blackhole wont have any impact.

How? Even if you manage to annihilate matter, the energy would be spread across the length and breadth of the universe (according to OP's prompt, anyway).

Fat Man weighed around four and a half tonnes, and 400 EJ is an insane amount of energy, but when it is dispersed over thousands (or even millions) of cubic parsecs worth of volume, it shouldn't be that much energy per cubic metre.

**** That was my point?

Either the energy itself was somehow everywhere at once, in which case you don't need a bomb, a match will do. Or it is spread out in which case s mile is pretty insignificant compared to say, even the size of the earth much less "everything"

** My headcanon is that vanishing means transfiguring an object into air and conjuring is transfiguring air into an object. So it can be everything but it would a harmless everything.

*** That wouldn't work out though - it would at least have to be air and magic, or vanishing large things in enclosed spaces of 'insufficient' size would be horrific.

**** I wouldn't know that because it's never brought up in the story and I also don't live in that world to know how the mechanics of magic work in there. My thought was that the object just gets transfigured in normal air.
