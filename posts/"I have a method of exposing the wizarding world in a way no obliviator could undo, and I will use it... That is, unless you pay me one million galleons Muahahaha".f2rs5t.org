What if Dr. Evil was a wizard?


** “You can't just make me hide what I am! I'll tell someone!”

“They would be obliviated.”

“I'll have them record and distribute what they saw before they went public so there would be a record of I even if they were obliviated!”

“They would just be assumed to be crazy.”

“I'll do it with a bunch of people so all their ‘crazy' stories line up!”

“We would pass it off as a conspiracy theory. Add a bit here and there to muddy the waters. An animagus tried it and now we have a rather vocal group claiming various politicians are lizard people.”

“I could go bigger. Get a large movement of people organized in secret. Write down what they see and know. The document could be distributed widely as the authoritative word on magic. You wouldn't be able to alter it because there would be too many secret copies. You couldn't obliviate them because there would be too many.”

“That, my boy, is how new religions start.”

**** Good thoughts, major world leaders have magical protectors a la Kingsley in HBP. Major spring events might like have protection. I'm actually looking for a reliable way to put the magical world for a story.

***** A bunch of wizards flying through the stadium in the middle of the Super Bowl would probably work. They could wear invisibility cloaks and only take them off when they're in the stadium to prevent other wizards from stopping them. Too many direct witnesses (hundreds of thousands) to obliviate quickly and millions of people who saw it on TV.

****** "Ah yes, the 'botched halftime show' of '84"

I think there's a general difficulty of convincing people by creating a spectacle during an event designed to be a spectacle.

The invisibility cloaks are a good idea, but are defeatable in canon. Even Harry's, which is supposed to be the greatest of all such cloaks, is spotted by Moody's eye and Dumbledore among others.
