Why do Muggleborns get scared why Voldemort name get said


** It's probably a learned behavior. They go to school at 11, see the reaction people have around the name, and learn not to say it. Eventually, they will probably start to feel the same fear that other people exhibit. Some of them may not even know what Voldemort's name even IS, they're just familiar with the genocidal "you-know-who." And considering that he posed a serious threat to their parents and people like them, being afraid of him makes sense.

*** Also, could be they get kind of shamed/peer pressured into not saying it by their peers and then it becomes habit

** Not just muggleborns. If everybody is afraid to say the name, why is anybody in Harry's class afraid of it: they'd never have heard the name!

**** But they never heard the actual name, because everybody is afraid to say it.
