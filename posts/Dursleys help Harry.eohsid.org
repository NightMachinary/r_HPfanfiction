Can't remember much about the fix but I remember Vernon finds out that Harry is not pleased with his treatment by Dumbledore and the Order. This leads to Vernon helping Harry with using muggle methods to fight wizards. Sorry I can't be more specific but it's been so long since I read it. I made this a 'request' flair as opposed to 'what's that fic?' since there's probably multiple fics with this premise and I'd be interested in reading any of them if I can't find the specific one I'm looking for.


** Is it 'Old soldiers never die' - a Fic where Vernon gives harry a pistol, and he decides to take on Voldemort with a regiment of old retired squib soldiers. somewhat crack.
