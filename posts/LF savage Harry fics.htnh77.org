I'm looking for fics where Harry just rips into everyone


** The Lie I've Lived, Harry (HJ) takes no shit in this one.

Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time + sequel, Harry is the definition of weary badass in this.

Harry Potter, Master of Malicious Compliance, Harry loves fucking people over.

A Cadmean Victory + sequel, Harry pretty much hates everyone.

These are all I remember right now, if I remember more I'll tell you. The Lie I've Lived is probably the best one, then Malicious Compliance, Wastelands, and Cadmean. (For the topic anyway.)

Edit: linkffn(Harry Potter, Master of Malicious Compliance)

Also, I could be wrong, but A Cadmean Victory doesn't have a sequel, does it?

**** It actually does! It's called A Taste of Ismenian Water. It's just the original epilogue though, but nice to read.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE.

  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.
