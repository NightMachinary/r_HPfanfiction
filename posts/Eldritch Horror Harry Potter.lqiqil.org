I found myself wondering just a little while ago about a Harry Potter world that is eldritch and slightly Lovecraftian. I don't mean like 'everything is pretty normal until someone summons Cthulhu, either accidentally or for shits and giggles' I mean more like 'Harry Potter, but also Nightvale' with bizarre, inexplicable, slightly horrifying things happening all the time.

People regularly get lost in the ever-expanding library, there's a giant eye floating over the astronomy tower getting in the way of lessons, sometimes the Forbidden Forest disappears for a few weeks and comes back decorated for a holiday that nobody can identify, the thing in the lake with tentacles isn't a giant squid, Things that may or may not have once been students sometimes come out of the library, some of the students live in the Black Lake, that kind of thing.

The way I'd write it would be to include some affection and humour, in the same way that Nightvale does; everybody's gotten used to the horror, so now it's kind of everyday and normal and isn't as horrifying. The Weasley twins like to obliquely trick people into talking about The Orb Which Does Not Like To Be Acknowledged so that it gets upset, and this is treated as wacky high jinks instead of terrible.

Not sure how it'd work as a full fic, however; if you're writing a long-form Harry Potter fic, you kinda need to include the whole situation with Death Eater ideology, or at least /a/ reason that Voldemort rendered Harry parentless.


** There's a street that branches off from Diagon Alley where all of the arithmancers, unspeakables, and displaced dimensional travelers live. It's called Transcendent Alley, and it should be relatively short, since it points in the direction of the muggle street where the Leaky Cauldron's entrance is.

Transcendent Alley is extremely long, and the further in you go, the stranger the geometry becomes. Most of it's residents live on the first half kilometer. Xeno Lovegood grew up at around the 1.5 kilometer mark, and the experience obviously affected him. At three kilometers in, the geometry is so obviously hyperbolic that you need a long rope to avoid getting lost. At five kilometers in, the buildings aren't even non-euclidean. They're so nonsensical that nobody's been able to come up with a self-consistent arithmantic theory that can describe them.

Past this point, the unspeakables don't bother mapping the road or making any observations. Instead, they let convicts choose between the Dementor's kiss and going as far into the alley as they can, equipped with a long rope around their waists and a year's worth of supplies. The unspeakables measure the distance the convicts go by the amount of rope that plays out from the spools at base camp.

** Harry was trying to concentrate on Professor Sinistra lecture. Looking at his watch it read 11:59 class still another thirty-one more minutes before it was over. It was a pleasant night out. The sky was clear and the moon was high in the sky. A full moon, Harry noticed, his thoughts drifting to Remus. Professor Sinatra was standing in front of the class in the middle of her lecture, “Slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust-“ Harry jotting down his notes half-listening noticed his watch turned Midnight, and the professors demeanour changed. Her eyes glazed over and her voice becoming more monotone “Tonight's full moon is brought to you by Pepsi. We created the moon and we will destroy it”

** Humans that manifest the essence of the eldritch gods are known as wizards and witches. Magic is thier watered down ability to manipulate reality. Wands are matched to thier souls, and use more ingredients for the cores than canon. Magical creatures muggles consider fantasy are all children of Shub-Niggurath,

For example, the seemingly innocuous unicron, so innocent, so docile, they will gore anything that bothers them with thier horn, and then reveal they actually have canines (like those pictures of horses but with dogs mouth's, google it) and the heard will swarm the victim and eat it alive. Knifflers can borough and chew through most anything to get the shiny, including human appendages. When a werewolf transforms they spit out all thier human teeth and then tear thier skin off to burst out like a bloody newborn, hulking wolf monstrosities, the apex hunters. Vampires are a combination of the ones from skyrim, underworld, and nomac from blade.

Magic accidents are common, but wizards and witches are resilient and can be healed easily, muggles, not so much. Having your limbs torn off, your ribs poking out of your shattered ribcage, twisted kneck, painful- but still something a wizard can recover from even after minutes of what would instantly kill a muggle.

The power he knows not, turns out Harry Potter is a remanifestation of ______________ elder god (whichever one u think is best). So he is especially hard to kill, like unholy shit why won't he die, oh god kill me I'm sorry levels of unlikable. Voldemort slowly finds this out the hard way.

**** It's listed as it's own subject, on the OWLs and NEWTs, in neat letters between Herbology and Potions: Intern, Hogwarts Community Radio.

The Radio Host is Lee Jordan, sixth year. It has been Lee Jordan, sixth year, since Augusta Longbottom attended the school. Since Griselda Marchbanks did. Hogwarts has had community radio - or something that fulfills the purpose of community radio - for longer than it has had radios or, indeed, a real sense of community.

Lee picks a new intern on Wednesdays, or Thursdays when scheduling errors mean Wednesdays no longer exist. He used to do it at feasts, but they weren't quite close enough - the 1953 disaster that led to the closure of the drama club, the banning of any future drama club, and the permanent erasure of any possible drama clubs from Hogwarts soil after Lee went without an intern for three days made that point well.

Lees interns are always first years, in spite of various Headmasters begging him to pick Better qualified tributes. He never does; his selection criteria are entirely his own, and those that try to force the issue find themselves cursed with blackening hands or shattered souls or a thousand other things that cannot be traced back to Lee, but that everyone knows, on a bone deep level, are because of the cheerful sixth year and his focused rage. His interns are always first years, and they always receive a purple envelope stamped with an unnervingly realistic human eye sitting on their plate at dinner.

That is the only thing they have in common. He has picked almost-squibs and full veela, purebloods and muggleborns, every Lovegood and every thirteenth Black and never, ever a Bones. They've been enthusiastic and terrified and reluctant, and it hadn't mattered. Not even removing a child from the school entirely could untangle the duties of an intern from a student that had been selected and still judged capable; little Irma Pince found every piece of paper she even looked at turn into a list of tasks when her parents made the attempt, including the contents of every wallet in a mile radius.

The duties of an intern were not particularly difficult. Every evening, they brought Lee coffee from the house elves, who regarded him with an unusual level of awe, even from then. Every morning, they tuned up the radio equipment, which did not require knowledge of technology as much as it did a working knowledge of the human circulatory system and determination. They would investigate whatever Lee told them to in between classes, and occasionally he would astrally project in to check on them. No, the duties were not difficult.

The death rate, then, was hard to explain. Things just seemed to happen around Lee and his interns. A quick trip to visit the mermaid village would reveal a high tech subway station in one corner that connected with Atlantis. Feeding the thestrals was significantly more challenging when the food you were feeding them reanimated itself and swore vengeance. Even a simple story about the various types of clouds would turn into a run for their life when one opened up an eye gleaming colours not designed for comprehension by humans and started following the interns everywhere.

Maybe every decade, an intern would survive a full year unscathed. Most of the time, Lee would run through five or ten or twenty of the first years, each one replacing a comrade who had died, vanished, been temporarily displaced, or developed a sudden and crippling case of “is a bird.”

And yet.

And yet...

And yet the students that did survive, that did gain that special qualification on their OWLs and their NEWTS, between Herbology and Potions? They became Ministers, became ministry heads of department or joined MI6 or did precisely whatever they wished. Bill Weasley became a curse breaker for the notoriously reclusive goblin nation. Rubeus Hagrid got to teach people about the wonders of creatures. Xenophilius Lovegood ran a profitable newspaper that no one ever seemed to read. Lee was not kind - Myrtle Warrens wish to stay at Hogwarts forever, Bellatrix Blacks wish to never be forced into a traditional marraige, Aberforth Dumbledores wish that his brother would look at him - but his interns always received precisely what they wished, god help them.

What was she doing that caused her untimely exit from the intern programme and, indeed, reality?

Sometimes the world appears vast, and oppressive. It is; this is a sign your visual organs are functioning correctly. Rejoice in the perception of that creeping shadow cast by no one in the third floor, the sallow, stretched taught skin of the DADA professor and her ever present smell of rot, in the doors that are not doors beckoning you. You're able to perceive all these things! Good for you!

They show you that the world is vast, maybe even endless, and that no matter how hard you try you cannot understand it all. And that is okay. Listeners, I do not remember sally anne perks. Out there, maybe none of you do. Maybe there's a half finished scarf you were making for a reason now lost to you, maybe there's a guest bedroom filled with the love and life of no one you know, maybe there's a hole in your heart that wasn't there before.

Maybe there isn't.

Maybe Sally Anne Perks passed through life without leaving a single memory behind in the minds of those that knew her. Maybe the only thing to show she ever existed is this note, right here, covered in wet black mold and the scent of blueberries.

I do not know. None of us do. But as we carry on with our day to day lives, after sally anne has left us and after the after, maybe you'll feel a little sad, for no reason at all. Maybe, without you even knowing, you'll miss the girl that was sally anne perks.

There is a cupcake on my desk, listeners, that neither I nor the house elves baked. There is a note pinned to the wrapper, saying that the baker has just gone to get one final thing, and then they'll be ready to celebrate. There is a hole in my heart where someone used to be.

The world is a little bit darker, listeners, without sally anne perks. But the world always gets darker, when we forget to hold on to eachother.

Goodnight, Hogwarts, goodnight.”

**** But that's just the thing, in an HP universe with a lovecraft twist, magic is measurable by Math and science, it just depends what aspect and how far the rabbit hole your willing to go down.

The further and more you understand, the less makes sense and the more questions you have. Don't go to far, or you might come face to face with the abyss. Things make sense 99.9 % of the time, if you ignore the frayed edges of logic and the slight inconsistencies of sense. The other .01% they don't, they really don't, they mind meltingly, existentially horrifyingly, nihilisticly don't.

Zeno Lovegood and his daughter took a look through the peephole to the .01%, Dumbledore glanced at it from his peripherals, Voldemort took a taste. Lily jumped in head first and tied herself to Harry right before she died.

**** I'm the same way, but it was the way the author uses more and more transcendental types of math. Go advanced enough and all math becomes somewhat eldritch, with infinities appearing where they shouldn't be, strange nonexistant number constructs, ordinal numbers in the depths of infinity, etc. There might be ordinal numbers (numbers that are defined to be after something else) that exist so far into the realm of impossibility that they prove things like 0 = 1. The entire realm of imaginary numbers is fucking /whack/, with how they describe numbers with two dimensions to make up the mandelbrot fractal.

If you get down to it, all reality can also be described with numbers - light speed for example is like when a hyperbolic curve approaches a point for all eternity, a black hole is like a stack overflow error that causes gravity to suddenly become infinity, physical dimensions can be quantified and divided with each other to form logical results that describe their properties, etc.

It's a shame I suck so bad at math because it's an amazing field.

***** I will admit that all of that stuff sounds really cool. However, that's not what bothered me about the Arithmancer.

In the Arithmancer, Hermione invents new spells by using Arithmancy to count syllables and wand movements/twists. That's not how magic works. The fact that you can use magic in HP without incantations, wand movements or - in extremis - wands at all shows this. For me, using Arithmancy to create spells in the way shown by White Squirrel is twaddle.

In HP, wand movements and incantations are just mnemonic or focusing aids. They're not a required component of the magic.

Backstory: It is canon that the Ministry only learned of Azkaban when the wards around it fell. It is also canon that the Dementors were the /least/ scary thing they found there.

Premise: Azkaban is home to some eldritch horrors that are empowered by positive emotions, what then is a better prison than Azkaban - the immorality of prisoners will stop the spread of the monsters of Azkaban.

Unfortunately, Sirius Black was innocent, and his imprisonment there and the strength of his conviction has strengthened the monsters therein... dun dun dunnnnnnnn

** I do am writing something like that, but it's more like the first paragraph with some of the rest.

Basically, it's standard Magical World for most people, but the Eldritch is there, in the underneath and in some things, regular Wizards can't deal with most of it so there are bloodlines of "superhuman" wizards and muggles who deal with this called Hunters(yes, inspired by BloodBorne), they are the ones called in when some stupid wizard summons something dangerous, they work with the DOM(or their country's equivalent) to help out, they serve as ambassadors to other magical nations (Fae for example) and on the side the hunt the more common creatures that are dangerous even to Aurors (werewolves, higher vampires, etc...)

Bloodlines like Van Hellsing and Belmont are of hunters, same as the Peverell and later the Potters, though it can skip a generation.

Harry 'awakes' that when he kills the Basilisk(they must slay a creature without their "superhuman"(think Captain America and Wolverine) abilities) and finds out the world has much more depth than he expected.

*** Harry must learn, very quickly, that if you find a window in the Underspace, you /don't look out of it./

It's not that there's anything clawing at the panes, or anything. No, nothing so mundane. But sometimes, through the dark mist, you can glimpse strange constellations. Worse is that occasionally, very occasionally, dark shapes will blot out those glittering stars. And if you stare too long, those shapes stop moving. Then they begin to get bigger.

Once, when Harry was exploring an Underspace manor, he found a figure standing, staring out of a window. Some poor bastard must have gotten trapped inside when the trunk outside was destroyed. I say a figure, though, because when Harry aproached and it turned around it was clear there was no way you could describe it as a person any more.

** It doesn't have anything to do with Hogwarts, but linkffn(The Adumbration of Cordelia by Temporal Knight) has a fem!Harry dealing with being an eldritch abomination.

Another one that doesn't involve Hogwarts is linkao3(Outsiders and Other Eldritch Entities by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel). It has a sequel: linkao3(Petunia Potter's Monster by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel).

Edit: It seems that the TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel has removed his/her stories from ao3. They are still available on [[https://archive.org][archive.org]]. I presume etiquette discourages direct links to the [[https://archive.org][archive.org]] pages in cases like this.

Since the bot doesn't seem to be working for ffn at the moment, here's the link to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13347771/1/The-Adumbration-of-Cordelia][The Adumbration of Cordelia]].

  Hourglass 2 - Dora Kirk aka time-tossed Nymphadora Tonks thought that things would be easier with Voldemort exposed and Umbridge gone. But now there is a new enemy on the board vying for Voldemort's role, her boyfriend is getting friendly with another girl, and to top things off...Time itself seems to be breaking down more and more often. Who knew being a teen again was this hard?

*** Thanks for the rec. Unfortunately, there were a couple of things about this fic that took me out of it and which stopped me from wanting to continue.

I can just about forgive an author for renaming Harry to Hadrian if the rest of the story engages me, but this one failed to do that. No explanation was given for the Potters neglecting thier first son, and checking the reviews it seems like the pacing is all over the place.

As a result, I was unable to settle in and enjoy it. But I appreciate you digging it out for me.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, & the TWT in a way you have never seen. Alterate Universe.
