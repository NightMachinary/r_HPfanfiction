We know that canonically, Transfiguration is permanant. However, pretty much every single Harry Potter Fic uses the "non-permanant" version instead. Why? And what fic started this trope?

*** Regarding the parchment/robes, not only is not everyone good enough for it as has been said along with manual labor of doing each piece of transfiguration what are they transfiguring it from?

Regarding metamorphmagic, human transfiguration is very dangerous and difficult whereas metamorphmagi have the natural ability to do so without needing a wand.

Regarding non living to living, you aren't bringing anything to life you are making new life essentially.

Regarding alchemy/gold, I always thought that transfiguring certain things are more power intensive or difficult to while alchemy gets around that by (in my mind) being less power intensive by combining the magic with other things.

What would our heroes transfigure stuff into that would solve all their problems. They can't make food.

I'm a bit confused regarding your last statement. If you are asking why people don't do chain transfigurations to accomplish the same task, certainly they can but it takes longer and isn't as impressive.

#+end_quote

Robes -because not everyone is good enough with Transfiguration to make the robes look like they want to. Making it good fit might be difficult to. Also, it could be a form of showing off your wealth.

Parchment - convienence. You don't wanna do the manual labour yourself and making it via transfiguration might not give you the standart quality you want if you aren't good enough.

Because it's instant transformation requiring no effort. Human transfiguration is dangerous and hard to do, and not instant.

#+end_quote

Books are wrong on this tho, depending on your definition of the word "alive". Priori incantatem managed to bring back Harry's parents and they could react and talk to him. Ressurection stone did the same thing. It's possible that it is only impossible under normal circumstances tho.

That's extremely hard and dangerous tho. People want easy "eternal life" like drinking potion of eternal youth or something. But, yeah, HP world is no stranger to eternal life. Horcruxes, Philosopher's stone.

Infinite food. Infinite space. Infinite items. Infinite water. You really seem to be keen on ignoring these things. They have infinite supply on everything that's not super difficult to make.

#+begin_quote

And, if you would have read my replies(or the thread I linked you), you would have realized, that this falls on the "difficult to make" bit. Regardless, if they weren't lazy they could do 90% of the work themselves. Getting ingrediants is far easier than for muggles.

Pets are fairly expensive. And you have to get them somehow. They could have used transfiguration, but I assume they weren't much good at it. So, I suppose, it's infinite supply, if you actually put in effort to get it.

#+begin_quote

Well, you still have to buy them. Then you can start dublicating them. Again, infinite supply of brooms.

I would also like to point out that the kids were able to do great things with those wands. As long as their parents ensure that they get any wand whatsoever and get into Hogwarts, they are pretty much set for life. Never need to worry about anything else(unless you want to live in luxury)

Summary:

Wizards have near infinite supply on most of their goods, except certain hard to manifacture goods like wands. This leads to everyone not lazy having a really good life and a vastly different economy from the muggle world.

I think this summary is enough so we don't have to debate further.

Ron and Neville being shit is fanon. They just weren't ask good as Hermione or Harry.

Ron being shit comes from him not being perfect on trying the levitating charm in his first lesson. We can't say how bad or good he did, considering he really only started using spells alot during book 5.

*** Their economy is vastly different from our own. Most of our "economic laws" don't apply in their world. They have many ways to make infinite supply, there is no starvation(transfiguration, dublication, summoning, ect), and very little demand on most of the stuff. For example, most people don't have time/knowledge to make chairs. They pay for other people to make it for them. Wizards can make it in 5 seconds however, so there's not much money to be made in that. Money is only spent on rare things(invisibility cloaks, potion ingredients), hard to make things(brooms). Their economy is vastly stronger to any of our muggle countries as well. One Euro/dollar/pound is not gonna buy much for muggles, while for Wizards one galleon it is enough to buy school supplies for 5 children. There's to much difference in our economies to say that transfiguration would ruin theirs. It could possibly ruin ours, sure. But their's are built with this in mind

** Simple: JK was bad at world building.

Magic needs constraints to be an interesting plot device and strong rules:

"Sanderson's Laws of Magic:

The author's ability to resolve conflicts in a satisfying way with magic is directly proportional to how the reader understands said magic.

Weaknesses are more interesting than powers.

Expand, Don't Add"

JK goes for fantastical and rule of cool alot, but the problem with that is 'if they can do all that with a wave, why is there any drama at all?'. Think about what we know about the secret keeper spell. It is basically unbreakable without the secret keeper and we know the secret keeper can visit the location. Without some sort of limitations on it (secret keeper can't be hidden by his own secret for long, no nesting secret keepers), it just seems like any competent character should be able to use it to avoid any drama.

It is better, of course, if such limitations come from a self consistent overall setting for magic. But we pretty much ain't getting that for HP.

The temporary transfiguration rules fit well with cannon while putting a restriction on magic the author can play with.

I would say a good chunk of good HP fanfic does an attempt at retroactively world building, putting in constraints (magical or social or whatever) to help explain most of the fantastical plot driven ex-machina

**** I think you missed the point entirely.

Fidelius is just a good example of how things are more interesting when limited. Making the magic not 'perfect' gives opportunities for interesting stories. Fidelius isn't particularly problemsome in canon, although it falls more under the 'keep things mysterious' rather than 'explain why it has flaws' catagory.

Don't read it as too much of a slight on the author, HP was never really about world-building. That is ok. You can compare to series that are entirely based in world-building (Middle Earth comes to mind), and sometimes it comes as the detriment of a good story.

​

The way I see it (and I may not be using correct literary terms here), world building is about the why. You can have great imagination in a scene ("The Elves and Dwarves charged down the dale at each other"), you can have good characters and motivations ("The Head Elf is lost a brother in the fighting a week ago"), but world-building is about being able to answer the why: Why are the elves and dwarves fighting?

As mentioned in the original post, it isn't really important that this is actually answered, simply that it comes off as there is an answer. What really kills it is when the answer seems to change to the demands of the plot. Plot needs to go faster? Spell can magically overcome the obstacles. It needs to go slower? Spell starts having troubles. It needs to feel like the answer to "Why (is this happening in this world situation) needs to feel like it exists and is not just off the cuff.

For HP in generally, the world tends to hold together pretty well over a single book, but when viewing the work as a series there are some serious flaws (usually because magic/worldcrafting that happens in the later books wasn't created/thought of/mentioned in the earlier books). Things like HP Universe's money, spells introduced later etc.

​

Anyway, a lot of this is neither here nor there. The original question you asked is why is this used? It is a way to add 'flaws' or imperfect the magic so you can do interesting things with it. Can you do interesting things without that? Sure. It is in the same boat as giving people magical cores and having them burn down their energy level / magical exhaustion or making it so particularly powerful spells have to go through high-research branches instead of just being discovered, or even giving wizards 'power levels' instead of (I believe established canon) the idea that wizards have the same access to magic and it is just in their training/character.

Magic becomes a fixall, by limiting the length of time transfigurations hold you easily stop the characters, and therefore writers, from using magic to fix everything.

If your conflict is ruined because transfiguration isn't short, then it's likely forced and bad conflict.

******** True I was just making a suggestion honestly sort of inspired from actual happenings in the history of Doctor Who, where since the Doctor was becoming overly dependent on the Sonic Screwdriver, they just wrote it out of the show for a while. Just because it isn't logical doesn't mean it isn't a possibility. We are most likely never going to know why the first fic used this but I highly doubt it was logically thought out. The vast majority of fanfiction is written by inexperienced writers after all.

********** I think a reason that this trope became popular was.the idea of making a more hard magic system. After all, in hp there are rarely any limitations put on the magic system. That makes it frustrating when the world is so dependent on magic and is so fundamental to the story. In situations like these, having a more defined magic system makes for better writing. Am example of this would be when in the deathly hollows, Hermione talks about gamp's law. This introduces that "good food" can not be conjured. Now this is a vague law and actually doesn't put very much limitations on magic, but this is a failure on JKR's part. She doesn't do a good job of making limitations for magic in hp.

None of this has anything to do with non-permanant transfiguration. What actual difference does it make if your cover can last an hour or 50 years while you are under heavy fire? You either will have to move to attack, or make new cover if it is destroyed(as it likely will be). Honestly, the heist one doesn't make sense either, unless by non-permanant you mean "it lasts like less than 5 minutes" which is silly in itself.

That's stupid. It only works if the weaknesses are interesting, or if the mechanics are good. Meaning, it only works if done extremely well.

****** The stuff I mentioned directly deals with non-permanent transfiguration. It'd help if you actually read what I said. How long cover lasts can have a huge effect on a battleground situation. Having cover durability be a function of the caster's ability as well enemy interference adds a new source of tension in a scene. Timing and tempo can and should matter a lot in battle, especially with regards to larger strategy rather than the small-scale tactics you seem boxed into. Transfiguration that lasts for short periods of time is not silly in and of itself. You just appear to not like that level of nerf. I like that nerf because it forces the characters and authors to work harder to solve problems that are more difficult to solve (making the story more engaging) and because, as others in these comments have pointed out, permanent transfiguration is overpowered.

#+begin_quote

StarDolph was not horribly wrong. The Fidelius being hard to cast does nothing to invalidate their points about the Fidelius being easy to abuse and riddled with plot holes.

#+begin_quote
  Also, please cite an example where limiting Transfiguration would actually prevent them from solving all their problems with a wave?
#+end_quote

There are tons of examples where limiting transfiguration could not be worked around with another spell. For example: [

Only a select few people in canon can fly unsupported, all of whom save one (who a significant number of fans, including myself, consider apocryphal) are dead. If a wix who doesn't know how to apparate is stuck in a deserted, tall tower with just a wand and an empty bed frame, their best bet is to transfigure that bed frame into some sort of parachute or rappelling gear. Impermanent transfiguration either forces them to rush and risk injuring themselves or to be inventive with what they transfigure (say, parachute most of the way down, then retransfigure the bed frame into a large cushion when the parachute fails). ].

That's just an example off the top of my head. There are many more anyone could think of.

#+begin_quote
  Edit: Also, the spell is ancient and likely not all that well know since the only people who knew how it worked was Minister of Magic and Charms Master(a field in which Fidelius falls in)
#+end_quote

A Minister of Magic who is noted to be incompetent and to not be the brightest tool in the shed and a Charms master who has no problem eli5ing the Fidelius to laypeople he happens to be having a drink. And, again, the Fidelius being old or relatively unknown doesn't preclude its potential for abuse and story-breaking.

Case in point about fallacious arguments and strawmen. "But it can be done badly" can be said about any type of story element. But, let's say you were clear that you felt that weaknesses are not conducive to good story telling. Your only argument is to give a ridiculous strawmen that you then lambast. Neither I nor any of the other commenters on this post who feel that permanent transfiguration is overpowered would advocate for playing straight a character who ends up on the verge of death with their every action. We just value narrative tension and characters fighting adversity through hard work and/or ingenuity. Weaknesses help ensure that characters can't just breeze through their problems and that characters need to think creatively about dealing with obstacles in their path. If anything, characters having appreciable weaknesses is a mark of a mature writer.

#+end_quote

One, it is likely irrelavant either way do to heavy fire(mentioned it), apparation, or enemies making bombs(explosive potions) and portkey-ing them to you. Secondly, unless the cover lasts for only five minutes, it's irrelavant. Whatever or not it lasts an hour or a day will not matter.

#+begin_quote
  Having cover durability
#+end_quote

Right, and how is time relavant here? A wooden door is gonna be just as useless against a bombarda as a wooden door that lasts an hour. It having more time doesn't add any more defence and the enemies are certainly not gonna be using tickling jinxes.

Another problem is that many authors don't have the skill to make the idea work, which, admitedly, is more of a problem with them and not the idea.

#+begin_quote

If you had read his comment(take your own advice) you'd see that he was taking about any compatent Wizard. It being unknown makes it hard for most people to use it....because they don't know it.
