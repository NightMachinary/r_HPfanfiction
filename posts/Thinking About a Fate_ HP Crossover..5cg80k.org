With the 1st (or whichever number) Hogwarts Holy Grail war instead of the Tri-Wizard tournament.

Who is Harry's servant?

There are two possibilities I can see. Firstly, given The Cloak, he can likely summon Ignotus, which would be an interesting classic Caster, in all likelyhood.

Secondly, given that he drew Godric's Sword ("only a true Gryffindor"), he could also summon Godric as one of Saber, Archer or Caster.

Any thoughts, or other suggestions, given that it would be in 4th year, but also that it would be part of a further AU that could have access to other servants if it was worth it?

The fic would likely be ignoring the Nasu-verse characters, mostly.


** I second [[/u/darklooshkin]]'s idea of a sane Riddle as caster. The horcrux in Harry is as strong as a catalyst as Avalon in Shirou. There is no reason he must be sane, but it would be horrible for Harry if he had to use command seals just to control a very insane and highly homicidal Voldemort. Insane Voldemort for berserker?

(Does the Hogwarts HGW keep most of the Fuyuki HGW rules, like having command seals?)

Please let me know if/when you post this somewhere so I can read it. I need more good Nasuverse/HP crossovers in my life.

** I've tried this crossover a few times (there aren't that many things I haven't tried). In one, I tried it with Rowena Ravenclaw being Harry's, and in another, I shifted Saber over to him. King Arthur is a British myth after all.

*** The issue I have with that is that Harry hasn't encountered anything of either of theirs at that point in the story without it going AU. On the other hand, both those are cool, and Saber's an awesome character who I feel would mesh well with Harry's personality.

Anyway, ty!

** A simple idea-Harry's scar acts as a catalyst. He gets a sane and human-looking Tom Riddle as his Servant Caster.

As for the others, Cedric gets Helga Hufflepuff as Archer, Krum gets Basil the Second as Lancer, Fleur Delacour gets Isabella the first of Spain as Assassin (justified as her being the in-universe cause for the complete extermination of the wizards living in the Nasrid Emirate at the time of the reconquista and pioneering many an assassination technique subsequently used in the medieval world's version of black ops. Also, can summon notable members of the Inquisition to aid her in battle), which leaves Saber (Otto von Goetz-muggle mercenary who managed to kill a Dark Lord... and helped inspire the character Guts from Berserk) Rider (Genghis Fucking Khan), Archer (I would be tempted to go with a jaded, cynical time travelling Harry with premature grey hair for this one, obviously. Well, either him or Simo Hayha) and Berserker (Salazar Slytherin) to assign.

** Well, you're going to have to establish the setting first. Having the system existing in the first place can be handwaved to "the Throne of Heroes exist beyond space and time", but how does the "Hogwart Grail War" summon Servants? Handwaving it off as "oh it existed from the start" seems kind of shitty

You're probably better off just borrowing the concept and applying it as a generic battle royale, especially if you don't plan to bring any characters over. As a plus, you're not constraint to the servant system either, the ancient heroes you summon can be someone capable of dueling with both a sword and a wand (i.e. Godric Gryffinndor)

*** That was generally what I was going for, with the aside that I was thinking about keeping the classes, because the element of trying to determine a Hero's class was an added aspect I enjoyed. Having it specifically being a 'Holy Grail War' or other similar battle royale was something I was thinking about, but I'm unsure. Certainly, I wasn't going to restrict myself to the logic of the original. For one, it seems likely that it would be 7 schools competing, rather than 7 individual interests. Secondly, sponsorship from the church seems unlikely, unless there's an Italian school involved. Thirdly, the magic systems are just too different for a fusion that remains true to both worlds.

So, yeah, I was aiming for a 7 (Harry for no. 8? Or just one of the original 7? Hmmm...) man battle royale, each supported by their schools, with perhaps several events across the year with rewards to encourage people to compete (similar to the reward for the Caster problem in F/Z), otherwise a year long espionage and battle story.

TBH, I'm not likely to write it, given the 8 other stories I'm working on, but it was an idea that appealed to me yesterday.
