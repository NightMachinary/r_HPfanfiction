Looking for "Across the Time" by Aizwan. I can't find it anywhere else. Please let me know. Thank you


** There have been a few people making threads on this recently. If you do a sub-search for them (use the reddit search bar and limit to this sub, if you're not aware of how to do that), you should find some people who've shared them then.

If they don't pop up on this thread, anyway. Worth a shot, though! Hope you find it, it's a great fic. :)

This is what I use to often get books that have been deleted. Across the time by izwan appears to be there
