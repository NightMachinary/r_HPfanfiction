:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Cannot remember what it is. The writing style was fairly long winded "and in another universe blah blah blah... But this is not that universe" type of thing. I think it was harry potter without harry gimmick but not that specific fic but i honestly don't remember if that was the twist or not


** I think you're thinking about the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][boy with a scar series]] which is a collection of one-shots exploring what ifs, and the particular one without a chosen one as Harry and Neville both died is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4308630][the kids that chose themselves]] maybe.

If not maybe [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344/chapters/28275021][grey space]] where Harry doesn't get invited until Hogwarts until later and it's about his time at Stonewall High?
