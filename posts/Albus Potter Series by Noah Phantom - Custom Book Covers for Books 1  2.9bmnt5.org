If you haven't read the series yet, you really should. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Global-Revelation]]


** OK, I saw The Alexandra Quick covers and really loved them. But since I love the Albus Potter series, this is really nice as well. I really love these covers, they're so nice and simplistic. Try contacting NoahPhantom as well, they'd really appreciate it.

*** Thanks! I've contacted each author so far but none have replied back to me. I hope I'm not offending them by stepping on their works.

**** Oh no, I'm sure you aren't. I don't know how they'd be offended. I think they'll appreciate that they have such a devoted fanbase, because they worked hard on them. I think NoahPhantom will greatly appreciate this, especially with the latest updates.

** Ugh, what an utterly boring, unimaginative premise. And I still want to slap Rowling across the face for the idiocy that is "Albus Severus Potter".
