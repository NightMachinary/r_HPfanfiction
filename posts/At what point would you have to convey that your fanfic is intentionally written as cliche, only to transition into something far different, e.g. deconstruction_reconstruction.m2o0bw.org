Fanfiction is different from original stories, no brainer there. For an original story, there is no pre-existing material -- hence, the 'original' part. Therefore, it is less obvious, if something is cliche and derivative. But for fanfic, e.g. HP fanfic, cliches are more apparent. For instance; Lord Harry-Many-Names and his goblin friends. So, at what point does the writer have to convey that, if at any?

Original stories have build-up, but fanfic readers wouldn't slog through trite material to get to the good stuff, right? Would you? Would subtlety not be advised, especially if the writer is /too/ good, for the majority of the readers?

Yes, you could warn readers ahead of time in the description or notes... But wouldn't that spoiler the surprise, if that's what you want it to be? Do you give your readers credit?


** This is one of those areas where fanfiction is often at odds with what might be regarded as best practice in 'traditional' storytelling.

Basically, you'll find that a large number of readers /want/ those tropes, and /don't/ want to have the rug pulled out from under them with a deconstruction of those tropes. A lot of readers are highly set in their ways. People who love Lord Harry power fantasy stories will often be disappointed if it the story turns out to be a subversion, and the people who /would/ appreciate a subversion of the trope will probably skip it on first glance, as the vast majority of fics which set up Lord Harry in their first act will not make any attempt at commentary or subversion.

You're battling expectations from both sides of the isle, and it makes it a pretty difficult proposition.

It's also not really a war you can win, so I'd recommend not trying to fight it.

Write the story in the way it needs to be written. If communicating your twist at the outset would fundamentally weaken the story, don't do that. Maybe you can add a note at the beginning stating something like 'things may not be as they seem', but don't expect it to make much of a difference. Your aim is to write a story that is strong enough to generate word of mouth, and to get eyes on your story that way, rather than through the capricious whims of random fandom trawlers.

I should probably say, though, that if your intent is deconstruction of a trope, it's probably worth having some minor deconstructions present earlier on, or hints to your planned deconstruction. You don't want to telegraph it, but it should be fairly obvious in retrospect that that was how it was going to go.

You're looking at this all wrong. In fact, it looks like you're trying to set yourself up to be able say "It's the readers' fault that no one likes my story." But that's not how this works. It's your job to convince readers that they should give your story a chance. And if I see a story where Harry does the standard Gringotts inheritance test, I'll probably drop it immediately, unless the author has given me a good reason to trust that it might be good anyway. And telling me that the story is supposed to be a deconstruction might do it.

But most of the stories I've seen that are claiming to be parodies or deconstructions of those tropes are indistinguishable from the ones that are playing them straight.

** Piggybacking off some of what [[/u/SteelbadgerMk2][u/SteelbadgerMk2]] said: as a reader who genuinely is interested in stories deconstructing Harry Potter's highly fandom-specific plots, I'm wary of any fic which claims that it's doing so.

Prince of Slytherin got ridiculously famous (by fanfiction standards) ridiculously quickly by claiming to "subvert the tropes" of WBWL fics, and spent its first year talking on and off in the author's notes about how "in order to subvert a trope, you first have to establish it," but as of the end of year three, none of those tropes have been subverted. In fact, most of them have been played almost entirely straight, with the only change to their execution being that they're rigorously explained away by the characters, rather than just being an accepted part of the world.

Being that PoS is, like, /super/ influential, whenever a fic tells me straight up that it's setting out to challenge fandom conventions, I just don't trust it.

** I think if you have to sit down and tell people that your story isn't cliche but a deconstruction of common cliches it probably isn't doing the job of deconstructing all that well.

In a similar vein, all stories, even fanfiction, should have appropriate build up, scene setting and editing. If the build up isn't good then the story isn't either.

** How many stories would be half the length if not for annotations every single chapter?
