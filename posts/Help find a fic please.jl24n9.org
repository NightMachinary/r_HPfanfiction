:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember the title but it was a fairly long fic on fanfiction.net where Harry potter and remus worked together and spent alot of time with the goblins. Talks about the history of magic and wizards relationships with goblins. Harry is able to create a potion that can be imbued into bubblegum, so the person can learn a new language depending on what type of bubblegum they choose. Also with the goblins help they semi cure remus of lyncanthropy, where it doesn't go away but he can change at will with no pain. Any help would be appreciated, also any fic recs for long stories about harry working with goblins, goblins are so cool? I hope this post doesn't get taken down because i don't know how to add 2 flairs. Have a great day ya'll.


** I don't recall a fic where Harry develops a potion that put into bubblegum that teaches you a language. There are a couple that feature a language lozenges that you can purchase.

Try Duel by fantasy1290

Linkffn(9041086)

For a goblin story one that I liked but many like to hate is Harry Crow by RobSt where harry is raised by goblins

Linkffn(8186071)

Try The Eighth Time is the Charm by madie080802 where Harry works with the goblins and uses a time chamber

Linkffn(13012483)

Try Harry Potter and the Daft Morons by Sinyk for another story where Harry works with the goblins.

  What if when Draco challenged Harry to a duel at the beginning of first year it had a lot more significance then either realized? A duel not only for bragging rights but for injustice and eventual love. Harry/Harem

  Harry tried to remember the reason why he was sitting, apparently waiting his turn, at the longest line he had ever seen. The long headcount behind him made him realize something was amiss. Then he heard it, "Not you again!" The death angel yelled. "Oh, gods, please have mercy, I'm going to lose my job, Potter, this is the seventh time!" A fic for Reptilia28's reaper challenge.
