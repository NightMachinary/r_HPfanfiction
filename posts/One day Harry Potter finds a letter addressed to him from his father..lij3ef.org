The contents of which are the hopes, dreams, wishes, and fears of a 19 year old teenager, barely a man in his own right, who's just found out that he's going to be a father from the woman of his dreams. The letter's not directly addressed to Harry, because at the time of writing it neither James nor Lily knew whether the child would be a boy or a girl, but the content of it makes it starkly clear that James was excited to welcome this new life into the world, and do everything in his power to keep them safe, and feel loved.


** Harry, in spite of himself, sobbed as he opened the envelope. He'd found it in-between the pages of the book Hagrid had given him - a plain, white envelope with "From James Potter, To His Child" written on it somewhat clumsily, like whomever was writing was more used to a quill-and-parchment than a pen and paper.

"My dear child,

If you are reading this, I am not here to read it to you. Most likely, the war has claimed my life, in which case I hope you're safe and well."

Though the Dursleys had never exactly treated him like family, Harry was at least relatively safe there. He nodded, despite the person he was nodding to not being there anymore.

"I just want you to know how happy I am, that I've brought you into this world. Lily, the love of my life, has just told me - she's pregnant. Pregnant with you.

While I'm not sure if I'll be a good father, and honestly with how I was at school, I probably wouldn't have been - Ow! Lily just started squeezing my arm, apparently she disagrees - I can't tell you how excited I am to teach you all about the magical world you'll be growing up in."

A tear fell from Harry's eyes, down his glasses, and onto the corner of the paper. He took off his glasses and took a deep breath, to keep from openly weeping. He had to keep quiet, the Dursleys were currently at "mildly raunchy joke about a bicycle" in their meeting.

"I'm writing this letter in case I can't do that - this way, I can at least tell you to not make my mistakes."

Mistakes? A bit of confusion pierced through his grief. He'd always seen his parents as perfect people, to hear he had made mistakes and regretted them was a surprise.

"First and foremost, you'll be going to Hogwarts in eleven-and-a-half years. This is where the majority of your father's mistakes happened - but also his best moments."

Harry continued reading, curiosity mixing with the grief that was slowly subsiding.

"Your father had the bad habit, sadly, of painting everyone in one House with the same brush - while Severus and his friends are not good people, I would have made friends with Andromeda Tonks, the Healer who told Lily about you, much quicker if I hadn't treated everyone in Slytherin House like they were him."

Harry nodded, relating. While Malfoy and his friends were awful, he realized now that there were a few Slytherin students who never really hung out with that group. Maybe he could reach out to those students?

"Further, while a joke is always welcome at Hogwarts, be careful not to take it too far. Nobody likes a bully - and hurting people as a joke makes you just that. Lily would have never made me the happiest man on Earth if I'd continued on the path I was on before Fifth Year."

"To counterbalance that, I will tell you a few things from my Hogwarts years I am proud of.

One of my best friends, Remus Lupin, is a werewolf. If you ever meet him, now you know his secret - try to keep that secret. I did, for seven years."

A werewolf? That sounded familiar. He'd heard about them in Defense Against the Dark Arts.

"Honestly, though, he's a good person. That matters more than whether someone's rich, poor, Pureblood, Muggleborn, or whether they have a furry little problem three days a month."

Harry nodded, reminded of Ron and Hermione. He hoped he was on track to make the kind of friends his father would approve of - good people, regardless of anything else.

"One of the few things I did before fifth year that Lily approves of - don't look at me like that, Lils, it's true - was to help Remus Lupin in any way he could think of. We even became Animagi - illegally - because Animagi don't trigger the werewolf's nastier instincts. This let us help him through the most difficult days."

Harry had a flash of a memory at that. He remembered someone turning into a great big dog, and his dad letting Harry pet the dog for a while. The letter went on for a while, detailing a few of the adventures his father had gotten into with his friends, Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew and Remus Lupin.

"To conclude, try to make good friends - and do anything you can to keep them. And don't make enemies for petty reasons, someone you bullied might have instead been a great friend."

"If I'm still alive, this letter will most likely be burned or read out by myself. I promise, I will do anything I can to protect you through this war and through life. You haven't even been born yet, but I already love you, my child."

"Once again hoping this letter finds you well,

James Potter."

At that, Harry closed the letter, sobbing into his pillow.

When he looked back up, he had the surprise of his life - there was a strange creature standing there, its enormous eyes looking on in sympathy.

--------------

If you hadn't already guessed, this takes place in the summer between first and second year, immediately before Dobby shows up. I think the talk with Dobby would go a lot differently from here - maybe to the point where Dobby doesn't get destructive.

Also I made myself a little sad writing this.

**** To troll, or to derail what they think is a bad prompt thread (which this isn't, in my opinion - I liked it enough to write a snippet).

That'd be my guess.

***** At risk of replying to a shitpost...

- James Potter's personality (he's too busy pining after Lily, or being happily-married to her).
- Molly Weasley's personality (Too loyal to Arthur).
- The fact that Molly Weasley is old enough to have a toddling son (Bill) while James is a first-year at Hogwarts.
- They have no reason to ever actually /meet/ in canon.
