  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** Sorry off topic, but I can't stop giggling about the Boody Baron. LOL

That has to be the funniest typo I've seen in awhile. It just sounds so wrong. :)

** I remember reading this as well, but can't remember the title... all I can say is I am certain it wasn't a fem Harry and it definitely included Harry being heir potter I think

** I think I read a fem!Harry with this. It might be the Hope Potter one? I'm guessing though.

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. (Fem!Harry) Mostly canon-compliant, diverging in book eight
