Just thought of it and wonder if anyone wrote a fic with this premise.

  Sirius Black twirled his wand between his fingers, eyes making a lazy sweep over the panicked denizens of Diagon Alley. Timid shopkeepers peered at the group of Death Eaters from windows and doorways, a woman screeched and flailed under the Cruciatius, and Nagini sprawled in the sun, a humanoid bulge in her stomach.

  Black groaned. "Right, five minutes and I'm already bored. Any chance we can head back?"

  Voldemort said, "I'm surprised at you, Black. I distinctly recall your enthusiasm for raids."

  He shrugged. "Eh, I've got papers to grade and six kids in for detention tonight. Having a job kinda sucks."

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** I mean, technically, linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stecphild) for the Second War... but it's not what you're expecting.

Also Sirius really was a traitor [[/spoiler][in the world of HPMOR]] but that's a minor point, /not/ by /any/ stretch of the imagination a plotline, or even a plot point.

*** Its been a while since I've read A Red Headed Stepchild so i'll have to re read it all. And I couldn't really ever get into HPMOR (though I do respect the premise).

**** Just be warned that while Sirius is a double agent, it's neither the main plot point, nor something he ever wanted.

Edit: And the entire story is a comedy/crack thing so poor Sirius will never live down being a Death Eater despite his worst efforts.

Don't know if the author will expand on it later.
