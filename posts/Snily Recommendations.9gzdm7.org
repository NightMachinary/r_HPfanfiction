Hey guys! I am really new to reddit and honestly this board was a main reason why I even joined, but that's because I was looking for help. I am a huge *Snily* shipper and fan and I love to read /good/ fics about them. Keyword being /good/. There have been many times I had to read and scroll through countless pages of terrible stories either because they were bashing some characters too much, they wrote a character (usually Lily) in a terrible way, or the story itself was just bad. So I come here for help, please pass on any recommendations of good stories that you have for me. And also to help out anyone in my dilemma, here are some of the best stories that I have already read:

​

From Fanfiction-

*The Long Road Home-* (Ongoing and honestly I thought the best parts of it are the first half) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6613973/1/The-Long-Road-Home]]

*The Path Not Tread-* (Ongoing, the best character studies I have ever read and has the potential to be the best Snily story ever) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11750613/1/The-Path-Not-Tread]]

*The Moment it Began-* (Complete) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began]]

*Puzzle-* (Complete, dark fic where a lot of shit happens. But really good) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6622580/1/Puzzle]]

*The Road Not Taken-* (Ongoing, honestly in my top 5. I love it in every way) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3939197/1/The-Road-Not-Taken]]

*Dreams of Future Past-* (Complete, a cool take on the Snape going back in time) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12129370/1/Dreams-of-Future-Past]]

*Ananke-* (Complete, I love it because Lily in here is the best I've ever seen. But the second half is kind of lacking) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4400517/1/Ananke]]

From AO3-

*A Dealer not a Death Eater-* (Ongoing, in my top five. Fricking amazing and the best au ever) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14046060]]

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

  "I read the book," he says. "Peter Pan. Took me all summer. And I've figured out why you're always so uptight and miserable: it's because you're trying so hard to be this Wendy character." / For Safari. (Sorry for cheating.)
