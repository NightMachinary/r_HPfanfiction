Basically a really uncommon duo being a main focus of a fic ( or the main focus).

The duo can be a friendship or a romance ( but not with a oc).

What is your favorite weird duo fic and what's a weird duo you would like to read a good fic of but haven't?

For example my fav weird duo story is The Code by Aduro. The weird duo is Draco and Bill Weasely.

A weird duo I haven't really seen but would like to is Sirius and Snape.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** Snape and Luna in this. Don't worry, it's not a romantic relationship, just a student-teacher one.

  One Shot. AU. After all, every child deserves a mother who loves them. Even those who grow up to be monsters. Luna just never imagined things would turn out this way. Time Travel.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.
