An idea I had for a pre-Hogwarts mentor!snape fic:

After Harry preforms accidental magic that causes Dudley to trip down the stairs, Uncle Vernon decided that they can no longer keep harry and wants to take him to an orphanage. Petunia insists that they can't just leave him at an orphanage, but she doesn't know how to contact Dumbledore. She does however remember the address for a certain Wizard, and promptly leaves him at Snape's doorstep.


** Petunia does know how to contact dumbledore though

she tried as a kid and got replies

***** canon!Snape is not a nice person, but I doubt he would accept caring for Harry, and canon!Dumbledore would never leave Harry with Snape for a multitude of reasons he would probably go and talk with the Dursley's and if they were really set on not keeping him(which would probably break the protective enchantments), then he would place him with a nice trustable and safe family with kids he could befriend.

All the while making heavy changes to his plans.

Honestly Dumbledore knew the Dursley's were crap, but at least in-universe for some unfathomable reason he was safest there.

If you remove the plot part of JKR needing a mistreated orphan hero and then the in-universe protections, there's no reason to leave Harry there.

Nice set of protections they got there.

******** if they are intent-based and dementors don't honestly have malicious intent. Plus who could have expected the dementors which are controlled by the MoM to go rouge on November 1, 1981?

Ps i have a theory the wards got wonky after the first year when Harry saw Hogwarts as his home.

EXCERPT OotP

Dumbledore to Harry: “But I knew too where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated ... to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.”\\
“She doesn't love me,” said Harry at once. “She doesn't give a damn --”\\
“/But she took you/,” Dumbledore cut across him. “/She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you/, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.”\\
“I still don't --”\\
“While you /can still call home/ the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.” ([[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/source/the-harry-potter-novels/op/op37][OP37]])

“Five years ago, then,” continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story, “you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as /happy nor as well-nourished/ as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances.”

********* Meaning it works inside the house, or probably some perimeter that includes the garden, etc. because it's part of the property.

It does /not/ extend further, if a DE wanted to get Harry while he was in school or going to the market, or the park, they would still have managed too.

Remember the touch based protection is just against Voldemort, who could sill hurt Harry with spells, and that same protection was lost after Fourth Year.

******* I like the sheer angst when they discover they are family though... Call me evil but reading these two brains break is enjoyable. I like the fact fandom Snape isnt a complete caricature of a one man's pathetic pity party. He needs to grow up and after a very adult-like mental breakdown angst and the fact JKR claims Lily and him were on the mend), I can hope to have him struggle with his emotions, employ Occlumency religiously and ACT LIKE AN ADULT DAMMIT. I hope he would take advantage of 'usurping' James as HP's father and feeling toasty by showing up his adversary one last time. okay I'm aware he is a twatwaffle... but there are a few Petunia fics where she tries to raise harry better than her sister 'ever could' and Petunia and Snape are literal mirrors of each other so.

Dumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer together.\\
“You did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.”

***** Snape would never be as bad as the Dursleys. It takes a special kind of cruelty to abuse an innocent toddler, and no matter his feelings, someone who swore to protect him wouldn't then proceed to abuse him worse than the Dursleys.

******* Yeah but they also said a lot of other things that in hindsight were obvious lies. Snape could specifically target James Potter while being generally honest and "kind" otherwise, which would make Harry genuinely believe him.

What is worse, for a period at least, James did do legitimately reprehensible things that Snape could point towards to prove his point. So reversing Harry's opinions would be far from easy, especially if Snape has shown no other signs of being untrustworthy.

He knows Snape despises Harry's father, he knows Snape is NOT a nice person to leave a child with for plenty of reasons, most of them Snape would agree with.

Heck, I don't see Snape wanting to care for any kid on a regular basis.

I can see Minerva having much bigger chances of wanting that and being much better.
