** This is the beginning of a Harry/Neville story that mostly takes place in America. I wrote this because I felt Harry/any-male-non-villain is criminally underexposed in hpfanfiction- I could just have easily written a Harry/Charlie or Harry/Fred story, but this idea took my fancy and ran away with it.

I hope you enjoy.

** I like the idea, Neville is shamefully underused still. There's a couple stylistic points that need some work, but I'm sure you can iron that out.

Right now you overuse the characters' names. There's no need to specify every single time. Pronouns are rather useful, and you can also leave things a little more ambiguous. You're not directing a play, after all. ' ' His eyes fell on Neville's wand. "Is that your dad's wand?" ' could be ' He glanced down. ' Isn't that your dad's wand?" '

You're also over-explaining their thoughts and actions. For instance "Mrs. Weasley---who obviously didn't notice anything out of the ordinary was turning this way and that waving her hands." You don't need to tell the readers that Mrs Weasley isn't noticing anything strange.

Try to have more faith in your readers, they'll figure things out.
