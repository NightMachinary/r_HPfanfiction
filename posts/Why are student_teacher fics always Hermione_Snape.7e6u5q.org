This has honestly been a question knocking around my brain for a while. It feels like there are a ton of Snape/Hermione teacher/student pairing fics (Or occasionally a Harry/Snape), whether romantic fluff pieces or heavily smut filled. Is there a particular reason behind this?

And why are there so few, if any Harry/"insert female teacher here" (student/teacher) fics? Is it because somehow a Male teacher female student is more acceptable than female teacher male student fics? Or perhaps its simply that Snape and Hermione are such major players in the books? I mean there are some options on Harry's end... (Sinestra, Babbling, and so on, even if they are barely there characters... not to mention an ofc is always an option.

Come to think of it, I've never stumbled across a Harry as a Teacher fics with him paired with a female student either. Its always Neville as the innocent Herbology teacher seduced by some firey female student or something.

Whats the deal?

Sorry if this is a bit odd of a query but I honestly am curious. Feel free to recommend as well as discuss.


** Albus, Minerva, Filius, Hooch and Sluggy are ancient. Q, Gilderoy, Umbridge and Crouch are evil. We never meet Vector, Burbage, or Babbling. Binns is dead, Firenze is half horse, and Hagrid is 12 feet tall.

So you have Sinistra, who is barely a character...trelawney, who is an unstable drunk...grubbly plank? Kettleburn? Filch?

**** It makes sense. Daphne as a pureblood slytherin classmate to the trio is way more of an exciting character to write and read about than an older professor woman.

Why write about professor Vector/whatever when you can write about an almost OC pretty girl ice princess in Slytherin and have her be involved directly in the plot. Burbage was also an older lady in the movies and Babbling just sounds silly (What subject does she even teach? I don't remember her at all)

I mean, we are talking about student/teacher fics. I assume that people who would write those find older professor women exciting. That there is a lack of those isn't a problem of lack of exciting characters, but lack of male writers with this particular fetish.

*** McGonagall isn't actually /that/ old in canon. A bit too old to be considered for most pairings, I suppose, yes, but she's certainly nowhere near as /ancient/ as Dumbledore or Slughorn. She's 56 in /Philosopher's Stone/, although she was made older in the movies for the sake of having Maggie Smith play her.

**** Also keep in mind the average life expectancy for witches/wizards (going by old age deaths only), was something like 135 with many living to be 150 (Dumbledores rumored age), or 175+ (Madam Marchbanks). So factor in the average life expectancy of Muggles (around 80 in the UK/USA), and realize the Wizards/Witches is easily 50+ more...

Even if you went with the higher "estimate" of McGonagall's age which was 70, that technically makes her around 40 in Muggle years, and if you went with her at 56 than shes like 33. And since witches/wizards did pair up with Muggles that math is valid to use.

Technically this means she still would be well within the age of "pairing up" with an older student if someone felt so inclined.

****** JK Rowling said he was 150. So its only myth if she lied. I agree there is conflicting information, as is typical with Harry Potter lore due to Rowlings contradictions at times. However she has repeated the 150 number over and over in interviews and talks, despite the supposed birth date of Dumbledore being 1881.

And heres another good example of the problems. The same supplementary information says Marchbanks was born in 1899. And yet, she was supposed to have examined Dumbledore personally in NEWTs AND been experienced when she did that. So clearly she had to have been born well before him. And even the new estimates of 1870 dont fit.

***** I don't think that reasoning holds much water, though. It seems to me that wizards age at the same rate as muggles, but are far less affected by /old/ age thanks to magic --- that is to say that a forty-year-old wizard and a forty-year-old muggle will look about the same, and the difference will only start to make itself felt around seventy.

Either way, the issue with pairing someone of McGonagall's age and a student is not so much in McGonagall's physical fitness as in the perceived squickiness of the difference in mental age.

*** Your point? I already pointed out Sinestra and Babbling with regards to a Harry pairing, and you brought up Vector and Burbage. We don't know much about any of them but isn't that the point of fan fiction? You develop characters in new ways, whether they have been developed before in any way in canon? In addition, for that very same reason ages and circumstances can be adjusted, not to mention you can always create an original female character.

EDIT: Not sure why I'm getting downvoted here. Is not exploring underdeveloped characters one of the primary aspects of fan fiction?

**** You did ask why there is so few pairings with them and people are trying to answer you. Most fan fiction uses canon as a guide and rarely strays away from it in any major way. Authors tend to only develop side characters in fan fiction who have potential to be interesting, who could make hot/good pairings for main characters and/or who could be easily inserted into the plot. Ice princess Daphne is just way easier and more fun to write about than some older professor trying to seduce Harry. OCs are harder to write and less popular so they are usually only developed as self inserts. Most people writing those want to imagine themselves as a student and not a teacher.

Also, the female professors that we do know about are just not terribly exciting and none of the ones in the movies/books look terribly attractive or young. None teach interesting subjects either. This makes the fic potential low unless someone is willing to put a lot of effort straying away from canon and making up their own character entirely from scratch.

The "teacher/student" pairing in the world of fan fiction or even just any form of fiction is not exactly rare. And there are quite a few post-Hogwarts fics, so not being able to imagine Harry as an older man is not an excuse.

I get your point though, especially the idea of "redeeming" through her.

honestly, those professor potter fics seem to be mostly written by men to fulfil their harem fantasies where they get every girl in school and a couple teachers.

and I am not saying they are unable to imagine harry as an older men, but he will always be younger then Hermione(unless AU). And Hermione simply is the character female writers choose most to insert themselves in. And if you want a Hermione relationship with a teacher Snape is the first choice because of his actor.

** I think part of it is that Alan Rickman was so attractive he made people think Snape was more attractive/approachable(?) than he was in the books. Also Hermione is almost a year older than her classmates so between that and the (fanon?) idea that she added a year (or more!) to her age because of the time turner, it's slightly less icky than say Snape and Hannah Abbot.

IIRC, someone did the maths and concluded that if she was as reasonable as McGonagall told her to be, she can't have added more than a few months to her lifetime, which were largely compensated by the time she was Petrified in Second Year (and presumably not aging).

***** That's only coutning class hours as such. I think it's very plausible she also used the Time-Turner for a little more time to do the increased amounts of homeworks, /and/ to give herself a few extra hours of sleep a night to compensate for her over-24-hours days. I believe that's enough to bring the counter over a month, even if, at the end of the day, she may still have been Petrified longer.
