I make this request every once in a while but never get any recommendations. It's a shame cause all the fics with this pairing I know of are so good.

linkffn(Awaken Sleeper; Fair Lady; Hell Eyes; Denarian Renegade) are all fics with this pairing. Hell Eyes and Denarian Renegade are more hinted relationships, not full blown ones, while the other two are pretty clear.


** I think [[/u/mistermisstep][u/mistermisstep]] was writing something along these lines, actually.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6ghtgk/prompt_suggest_a_massively_clichedbad_idea/][He submitted a challenge to give him ideas for a crackfic to write, and my idea won.]] Think he's still going?

*** The Harry/Gaea pairing is interesting but I suspect it being a crackfic won't be the exact type of story I'm looking for. I'll still probably read it because there are so few fics like the one I'm looking for, if he even wrote it.

*** Little late to this reply, but I will be publishing the first chapter of that particular fic pretty soon. Not sure if it'll be this weekend or sometime next week, though.

I'll say one thing about it: something entirely unexpected grew out of the premise you gave me.

*** Yeah there's actually two pairings, [[/spoiler][the Harry/Amanda one and the Harry/Meciel one which I was referring to in my post.]]. It's not a very substantial pairing, but it's there.

****** Huh. Maybe I should give ti another try then. Amanda was one of my favorite characters in that story but the way Harry never changed kind of pissed me of. It was just the same thing over and over again.

*** I took a look at the thread and it was a bit disappointing. The first recommendation was for Fair Lady, which I've read, and the next bunch where either Harry/male death slash or femHarry/male death. The last two recs were a crossover with an anime I've never watched and a harem fic.
