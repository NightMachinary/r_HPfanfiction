This is a question to fanfic writers: Do you spell Beauxbâtons like Rowling did without the circumflex accent or do you spell it like we would in French and with the circumflex accent above the 'a'?


** If you're writing in English, I would recommend ditching any unnecessary accents. It's not wrong to use it or anything, but it serves no real purpose in English, and occasionally encoding issues will mean accented letters turn into odd symbols or messes of random characters.

*** You make a good point about encoding, but â is still a part of the language. It would be like saying ‘Remove the silent p from psychology because it serves no purpose in my language' or ‘Replace all k's with c's because k isn't a letter we use and it would just be too much work.'

(Edit: After a quick check it turns out a and â are also pronounced differently in some dialects of French.)

Part of the French language, not the English language.

If you're speaking English, you say "Spain" not "España". If you're speaking French, you say "Angleterre" not "England". In most languages, including English, proper nouns are not just copied wholesale from their language of origin, but rather "localised" to that language.

So along the same lines, in English you would say/write Beauxbatons, not Beauxbâtons.

***** This is quite amusing if you remember that Jo knows French very well and was a French teacher, so she deliberately ditched the French accents in her English books.

****** Also amusing is that the name "Beauxbatons" uses the word "baton" for wand, where the actual French translations of the HP books use the word "baguette".

I occasionally entertain myself with the idea that there is a second French school called Bellesbaguettes, which is where French magical families send their squib children. It teaches baking, not magic.

Through an administrative error, Tom Riddle is accidentally sent to Bellesbaguettes rather than Hogwarts. Nonetheless, he somehow manages to take over magical France through the clever use of baked goods.

******* Just to note, 'baguette' is the correct translation - "magic wand" = "baguette magique" (baguette literally means a thin stick - the bread is named after the shape, though obviously it's better known abroad).

"Baton" is a more general word for stick, but generally would be a bigger stick than a 'baguette'. In the context of a magical one, I picture it more as a staff than a wand (I forget if in LotR, for instance, if Gandalf's staff is translated as being a magical 'baton').

Obviously only tangentially related to your point, but I find that a lot of english speakers don't really realize that.

***** True. One of the things I love about English is our weird criteria for what we borrow. Deutschland? No Germany. Cliché? Sure, why not. Au revoir? Ooh, yeah sounds nice. Tsunami? Spell it the same but forget saying that t. In the end it's weird, and mostly up to personal preference I guess. I enjoy seeing Beaxbâtons sometimes, but you're probably right that Beaxbatons is simpler and even probably less jarring to see.

** Until reading this, I didn't realise there was an alternate, more correct spelling for it. In the past I would've obviously just written it like Joanne did. Now that I know, I'd say that l'd probably mention there being two spellings but stick to the book spelling for most use. For example:

"Beauxbâtons, or simply Beauxbatons as those outside of Wizarding France tend to write it, was..." etc

Either that or have it correctly referred to when in a french setting or being discussed by french wizards and witches. So if Fleur mentioned the school, it would be Beauxbâtons. If it was Harry, Beauxbatons.
