So at the moment I'm currently working on linkffn(12348853), /Have You Ever Seen The Rain?/ which is just about to enter its third and final act and will come to a conclusion. As I'm someone who likes to plot ahead I generally like to plan my story out in advance before I work on it, but the problem is... I have too many ideas and can't decide which one I'd want to work on first. The main three are below, and I could use some feedback about which one sounds like the best idea.

*The Only Living Boy In New York*

A secret society exists beyond that of the Ministry of Magic, something more powerful and secretive than the Order of the Phoenix. Harry's long-lost half-brother, Caine, returns from exile in America to propose a new business venture. But Caine is not all that he seems, and soon his arrival could have far reaching consequences for the entire wizarding community. Post Deathly Hallows. And Harry is about to come up against a terrifying new threat. Beware the King of the Bottomless Pit...

Main influences for this one would be the /Court of Owls/ from Scott Snyder's Batman comics. The only problem I have with this one is that the secret society thing and a nameless enemy sounds like it could be potentially a bit too similiar to the original inspiration as well as my current fic which also deals with secret societies to a certain extent.

*Walkin' After Midnight (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Life of Crime)*

Harry Potter finds himself kicked out of the Dursleys at a young age and joins the magical community sooner than expected, being raised on the streets, kept from attending Hogwarts, and starts a new criminal enterprise. Earning the attention of the law he starts a love-hate relationship with newly promoted Auror Hermione Granger, who has been assigned as part of the taskforce to take him down. But Harry has his eyes on a bigger prize in the mythical Philosopher's Stone, something that could hold the key to immortality and is wanted not only by him, but a newly resurgent Dark Lord...

Mainly the inspiration for this one draws from crime films like those from the likes of Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino, as well as Spielberg's /Catch Me If You Can/. This would be massively AU where a Harry who never went to Hogwarts (due to some reason or another, haven't decided yet) is essentially a crime boss, operating outside of both the Ministry and Voldemort's influences. Voldemort is still using Quirrell's body as Harry hasn't come to stop him yet and the Philosopher's Stone is a bit harder to find than in canon.

*Rebel Rebel*

1940s Britain. Hogwarts was never created and the magical society never united, existing in even more secrecy than canon. But that doesn't stop Grindelwald from rising to power during the second world war, and his best friend, a young teacher at a muggle school, Albus Dumbledore, seeks out a group of allies to take him down. Dumbledore's allies are Newt Scamander, a finder of fantastic beasts, Tina Goldstein, an American who has left her homeland to help with the war effort and to find her missing sister, and a young Tom Riddle, who could either be the saviour of the wizarding world or its downfall...

And finally, this one which would be the hardest one to write out of the three most likely, but I love the idea of what would happen if Hogwarts had never existed and there were still people with magical powers walking around. What would their careers be like? Would they be forced to adapt to muggle society? Where would they learn their training? And of course, there's a war on, and this is the time of /Fantastic Beasts/, after all... so the idea to bring in Newt and Tina adds to the fun a bit especially as Newt was never expelled from Hogwarts because there was no Hogwarts in the first place. The main idea I drew this one from was the X-Men series, so potentially depending on interest this could expand into its own wider universe.

Apologies if this is the wrong place to put these, but like I mentioned above, any feedback would be awesome. You don't have to vote on the poll on my profile but it would be greatly appreciated if you did.


** I'd read Walkin' first. I think Rebel Rebel will need a lot of period research and world development so let that simmer for a while. New York didn't interest me, maybe other people?

*** Yeah, that's the main problem with Rebel Rebel, the period research. I've never written anything in the 1940s so It would be a huge challenge, but the idea sounds potentially really cool to explore. Thanks for the comment!

**** You're already going AU, may as well make it massive. Have the muggle world be steam or dieselpunk. Use sky captain as the visual cues for rebel, rebel. No hogwarts doesn't mean no magical society. It might even mean no pureblood prejudice due to no slytherin propaganda or centralization of bigotry. Perhaps the magicborn's prejudice is more overtly cultural/classist. Without a central school though, magic would have a master/apprentice system most likely.

** I really like /Walkin' After Midnight (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Life of Crime)/ and then /The Only Living Boy In New York/. The third one sounds interesting too but I guess I'm rather fond of Harry and rarely read ff with other characters.

**** The league of extraordinary gentlewizards would be good but if you want to stick to song titles, We Are The Champions^{1.}

1. 'Champion: a person who fights or argues for a cause or on behalf of someone else' thus his team would be the champions of those predated by grindlewald

  Harry Potter may not be The Boy Who Lived, but the world isn't going to save itself, and it sure as hell could use all the help it needs, especially if Voldemort gets his hands on an ancient weapon from the Department of Mysteries that would guarantee his victory if he is allowed to return. Only this time, Harry may need help of his own - from some rather unorthodox allies.

** Not the first one :( - don't invent new siblings for existing characters, this almost never works! If you have to have an OC, make them a total OC and give them a new family etc. :) - especially when you can't really explain well why a certain sibling only shows up now!

Also, the name! Damned, be creative :(

Second one isn't bad, but don't make it Hermione (it doesn't fit her profile at all to be an auror...even the chest-monster (Ginny Weasley!) would work better here!)...Tonks might work (and she'd be a pain in the ass if you have to secure meetings against a metamorphmagus who could literally be ANYBODY!)

Also, why would Harry not get a Hogwarts letter in your second idea? Has he been tried in absentia with a "snap wand on sight" order in place? Hell, they'd have to have proof (he's a hero in the publics eye, being suspected of a crime isn't enough to just order his wand snapped on sight and not sending him a Hogwarts letter...also: Running a criminal empire from school sounds interesting, too! Especially when he can bring in stuff a lot of students would want: Contraceptive potions, aphrodisiacs, the potion-equivalent of viagra, certain drugs etc.)

Third idea...nah, not interested...time-travel fictions aren't my thing (unless it's something like "Harry (or sb. else!) travels back to first/second/third etc. year (or maybe even to the time before they were at Hogwarts!)" (re-do fictions basically!)) especially if they kind of time-travel while making it massively AU (like sending Harry back to stop Tom Riddle...nah, sorry! Not my cup of tea!)

*** Thanks for the feedback. Caine was more or less a placeholder for now, I had planned on coming up with something original later down the line. And the idea about Harry going to Hogwarts and starting a criminal enterprise from there actually sounds pretty cool, so I'd take that idea on board.

The third one doesn't have any time travel, it's just an alternate history period setting, but I see what you're getting at.

** Whichever interests your personally the most. Which one would you like to read?

With your permission I'll provide few thoughts:

First one sounds tad cliche - lost/abandoned siblings just don't make much sense. Wizards are already stupidly powerful and both Voldemort and Dumbledore are far from stupid so there being yet another secret super-powerful organisation is dubious at best.

Crime lord Harry would be interesting, but you need to let him realistic childhood and his ascent to crime lord status. And Hermione somehow doesn't work for me as an Auror.

Last idea could be very interesting, but also would require the most work to make it believable.

** All three have promise. Personally, I like /Rebel, Rebel/ the best (and not just because of the title), but I that one would be a lot of work.

/The Only Living Boy in New York/ is interesting because sibling OCs usually aren't so ominous-sounding, and fuck yeah, Court of Owls.

/Walkin' After Midnight/, however, would have broader appeal than both of those, and you had me at Guy Ritchie. I'd like it especially if Hermione was a bit arrogant and standoffish, à la Cumberbatch's Sherlock. Without Harry at Hogwarts, it's likely that her time there would have ended up a little different.
