I recently reread Rogue's Bet linkffn(12240216) and I'm now really craving that kind of slice of life/coming of age story where there's no major, life ending crisis, but simple drama and some romance. Preferably stories that are either ongoing or completed! Thanks!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13247979/1/Three-Black-Birds]] - WBWL warning but if I recall correctly, this fic focused a lot more on romance/teenage drama than dealing with Voldemort. For example, Harry has a summer fling with an American.

  How would the wizarding world be different if Charlie had let his adventurous side take over a little early? A story where Charlie meets some muggles, Ron gets a work ethic, and all of the changes that happen as a result. I only have one pairing cemented, the rest will be up to how the story progresses.
