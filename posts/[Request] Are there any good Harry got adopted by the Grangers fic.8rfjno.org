And please don't let it be a fix-it fic or a type where Dumbledore is a “manipulative old coot”. Those kind of stories are way overused. Also no romances (That includes Harmony or Dramione. No expectations since it's likely I have already read it or something similar to it.)

I simply would like a story where Harry grows up in a loving muggle household and how that affect his choices.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): Dumbledore was very happy that Harry found Grangers to take him in, and he soon brought Tonkses in touch with them. Harry and Hermione grew up as siblings.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

**** Ron is not an important character, no bashing though.

In fact, Weasleys generally have a reduced role in this fic. Luna, Neville, Sirius, Remus, and Tonks are closer to Harry.
