Hello, I want to become a better writer but I consider my writing skills abysmal. When I read some stories I become captivated and won't stop reading until I'm satisfied. I want to be able to write like that but I have no clue where to start. If anyone can help me and direct me it would honestly be greatly appreciated!


** Read. See how others write. Write yourself. Practice. Post stuff to get feedback.

** Write. A lot. Get responses on what people think you can do better. As you start out, imitation will be somewhat common (hard to avoid when starting out).

Try to make things sound natural (especially dialogue). It helps to read it out to yourself afterward to see if it sounds like an actual conversation people would have. I've seen so many fanfics where the characters speak in a way no one would ever speak. Or else they act in a strange manner (such as immediately agree with something the MC says, when IRL people are much harder to move). Don't make huge text walls; line breaks make reading it feel less daunting.

More can doubtless be said, but you're just starting out, so you probably don't need to get good enough to write an engrossing epic just yet.

*** Reading dialog out loud is huge. If you're not British, watching a lot of British entertainment can help too. Listen closely to the rhythms along with the words. Watch shows with posh people, shows with not-so-posh people and the ones in between. Listen closely to the people around you as well, especially teenagers.

** Check out [[http://www.writingexcuses.com/][Writing Excuses]]. It's a podcast by 3 published authors about anything involving writing. It's a great way to learn many of the dos and don'ts, or just general tips on writing.

Apart from that, as anyone else will tell you, just keep writing. Don't write anything too long at first, otherwise you'll hate going back and reading the beginning to remind yourself of something that happened early on (too long in my mind is something that takes you years to write).

Remember, don't compare yourself to the greats when you're just starting out. Once upon a time, they probably had the same opinion of their writing skills as you do of yours now. Don't give up, and you'll get there eventually.

** Write.

Writing is like any other discipline. To improve at it you have to do it. It's no different than playing baseball or a musical instrument, or anything else.

** Try and spend a bit of time planning out motivations and working out what is important. Working out what matters should help you know if you need to write a lot or if perhaps you need to move a section on. Working out character motivations early will allow you to weave your plot and check that they behave as expected. Little is so jarring as characters going against their own interests simply because the author needed to. Immersion means choices make sense in the world you're writing. The more you understand a character's motivation the more in character they'll stay and the easier your story will be to plan. Working out what matters and what is important means you know when to add weight and detail. Does anyone care about the walk from the dorms to breakfast on a tuesday 3 weeks into term? Nope, don't bother using a thousand words to describe it. It will kill the pacing. The walk your protagonist has to make alone, to fight the final fight, that matters, you can build that, reflect on that, describe more because you're making it important.

** Like others have said, you should write yourself, no matter how abysmal it is on your first go-around. However, the only feedback I would encourage you to receive is that on grammar as the rules are somewhat set in stone for it. Feedback on your writing style is more difficult to pinpoint as every author has a different tone on which his/her story takes place. For example, many people don't like how Stephen King writes yet many do (myself included). His stories each have a different voice, distinguishing one from his many others. Your story should have its own voice, and since FanFiction tends to cater to a younger audience, the use of different voices should fly right over their heads and they may leave comments like, "This sucks!" or "You should learn how to write"! etc, etc.

** Don't repeatedly use "growled" after a character says something. Absolutely drives me nuts when used over and over again.
