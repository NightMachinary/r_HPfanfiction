I'm looking for a fanfiction where Harry is either the Heir of Slytherin, or Peverell.

I want it to actually mean something too. I don't want one of those fanfics where Harry goes to Gringotts and gets revealed to be the lord of several different houses, only for it never to be brought up again.

No slash.

  Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have a lot in common. Both of them are Half-bloods raised by abusive muggles. Both of them are Parselmouths. Both are sorted into the house of snakes. What sets them apart is that one had friends, true, loyal friends, and the other did not. The story of a cold and calculating Harry. Slytherin!Harry. Grey!Harry. OC is the son of Sirius. No slash

** A book I'm reading on Wattpad has it am I love the book even tho it's super wordy and a little repetitive at times. I have no idea how linking works so I'll just give you the name it's literally called Harry Potter gets smart and takes control so not the best name but it's great
