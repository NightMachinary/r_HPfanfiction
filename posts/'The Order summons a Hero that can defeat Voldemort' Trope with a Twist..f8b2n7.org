I wrote this after reading a post looking for a fic with this premise.

This is the first piece of fiction that I have posted. Any criticism or advice is welcome.

I have posted it on both Archive of Our Own and Fanfiction.

Hope you enjoy it.


** I enjoyed it. I assume that in the summoning universe, Mrs. Potter survived.

** Everytime I see a fic say they do something with a Twist where the 'Twist' has a capital letter, I keep desperately hoping they're making a Chubby Checker reference. Someday... :D

Adding your fic to my bookmark to-read list. I'll get to it ASAP.
