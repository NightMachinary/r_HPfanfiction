** Why would anyone possibly want to read this?? I mean, seriously: what's the point of Harry Potter if there's no magic? It would be completely unrecognizable from a standard highschool-story that are a dime a dozen.

*** Because of the characters. I would make 100% sure it was more British than the Queen. So you don't go to Highschool. You go to secondary school, you wear a uniform (yes a uniform), you smoke fags behind the bikeshed and play football at lunch. Also, did I mention the characters?

**** But their characterizations are very heavily intertwined with the existence of magic, to the point that separating the two makes no sense. I'll just go over some of the main people to demonstrate:

- Harry Potter's life is heavily determined by him being a wizard that lives with his magic-hating muggle family. There is also the whole "boy-who-lived" thing that influences how people treat him. Without any of that, he is just.. a kid. no magic, no prophecy, nothing special about him... he wouldn't be Harry at all.

- Hermione Granger is the muggleborn witch that tries to prove her best in a magical society that looks down on people like her. Without it she's just some dentist's daughter...

- Ron Weasly is the son of a pureblood wizarding family who stumbles with trying to understand what all the muggle-things his friends keep talking about mean. Without it he's just another random kid.

- Draco Malfoy is a pureblood supremacist that looks down on muggleborns and dabbles in dark magic. Without magic he's just (yet again) another random kid with nothing special about him or the way he interacts with the world....

The list just goes on and on. I just genuinely do not see how one could possibly separate the two.

EDIT: people seem to misunderstand this post: I'm not "judging" stories without magic, I'm just genuinely confused how they could possibly work. So don't downvote, but respond and try to explain what such a story would look like.

** I've not actually read the story, so I have no idea about the quality, or if it really is magic-less. But: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1497453/1/Dance][Dance!]]. AU Hogwarts is the most famous ballet school of Europe, and Hermione is proud to be part of its graduating class. But this year, the young prodigy Harry Potter, son of two ballet stars is coming to Hogwarts... This is a year everyone will remember.

Of course, I do believe this story was the inspiration for world [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/2/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners][#240]].

#+begin_quote
  An AU story set in a world with no magic. James and Lily were killed by Peter's deceit; Sirius imprisoned, Remus tortured for a long painful year. Now, they raise Harry. Sirius dates every girl that crosses his path and Remus concentrates on surviving one day to the next. It all changes when a red-headed cop trips into their lives. Will Remus see her love before it's too late?
