*** Start selling an actual cheese called Voldemort in muggle grocers after some right hand / left hand stuff to import it from some property you own in France. Be sure to get a recording of the reactions when the Taboo goes up.

Bonus: get it on the menu for prisoners in Azkaban without anyone knowing that's what it's being sold as among muggles. Then have a cheese platter delivered as soon as Tom cools down a bit from finding out about the Taboo problem.

** Part of the premise of the Pureblood Pretence series is that Voldemort was sane and switched to the political method of taking over the wizarding world. When the diary resurfaces, it is not happy and decides to take matters into its own hands.

I always thought that calling yourself "Lord Voldemort" was like reading a whole bunch of LOTR inspired high fantasy knock offs, looking at the "Dark Lords" who despite having legions at their command got knocked off by a teenager with an attitude and thinking "that guy there, I want to be him".

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

*** It is definitely interesting, reading through a story where Tom Riddle and Voldemort are related but distinct individuals.

The particularly ironic part is that the Diary was specifically created as a safeguard against the core Riddle becoming complacent and settling for doing half the job of reforming the world. Apparently his sixteen year old self never considered the possibility that he might change as he got older /for good reasons/, like gaining wisdom from experience.
