Preferably, a story told by someone who's sick and tired of playing mob character to Harry/the Golden Trio. Like "Daphne Greengrass, Side Character" in ao3 wherein the story still follows the plot but the side characters have their own life.


** linkffn(Latet Anguis in Herba)

Probably won't fulfill your "mob character" fix but this is a fantastic war series by one of the most underrated authors in all of fanfiction. Follows 4 OC Slytherins and their friends who get involved outside of the canon fray of events.

#+begin_quote
  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

*** Thanks! I recently read that one. It's my first Ginny-centric story. It helped to get me to see her in a better light.
