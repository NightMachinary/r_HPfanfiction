**** Hey look at this, linkffn(fate by thetruespartan) it's at the end of third year and has 2.5 MILLION words

I know the fics are long but usually 400k is my sweet spot for good fics, and I gotta say, elemental's power is easily in my top 5 fics, the seven years go by so quick it's surprising with how long it is.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.
