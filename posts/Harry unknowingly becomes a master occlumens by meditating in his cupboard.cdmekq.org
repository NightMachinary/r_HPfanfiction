(title) and then when Dumbledore tries to use it he unexpectedly encounters Harry's subconscious resistance


** linkffn(12740667) Has a similar premise. Harry becomes a master at Legilimency and by extension, Occlumency before he starts at Hogwarts. Dumbledore is immensely impressed.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

***** Nope. All forms of meditation involve being /aware/ of your thoughts. Whether it's by clearing them (aware of where your thoughts are coming from to quiet them), focusing on a specific action/chant/mantra (filling your thoughts with a specific idea), or just analyzing your own thought process. (Steven Universe's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHg50mdODFM]["Here Comes a Thought"]] is actually a really good representation of one form of this processes.)

Meditation is thinking about your own thinking. Which, if your mind is being probed/manipulated, recognizing that it's going to different places because you're familiar with how your mind works is a viable strategy for mental defense.
