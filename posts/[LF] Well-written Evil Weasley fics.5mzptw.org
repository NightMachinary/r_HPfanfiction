** Some people would probably argue that there's no such thing (evil Weaslys and low quality writing seem to have some correlation).

There's some fics that I've enjoyed with evil Weasleys, but I'm not sure there's any of them in which they are really very competent (people who write evil Weasleys usually don't like them very much and use every opportunity to mock them). It's an interesting question whether there is any Fic that includes Evil Weasleys as a semi-serious source of antagonism/conflict and not just as an excuse to kick them in the balls without feeling bad about it.

I'm going to watch this thread, sorry that I don't have anything substantial to add other than my ramblings...

*** Nah it's fine. I was actually thinking of writing a canon-compliant fic where Ron is a prodigy and does his own thing behind the scenes. I'm deciding what his motivations are, but I was interested in different characterizations of the Weasleys.

Just my 2 cents: Seems really dangerous in terms of target audience. Those who want to read Evil!Ron stories won't enjoy him being portrayed as competent and those that like Ron won't enjoy him being portrayed as evil.

It's like writing a Dumbledore bashing fic in which he mentors Harry and fosters a grandfather realtionship to him. Who would really want to read it?

***** I always wondered why people worry about audience in fanfiction. I mean, there is nothing to gain but imaginary Internet points and maybe, /maybe/ some internet fame, if your stuff is really hitting it off with people.

So why bother worrying about who would want to read it?

****** I'm not really an author, but I understand the appeal of recognition in academia when people actually read what you write. If you spent a lot of time and something and no one really cares is extremely unfulfilling. Honestly I think even a massive negative response is better than apathy (at least then people care enough to try to correct you).

I guess it's theoretically possible that there are some people who truly only write fanfics for their own enjoyment.. Maybe I'm way too shallow and cynical but I can't help but wonder why they even bother to publish it at all then. I just don't really buy that they are releasing it just out of pure altruism... At some level we all seek recognition of our peers.

******* Oh, I didn't mean to say that as an author who publishes you seek no recognition whatsoever. I'm just saying that there are a lot of authors out there who don't care if they have 10, 100 or 1000 reviews. Its enough that some people read it.

Because on the other side, if you only write/create for the audience, you'll eventually hate your own work. Take my own work for example. If I'd want to create for the audience, I wouldn't write what I do. If reviews are my only goal, I'd write a Lord Potter fic from some template (that I'm sure exists somewhere out there. There gotta be a reason why they all read like copypasta). I'd bash and I'd make it Harmony, or Harry/Draco slash or whatever else seems to lure in the reviews.

But I don't, because while I certainly do like recognition, my primary concern is that I can re-read what I wrote and like it myself.

***** I'd read a competent evil Ron, but the canon compliancy puts me off.

** The Closest to evil Weasley is The Red Knight due to fem!Harry and Hermione in this timeline are suspecting this Ron(Auror/Unspeakable) is their Ron(Antagonist) who they want dead before he gathers influence which this Ron seems to be doing.
