I'm looking for the relatively short story (I think it was like 7 chapters) about Voldemort's last killing curse slowly killing Harry after the battle is over. IIRC they bring in someone from the department of mysteries to try and cure him with new potions and near the end they bring Harry back to Hogwarts from the Burrow.

*** Hmm, this seems like the right one, must have misremembered it. Thanks!

  Complete. Sick!Harry. Voldemort was defeated in Harry's 6th year. Now in his 7th year, Harry struggles with PTSD. However, surviving the killing curse resulted in more damage to Harry's body than anyone could have suspected. He develops an incurable, unknown form of cancer that only very dark magic can cause. How will everyone deal with it? Deathfic. Trio-centric.
