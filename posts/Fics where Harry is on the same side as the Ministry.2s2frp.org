I've just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8914586/1/Harry-Potter-Junior-Inquisitor][Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitior]] and was wondering if there are any other fanfics where Harry either is on the side of the Ministry or at least appears to be. (Possibilities include meetings with Fudge or interviews with Rita Skeeter to let the public view him in a positive light).

Bonus points if it's during Harry's fifth year, I found Junior Inquisitor's take on Umbridge really refreshing (as opposed to the countless fanfics bashing her) and would like to see more fics where she and Harry are on the same side, even if it's just temporarily and not quite voluntarily.

(Also, I would prefer the connection to the ministry be more than just talks with Amelia Bones, but that would be fine too.)


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][Runemaster]] he collaborates with the ministry in the second half of the book.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

*** Is there bashing of any major characters?

**** Not that I remember. Some minor ribbing I suppose but nothing I would classify as a major "bashing" descriptor.
