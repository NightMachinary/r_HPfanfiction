I'm starting to see it more and more where Harry gives up Quidditch, or never tries out for the team, or just doesn't enjoy flying. I don't get it. Quidditch always seemed like a fun part of the wizarding world but so many authors just seem to disregard it.


** I enjoyed Quidditch in the novels, and in the first few fanfics I read. But after reading dozend of games of quidditch, it gets really boring to read about.

**** I guess it's just part of Harry's identity as we see it. If he came from the same background as canon (living with the dursleys), flying is often shown as a way of empowering him and giving him a sense of freedom he never had. A few of the good stories I've read have used it as part of his character development at Hogwarts as he grows more confident and out of his shell even though they didn't focus on the actual quidditch games very much in the story.

** I dont think people hate it. I think its simply there there is only so much you can do with Quidditch and its such a tiny part of the magical world in the grand scheme of things. Its an easy thing to "kill off" regardless of the reasoning and it usually doesn't detract from the story being told.

Now I am not saying Quidditch is not fun to explore. I recently asked for recommendations on such stories as I wanted to read them. But if your story is not heavily influenced by it, or focused on it, its an unnecessary component, and It doesnt shock or bother me if the author "kills it off".

*** As if you couldn't just leave it in and not describe a game if you aren't into it...you just need to tell the audience that a game has happened and who won (and what the score was) :)

Still, I agree most people just can't write quidditch well (I love the games when people describe it well, like say I've seen stories where Harry plays the 4th chaser to support the team till the snitch makes an appearance, same for some where there are more maneuvers than the Wronski Feint) and sometimes it really is better to leave it out than to bore the audience :D

** I mean, if it doesn't contribute to the story, don't include it right?

The games were fun in the books, since they contributed to the whole boarding school atmosphere. But that's not what a lot of authors necessarily want.

** I don't hate it in stories, but irl I think it'd get old because it's so hard to follow, with essentially two overlapping games being played at once, with the most interesting of those two games almost always meaning nothing. It seems more like a sport you'd like to play rather than one that's enjoyable to watch.

As far as authors disregarding it, it may be that they just find it difficult to write or that games don't add to their storyline, so they don't want to waste time on it.

**** It's definitely not as scripted xD

I would have to say that I definitely prefer when the rules are changed a little bit to make the game more competitive. You can tell that Rowling wasn't a sports designer in her free time. Even simple changes like making the snitch worth 50 points or 10% of their total score (which I remember 1 fic doing) makes the game a lot more interesting and worth reading. At other times, I have skipped the section altogether if nothing of import happens.

** Reading about Quidditch matches over and over again can get dull, so I imagine it can be the same writing it. Maybe they just want to stray away from canon. I, personally, would prefer it if Quidditch cut out the Seekers. They really throw the balance of the game off, and would instead just make it a time limit with the winner being most points scored. I'd actually make the Seekers into their own, separate sport, or a contest of skill and talent.

*** Yeah, seeker is the biggest problem, it is just insane how many points they earn. I think that it would be way more interesting if seeker just ended the game. No points. Then it would no longer be a race for the snitch, the opposing seeker would mostly be trying to stop you from catching it, in order to buy time for their team to come back.

**** I get Rowling wanted Quidditch to be unique, but the way she created the Seeker position was just super flawed. Not only do they end the game, they earn an obscene amount of points all at once. Quidditch is literally two games at once; the Chasers, Beaters and Keepers playing one, and the two Seekers playing another. The only time Harry really needed to pay attention to the other people was when he had to grab the Snitch only after they had scored a certain amount of points. Otherwise, he just kind of flies around on his own, doing whatever he wants before he sees the Snitch.

****** I've seen reinterpretations where in order to remain competitive in the meta the Seeker's position is essentially hybrid with Chaser, so they get involved with the action elsewhere often. It makes sense that teams which used this strategy would potentially outscore others by a very large margin, if you make the tweaks that Keeper is a very very difficult position and that finding the Snitch in less than ten minutes is essentially impossible.

******* sorry for necro, but I think it's more likely that the other team members would join the seeker, not seeker joining the team.

**** I did say it in a post above, but even tweaking the snitch a little bit helps improve the interest level of the games a lot. Either dropping the value of it to 50 points or less or making it worth say 10% of their total points gives the seeker much more to do rather than mindlessly searching for the snitch though whole game.

** As has been named, my main problem with the sport is how utterly broken it is. Bar extrems like Ireland/Bulgaria at the world cup, the seeker is the decisive factor in most plays. This means that it's for the absolute most part 2 beaters, 3 chasers and 1 goal on each side flying around uselessly waiting for the better/luckier seeker to do his/her thing...

As in most case the snitch hides itself like 80% of the time, the whole thing feels like a tedious wait for an underwhelming (to all but the seeker) conclusion.

Add to the fact that schoolplay obviously has no rule or qualms about equipment disparity, and you end up with a team where the kid in the most important position has rich sponsors (first "anonymous" with a nimbus 2000 and then the "anonymous then revealed" godfather) and the best equipment even pros can't always afford... I mean what? That's kinda game rigging from the start, and baring dementor rain or homicidal house elf you just kknow Harry has the skill and broom to catch the snitch so... team Harry is on = winner unless contrived plot point interfers.

That's not enjoyable or suspensfull.

Or something like that.

** At least a part of it comes from alternate character progression: there are stories where it simply is not fitting for Harry to end up on the Quidditch team, for one reason or another (“Seventh Horcrux”, for example, or “Almost a Squib”), and for as long as it does make sense for the character I do not see anything wrong with it happening. The other two parts are that the Quidditch matches are one of the more difficult things to write differently enough to make them enjoyable on the bajillionth repetition and thus some authors don't bother and instead handwave Harry not being on the team, and simply not liking the sport (or all sports) for one reason or another and deciding not to force themselves to write about something they don't like.

** Hate is probably too strong of a term for my opinion about quidditch. It's not like quidditch ever burned down my house or shot my dog or something.

I find the sport disinteresting for these reasons:

- It is difficult to consider it a sport when it's just people flying on brooms. I think the same of NASCAR or Formula One.

- The point values included are massively skewed, so much so that in my headcanon most quidditch matches look like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEZVGM1679s][this]] or [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-aiWqjVDxk][this]] until one seeker or the other notices and catches the snitch.

- There are apparently only six contests throughout the entire school year. That's less than one per month. There's no way players can remain sharp without actual competition on a regular basis.

- Only seven students out of a house of dozens get to play.

- The concept of a full time professional league in a population so small that it can't fill Hogwarts seems rather unlikely, given that such a population seems unlikely to sell enough tickets to make player payroll and pay for upkeep on the venue.

- There's no standardization of equipment, or standards for referees and enforcement of the rules.

** I've recently come to the conclusion that Hogwarts Quidditch is basically kiddie league sports, and that the snitch is adjusted to reflect that. You remember that one quidditch game that held the record for longest match? Something like three days. You can't play quidditch with a broom that physically can't catch up to the snitch, so it follows that either the players were incompetent or the snitch was legitimately harder to catch.

My headcanon is that the snitch has difficulty levels charmed into it. There's the training snitch, like the one James constantly played with, the amateur snitch, that Hogwarts uses for school games, and the professional level snitch, that is used for high level play.

Both Harry and Draco have brooms that are used for high level play; they can simply grab the amateur snitch easily because their equipment is not matched up with the difficulty level.

Put both of them in a professional setting, and I think it would get much more challenging for them.

** honestly, i dont mind fics where he doesnt play quidditch but i always thought flying was part of him.

imo there is not much you can do with quidditch unless you are willing to write your own game play by play, else it come down to copy paste book games and by that point you might as well just drop it.
