Fear not for I am not going to talk about his battle with Lord Voldemort in book 7 and the fact that he gambled everyone's lives on a shitty plan that should never have worked, nor am I going to talk about the fact that he launched a Disarming Charm, knowing full well that it would only work if they had brother wands, which they did not have since Lord Voldemort had the Elder Wand at that time.

Instead, I'll talk about the first DA meeting. I'll give you the quote:

#+begin_quote
  “Right,” said Harry, when she had sat down again, “shall we get practicing then? I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm. I know it's pretty basic but I've found it really useful ---” “Oh please,” said Zacharias Smith, rolling his eyes and folding his arms. “I don't think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against You-Know-Who, do you?” “I've used it against him,” said Harry quietly. “It saved my life last June.” Smith opened his mouth stupidly. The rest of the room was very quiet. “But if you think it's beneath you, you can leave,” Harry said.
#+end_quote

His argument that Disarming Charm saved his life and therefore is useful is irrelevant, seeing as any curse or charm would have done the same.

Because Harry and Lord Voldemort had brother wands. Something that the rest of DA did not have.

Now the purpose of DA was not to fight Lord Voldemort but to learn to defend themselves, in which case it is still not very useful since it's easy to counter.

So was he just stupid here? Or incredibly prideful?


** Neither. He was just trying to shut up Zacharias whose argument was shown to be incorrect given many present apparently couldn't do the charm properly. And how is the charm not useful? We are never told the charm is easy to counter (no easier than any other spell that the basic Shield Charm rebounds anyway), and when successful it renders nearly all wizard's powerless.

Aside from the upper echelon like Riddle and Dumbledore, almost no wizard can consciously do wandless magic, so it's pretty damn useful.

** He is stupid whenever the plot needs him to be, same with Dumbledore, Hermione, and Voldemort.

** Zacharias' example was stupid in the first place. /Nothing/ will save a student against Voldemort, they will only last as long as He found it amusing. It literally does not matter what Harry teaches the DA, because against Voldemort they are already dead. Instead, Harry uses it to assert his teaching authority over everyone else. The correlation of the facts "I've used it against him" and "I'm still alive" is a very powerful shutdown. So in this case he was neither stupid, nor prideful. Instead he was being charismatic.

Plus, Expelliarmus is both fast and effective, and it's one more spell being flung at the enemy. And everyone gets lucky occasionally.

** he's an idiot. He was TOLD there was gonna be a big difficult task and what does he do? he just mopes around and /attends class like a skrub/ until he finds out o dang its a dragon.

But it /is/ a useful spell - making someone suddenly throw whatever the crap they're holding. I would totally run around stealing people's sandwiches with it.

Huh, I guess it is useful.
