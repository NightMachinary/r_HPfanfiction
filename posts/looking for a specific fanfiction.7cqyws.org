hi everyone.

i'm searching for days for a specific lily potter/harry potter fanfiction. i read it a long time ago and i'm not able to find it again. it drives me crazy. and since this community helped me finding different storys in the past, i thought maybe this time its gonna work, too.

here are the cliffs:

the whole thing starts after book 5, eventually after book 6, I'm not sure anymore. lily potter comes back to life after sirius fall through the veil, but it needs some months until she finds harry, cause she couldnt remember her past for a long time and was just getting it back piece after piece lily lives with harry i grimauld place and the end of the book, also harry loses his memories, but gains them back piece for piece. novel length and finished. i'm not sure if written in german or english

please oversee my english skills, it's not my native language.

hope someone knows this one and can help.

thanks

nick


** From your description I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but it ticks a lot of the boxes.

  Harry knows now what he has to do. He's the only one who can. Everyone helps him out with the fulfilment of the prophecy, but he receives help from last person he would have ever expected, a relative long thought dead. AU DH
