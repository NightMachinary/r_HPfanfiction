/Almost nothing of what I remember was in the story. But [[/u/JennaSayquah][u/JennaSayquah]] somehow managed to figure it out./

Got reminded of this story by a prompt. It's not This Tournament Needs Better Security

4th year. Harry throws multiple names into the goblet of fire. Think it might have been crack fic, think it's a one-shot, or quite possibly a dream because I don't remember anything else about it and despite saving every story I read I haven't found it.


** Oh Got Not Again! has the Pentawizard Playoffs. linkffn(4536005)

There's another one though that has the goblet spitting names out for hours, including the ghosts and Fudge. Am thinking. May get back to you @.@

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
