** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1024910/1/Hinge-of-Fate][Hinge of Fate]] is my favorite involving pregnancy.

Summary: Hermione's memory is missing something, including the details on how she became pregnant. Snape would rather not remember.

Rated R

  Harry needs some time to let his guard down in the war. So he goes to a celebration just before he, Ron and Hermione plan to get Hufflepuff's Cup from Bellatrix Lestrange's vault. Who could have guessed what the consequences would be?
