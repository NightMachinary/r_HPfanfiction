** My super awesome fic Wastelands of Time has Harry as a 1,000-year-old immortal in his technically 15-year-old body smooching women both two/three years older than him and respectively about 980 years younger than him. It... doesn't /not/ work. Linkffn(4068153)

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
