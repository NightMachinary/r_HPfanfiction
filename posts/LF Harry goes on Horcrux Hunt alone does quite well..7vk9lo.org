Maybe he made a deal with Scrimgeour to get trace lifted and then left before Order could get to him. Went to Grimmauld Place made good with Kreacher and got locket, went to Hogwarts for snake fang and found Dobby who got him Diadem (maybe talk with Dumbledore), traded basilisk and maybe sword of Gryffindor with Goblins to get into Bellatrix's vault and get cup. Goes with Dobby and Kreacher to his parents graves where he eventually finds and kills Nagini. Voldemort shows up and tries to using killing curse on the House Elves and Harry reacts on instincts and shields them. The Elves apparate him back and he wakes up a new man. Final battle happens and...plot twist. Harry is losing against Voldemort till he is AK ed by Draco who exclaims he will be taking down Harry. Harry then disarms a boasting Draco and wins the day in a serious or comedic fashion................... But mostly looking for a Harry goes on Horcrux Hunt alone and does quite well. Thanks!

There's at least one or two more that I'm aware of, but I either don't have the link to them, or I consider them really bad.

  One decision changes everything. Chance rips Harry's boon companions from his side, and replaces them with a knight who's apparently immune to magic. Somehow, Harry thinks he's better off.

  After 'HBP', Harry finds a strange green mask in the trash, but even after everything he has witnessed since joining the wizarding world, he has no idea how his possession of such a seemingly simple artefact will affect the outcome of the final battle...
