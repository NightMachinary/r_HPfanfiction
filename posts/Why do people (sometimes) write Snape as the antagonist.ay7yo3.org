As in, why do they bash him so much that he becomes a spy for Voldemort instead of Dumbledore? We know he was a bitter and spiteful bully who joined 'the magical equivalent to the KKK'. We also know that he had an unhealthy obsession with his childhood crush... but why????? I don't like Snape; bash him all you want. But please, at least keep one of his recognizable traits.

Please????


** I don't really consider that idea bashing. To me, character bashing is just stripping of them of all positive traits and basically made into a punching bag for the protagonist. It does happen in these kinds of fics, but the idea itself is not bad. A Snape who maybe grows to resent Lily and becomes a spy who can fool Dumbledore and the rest of the Order is a smart and capable character. Some of his anger could have spilled over to Lily when she became close to the marauders. It's a pretty valid AU.

Because his reasons for being Albus' spy are utterly flimsy. If he decides that he hates Harry enough, it should be sufficient to tip him over to the other side.

** It's one of a few reasons

1.EXTREME Snape hate boner.Literally believing he was still a blood purist during the books,that he didn't love Lily,and that some of the utterly fucked things the marauders did to him we're justified.

2.Opposite portrayals.People often bash the Weasleys and act like they're homophobic,thieving,bullies.

3.Just wanting a different portrayal.Harry and his +harem/borderline sex slaves+ friends dunk on bigots/Dumbles/Goblins/Weasels with facts and logic for the 100,000th time gets boring.Fundamentally changing a single character can make for a completely different story while you can still use canon as a general outline.

** Until DH came out, the fandom was split 50/50 on Snape's true loyalties. I'm guessing you've come to HP after DH was already out so have only ever thought of Snape as definitely one of the good guys, but for people who have been part of the fandom since before the series ended, the possibility that Snape might actually be on Voldemort's side /is/ one of the core parts of his character. The series very deliberately kept it ambiguous until the last moment.

*** That's pretty much it. Indeed, up until the end of GoF, Snape /was/ the antagonist for most purposes, as up to that point, it was still a school story in the same vein Enid Blyton mined for several series of books (Mallory Towers being the only one I can remember off the cuff, this is stuff I read over forty years ago and haven't seen since.) In that context, the Evil Teacher /is/ the antagonist for the poor, put-upon pupils.

** It's not that unrealistic to think that he got over his attachment to Lily and took the easy way out. Some people would say it's about time.

** People turn Harry and Hermione and Ron and whoever else into sadistic psychopaths that make Death Eaters look like reasonable fellows.

In comparison to that, making Snape the antagonist is positively tame.

Off the top of my head, I'd say the main reason is simply that people really don't like Snape, and by making him a villain they get to treat him like a villain. It could also be people railing against the whitewashed fanon version of him, or the fact that Harry canonically named a son after him.

** The same reason why anyone writes characters OOC from their canon characters: for the drama and conflict.

We already know how the character dynamics work between canon Snape and Dumbledore, Snape and Sirius, Snape and Harry. So fanfiction authors try to mix up the characters to create a different flavor of interpersonal conflict, and in doing so, often neglect the outside circumstances that would make them become that way. It's either done out of laziness or lack of interest in worldbuilding.

Honestly, it only feels out of place because the author writes zero set-up to explain how Snape /became OOC/, where it wouldn't be weird at all had the story shown Eileen divorcing Tobias and re-marrying another wizard who helped shape Snape's upbringing and adult personality, as a soft-hearted woobie who holds in his tears until the moment the last class ends on Friday afternoon. Or as a rapist racist incel.
