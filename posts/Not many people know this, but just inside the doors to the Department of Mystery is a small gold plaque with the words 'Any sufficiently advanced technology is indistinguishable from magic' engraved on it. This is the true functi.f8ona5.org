** Croaker: "Do you understand what this means?"

Bode: "Sir?"

Croaker paused for a moment to let things sink in.

Bode: "Uh, erm. Wait." Croaker nodded encouragingly.

"What the actual fu--"

"Yes, Bode, all of this is based on logic."

"Everything?"

"Everything."

"That doesn't make any sense."

"It won't. Not at first."

"But how?"

Croaker sighed. "It's complicated."

"HOW?!"

"Okay! Okay! Well, there /is/ a god."

"What do you mean? Where are you going with this!?"

"I told you to relax. Okay. There is a god. She's really bad at math and continuity, but she tells a hell of a story. Self contained, of course."

"You're fucking kidding, mate."

"I wish. Actually, we can do more than wish. Come with me..."

** "We've got a live one!" The shout goes out. A Silence of Unspeakables materializes around the door to peer at the newest artifact. It is a thin metallic box. One side is riddled with ports and jacks and sockets. The other is painted with a moving picture.

"Oh," one says. "It's obviously magical. Muggle pictures don't move."

"It has to be science. It's got all those Elekktrikal parts on the back," his colleague insists.

Another offers, "Maybe it's both. Maybe someone's enchanted a muggle thing again. Where did we get this one? Did MUMA find it?" They all bicker, each feeling the need to give their knut's worth.

"Has anyone cast diagnostics, yet?" The project leader asks. When no one replies, she casts a Sonorous Charm on her throat and repeats the question.

The Silence falls into an embarrassed silence.

"Alright, then. Fawley, you start on the preliminaries. Monk, go fetch the Dynamism Spectrometer. Bode, ready the Scrutinization Chamber. The rest of you, shoo. You've got your own projects to work on."
