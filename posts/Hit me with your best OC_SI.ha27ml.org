So I just finished reading both (A Magical Awakening by Emperor Tippy) and (Umbrus Shade, The Incredibly Annoyed Ravenclaw by shadenight123) both are good, but the former I think is abandoned while the latter is complete. Just asking here if you can share to me those SI/OC fics that you find enjoyable. Thanks.

** Imo, the two best SIs in the fandom are What's her Name in Hufflepuff and Faith and the Devil.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff]]) has amazing worldbuilding, great humor and an interesting plot.

And Faith and Devil is by Tozette, but I can't seem to find a link right now.

***** It's been a while since I read it, can't recall details, but I think it was a combination of "hands-off" approach and not sharing intel with people that could act on it. Accio Butterflies is pretty much exactly how I'd handle an SI reincarnation into the Potterverse, though I'd probably have looked into more creatively lethal booby-traps for my shop.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** linkffn(Accio Butterflies) and linkffn(Ghost of Privet Drive) are both great. Neither of them have ridiculous wish-fulfillment SIs, though Ghost does edge in that direction at times, but both are /very/ well-written.

*** I've been diving into Ghost of Privet Drive and I'm absolutely floored at how quintessentially British the prose is. My usual standards for a fic being sufficiently British is if the characters remember to call their moms "mum" and say "bloody hell" a lot - it's quite refreshing to see a fic that so immerses itself in British dialect (note: I'm a Yank, so it may be an utter caricature and I'm as woefully ignorant as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron).

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI, no ships. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]
