So many times I get really into a Slytherin!Harry fic then have to drop it because of the mind numbing approach to how the house is ran with literal elections/someone being the Slytherin Queen or King.

Yet somehow this is all kept secret from the school at large and no one ever mocks the children pretending to have a court in the common room that can actually dole out punishment that the teachers respect. Like I once saw a fic where Draco was suspended for being a dick. By the students. They actually sent him home. Everyone was totally fine with it because Slytherin!

I just don't get it, am I just reading shit fics?


** Yeah, it's really frustrating because it'd be interesting to read if it was well executed. I'd like to read a good fic about them scheming and jockeying for power. They always seem to be junk. The main character just waltzes in and claims the title despite being a first year. The whole story talks about how clever, subtle, and manipulative the students are, but they're written to be stupid, clumsy, and heavy-handed.

Maybe someone will have a suggestion?

*** Exactly, it's that whole cliche of "show don't tell". Just saying something's clever doesn't make it so. An unofficial hierarchy would be really cool, something like the best seats being left or first pick of the common room area being taken by the more powerful people, then revenge taken subtlety of your wronged.

But instead I see all out duels for the special chair. I just don't get why that would be respected.

Totally agree about the first year thing too. Why would a 17 year old defer to some random 12 year old?

**** What you are describing sounds to me like the typical school cliques hierarchy. I'd be surprised if that sort of thing is not the norm in every house, with the Gryffindor Quidditch team having their own corner, "reserved" for them, Hermione having her own "book nook", and so on. I thought you meant the sort of Syltherin politics where 11 year olds act like machiavellian politicans, while anyone older doesn't play a role at all.

** I think that it's highly plausible for children in Slytherin to be a little more aware of social status and politics than children in other Houses and perhaps be a bit more calculating about their friendships, because children who think like that in the first place tend to be Sorted there, and the culture of the house would encourage these attitudes.

In that, I think fics like linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth) and linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) do it well. The protagonists (Harry and Hermione, respectively) early on find themselves in situations where their Houses (or at least their years) turn on them, and their friends-to-that-point not so much abandon them as stand back and see if the protagonists manage to claw back their status and standing.

But, a fic that has an actual Slytherin court system is almost guaranteed to be a shitfic.

On the third hand, a deliberate AU where /every/ House has some degree of self-governance, including bylaws voted on by the students and Prefects being elected, could work pretty well, and provide a sensible substrate for House politics.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

*** Ah. Yeah so I probably should have mentioned this but...that's the fic that pissed me off enough to post this...

Theres two main reasons. The first being that the "Slytherins don't tell other people" thing is total bs imo and would never fly in an actual bording school. People would notice the weird dynamic and probably mock it. The second is that they have literal royalty. Harry spends his days trying to become the King. Also if you look at my other comment ITT I mention the ridiculous duelling for position.

I really, really tried with that fic but it's just too much.

** More political fics tend to require a large cast, which is hard to pull off well. "King and queen" sort of theatrics work for me if a fic commits to it and the reader is kind of "in" on the hamminess. It sounds like the major issue is a lack of believable worldbuilding.

I'm reading [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327575][Devilish Delights, Wicked Ends]] (next gen, not Harry) right now, which pulls it off, with the ringleaders being perhaps ridiculous on one hand (mafias! triumvirates!) while also wielding real fear and power. Just like real politics. The other characters are apathetic and/or crazy in their own right and distinct, and they see the game, mock the game, but play the game. It's not my usual thing because I'm not a court politics person, but the author's great and I beta'd some of it :D It's on the verbose and talky end, which might not be to some's taste, and a little confusing initially, but it revs up after the setup.

** I'm a dramione reader so I'm not sure if I can be of any help. But the best examples of "Slytherin Politics" fics came from when our Slytherin character has something to hide. The stresses Draco undergoes while hiding his illicit affair and maintaining his status in Slytherin is really engrossing and entertaining. I've also noticed this in the few Drarry fics I've read, especially the accidental bond/mistaken bonding ones.
