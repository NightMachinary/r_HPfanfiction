So, I'm looking for fics where Harry is in denial about being the Master of Death, runs from being the MoD, or is otherwise trying to dispose of the Hallows and the whole situation. Bonus points if the Hallows keep finding him (read: hunting him down) and Death keeps following him the longer he fights it. As a corollary, he can also be running from weird shit associated with the position - eg. having dozens of Death Gods living in his head a la the fic linked at the bottom.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

  She is different. She is magic. And her life is unbelievably beyond normal - it's supernormal. Featuring: M-rating for language and violence, magic rituals, strange creatures, stranger deaths, some citrus, realistic character development, and a super slow burn.
