I've got a new idea for a fanfic that I've started to write.

It's got a cracky start that will get progressively darker, titled: Ritual Minded.

The premise is that harry slowly becomes addicted to the power in rituals and seeks so constantly improve himself using it,

Starting with small things like his eyesight, fixing his hair etc. then more and more things.

It's going to be based on a sacrifice basis, somewhat similar to how alchemy is taken (e.g. equivalent exchange) with a few twists.

Not sure if there is anything similar about?

Be warned, no bashing as such but there will be a large lack of good vibes towards hermione and how she talks to people.

Possibly going to be titled "There's a Ritual for That!"

Cheers guys

** A non-crack (at least from the author's perspective, I think) version of this is linkffn(For Love of Magic), where Harry keeps performing rituals on himself, sometimes to counteract the unexpected effects of an earlier ritual

*** I had the same thought, but the story jumps the tracks early on. Then the train plows through fields and villages to end up in some strange place nobody has gone before. Finally, the train turns around makes a full circle and ends up in a surprisingly predicable ending.

**** Yeah, that's why I said non-crack from the author's perspective. If you don't read the author's notes, I think it'd be believable that it's a crack fic XD

***** I'm actually thinking the author knows its a crack fic, but its written as if it isn't. Probably the strangest “buttoned down" fic I have read. It doesn't rank among my favorites, but its one I basically followed from Chapter 15 on.

*** That's why I was thinking more of keeping with "ritual minded" rather than "there's a ritual for that".

Appreciate the comment though, possibly something to look at once I've got the first few chapters flowing

** Thats like the fanfic “Too Young To Die” in the sense of the many, many rituals. But I bet it actually wouldn't be as awful if it was written as a crack comedy fic, also i really like the title “There's a Ritual For That!”

It's depressing but it's finished and all questions you might have had when reading are answered in the end.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

**** But the author cheapens just how powerful Voldemort and the Death Eaters are to an extent that halfway to crackfic land. Harry uses the same transfiguration techniques against them 3-4 times, and they fall victim to the same things again and again.

***** It's certainly a conundrum of giving them the right level of capability and intelligence while still being arrogant in their abilities. Following cannon, they were held off by a bunch of school kids despite the injuries the kids had. Some luck certainly and the prophecy orb played a part but still, not an easy balance to have. Certainly with Voldemort's abilities

****** Well, that's if you consider canon to be decent - which I don't. Rowling's works are full of plot holes.

In Book 5, we read the Voldemort and Dumbledore fight. Heck, even the useless movie got that part right. Someone who can literally shape the world around him - that's how powerful Riddle is, and he falls to a spell HP learns as a 12 year old. There's so much BS and Deus Ex Machina in the books as Rowling wrote them that it's very hard to say that they're good examples of writing fiction.

** First question that you need to address in something like this is, if such rituals are easily accessible to HP, then why doesn't everyone do them?

That's one of the easiest things to fall into - the premise that HP finds rituals that seemingly no one else bothers to do - especially Voldemort and the other powerful characters in the universe. If you can avoid that, it will make for interesting reading.
