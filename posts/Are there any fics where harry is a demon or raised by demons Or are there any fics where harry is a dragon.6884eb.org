Why are there so little of these kinds of fics, I mean, I would think someone has already had the idea of harry as like a demon king or something in that manner. Or fics where harry is a gigantic dragon, but then I search for them and I find no posts and no (good) fanfiction. I have probably only seen two fics that not only have harry as a dragon or demon, but also are written better than Linkffn(My Immortal), okay maybe that's too far but to be fair these fics are pretty bad. These fics are Linkffn(Breath of the Inferno) which does have ridiculously OP 11 year-olds and other disgusting tropes but tbh it's the best dragon harry fic I could find, the other fic is Linkffn(Do Unto Others) which has a badass demonhunter harry. Also can someone, anyone, please explain to me the shortage of demons and dragons on fanfiction?

Demons aren't part of the cosmology of the Potterverse; the closest that it comes is the island of Azkaban and the Dementors. JKR deliberately kept away from any association with devils and pacts with extraplanar creatures so as to avoid being associated with or needing to implicitly make commentary on real-life religion.

Dragon-powers would just be over-powered, and most fanfiction writers are at least aware of the idea of Mary-Sues and wish to avoid being labelled as writing one. Also, there aren't a whole lot of love stories out there about girls and their dragons, no doubt because dragons are all scaly and massive. Not cuddly like big dog-men or sexy like beautiful, eternally-young, misunderstood goths.

That said, have some fun with linkffn(Enter the Dragon by doghead thirteen)

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

Hmm, you know how The Accidental Animagus and a few other fics start with Harry making a wish?

Maybe there's a fic out there where Harry sees Pete's Dragon on the TV, and wishes he could be an invisible dragon so the Dursleys wouldn't bother him. And ~poof!~, he's a dragon!

** [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter__trashed/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond]] is a OP-as-fuck Harry-soulbond-Hermione where his animagus form is a dragon. It also has insane amounts of Weasley bashing and about as much conflict as a wet paper bag. It's well /written/, but about as suspenseful as Tom and Jerry. I enjoyed the setting, if nothing else.

*** Also you can tell a woman wrote it all of the men are either bi gay or effeminate even harry. Not that thats a bad thing or something only girls do i enjoyed the hell out of it. But it is a nitpick i have with the story their were times in the story where i legitametly scoffed because a guy wouldnt do what someone im the story did. And im sure its the same way with females written by men.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6616730/1/Brought-to-Order][Brought to Order]], written by Lady Salazar. is an origin story for Nero, Harry is captured by the [[http://devilmaycry.wikia.com/wiki/Order_of_the_Sword][Order of the Sword]] as they need [[/spoiler][Dante so the Savior can be brought to life]]. unfortunately, Dante is not available. hence, the back-up plan involves Harry. so as I've said, Harry is captured. and tortured by the Order until he loses the memories of /being/ Harry and all that's left is Nero.

That's all I'm going to say.
