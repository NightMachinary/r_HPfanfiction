**** Is it this one? linkffn(Blurring Reality by Terrific Lunacy) Because while it sounds completely ridiculous I actually found it to be amazing and not what I expected to be at all. I started reading it once because of how silly the premise sounded but I could not stop reading once I started. It's more of a psychological thriller thats similar to the movie Black Swan than any normal modern AU fic I have ever seen.

The story has a supernatural element to it with characters slowly losing their sense of reality and understanding of which world they are in (real world with no magic or the characters in the play that they are performing). The dialogue is great and the way everyone is written is so in character. The performance dance scenes are very well written with some seriously intense and suspenseful action scenes that mirror canon in a unique way. It has this subtle meta commentary on canon going on which is very entertaining. It is sadly incomplete though.

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.

** After years of fanfiction, I think I have read everything (from alive Potter, to good guy Voldemort to James Potter secret Death Eater).

Individually, I think anything can be changed. But it would probably be best to not change too much (sometimes, I feel the only reason a fic is classed as "fanfiction" is because the characters are called Harry, Ron or Draco . . .)

** It depends on the individual work, but I generally dislike characters being too distant from their canon selves in terms of base personality and ability. I can accept a different background would shift loyalties or confidence levels or whatever, so long as it's logical. I imagine Neville would have been quite different had his parents raised him, for example. But if he starts throwing around the word mudblood, performing dark rituals, stomping on plants etc. without a very good reason, I'm out. This is one of the reasons I so dislike Cursed Child. There is no reality in which Cedric as he was established would ever become a Death Eater, especially not for so stupid a reason.

OP Harry in particular is also a real pet peeve. He has enough of the shinies already.

  the author introduces AU elements and canon events still happen
#+end_quote

Or, sometimes, the author has a specific recognised source of divergence, eg Harry met a different family at King's Cross station, but then other things change just because they felt like it, eg the Triwizard tasks are completely different. It's fine to explore the ripples that can spread out from a single stone, and it's fine to just push the boundaries of what you can do in a fantasy world, but they're two different stories, and mixing them usually doesn't work.

So the elements of canon that must remain inviolate are /whatever the premise of the story implied would remain inviolate/.

** Anything's possible (though I greatly dislike no-magic AUs, even they can be done well), but there are ways to change canon that are /rarely/ done well, and so functional turn-offs even if in theory I could see a fic where I didn't mind them. For example, inborn power-levels not related to skill; it's not that you couldn't build a decent AU with this idea, it's that usually it's just thrown in to justify some characters being inordinately dangerous, without it impacting the rest of the world very much.

** The original personalities and physical descriptions. Like, I'm all for a great character arc, or even adding layers to a character's motivations and temperament, but don't drastically alter someone to the point they're unrecognizable.

SSHG is my OTP, but I will exit out of a fic that makes Snape a romantic softy or Hermione not a bossy know-it-all. Exaggerating features is one thing, but eliminating them is another. If you want Snape to be a romantic softy, SHOW ME in a believable way how he becomes one from the hard and bitter shell he started as.
