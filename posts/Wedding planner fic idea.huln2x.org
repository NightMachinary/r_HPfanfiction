I've had this idea for ages because I really like going to those big manors or castles on holiday that you can take tours on and rich people rent them as venues. What about a muggle AU fic where Malfoy Manor is one of those places and Ron and Hermione are looking for their wedding venue, Harry is with them cos he's their bff and best man. Draco is the one showing them the manor, with its beautifully kept gardens, the family own the meadows and forests, theres a huge rose garden indoor conservatory and ballrooms and on and on- it would be very expensive but a lot of their rich friends are chipping in as a wedding gift maybe?

Idk what the plot would be really, maybe some drarry or ronmione stuff, or just focusing on the hectic wedding planning drama.

Maybe Draco isn't the one that usually sells it, so when he has to work with Harry and the soon-to-be-weds to sort out their wedding instead of his more communicative and capable wife Astoria, he isn't the greatest help. Then at last Astoria comes back from her business trip and it's finally smooth sailing because Astoria is a very good and very expensive events manager (but she gives them a little discount for having to deal with her husband).

I want to write this at some point but I likely won't anytime soon. Do you guys have any suggestions for plot points?


** I don't have any plot point idea, but do you plan to place your story in the "canon" universe or in an AU? Because I'm pretty sure that Malfoy Manor would be the last place on Earth where Ron and Hermione would want to marry, considering the whole "Been tortured by Death Eater and almost died there" thing. Though I admit it could also be the occasion to have a funny scene from Dean and especially Luna (them mentioning off hand how they already went there during a conversation as an example).

Maybe the story could take place in an AU where the war never happened, or at least differently so the guests of honor don't suffer from PTSD during the wedding. Or if in the canon universe, having Draco showing them a different place (the Greengrass residence maybe, they are supposed to be "close" to the Malfoy so could also have an impressive estate).

*** Like I said, in a muggle au.

So the book's plots are not used, the Malfoys and their Manor have no pre-existing relation to the other characters. Maybe someone went there on holiday and suggested it as a venue to the Granger-Weasleys, or maybe Hermione found it on Google.

*** Now that I think of it, I'd happily attend a wedding planned by Luna.
