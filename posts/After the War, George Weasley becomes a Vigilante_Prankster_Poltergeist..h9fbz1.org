A grieving George, disillusioned with life after the war, tries to cope the only way he knows: by playing pranks on every Slytherin he's played against in Quidditch, every Slytherin he's had a class with in Hogwarts, and of course, Zacharias Smith. Particularly unfortunate are people like Malfoy, Smith, Flint, Warrington and Montague who don't seem to be able to catch a break. Whenever they try to get some shopping done or bring a date to Fortescue's in Diagon Alley, alarming things tend to happen to them, like vast quantities of hair suddenly growing out of their privates, their hands suddenly being glued to tabletops or inexplicable urges to tap dance and sing loudly in Mermish.

It doesn't take long for people like Harry, Ron and Kingsley to realize what he's up to, but they aren't particularly keen to make him stop. Oliver Wood finds out what he's up to and starts helping him enthusiastically.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
