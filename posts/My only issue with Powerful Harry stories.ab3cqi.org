For me, it breaks my suspension of disbelief when Harry is powerful enough to stand against the likes of Voldemort or Dumbledore on his own in 1-v-1 combat. I say this because Voldemort spent decades travelling the world, learning the darkest of magics, and Dumbledore is recognized as one of the greatest wizards to have ever lived.

Harry Potter, no matter how many hours he spends reading Hogwarts library books or being trained, can't match the amount of time that Voldemort and the likes have put in. Their sheer experience and breadth of knowledge would always outweigh a school boy, destiny or no, in my opinion.

Other than that, I like power fantasy stories pretty well.


** True, but Elphias Doge mentions in his article(?) that Dumbledore had established himself as the most talented student Hogwarts had seen in decades a few months into his first year. Griselda Marchbanks says that Dumbledore did things in his OWLs that she didn't think was possible with a wand. And we all know that Voldemort was ridiculously talented.

Making Harry equal to Voldemort or Dumbledore as they were in their school years is not bad, as long as the author ensures that Dumbledore is still in another universe as far as skill and magic goes. That is, while the regular wizard won't last 10 seconds against Dumbledore in a straight up fight (it takes Albus roughly 10 seconds to subdue all the Death Eaters in OoTP), make a 14-15 year old Harry last for half a minute. Or even a minute.

Also, while hard work and discipline can do a lot, it won't just cut it with pure genius. Authors writing Voldemort'sEqual!Harry need to stop with the bookshopping scenes and the library scenes.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

***** Cool, thanks. I'm up to date on The Merging, but, while it's a great fic, I don't consider it to have the same, I don't know, direction, I guess, of the three i mentioned before. HP&tBWL, The Mind Arts, and Victoria Potter all have more of a focus on magic as a whole and Harry's exploration into its different facets, I think. Voldemort isn't the driving factor, whereas in The Merging it's all driven by training, horcrux hunting, Voldemort fighting, etc. It's got a different tone to it, but I like all of em. I just love it when a fic expands on magic as a whole.

Thanks for the other rec again, I'll give it a whirl!

*** You are talking as if they didn't develop at all from their school years.

Saying that Harry has feats similar to them when they are their age isn't a good point to argue them being equal despite a difference of 50+ years ( and more in the case of Dumbledore).

And you are discounting combat experience and spell knowledge entirely, things that you only acquire through practice.

**** Read my comment again. Harry, or anyone who the author writes as Voldemort's equal lasting half a minute against Albus does not make that character Albus' equal. Or Voldemort's.

It means that they have the potential to be equal. Having the potential to be as powerful as Albus or Tom in the future does not mean the character is as powerful as they are right this second.

As far as I know, only one fic I've read has ever explored this, but it was a bad smut fic.

** To play a bit of devil's advocate for a minute, people /REALLY/ overvalue the importance of experience over raw natural talent.

Case in point: Just compare Voldemort and Dumbledore. Remember that Voldemort was born in 1926 whereas Dumbledore was born in 1881, an age age of 45 years. Why is this so important? Because the age gap between Harry and Voldemort is 54 years. Let that sink in: The experience gap between Voldemort and Dumbledore is almost as big as the gap between Harry and Voldemort, yet despite Dumbledore having such experiences, Voldemort managed to massively close the gap between them. Meaning that if Voldemort can rival Dumbledore pretty well despite being 45 years younger than him, then its not that impossible for Harry to be Voldemort's rival while being 54 years younger than Voldemort.

Meaning that when Riddle was unleashing the Basilisk in 1943 as a 16-year old, Dumbledore was 62-years old by comparison. Also, when Voldemort applied for the position of DADA Professor for the second time (i.e. when he cursed the position), he would have been 29-years old. By this point, Voldemort had been establishing the early Death Eaters (Dumbledore mentions about five of them by name in their interview), had made all of his Horcruxes except for Harry and Nagini, and cursed the DADA position.

By the time of the First Wizarding War in 1970, Voldemort would have been 44 years old. By comparison, Dumbledore was 89 years old. Again, Voldemort was Dumbledore's main rival despite being 45 years younger than him, and that the age gap between Voldemort and Dumbledore is roughly comparable to the age gap between Harry and Voldemort.

What this means is that Voldemort, while less talented than Dumbledore, managed to rival him /despite/ having 45-years less experience than him. By proxy, this actually proves how utterly incompetent canon Harry is by comparison when compared to the younger adults. The age gap between Harry and Snape (or the Marauders and Lily) is a mere 20 years, yet Harry can't even close the gap between himself and Hermione, let alone Snape (or the Marauders and Lily). To a lesser extent, Snape managed to surpass the likes of Slughorn and McGonagall... despite the fact that McGonagall is 25 years older than him (McGonagall being born in 1935), and that Slughorn is /at bare minimum/ over 40 years older than him (assuming Slughorn was born around the 1910s at his very youngest, since he likely taught at Hogwarts for 5-10 years before Riddle asked him about Horcruxes).

Snape aside, my actual point is that if Snape can surpass McGonagall or Slughorn despite those two being significantly older than him (25 and 40-50 years older than him respectively), then a powerful Harry surpassing the likes of canon Snape/McGonagall/Slughorn/Sirius/Bellatrix makes logically sense. *Furthermore, there is nothing wrong with Harry surpassing someone like McGonagall since the age gap between Harry and McGonagall is 45 years, making the Harry-McGonagall age gap equal to the Voldemort-Dumbledore age gap.* Logically, why would a powerful Harry rivalling Voldemort be considered bad writing? Nobody mentions Voldemort rivalling Dumbledore consistently in canon despite the age gap between them being almost as wide as the gap between Harry and Voldemort.

*TL;DR: The age gap between Harry and Voldemort (54 years) is almost as big as the gap between Voldemort and Dumbledore (45 years). If Voldemort can rival Dumbledore despite the fact Dumbledore has 45 years of experience more than him, then its not really that absurd for a powerful Harry to rival Voldemort in a similar fashion despite being 54 years younger.*

*** This assumes that the benefit of experience is linear in time, but in reality, there would be diminishing returns. Once one has mastered all of the best spells and techniques, drilled them to the limits of one's cognitive and physical abilities, and got to practice them against powerful opponents, another 40 years' head start will just make one older.

** If you look at the Dumbledore vs. Voldemort duel in OotP, neither of them use any magic which cannot be learnt at Hogwarts, with the possible exception of Dumbledore's unknown "stunning" spell.

The power of wizards like Voldemort and Dumbledore doesn't come from knowing more spells than the other guy. It comes from having a deeper understanding of the same magic that is available to every wizard. By the time Albus Dumbledore graduated Hogwarts, he was probably 95% of the way to being the Albus Dumbledore we know in terms of magical abilities.

Yes, over the years you can add additional obscure items to your magical repertoire, some of which may be combat relevant. But you're more or less the complete package already by the time you leave school.

So if you've depicted Harry as a magical genius in the same weight class as Voldemort, then I have no problem with Harry being able to hold his own against Voldemort by the time he is 18. Just as I have no problem with an 18 year old Voldemort being able to hold his own against a 60 year old Dumbledore.

The key to maintaining tension is to remember that being in the same weight class/being able to hold your own does not mean you can win. Dumbledore was in the same weight class as Voldemort but couldn't beat him in a duel. This is why I took pains in The One He Feared to have Harry lose a duel to Voldemort fairly early on, even though he now had all of Dumbledore's magical abilities. Victory against Voldemort cannot come through strength of arms, because within the top weight class, Voldemort is the top of the class.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** I'd recommend linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat). Harry has access to an unprecedented ability that no one else does and once he fully understands it, he becomes quite literally unstoppable.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
