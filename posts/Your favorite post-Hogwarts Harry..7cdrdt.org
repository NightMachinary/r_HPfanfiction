What is your favorite thing for Harry to be doing post-Hogwarts?

The most common one is becoming an Auror, probably. Joining a professional quidditch team happens frequently. Sometimes travelling, sometimes teaching.

Personally, I like the idea of Harry being Head Auror or Director of the DMLE, but I really /don't/ like the idea of Harry finishing the war and becoming a rank and file Auror.

Quidditch player is kind of cool, but that just means he isn't becoming a better wizard.

I think my favorite is for him to travel and learn a lot of stuff, come back and maybe fast track himself through Aurors or maybe teach.


** I love the idea of Harry becoming an independent problem-solver for hire. Something like a mix between a mercenary & a private investigator. He'd lend out his services to both individuals and institutions.

So you might have a foreign ministry wanting help against a dark wizard (which he'd charge through the roof for), or the British ministry hiring him to show up at a ball and raise the event's prestige (payment in favors?), or an elderly witch might hire him to locate her pet kneazle (for which Harry would only ask a few knuts, being of chaotic good alignment).

Of course all this assumes that Harry has kept sharpening his skills and no longer relies on deus ex machina solutions.

*** I like that idea a lot actually, but I've never read a fic where he does this before.

Except, maybe technically linkffn(4655545). I'll have to check out the fic you linked.

I kind of doubt Harry would attend publicity events for money. He might occasionally get suckered into doing silly things like looking for a pet though.

**** If there was an adjustment Harry would have /had/ to make after Hogwarts, that'd have been adjusting to his fame - which, afterall, he rightfully earned this time around. I doubt he'd ever be comfortable with it, but I can see some acceptance and settling into it. Otherwise, his stay in the wizardring world would be nigh-impossible to endure.

#+end_quote

Not money, influence. Say, for example, some mid-level bureaucrat has set up this event and asks for his participation. Harry accepts, with the understanding that the bureaucrat owes him a small favor, that Harry may or may not cash in, in the future.

Essentially, I see Harry doing these things as a precaution. If he's not working with the ministry directly, he has to build relationships with various workers and departments so that he, /a/)can make his own work easier, /b/)keep an ear open for interesting knowledge, /c/)maintain a reputation of willingness to work with the ministry and /d/)watching his own ass. The ministry has proven before how easily it can turn against him, so I can see Harry manuevering to maintain some degree of safety in the knowledge of its workings and underlings. A spider web of safety, if you will.

** I personally like the idea of Harry being a Professor, he was great teaching when he had Dumbledore's Army and even had students actually learn the patronus charm which is suppose to be a powerful and difficult spell. So I just think that Harry would be a great teacher.
