** This is like every single time travel fic. It's a very common trope. It would be harder to find fics that DON'T stick to cannon.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.
