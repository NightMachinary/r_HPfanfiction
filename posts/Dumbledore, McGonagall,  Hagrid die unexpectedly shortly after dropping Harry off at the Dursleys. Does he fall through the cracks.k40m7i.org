As far as I can remember, the only people who knew the location of Harry Potter as a baby were Dumbledore, McGonagall, & Hagrid, all of who were there when he was dropped off.

Ms. Figg doesn't appear to be "installed" by Dumbledore as a neighbor, or at the very least informed, until later. Sirius Black doesn't know as he hands the child off to Hagrid and ends up in Prison. And no other characters appear to be informed in any way even going into his school years. Therefore, the ONLY thing I can see showing his location, would be anything Dumbledore charmed (and I doubt any of it would work for anyone but him), and the "book of names" at Hogwarts which wouldn't show him until school age, and even then may require intervention on the headmaster/mistress or deputy headmaster/mistress in order to track them down if a response is not given. Surely the situation where the letters flooded Harry Potter and the Dursley's locations is something that is abnormal and perhaps triggered by Dumbledore himself.

And with the blood wards in place, it seems unlikely most people (apart from the truly innocent minded) would be able to track him down and that would still take significant work and perhaps luck and require muggle knowledge.

--------------

So the questions (and prompt if you want it) is this:

Does Harry Potter fall through the cracks if the 3 who knew his location die suddenly early on before revealing or passing on his location to anyone else?

Would the book of names situation catch him if someone else (perhaps far less known) was at the helm of the school?

What happens to Harry Potter if he DOES fall through the cracks considering his magic was starting to showcase itself?

How would the situation develop in your mind?


** Possible points of contact (time)| Reason:

1. Hogwarts letter (usual time)| It /seems/ to have come automatically in canon.
2. Snape (after sorting of 1991) | Oath to protect Lily's son, knowledge of the Mundane (even if he doesn't end up as Potions Master, he probably will check on Harry, especially if he doesn't show up at Hogwarts).
3. Sirius (same as first canon meeting if not butterflied away)| He /does/ find Harry as Padfoot with seemingly little trouble. It is conceivable that he would be questioned (and thereby be motivated to seek out Harry) if he doesn't appear when expected.
4. Voldemort (After end of Years 1, 2, or 4 if the respective plots are not thwarted) | Wants to kill Harry, but /if/ the wards prevent attack or precise finding (after all, in book 7, they seem to have known at least the general area to wait in), he will probably be forced to wait for Harry to turn 17 or leave the protected area.

In case 1 we can have anything from "almost canon, as long as someone figures out the Horcruxes" to "arbitrarily butterflied AU"

Case 2 lends itself to Severitus

​

Case 3 is a standardish lead-in towards Lord Padfoot fics

​

Case 4 easily goes into Bad Future fics

*** The letter certainly comes automatically. 1 letter. The question is, is it normal to be spammed with them if you don't answer (I think not personally). And what happens if a letter is ignored?

The question with Snape is would he be affected by the blood wards and in what way. I would question how they would react even with his intent because of how that intent came to be. There is also the question of if he stays around with Dumbledore gone.

Sirius does find Harry but that is after Harry has gone back to school and after he has been trying to find Peter via the Weasleys so he may have come across information which may not exist in my scenario. Hell he may not even break out in the first place in the scenario I laid out since its predicated on Harry going back to school in a way.

Voldemort is a big ? without Harry in the picture in the traditional way. It is interesting to think about how he would be affected.

**** The first two paragraphs are good questions, could go whichever way one wants for the story, really without contradicting a shred of the underlying canon.

​

Sirius finds Harry at least /near/ Privet drive - he's the big black dog Harry runs into after fleeing Number 4 with his trunk after blowing up Marge. It is not entirely clear how far away from Number 4 Harry was, or how far the blood ward's influence extends, so one could understand this as either "the wards successfully prevented Sirius from finding Number 4, and he was prowling around the border of the ward" or "Sirius successfully entered the wards".

In the former case, the wards do /not/ sense intent, and they just blanket-repel all magicals, or something like that.

I suspect it is the latter case, because Sirius later tells Harry that he had come by Privet Drive to check on him on his way to Hogwarts to get Peter, and he doesn't remark on being unable to enter or find him... It is possible he was being prevented and Sirius didn't realize that for any number of reasons.

Indeed. Without Dumbledore, the Philosopher's Stone probably doesn't end up at Hogwarts, so that might be closed off. Bertha Jorkins' Albanian trip and Crouch Jr. escaping probably still happen, and Voldie says he fled back to the same place after losing Quirrel, so blood, bone, and flesh probably still happens, just with a different Enemy. Year 2 could still happen, and without a Parselmouth to enter the CoS...

** Depending on how manipulative your notion of Dumbledore is, I would say Harry's life would be similar to or better than canon until the 1st letter came. As far as we know, no one came to check on Harry and Mrs Figg was not exactly effectual. So if Dumbledore used active magic to keep him at the Dursleys, without him, any complaints made to Child Welfare might actually stick. But that's a hard version.

Assuming the contact letter is automated, he should still get one. I like the notion of the new deputy seeing the address and getting upset (Cupboard Under the Stairs), but there's a good chance they aren't looking after 10 years. Now, the name "Harry Potter" will still carry weight so as soon as someone realizes he hasn't answered, I should think he would get a personal visit from the deputy. No shower of letters, though. Once at Hogwarts, I feel as though most of his canon adventures wouldn't happen; 1st year, Quirrel might get hired (which could still be very dangerous for Harry), but no Mirror of Erised, no Philosopher's Stone, probably no troll. Invisibility cloak potentially lost unless Dumbledore labeled it as a Potter possession. Hard to say about Snape's attitude or if he'd be friends with Hermione. No Quidditch yet either.

Of course, if second year starts out the same, it would probably end a hell of a lot darker. Harry dead or obliviated if Lockhart was still hired; Ginny dead; a young Voldemort resurrected. (I'm sure there is a way to spin it happier though)

Going back to the letters... if no one realizes what's going on with Harry and he ends up staying at the Dursleys, then I posit him eventually running away and living on the streets. Tracking accidental magic seems very hit and miss but if his was cloaked by something Dumbledore did, he'll get sensed by the Ministry as soon as he's away from Privet or never. On the streets, he's either a victim or a survivor, and we'd all prefer tales of the latter. He'll probably never learn about Hogwarts until his kid gets a letter (assuming he has any).

  “We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging other than Harry Potter,” said Madam Bones at once. *“That situation has always been closely monitored, given . . . given past events.”*
#+end_quote

The Ministry of Magic knows where he is and given "always" it seems they've been monitoring since November of '81. Even still, if he'd been performing magic in the general vicinity without Dumbledore's protection for 11 years they'd find him with ease and probably take him.

*** I thought about that quote but the problem with it is its utter lack of clarity. First off, we know that even if the Ministry knows hes in Little Whinging, they don't know exactly where he lives. Secondly, that quote is made deep into the "school years", so we don't know the timeline on the "close monitoring" she speaks of, nor the full implications of what "past events" means.

Its easy to jump to the conclusion that they have been monitoring since day 1, but at the same time that seems to go against the idea that Dumbledore was hiding him away behind (illegal mind you) blood wards from the Wizarding world itself and factoring in that the Ministry was clearly compromised... well it just seems odd the Ministry would be as aware pre-schooling as that quote seems to imply.

Harry performs accidental magic at school and every school knows their students' addresses. But if Harry is performing accidental magic inside the house, they ought to know that, too.

** I would ask another question: Does it matter if no one knows where he lives? On the one hand, the address on the letter appears to be magical -- no one could have known that Harry lived in the boxroom under the stairs, or the address of the hotel in Cokeworth. And on the other hand, clearly letters from Hogwarts can reach him at Privet Drive. So the progress of events would be thus; Harry gets a Hogwarts letter, whoever is in charge of the registration eventually realises there is no answer and resends the letter, and since the letter addresses itself, they know the address, too, and can deliver it by hand.

Ultimately, nothing else but what happens in Canon where Hagrid figures out where "Hut-on-the-rock" is using only the letter. So I don't think he'd fall through the cracks.

*Edit:* And of course, there's always the Muggleborn angle. No one knows where they live either, so there is a way to figure that out -- in the most simple case the self-addressing letter from above.

** To me, This depends on how soon they die. We know Harry performed Accidental Magic while in Primary school. Asumming Dumbledore didn't have time to do anything, then in theory the Ministry would know where Harry is the moment the 1st bit of magic happens in a public area. Such as the "Wig turned blue" incident, or that time Harry apparated to a Roof.

I say "in theory" because it depends on who shows up to investigave the incident. If a former death eater is the one who shows up at say, the school, then chances are the Ministry won't know about it. Same goes for a former OotP member, only for the opposite reason.

Now, if the Ministry does find out where Harry is, chances are he gets removed from the Dursleys. Dumbledore issn't alive to fight this decision. The Ministry will want 'The boy who llived' to be part of their society asap, since it's, you know, safe.

But this only covers some of what could happen while Harry is at Primary School. Harry could leave the Dursleys sooner than this.

*** Ah very true. I didn't consider the fact that Dumbledore could have been supressing any accidental magic incidents. Then again as you pointed out, we don't necessarily know how aware the Ministry is (ignoring outside interference for good or bad).

Of course then the question is, if accidental magic is detected and followed up on, I would assume it would have to happen outside the blood wards or they may not be able to find Harry. Not sure though...

**** Yes, it would have to be magic done outside the house. This is why I focused on the school. And why I mentioned a public area.

A kind of perfect scenario for me here would involve Remus actively looking for and finding Harry. Then "kidnap" him without anyone being any the wiser until 91 when he shows up at Hogwarts, or better yet when he doesn't.

** This is really fascinating to think about.

First of all, we'd have to assume how they died. Dumbledore you could write from old age. But what about McGonagall and Hagrid? How do they die?

Hagrid, maybe from a potential too dangerous creature, finally got the best of him. McGonagall? Mhm... not sure to make enough sense.

It seems to be widely assumed that names are put in the book at birth. So, I'd assume that Harry would get a letter to Hogwarts when it's time to get one.

Now: A lot would change. With no Dumbledore, Quirrel might not get hired, there'd be no troll, no stone, etc.

Second year could be a lot darker: Ginny could be dead, a Teenage Voldemort could be around, more students could be dead instead of petrified.

Third year: Does Sirius escape? Sirius only escapes because he saw the newspaper and noticed Pettigrew's rat form. If the Weasley's don't go to Egypt, Sirius might not escape. Or he might say screw it and escape way earlier or way later then in canon. Several ways you could play with that. You also likely wouldn't get Dementors at the school at this point. Harry wouldn't learn Patronus.

And then we go from there, things get even trickier to decide what ends up happening. Especially, if Teenage Voldemort is around.
