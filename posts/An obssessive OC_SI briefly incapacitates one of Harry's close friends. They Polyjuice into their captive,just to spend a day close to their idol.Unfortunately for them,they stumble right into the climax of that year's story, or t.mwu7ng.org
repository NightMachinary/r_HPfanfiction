Bonus points if OC tries to "blend in" as Ron by playing fanon-asshole-idiot Ron.They think it's working but Harry and Hermione are non-plussed.Or they assume that Harry and Hermione just totally have a thing going and creep everyone out by coming onto him in a decidedly UnHermioneish way.


** I'd so love to read this if someone wrote it.

I can just imagine "Ron," trying to ask Dumbledore if he will give them money for being Harry's friend, and Dumbledore is upset and "Ron" doesn't understand why as they believe Dumbledore is evil.
