Why Voldemort wasn't the master of the Wand when he killed Harry, if Harry was the master of the wand when he disarmed Draco?


** Because Voldemort didnt defeat Harry, Harry walked to him and allowed himself to be killed. Draco on the other hand was disarmed against his will. If Harry had actually died like he thought he would, he would have caused the Elder Wand to loose its power, the same thing Dumbledore intended to happen with him allowing Snape to kill him.

**** Why? Its the nature of the Elder Wand that you will end up having it either taken from you against your will or that somebody kills you for it. The owner of the Elder Wand to actively walk to his death would be a rare thing to be when he either had to murder or to steal to even become the owner.

****** Realize what? Nobody thought that killing a non resisting opponent would count as defeat and gain you the ownership of the want. Not even Voldemort thought that he would own the wand after Harry revealed that he was and is the master of it. You are pretty much the only person who didn't realize that.

Any reason why you assume that somebody would have chosen to walk to his death while owning the wand? Both Harry and Dumbledore didn't plan to to get the wand and had special reasons why they chose to walk to their death, but they are far from the typical owner of the wand who get the wand after finding out who owns it and either murder the owner or steal it form him.

********* Only by probability, between all the owners of the wand, at least more than two people should have reached the same conclussion as Dumbledore and with less forced situations. Okey, Dumbledore was a genious, but it can't be the only genious in all the history of the magic world, and the wand have to move to different parts of the planet

**** No it didn't, Draco got the wand when he disarmed Dumbledore against his will, and Harry later became the owner after he disarmed Draco. I am not sure how you could have missed that, that is literally how he kills Voldemort.

***** Probably because I haven't read the books in like 8 years, those are the ones I liked the least, and the farther in the series you get the less canon is adhered to by fanfics. Less to kick up memories and less reason to look up canon.

I'll go back and check out the disarming scene, because I find it hard to believe that Draco was capable of that.

****** Dumbledore was still weakened from drinking that potion in the cave which caused him to relive his worst memories and caused him to clutch his chest and made him unable to apparate himself.

Draco basically disarmed a heavily weakened Dumbeldore who didn't see him and was in the middle of putting a freezing charm on Harry so he wouldn't reveal his position under the invisibilty cloak when death eaters were nearby.

** Plot. That's really the reason why. JK Rowling really wrote herself into a whole that takes a lot of apologetics to solve.

If we want to do so then, Voldemort didn't kill Harry. He attacked himself that was within Harry's body.

** I think the answer is that technically, the Avada Kedavra killed the Horcrux inside of Harry. Harry himself did not die, and therefore was not defeated by Voldemort.

**** Another "possible" answers are that Harry walked to his Death, completely accepting it (a little like Dumbledore did) and, more importantly, that Voldemort also suffered a backlash from his spell. From what Harry saw when he came back to himself, it seemed closer to a draw thant Voldemort's victory.

**** The difference is that after Harry disarmed Draco they escaped and the fight was over. Whereas Harry and Voldemort were still fighting, Harry being unconscious could be considered a break in the fight rather than a complete defeat.

Again, this is what makes sense to me. Otherwise the answer is "idk, what a plot hole"

** What I find implausible is that Draco was still the Master of the Elder Wand when Harry disarmed him. He spent months in school as a Death Eater who had lost influence. I find it rather unlikely that he wasn't "defeated" at least once by someone from the DA or by some other student or even some other Death Eater who wanted to taunt the Malfoys. It's remarkably stupid of Harry to simply assume that he was the first to get to Draco.
