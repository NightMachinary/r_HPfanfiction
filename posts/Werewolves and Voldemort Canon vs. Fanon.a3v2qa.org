It's just occurred to me that I'm unsure about a few things regarding werewolves and their affiliation with Voldemort. This is compounded by common fanon ideas that I didn't realize until now don't necessarily have a clear basis in canon.

First, according to some sources (like [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Werewolf_army]]), the werewolves "led by Greyback" sided with Voldemort. My questions:

1. Do we have any idea what percentage of werewolves were under Greyback? Is there any canon evidence for other non-affiliated werewolf groups?
2. The conversation (a *movie* conversation) cited on the above page about Remus Lupin living with the werewolves and attempting to draw them away from considering supporting Voldemort paints this as Lupin living among those under Fenrir, I think. But can't it just be werewolves not affiliated with Greyback who were thinking of joining? Essentially, I'm trying to tell if Lupin was a spy in clearly enemy territory or if he was trying to convince those more on the fence.
3. Finally, is this the same sort of activity as Lupin was doing in the first war? I recall that James and Sirius began to distrust him because of werewolf-related issues, but can't find if there is something more specific than this (it's not on Remus Lupin's wikia page.)

Next, fanon loves talking about Fenrir as an alpha werewolf/pack leader. While the latter seems supported by the "led by Greyback" bit, is there any any canon evidence for actually considering him an alpha? (I've always rather disliked the term, myself.)

Last, did canon ever answer why other werewolves after Remus were not allowed (unless they were?) to attend Hogwarts? I know that there was later legislation against them, but is there any hint of other students in the 80s, for example, attending?

If you have any answers for any of these, I appreciate it. Thanks.

** I don't think there WERE any werewolves who could have attended Hogwarts after Remus.

Werewolf attacks are not THAT common in Britain. Say maybe a handful a year. Six tops, and probably less. There may be more where the victims are Muggle hikers or something, but we can exclude Muggle victims of werewolf bites from this statistic, because Muggles don't go to Hogwarts.

Of that handful, most victims will be adults - a child is much less likely to be out at night, under the full moon, by themselves. Even Remus confirms that he was only bitten because Greyback specifically targeted him to hurt his father. Adult victims have no need to go to Hogwarts either.

Of the few children...honestly I think most of the time, when a child is bitten, they probably die. Or they survive the bite but die under the strain of transformations, which may mean they don't make it to eleven. When Greyback starts attacking children again in the books, Hermione points out the “Montgomery” family - they had a little boy who was bitten, and he died.

Remus is very, very unusual. A child being bitten at all is rare, but for him to survive and be in a position where he still needs an education...

*** Really good point about the rarity of werewolf children. I hadn't thought of this, and Montgomery is a great example. Thanks!

** I think the easy answer is that canon portrays lycanthropy as a horrific curse and doesn't white wash it. A lot of fanon tropes have no basis in canon e.g. Remus doesnt have super strength, his mind isn't "protected by his wolf" he doesn't have super senses. He just turns agonisingly into a beast every month unless he has the wolfsbane or very good very talented friends. On top of being a very sickly man.

As an aside I hate stories that have him use terms like "cub" or "pup" or "pack". Lupin despises his curse. Is ashamed of it. Why would he use terminology that normalises it?

*** Ugh, the terminology and the "positives" of lycanthropy! I too can't stand it. I still feel like JKR does use "pack" when Remus once talks about his work for the Order, but if she does it's in passing and neutral.

**** I can accept positives to lycanthropy when they're minor, inconsequential things. I remember reading a fic once where Remus had a *staggeringly high* tolerance for booze - he was basically incapable of getting drunk, even if he wanted to - and it was just sort of...there. That didn't bother me.

My line in the sand is that if there ARE any positives, they have to be drastically outweighed by the negatives, and they have to be things that are basically pointless. The kind of thing that you would never deliberately try to test, you know? It's not a benefit in any real sense, it's just a thing.

“High tolerance for alcohol, which is either useless for a low to moderate drinker or a problem if he WANTS to get drunk and not think”

“Could probably swallow a chicken bone and be okay, but why the hell would he ever eat a chicken bone to find that out?”

“Generally has a pretty good idea what the time is, because his body is sensitive to moonrise, but it's kind of useless because it gets less accurate at different times of year so he can't rely on it”

***** To be fair we really only get Lupin's perspective on lycanthropy. He sees it as a curse and himself as a monster. Someone like Fenrir Greyback would definitely see it as a gift. So it's probable that, if it were to give him enhanced senses or something similar, he would still see it as a curse. There are still negatives, more than enough so that having an acute sense of smell or hearing wouldn't make up for it, such as how he loses control of himself once a month, he hurts himself during that time (since he isolates himself he has nothing else to take out his aggression on), and he seems to become lethargic around the time of the full moon. It's possible someone like Greyback wouldn't have the same drawbacks, since he wouldn't see it as losing control since he wants to hurt others anyway, he wouldn't have to hurt himself since he doesn't isolate himself, and perhaps the lethargy is caused because Lupin is so resistant to the transformation, so Greyback wouldn't be so negatively affected since he embraces the transformation.

TL;DR Lycanthropy and it's effects aren't fully explained in canon, and we only see Lupin's reactions/feeling towards it. So there's a lot of wiggle room as to how it affects each individual werewolf. This also means you can give werewolves those enhanced abilities and still make it a "curse."

** In regards to the whole "alpha of the pack" stuff, I don't recall anything like that in canon. I don't even think they were referred to as "packs" in canon. It seems to me to be fans trying to expand on werewolf culture, which is pretty limited in canon. So they tend to leans towards how we describe actual wolves and their societies. Which is reasonable imo, since the only werewolf we see prominantly other than Lupin is Greyback. Lupin seems to be an outcast with the werewolves, while Greyback is the leader of at least some of them, and he has definitely embraced his animal side, such as biting people without being in his wolf form. He's probably one of the most extreme cases of werewolves embracing their disease, but it paints enough of a picture than people write werewolf society as being very animalistic and similar to actual wolf societies.

As for who Lupin was interacting with, he's known to be an ally of Dumbledore, fought in the First War as a member of the Order, and is probably known to despise Greayback for attacking him. So I think it's more likely he was in contact with neutral groups rather than the one(s) Greyback led. Greyback would probably have killed him onsight (if he didn't it would probably only be because he wants Lupin to suffer as a werewolf, since Greyback turned him), and it probably wouldn't be worth the effort to try an convince known Voldemort supporters to turn their backs on their master. However, if both Lupin and Greyback were to go to neutral groups and try and convince those members to join their cause, then Lupin would have a much better chance of surviving the encounter, as Greyback killing him could scare off the neutral werewolves. Although, if this was an alpha-beta society, then killing Lupin (and the neutral groups' leaders) would just prove that Greyback was the alpha, and he would gain the allegiance of those groups by force. Taking this into consideration, the wolf-like societies are less likely to make sense, unless it's only used for Greyback's group as an extreme example of those who have given into their animal side, while the neutrals aren't in any sort of pack and would need to be convinced rather than dominated.

*** I could see *Fenrir* leaning heavily on “alpha” type terminology, because he strikes me as someone who would want to differentiate himself from ordinary wizards in every way possible. He'd probably get it wrong - the alpha-beta-omega model is itself a really flawed way to look at wolf pack dynamics...it's not something you see in wild packs, only in captive packs, and even then only in captive packs that are structured really weirdly with lots of unrelated wolves - but he'd do it. Just to reinforce to them that they really weren't human, and that there was no point attempting to be human or look for acceptance from humans. Fenrir *wants* his followers to reject human norms.

However, just because Fenrir Greyback does it doesn't mean any OTHER werewolves would.

*** Thanks you -- this is really helpful. I think you're probably correct about all this, especially your second paragraph.

*** Fun fact, actual wolves don't really have alphas. IIRC the guy who initially publicized the concept later discredited his own research when he realized the wolves he had identified as alphas were actually just parents being given seniority due to being parents.

Unfortunately, by that time it was already too late since people had heavily romanticized the idea of strong manly alpha wolves and didn't really care about scientific accuracy.

** I don't think we have a percentage of werewolves under Greyback. It is implied though, that the majority of them live secludedly in so called packs, I'm guessing because they cannot find a place in wizarding community much like Remus, who somehow persisted, meaning they were not on the wizarding side.

I'm pretty sure the part where his job was to try and bring werewolves to their side was also in the books, it was never elaborated on though so I guess it could be explained either way. However, one would think that Greyback might know some things about him and distrust him, since he made the conscious choice to bite Remus as a retaliation towards his father, so I personally do not think he was a spy in their midst.

I believe it was mentioned that he had a similar job in the first war but I'm not sure. The fact that he was mistrusted and, as somebody pointed out, distanced from his friends in the Order of the Phoenix (he was standing further away from James and Sirius in a group photo and might not have been able to contact James and Lily since he did not know who their secret keepter was) is something I'm very sore with, but a reason was never mentioned. Personally I suspect that he was more seen as a werewolf than a man even by those he claimed to have made him happier than ever in his life, a fun adventure to play with as kids and to be distrusted as an adult.

I'm not sure the term alpha has ever come up in the books, but it did seem like Greyback was the one werewolf who was in contact with Voldemort and the Death Eaters, so it might be deduced that he was at least their leader and spokesperson in the cooperation with Voldemort.

I wonder myself why Remus seemed to have been the only werewolf to ever attend Hogwarts, maybe Dumbledore was only aware of him by accident because his father worked at the ministry and his case was more well known than others? It is said that after his death werewolves have gotten more rights, but I wonder whether that led to more werewolf children being allowed to attend school?

The whole discrimination against werewolves seems rather out of proportion in my eyes, as stated in Fantastic Beasts, even merpeople were invited to conferences of the ministry, and also centaurs, and in earlier cases, trolls and fairies, but werewolves were never considered "beings" but rather have always had the status between beings and beasts, even though for about 29 days every month they were just normal humans and all of them were born into normal human families...
