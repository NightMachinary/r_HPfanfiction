Are there any fics where Sirius adopts a child from an orphanage? (Maybe because he needs an heir or to annoy his family or whatever) If possible with a little angst or/and hurt/comfort. Thanks in advance.


** I've read many where harry is adopted by sirius but no others. I'm guessing it's not a popular subject.
