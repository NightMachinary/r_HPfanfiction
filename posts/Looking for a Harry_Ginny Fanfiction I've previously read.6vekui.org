Hi all,

Usually wouldn't ask this but I'm looking for a fanfiction I once read, I can detail some key points I can remember, and some of them are spoilers I guess?:

Lily is alive and well, she and Harry survive that night but James does not

There's mention to a Succubas colony in the early chapters

Neville is the BWL, and an ass.

If I remember correctly Ron is competent, Dumbledore is manipulative

Harry doesn't come to Hogwarts until 6th or 7th year?

Any help finding this would be greatly appreciated!

EDIT: Thanks to everyone! That's the one I was looking for


** Hmm, I'd say that is linkffn(Return of the Marauders by TheLastZion). I've tried to read it multiple times, but the writing is just... not good. And not from a story decision point, but from a basic mechanics point.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
