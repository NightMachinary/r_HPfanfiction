With the right mindset, you might be able to Apparate yourself to any velocity you want. You could kick someone very hard by Apparating yourself going towards them at 50 kilometers per hour. You might be able to get into an airtight steel container with life support charms and Side-along Apparate it into orbit.


** Imagine the implications of /not/ being able to successfully apparate onto a moving target, such as the Earth.

Point is, they are already doing it so everything is possible.

** Basically any teleportation skill in nearly all fiction has to include this feature (even if the teleporter is not consciously aware of it) or it'd be either impossible or incredibly difficult to teleport anywhere with any accuracy.

After all Earth's rotation means that apparating across latitudes will have a speed difference. Earth's orbit will mean that if apparating takes any time at all then you'll either appear way above your target or underground. This can be extended further for the Sun's motion and our galaxy's motion and so on.

Apparition then either requires magicals to learn how to deal with these things, which afaik isn't shown; or more likely has motion compensation built. Meaning that it's very likely that any magical that can apparate would probably not think much of apparating onto a moving target at all.
