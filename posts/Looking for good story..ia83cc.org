Hello, I looking for any good harry poter story, without bashing, overpowered harry, m/m pairing(protagonist, nothing agnist background paring), and he wouldn't be horocrux or it would be removed at young age, preferable if he wouldn't be bwl.

That would be harder: Best fic would be if harry didn't live with Dursley but in orphangery, adopted by squib, learned about magic from young age, still no bwl, no overpowered, sorted ravenclaw/slytherin.

I think thats good start prefer long stories 150k+ rating prefer M can be T. Paring with Daphne/Tracy/Luna(or other good female character), i don't like harem.


** The flair you should be using is 'Request', not 'Recommendation'. 'Recommendation' is for when you want to /recommend/ a fic to others.
