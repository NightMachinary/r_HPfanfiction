I really like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down][Watership Down]]. Richard Adams hints at a much larger world outside of his linear story about rabbits escaping an unseen disaster. Through various interludes, he manages to tell stories-within-the-story about the rabbits' myths, legends, and spiritual belief system. I think it's a brilliant way to pace the story in a way that holds the reader's attention.

Broadly speaking, HBP could be seen to do this with the Pensieve Story Hour chapters.

Have you incorporated any elements from children's novels or book series in your work?


** Chronicles of Narnia was what really got me to love fantasy literature when I was young, so yes. Now that I look back, I realize that it's almost Christian propaganda. Still, I look back at it fondly as what really began everything.

I feel propaganda is the wrong word. It certainly has a Christian theme but its still a solid story in its own right and the Christian elements enhance it if anything.

**** I actually meant something else when I said propaganda. I personally don't mind the Christian theme. J.R.R. Tolkien does the same thing with The Lord of the Rings, and I love Tolkienlore. But one thing that really stood out to me in my re-read of Narnia was the subtle Islamophobia and racism. If you look in the Horse and His boy and the Last Battle, you see Calormens and Tash, which are basically symbols of the Islam World and Allah. He wrote them as if they were the evil of the world, and is portrayed almost like some Satanic cult. Islam does have major problems, but C. S. Lewis (who doesn't seem to have actually met a Muslim) does not portray them accurately and gives a strong negative impression on children, thus propaganda.

Out of curiosity, why/how is it bad? I've heard of it before, but haven't heard an objective review of it yet.

It's positively Puritanical.

** I grew up with the Chronicles of Ancient Darkness series. It's pretty similar to Harry Potter in many ways, and I really loved the series. It plays out in prehistoric Europe, and the world building is incredible. Really good book to get lost in.

** Oh certainly, The Dark is Rising Sequence of novels by Susan Cooper certainly had a massive impact on me. Obernewtyn by Isobelle Carmody (and is subsequent sequels) also heavily influenced my style of storytelling. Children of Green Knowe and The Chimneys of Green Knowe by Lucy Boston has left a mark on the way I both read and write children as characters. The Stronghold by Mollie Hunter kindled a love of history which still burns three decades later but also taught me how love and grief work in a narrative and present in characters.

Without doubt there will be stylistic choices I make because of the works I loved from my youth, although I am unaware of them. I think any incorporation of elements in my work is through when I want to evoke a certain emotion and I hark back to a scene which did just that for me. I look closely at how the scene did it - what device did the author use to draw out that feeling? What language choices did they make? Then I write the scene with those choices in mind.

** Chronicles of Narnia, like many here, but also anything by Tamora Pierce. I considered her my favorite author for almost ten years.

** I've were going strictly with childrens books, I'd say Redwall is one of my influences. But, if we stretch a bit more, I'd say the Merlin Saga (by T.A. Barron) is one that stood out to me. I don't know how good I'd think it is if I reread the series today.

*** Aaaah, yes. Redwall was the best. All those tense sieges by rats, dramatic wars with stoats and badgers, and BY GAWD THE LONG PATROL WOT WOT!

Best book series ever.

** The magic and the sheer beauty in the world of Fablehaven had me head over heels and still does, quite frankly. I was actually introduced to Fablehaven by a Harry Potter fanfic writer, Rorschach's Blot, and it's one of those things that really sticks with me. There's a particularly intricate delicacy to the way the universe is constructed, the way detail and layers are described, and while I might not wish to emulate the subject matter, I definitely try and emulate the sheer magic of the situation.

In terms of my sense of humour, in recent years Skulduggery Pleasant has definitely made me more willing to improve and spruce up my dialogue - I love Derek Landy, and I definitely admire the polished, well-delivered hilarity of his characters' conversations, and I admire that a lot.

** His Dark Materials, and the Inheritance saga. If we really really stretch it, I would also say that tom clancy got me into realistic fiction. I was also rather fond of Alex Rider, artemis Fowl, and the Spy High series.

But even more than Harry Potter, I read Naruto from the time it released to the time it ended. It was a better friend to me, than most of the other people I have labeled as such. But that is stretching the term children's story.
