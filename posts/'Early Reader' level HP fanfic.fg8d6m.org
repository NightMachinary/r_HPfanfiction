I write 'Early Reader' level fanfic to share with my daughter, who is five. She is an avid reader but obviously several years from starting the books. My wife and I wanted to do what we could, though, to plant the seed of loving HP. There are a various types of kid level books, and I'm interested in early chapter books that are very short, (~250 words/chapter) and overall maybe 2500.\\
Our stories are about Dobby and another Malfoy house elf, Pelly, who go off on adventures and help out in situations. Its set before the events in Book 2.\\
Any other parents out there know of any similar works?


** Chapters are long, but Linkffn(Harry is a dragon and that's okay) might suit.

Probably the most "kid's book" fanfic I've read, at least from where I've gotten up to. Very Pratchett-esque too.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
