What fics do you know in which Harry & Hermione are friends before Hogwarts?

My only stipulations are no Harmony/Dramione/Drarry and no Weasley Bashing.

  The Doctor takes to listening to Yaz's singing to help her relax. It's a very effective insomnia treatment, she finds, until the Tardis starts to meddle, and things get complicated.

  Harry did not know this and would not know this until Mrs. Granger mentioned it casually over a Christmas dinner years and years later-- but she and Mr. Granger reported the Dursleys for child abuse and neglect, over and over.The reports got lost-- minds scrubbed down, papers vanished-- but they kept calling in reports. They considered kidnapping. They couldn't imagine why the wizarding world might want to keep their chosen one somewhere so toxic, why they might want to keep this underfed child and his messy hair with those people."My mother left me a blood protection spell," said Harry, whose scar had not ached in years. He poked at his mashed potatoes under the focused attention of Mrs. Granger's stern little forehead wrinkle. "I had to live with family, blood family.""Then they should have made them treat you right," Mrs. Granger said, as though it was that simple.Mr. Granger gave Harry another helping of peas.
