I've been trying to find good fics where Harry is a father. I don't care who is a father to or who he is paired with. I would appreciate any recommendations. Thank you so much!


** You could try [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16405130/chapters/38403062][Grow Young with Me]], both are epilogue compliant with Harry and Ginny having had James, Lily, and Albus. Although in Grow Young with Me Ginny died. Both show Harry as a pretty good parent.

Hope you enjoy!

*** And have a pretty good depiction of parenthood, too. It's not all sunshine and roses and the kids are chaotic little whirlwinds of mercuriality. :D

**** I loved how James and Henry talked in Strangers. Half of it was gibberish that the parents were trying to parse.

***** Totally agreed. Might just be the small children I've met in my life, but that's far closer to the dynamics I've seen than anything with them being little angels. I do not miss the days when my mother minded schoolchildren for a living. :D

** Harry Potter and the Grocery Run has that in it even though it's not the main focus. Good parenting in the epilogue. You might enjoy it nonetheless.

#+begin_quote
  Harry comes home after finishing his fifth year, the happenings at the department of mysteries and Sirius death heavy on his mind. He finds the Dursley household in chaos and learns that sometimes great gifts come in small packages. As usual no slash!
