I am a huge sucker for Game of Thrones/ASOIAF SI fics where the SI is trying to fix the world to the best of his/her abilities (usually through knowledge of the plot, future technology and jumpstarting an industrial revolution). But so far my search for a decent HP SI fic have been less than successful, most seem to be about shipping the author with a character of her choice, mostly Snape, Malfoy or Harry.

Admittedly, it would be more difficult for an SI in the HP universe to cause massive changes on his/her own, considering the unfamiliarity with actually doing magic, but considering there are nearly 600k HP stories written in the English language, there ought to be a few decent SI ones which are not centred around shipping but actually resolving the canon plot and rescuing Harry from abusive relatives and an undeniably manipulative headmaster.

Please no slash, Happy Weasley (so no canon pairings) family or Death Eater redemption/whitewashing.


** I'm actually very interested in a SI jumping into the HP world, only to find out that the Books were a MoM disinformation campaign:

- The Trio was far more cunning and ruthless.
- Dumbledore was not that dumbed down plot device.
- Voldemort was not that monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain. He neither looked like a snake nor did he mutilate his soul.
- Voldemort was a military genius, while Dumbledore was the top political hack.
- The right and wrong in this conflict was far murkier, although Voldemort seemed to be supported by conservative elitist forces, while Dumbledore seemed to champion the cause of popular majority.
- SI's knowledge about Horcruxes and Wormtail was useless.
- Dursleys didn't exist, although Harry was brought up indeed by his uncle and aunt. He was never mistreated, but neither side was happy with this arrangement.
- Wizards knew Muggles very well, and they interfered several times to prevent nuclear wars from breaking out. A very comprehensive system had been put in place to prevent rogue wizards from getting their hands on those weapons.

The first ones the best, the last one drags on a bit, even by GoT standards. There's also one where the SI ends up as Lyanna, including trauma and everything, but that one never went far.

There's also "wearing Roberts crown" and a Lannister SI one where the SI is Roberts trueborn daughter, but I haven't read those. Google is your friend if you are interested in those.

  Mirrored story from SpaceBattles - Volume 1 from AndrewJTalon. An SI takes over Theon Greyjoy when he's brought to Winterfell as a hostage, and proceeds to bring the Industrial Revolution to Westeros, with the contents of the internet in his mind.

  An escape attempt gone wrong caused a chain of events that led to young Stannis Baratheon getting knocked on the head. Instead of the Mannis the Self Insert wakes up with hunger knotting his belly. It's the late stages of the Siege of Storms End by the Tyrell host and the situation is looking dire. Will knowing that it probably wont last much longer make the hunger gnaw any less?

#+begin_quote
  Self-Insert. Gregor Clegane was one of the worst people to have ever existed. But what if someone else lived his life? What if a modern person of sound mind and honorable character was reborn as The Mountain? How would his rational and reasonable mind impact the ultimate outcome of Westeros? He just might be able to change the world for the better... Feedback is appreciated.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.
