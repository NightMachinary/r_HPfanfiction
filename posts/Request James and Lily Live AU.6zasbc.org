Stories where James and Lily live. Please no bashing of characters, please if Harry has a brother or sister rather or not they are the Boy/Girl Who Lived please don't have James, Lily and the others neglect Harry.

I want James and Lily being loving parents to Harry (and to any siblings he might have).

Multi-Chapter would be prefered, but would be okay with one shots.

Any rating is fine.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), fits your requirements really well:

- James and Lily were alive
- James and Lily were loving parents, and Harry had two more siblings
- No BWL or GWL
- 680k words long and still IP, the chance for a completion is very high since the author already finished most of the final story arc
- Bashing is held to a minimum

This is however a VERY DIFFERENT Harry Potter fanfiction.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

**** During the dementor attack in Little Whinging, Harry's wand is snapped and he gets the Dementor's Kiss, only he somehow survived, but his magic is unstable. He goes through the motions of fifth year, but with some differences. (And a wand of rosewood and basilisk venom.) The Battle of the DoM is an ambush by the Order on the Death Eaters with the prophecy and Harry as bait. Also, Harry has an... /interesting/ reaction to the Horcruxes.

And as far as I can tell, /not/ a harem fic.

** 'The Dark Prince' is pretty good. Harry has a sibling and their parents love them. Of course, the conflict stems from the fact that Harry is kidnapped. His parents will stand by him when they meet throughout the fic tho
