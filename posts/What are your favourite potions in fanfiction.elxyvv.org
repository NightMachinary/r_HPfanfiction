In the original books potions are described as having almost unlimited potential, but apart from a few cool examples like Felix felices and polyjuice Rowling didn't really go into it.

So what are the coolest potions you've seen in fanfiction?

Ps. Bonus points if you've got recommendations with a potions master/ prodigy main character ( except the one were girl Harry pretends to be a boy or something)


** In Problems of Potions Harry tries to make a cleaning potion and gets a result so weird that Voldemort gets interested. Having the Dark Lord's voice in your head is weird, but having him try to discuss potions with you is weirder.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** The classic goblin potions in all the IndyHarry fics. Just seven drops of blood in this potion and the magic quill writes out everything we could ever know about you.

Also the potion Harry invented for the second task in Saviour of Magic is pretty cool too.

** Not really a "pure" fanfiction (it's a Lord of the Ring crossover) but I just love how potions work in Shadow of Angmar, and I think the author did a pretty good job a showing their "almost unlimited potential", even with the limited ressources of Arda while not making them too powerfull.

As for my favourite potion, I'm a simple guy, if it blows up, I love it.

** It's more Alchemy than Potions, but Harry makes a Philosopher's Stone in Azoth and I found the process interesting, along with other Potions details. (It's a Harry/Draco fic with portrait!Snape as a semi-major character, so I wouldn't recommend if you hate any of these things.)

*** I don't mind slash, as long as it's not like 30% of the story waxing on about the tingly magic of their soul mate or descriptively fantasizing about the tight bodies of retold year olds... But ill check it out, alchemy is usually interesting.
