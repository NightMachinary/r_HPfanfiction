:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I honestly don't remember much of it but a scene has been stuck in my head ALL WEEK. I'm pretty sure Harry and Ginny were riding on the Firebolt, running from Death Eaters when they fell. Then Harry does this Occulemency technique where he can split his mind into sections that can work of separate things at once. He did this the entire fic with just 2-3 but did 7 different sections at once for this scene which he was not supposed to do since it is dangerous. Then he has all 7 sections repeating acciowandacciowandacciowand over and over so that he can get his wand, which is too far away from him, wandlessly. He succeeded but Moody (pretty sure) tells him that because he strained his mind to learn that in a few minutes, it will be the only wandless spell he will ever be able to do. Thanks in advance!


** That's from Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, specifically [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/104/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][this chapter]] (it was Amy Wilkes, not Ginny).

** It's Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, though it wasn't Ginny on the broomstick with him.

Here's the link to the chapter.
