...is that authors assume their readers have the same nearly encyclopedic knowledge of the source material that /they/ do, and thus feel no need to explain or describe anything that happens in the crossover series. This is especially frustrating in multi-source crossovers, where many series are jumbled together without rhyme or reason. Characters are name-dropped without ever being described, events happen without explanation, and readers who haven't been glued to the TV for the last decade are left in the dark.

This thread brought to you by Chipmonkonspeed's "Prodigy," where SuperDuper!Harry is part of apparently every American cop, crime, and medical show of the 2000s, but has been enough if an issue from other works that I felt the need to bring it up.


** It's a tough one because if you swing the other way you can potentially become a boring rehash of canon(s). Definitely a fine line to walk.

It is the precise reason I would never try writing a crossover fic as I fear it would break my brain trying to reconcile the two.

** Personally, I tend to stick to crossovers that include only two works. Any more and, as you say, it gets very jumbled, especially as writers want to showcase their favourite characters from each world, piling them up one on top of the other.

**** Having characters piled up on each other ( ^{hurr} ^{hurr} ^{hurr} )is /fine/ when you know who those characters are. Han Solo, Indiana Jones, Captain Picard, Captain Reynolds and Captain Phillips on the /Event Horizon/ fighting Xenomorphs is great... if you've seen their films/shows or have an adequate explanation.

Name dropping stuff as a cameo can be fine (see: /Ready Player One/), but not when the story depends on them, and therefore the reader's knowledge of them.

*** Yeah, I have rarely seen stories with multiple crosses that work well. There are a few exceptions. [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26436/DianeCastle+The+League+of+Extraordinary+Women.htm][The League of Extraordinary Women for one.]] I have also seen a few, more often in the Buffy fandom than in Harry Potter, where a crossover needs a minor character for something and uses a crossover rather than an OC. For example a Buffy/Stargate story that needs a competent President might cross with the West Wing or if they need a cop might cross with CSI. It works pretty well as long as you don't go overboard with it.

** I actually enjoy learning about the lore on the side. If the story is good and interesting enough then it's not a big deal to me. I once read a Mass Effect crossover knowing next to nothing about the franchise and I quite enjoyed it even if I had to constantly look things up on the side. I later did the same with a LOTR crossover and I'm now hooked. It's a nice way of getting to know a new universe, but that's probably just me.

*** I think some crossovers require more in-universe knowledge than others. Mass Effect, for instance, doesn't veer too far off from other space-age-humanity scifi series. Thus, the reader can figure out most things in the crossover story by context and doesn't have to do much research to understand the basics of who's-who and what's going on. Similarly, with a Lord of the Rings crossover everyone knows the basics of elves, men, and dwarves vs. The Evil Bad Guys (aka the ugly faction), so you don't have to remember the names of specific canon characters to understand the plot.

I think that the MCU and Worm are examples of crossover universes that require more exposition. Those are both worlds with (many) more than a handfull of important and diverse backstories. Focusing on just a few characters in the crossover is doable, but the fic turns into an unwieldy mess if the author keeps introducing more.

A similar good example of a crossover might be /The Archaeologist,/ which has Harry (a curse-breaker) working t through the cursed city of Yharnam from the video game Bloodborne. Not having played the game, the author still have enough description and background through the process of exploration (since it was new to Harry, too) that it conveyed the necessary details to keep up.

** I can see what you mean, but there are two things you have to consider.\\
1. Why would you even read a crossover if you are not familiar with the source materials.\\
2. Much more importantly, explaining all this stuff from the other franchise is exposition. Exposition is boring, it kneecaps the pacing of the story and in general, nothing of value is accomplished in chapters it is in. You may not entirely agree with this, and it is certainly not an absolute rule. There are, in fact, stories that are centered around exposition that don't suck. But in general this rule holds fast. So best to avoid exposition, as it is an unnecessary failure point.

Honestly, nowadays, every fandom and their mom has a wiki, so it's not hard to look up characters for a reference.

*** Nah, there's quite a few worlds where Harry's abilities, even tanked up to OP!fic levels, barely make a dent. Even on those where he /would/ be super unsuited for the setting, a decent author can add dramatic tension and increase the odds; maybe Harry's magic in the new world is limited and he can't recover as fast as he would in canon (because less ambient magic), or he cant overtly use his powers because he needs to remain hidden from the authorities/Muggles. There's also the fact that a well-written villain will react to neutralize the hero's advantages or reply with increased power of their own; remember that old chestnut, "if Harry is a Jedi, then Voldemort has the Death Star."

*** I don't know, I think that's less of a crossover problem and more of a fanfiction problem. Quite a few HP fics do the /exact same thing/.

They give Harry some random powerup and then he mops the floor with Voldemort and then he kills every dementor with an uber-patronus because goddamnit he felt like it today.

Literally any crossover is a balancing act- you want the character(s) being introduced to have an effect, but not to completely fuck over the entire universe and plot. This is done through where they pop up at, how their powers are manipulated and scaled against their new universe, etc, etc.

Harry is usually not /that/ absurd in crossovers, assuming he's at least somewhat close to canon. If you drop fifth year Harry into Westeros he's capable of doing stuff- manipulating the world around him to cause changes that are fun to read about. If you drop Dumbledore into Westeros he's capable of utterly breaking everything. A wizard of Dumbledores caliber fighting muggles with swords and crossbows is going to be an absolute slaughter- think about his duel with Voldemort in the ministry in OotP, or against the inferi in.. HBP, I think. He could take the Seven Kingdoms and rule them God-Emperor style.

Once of the nice things about it is that it expects some knowledge of Lord of the Rings, but you don't have to know about all the Silmarillion backstory; it will teach you that story.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

Wasn't it, though? Super cracked out with a horribly Mary Sue, superHarry. Oh, sorry, "James" - because Harry's such a terrible name. 🙄

Weird that the same author did "Gryffindors Never Die," whose main characters - while powerful - were also sympathetic and flawed, whose alcoholism and temper were both sources of humor as well as hindrances that constantly worked against them.

As an aside, Prodigy!Harry was 17 and constantly getting called "kid," despite massive Time Turner abuse. He really should have been in his 30s or even older, as much as he used that thing.

They're not really crossing anything over so much as they're adapting ideas. I'm not 100% sure, though, because I've not read Pureblood Pretense past the first couple chapters.
