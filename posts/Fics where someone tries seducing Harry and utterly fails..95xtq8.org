Especially if it's someone like Narcissa, or a Slytherin, or fem!Voldemort. I've read too many with Harry just letting his dick think for him.

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.

**** Several individuals. He ends up in a world a world with the social and cultural aspects of sex, gender, dating and hookups the other way around. Hilarity ensues.

(It's not a bad read, for all that the premise is silly and run more on rule-of-cool-and/or-funny than internal consistency.)

** It's more a background thing, but in my story "Patron", Daphne keeps trying to get into Harry's pants, even though all her friends (including Pansy, who is not quite certain if she should be included in that definition, despite Daphne feeling that way) tell her that she has no chance and she constantly fails. It's pretty low-key, though.
