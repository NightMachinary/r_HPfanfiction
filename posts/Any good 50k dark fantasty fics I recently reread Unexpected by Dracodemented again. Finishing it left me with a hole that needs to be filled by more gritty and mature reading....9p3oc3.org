I loved gritty Dark Fantasy. Unexpected has always been my favorite fanfic simply because it's creative and dark and creates a lot of lore that I found interesting with its use of Pantheon's and mythology.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1912693/1/Unexpected]]

It has its flaws, melodrama and tropes. It feels a bit outdated...It goes super over the top trio bashing.

but I have troble finding anything else in the Harry Potter fanfic world but has the same sort of tone.

It's always kind of reminded me of black Jewels trilogy by Anne Bishop. Which is also a dark gritty wish-fulfillment kind of work.

I really like fics with Ginny or Luna as the main character. Or really any side characters that can be taken and built upon simply due to their lack of appearance in the books or screen time.

Books that explore Slytherin or Ravenclaw are awesome.

Well written alternate universes of The Wizarding World. Ones with Pantheon's or Elemental characters. Or someone is a vampire. But like more Lestat and less Edward Cullen...


** Ah, sorry, the combination of you saying trio bashing and the absolute mess of a first chapter meant I don't exactly know what you're looking for, but gritty and mature I can do : linkffn(Bungle in the jungle; Wastelands of time; Elizium for the sleepless souls; That which holds the image; The unwinding golden Thread; Forests of Valbone)

Though it isn't 50k, I'd like to recommend a Luna centric hidden gem that I highly recommend everyone try : linkffn(Innocence and Roses).

** I've been working on and off with something sort of similar to what you want, I think. The plot is rather dark, influenced by Irish mythology, but it is an entirely OC story, set nearly three decades after book seven with no characters from the books involved (I realize that's a deal breaker for most everyone, but maybe someone will enjoy it).

I'm currently around halfway through chapter eight, around 50k words, and I know exactly where the story is going, for the most part. I'm curious to know this sub's opinion on posting: should I wait until I'm done, or post what I have now week by week while I continue?

Edit: Sorry, I forgot reccomendations! Off the top of my head, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian]] is quite dark and has new fantasy elements like fae (?) I stopped reading after a few chapters so I can't say much more about it. One I've read and enjoyed was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11448506/1/The-Dark-Corners-of-the-Earth][Dark Corners of the Earth by Useful Oxymoron.]] It's a Bellamione romance that happens right after the Battle of Hogwarts, and Luna has an interesting arc. It's creepy and Lovecraftian and pretty well written, apart from unimaginative dueling scenes.

It depends on where your writing is. If you feel you would appreciate feedback to help guide the process, post weekly as you can. The readers will be more engaged if they think they might have some input on the story, especially if you can stay consistent with a posting schedule.

If you have a clear vision of what you've written and intend to write, and feel that criticism could only deflect your focus or douse your enthusiasm, post in bulk.

Personally, I'd love to see what you have, because I'm working on a fic for nanowrimo inspired by Lovecraftian cosmic horror and good old fashioned Elric-esque dark fantasy, and I would love to see other takes on a Dark-Fantasy HP world. But I think better advice would depend on what your work ethic is tbh. I've realised that I have really, really shit work ethic and that I shouldn't post something that I'm only a few chapters into, and should instead wait until I've got a solid chunk of it done. But if you know for sure that you can power through without losing interest then go for it and post it week-by-week.

***** I don't think it's a problem if updates slow down, so long as they don't stop entirely. Or, perhaps, slow down to the point that it's functionally the same as stopping entirely (i.e. updating once every other year). If you posted it and linked it, I'd definitely give it a read and try to give some feedback when I get some free time.

I haven't posted mine yet because it's meant to be a very, very long oneshot (like 40k words), and I'm only about 7k words in, and of those 7k I'm only sure about 2.5k of it is actually going to make it into the final product. Definitely hope to have it finished by the end of November to keep in line with the nanowrimo deadline, but even then there's probably going to be massive amounts of editing before it's really ready for posting.

When I run out of what's done, updates would be around once a month, at worst. I appreciate your interest. I've settled on writing more before I start rolling it out, but maybe I should put out just the first chapter? I'm anxious to know just how inadequate I actually am.

******* lmao it feels like I can never escape that Dexter fic. But, in my defence, that's has less to do with my shite work ethic and more to do with the fact that the show was such a heaping dumpster fire by the end that it killed any interest I had in finishing that fic.

I'd definitely give it a look if you posted the first chapter. I'd just say if you do, temper your expectations. I've never written an all OC fic, the closest I've done to that is having written a relatively obscure crossover, but even that featured characters from canon, just reinterpretations. OC fics tend to be really under-reviewed, even the ones people have mentioned a few times around the subreddit as being good, like linkffn(Starnlicht). Of course, I think you probably understand that judging by your OP, and I would never want to discourage you from posting, but, speaking from experience, sometimes writing something you're really passionate about and getting a really muted response can be a huge drag. As long as you go in with a good mindset, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't post a little bit if you want to dip your toes in.

#+begin_quote
  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war?

*** Yeah I'm not a nihilist. In fact I find nihilism to be depressing and boring. I fall more into a realist or Taoist category.

I like dark things because they're real. And because they make the happy Parts brighter.
