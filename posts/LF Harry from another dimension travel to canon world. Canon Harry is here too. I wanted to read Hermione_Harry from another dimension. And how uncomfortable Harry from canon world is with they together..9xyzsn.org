Is there anything like this?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3959072/1/Deepest-Reflections][Deepest Reflections]], linkffn(3959072): Harry from the "Dark Prince Trilogy" and canon Harry swap places. No H/Hr as both Harrys are involved with Ginny. However, there is time difference between the two dimensions.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]], linkffn(9754483), is the unfinished sequel to "Delenda Est". Canon Harry and Ginny make it to their world first and meet Hermione the Chief Unspeakable and Bellatrix the Minister. The other Harry is secretly operating in the canon world.

Unfortunately, I'm not aware of an AU H/Hr traveling to the canon world. I'm certainly interested too.

  An ambitious Voldemort prepares to lead his armies into the Delenda Est dimension to topple Minister Black III. But, he has lost the element of surprise, and there is a Pre-OotP dimension in between his dimension and the DE dimension where he will have to fight Minister Black's armies, spies, and civilian meddlers, not to mention two Harry Potters and the infamous Black Triplets.

  When things go wrong in one world, wizards seek help from another. Unfortunately what you want and what you get can sometimes be entirely different things. A tale featuring Harry, Hermione, Luna, Susan, Neville and a whole host of others. Loosely inspired by "The Meaning of Fear" by Rorschach's Blot. Rating for highly probable violence, and likely bad language.
