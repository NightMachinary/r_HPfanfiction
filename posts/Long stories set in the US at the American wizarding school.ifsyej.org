Either current time, or totally up for set in the school years of the sisters from fantastic beasts.

I'd love to see what some of the great writers out there have done to create this school just out of their imagination.


** People recommend Alexandra Quick because there is nothing American about Ilvermorny.

*** I agree. I am not a fan of Ilvermorny and the details JKR has given us, but I was hoping for someone awesome to have created something American out of it in their heads.

** The *Alexandra Quick* series is what I (and many others here) would most recommend! It's a completely original story (no canon characters!) set in a book-canon-compliant Wizarding America. The series was started before the Fantastic Beasts movies, so the setting is entirely original. It's quite a bit darker than canon, with real-life American issues crossing into the magical world in a very well-handled way.

It's very long (over a million words total) and five books out of a planned seven are complete, with the sixth about halfway written as of the latest update.

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

** If you can track his stuff down, DrT had a multi part series set in the US.

There's also Brave New World which had Harry moving to the US, sadly only available from an archive: [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwfE6l6RtZAscnFBcjVpWVpETzA]]
