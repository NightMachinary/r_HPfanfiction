The bigger the role, the better. I've tried searching for some fics, only to come up with none.


** I recall some fics where she is essentially Rita Skeeter's muggle alias. Though I can't recall the name of the fics. But even so she wasn't the focus of the story beyond how she got "creative"/"extra creative" with Harry's life past 4th year.

** Well, if you don't count all those “heroes read the book” stories (e.g., [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977403]] ), then I am not sure.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** linkao3(18182192) "J.K. Rowling Press Event" is a cracky meta fic which references all the recent JKR memes. Fair warning: the NSFW memes like "Dobby has a 10 inch cock" are also mentioned.

  J.K. holds a Press Conference and the fans invited are in for more than they bargained for. They don't remember the Harry Potter world being so... perverted, nasty, and crazy.

**** This was pretty funny until I read this

"I bet you all didn't even catch the whole highly sexualized relationship between Hermione and Dobby. He actually had a 9 and ¾ inch dick that was thick with a massive head, very gigantic for a House elf. One of his duties under the Malfoys was to satisfy Narcissa once Lucius, who was actually a pre-mature ejaculate unlike his son"

Made it funnier, just in a sick kinda way.

#+begin_quote
  “Dadfoot's already holding auditions for an actress to pretend to be him for interviews and things.” Meghan giggled. “It was Uncle Reggie's idea to make sure she's blonde, to account for all the stupid mistakes Dadfoot made writing the books. And Dadfoot wants her to be pretty but not beautiful, so he won't be tempted to fall in love with himself.”
