My fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11845077/chapters/26740251][Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]

Great title, I know.

Hi. I'm new here. Thought I'd offer up my stuff for... I don't know, approval? Consideration? Ritual sacrifice? Basically, you know how some animals will show a vulnerable spot to animals they haven't met before? Kinda what I'm going for.

I've been writing fanfic forever (it's what got me into writing), but I've never really posted a lot. And even when I wrote, I didn't really get into fic for HP because I wanted to make sure I had a solid idea for an HP fic before I wrote it.

Enter Fullmetal Alchemist.

The basic premise is the story of Harry Potter, adapted for the world of Amestris, Alchemy, and Automail. Harry Potter, eventually the Lightning Bolt Alchemist, wants to know why his parents died, and why it ended the Ishvalan Civil War. Meeting allies and enemies along the way, Harry starts to unravel the secrets of the country he has sworn to defend.

...yeah, that's why the AO3 summary is a quote from the fic.

I will say, the first two chapters I was still getting used to the world, so they're pretty much directly ripped from FMA and HP. Figuring out where the Canon Stations blend has been... interesting. And, of course, FMA's stance on the military is strikingly different from HP's stance on wizards. I'm having fun writing it though, which is nice!

Let me know what you think, and hi, again, I guess. ^-^


** I love the idea of alchemy, albeit I think it should incorporate FMA alchemy in Harry Potter rather than Harry Potter in FMA. Only one wizard ever successfully killed a Chimera for instance.

** I tend to prefer crossovers where the two fandoms are separate(is there a singular word for this?) to fusion ones, but there's been a couple fusions I've liked so I'll give it a shot.

Out of curiosity is it mostly HP plot and characters with FMA setting/world? IE no FMA Homunculi, Van Hohenheim, Elric Brothers, etc, or are those also present?

*** The setting is almost 100% Amestris. There's a few things different with how the nation was created (had to get the four founders in somewhere!), but all the locations-- Resembool, Central City, Eastern Command, Lior, Ishval, etc-- the gang's all here.

The characters are Harry Potter, mostly. Because of the different setting, characters have had different experiences and therefore slightly different character traits. There are also characters from HP that graph very well onto characters from FMA, which I take advantage of. Certain groups of characters-- the Ishvalans, the Homunculi, the Briggs soldiers-- still exist, but have the HP characters grafted onto them, sometimes in surprising ways. So no, none of the major FMA characters will be appearing.

And thus, the plot. Both FMA and HP have such tight storytelling and are built to work around the characters and world building that each created. To take one's setting and the other's characters means that to create a wholly new plot unrelated to the narratives of either would be very difficult. So, I'm taking elements of FMA, FMA 2003, and HP that I like, throwing them in a blender, and seeing what comes out. :)
