  First year: "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really." AU, assorted oneshots and snippets.

  Ron knows what he's fighting for, even if no one else does. Now complete!

** I know linkao3(From the Waters to the Wild) has Draco/Ron implied as the story goes on. (Don't let the Tomarry tag throw you off; it is still very early days for Harry and Tom and is weirdly sweet crackfic anyway.)

  Flying back from Godric's Hollow, Hagrid accidentally drops baby Harry over a wild forest. Harry is raised by rebel fairies until his Hogwarts letter arrives. The Dark Lord is in for a surprise... HP/LV romance.

** I really enjoyed [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18634393/chapters/44188591][Notes on a Resurrection]] by newleaves. It has a lot of jumps and an unreliable narrator however that's the beauty of it because the author pulls all the strands together. Its Drarry and also Wolfstar. The friendship between Ron and Draco is lovely. And Luna and Draco. There is a sequel but I think I prefer the first to the second but that's because I think Draco is a funnier narrator than Harry. Harry is a bit too OoTP Harry for me.

** linkao3(Draco Malfoy and the Resurrection Stone) and its sequels have Draco on good terms on the whole golden trio. (It is romantically Drarry, so... take what you will.)

  This is it. This is the end of it all.Draco Lucius Malfoy has survived the Second Wizarding War and has been miraculously kept from going to Azkaban. The Aurors have his wand while he's on parole, but at least he's a free man. Free to do whatever he wants, including go to Diagon Alley where people shun him at best and throw curses and slurs at worst.Draco made the wrong decisions. He doesn't belong in this world anymore, this world he helped to create. When he finds a way to go back to when it all began, he realizes this isn't the end.This is just the beginning.UPDATE : Vietnamese translation now available!! Thank you, ChunyuPink!!!
