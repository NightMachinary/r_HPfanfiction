Somehow my lazy, fanfiction addicted ass never realized it didn't actually have an ao3 account. Now I'm stuck rethinking my life choices as a fic taunts me from a distance, just waiting to be read.

I can't last a week. Does anyone have any spare ao3 codes so that I can drug myself on that sweet, sweet unread fanfic?


** I mean you can submit for an invitation, you will probably get one in a week or so -- they say they send out 2k invites per day and there are like 15k ppl on the list.

Or just drop me a pm and I'll dl the fic and send it to you.

**** Could you summon the bot and get the downloadable version from it? I haven't seen any such locked fic, but I think it could work.

#+begin_quote
  The world is becoming out of joint. The cruel winds of winter are coming, but they come at a slow turn. It is the summer of plenty, of long laughs and even longer lives. But that summer is coming to a close. The Lord of Winterfell wants a better life for his bastard - a better life than even what his son would want. So Jon Snow travels across the Narrow Sea, where tales of an empire of horselords await him. A thousand roads he could travel, but he finds himself walking only the one, the one that brings him in conflict with a vicious dragon prince who will sell his sister for the Iron Throne. And so, begins a Song for Dragons.
