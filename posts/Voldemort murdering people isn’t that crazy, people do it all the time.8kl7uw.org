Look, murder bad. I have my ethics books right here from the Old Testament to The Lives of Animals. Not arguing that, not the point.

Let's take a look at American history for a second, though I am sure there are ‘great' figures in your history you could choose from, and examine, just for example, George Washington.

If you don't think George Washington killed people for his cause you are crazy. But then here in the US he is an incredibly romanticized figure. How is Voldemort killing in the name of his cause any different?

You might then say ‘Wu, George Washington fought for civil liberties while Voldemort murdered for bigotry and power.'

That's not false. But to justify Washington's cause based on your ethics is unfair. You have to be arguing that it is okay for people whose cause you support to murder for it but not for the other guys to do the same thing.

Would you call George Washington a psychopath? Or insane?

(Sure Voldemort may have been but if you're going to classify him that way make sure it's not with this brush.)

Revolutions always require murder so Voldemort was always going to do that.

Because he was always going to kill and split his soul it would then have been crazy not to use that to make horcruxes. (Given his irrational fear of dying. Discussed in a previous thread.)

That's ridiculous. The whole point of ethics is to determine the moral justification of what people do or think, so of course if people think some specific person's actions are moral and another's aren't they think there are relevant differences that make one okay. To not get this is to not understand what ethics are. It's not the fact that one supports what I like and the other doesn't, it's that one has moral aims they're going for and the other (Voldemort) does not.

Voldemort killed and destroyed for his own personal pleasure because he was a psychopath who gloried in doing such things for their own sake (look how many people he killed outside of Horcrux creation). He used murder to damage his soul and used a spell to use that damage to break it apart. He was so afraid of death that anything became justified (in his head) to avoid it.

** While I absolutely agree just killing people doesn't make you insane, I think you chose the wrong way to go about arguing this (George Washington, while making a point about killing, was not a radical faction leader, murder as a soldier is made with a different mentality that that as an independent citizen or extremist leader), I also still think Voldemort was insane. I think the better comparison would be someone like Hitler, who is a generally accepted counterpart to Voldemort (there are some differences, like Hitler's more legitimate position of power etc. but these are also the case for GW)

You can argue about the sanity of Adolf Hitler, but I still think, compared to Voldemort, he is obviously more sane. Making this comparison is where I think you can actually see Voldemort's obvious insanity, through how he murders and acts. The fundamental issue to consider here, I think, is torture and their actions towards their own people. While both leaders sought the eradication of those they deemed unfit for their society, Voldemort also tortured and killed his own people. He killed Snape, who he believed to be perfectly loyal just because he thought he owned the elder wand, he sent Malfoy off on an unachievable quest to kill Dumbledore just to punish Lucius for his failure in the prophecy hall. What becomes clear through these actions, is that Voldemort, unlike those who follow him, does not care about his goals. He does not seek to protect the pureblood wizarding race, only to seize control and revel in the deaths of those he deems inferior. The horror of the crimes committed by Nazi's during their reign is the way they systematically exterminated those deemed inferior. While you can say Voldemort didn't have the governmental power needed to create something similar to concentration camps, the killing purely for pleasure is an undeniable action. Hitler did not personally inflict torture on the people he imprisoned and murdered, Voldemort did.

I honestly think Voldemort's insanity makes him a less interesting character (it's why I see Tom Riddle, who I consider to still be sane before the making of Horxcruxes, as much more interesting). The concentration camps are horrifying exactly because of the way humans were systematically reduced to little more than resources. Hitler is terrifying, because (at least to me) his actions were caused solely by his hatred, ideology and lust for power.

Why do you have such a hard on for Voldemort?

I mean, - /benefit of the doubt/ - I could see you just wanting a more engaging, deeper villain in the HP books. Fair enough. On the other side, if I'd interpret those two threads in the worst light, it seems like you glorify Magic-Hitler.

** George Washington wasn't committing murder, though. Murder (in the sense we are discussing) is generally premeditated, and done by one human being to another. War is different because it's not premeditated, at least not in a personal sense. George Washington didn't go out everyday to kill specific soldiers. They were collateral damage to war. Voldemort went out to specifically kill people. He went after James and Lily, killed Charity Burbage in front of an audience, and the muggle in the fourth book, Frank Bryce just because he'd "seen too much" (Ever hear of an obliviation charm, Tom?)

I wouldn't call President Washington a psychopath. He was quite the liar and a bit of a cheater, but not a psychopath. In the same line of thinking, I wouldn't necessarily say Voldemort is a psychopath. He doesn't seem to take pleasure in the act of killing itself (unlike real-life gangster, Nicky Scarfo, who was literally quoted as saying "I love this. I absolutely love this" after murdering one of his underlings) I would likely classify him as a sociopath. He's very good a emotional manipulation yet feels almost nothing himself but rage, anger, and maybe happiness, yet barely.

Another point I believe to be incorrect is that they always require murder. That's not true. Societal change is not always dependent on death. After all, look at India. They didn't stage a violent revolution against the British government. There's also the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia, where they threw out the Communist government of the Soviet Union, and created a democratic government.

I disagree with your last point. The emphasis of horcruxes is that they are on of, if not the most, foul pieces of magic to exist on the planet. To make a horcrux requires a ritual that Jo has refused to release specific details of, and has only said that when her editor saw it, became nauseous at the thought if it actually being performed. Horcruxes should not exist. It cannot be justifiable to bring something like that into the world.

India is a terrible example for your point, I think. The Brits causes tens of /millions/ of Indians to die before change happened. The popular notion that it was just some peaceful protesting and nonviolence as the impetus for change is extremely revisionist.

***** That ignores an incredible amount of context. Context like the fact that the UK had already bled India for most of its resources. Context like the fact that Indian independence happened during a time of transition from empire to commonwealth. Context like the fact it was also the 20th century, colonialism was responsible for 2 world wars, and it was hardly supported world wide.

The US rebelled during a time when British mercantile policies were at its peak, and the world believed in colonialism. There was an entire continent of natural resources that was untapped. Not to mention the United States attempted peace first. They sent an Olive Branch to the British government asking for representation in parliament.

Saying murder is a large generalization

***** You are very ignorant of what was going on in india at the time. The only reason Ghandi wanted peaceful non violence was because he knew they couldnt fight the british in a war. They were poorly armed untrained people against a first world power. So he aimed for peaceful protest knowing that if the british suppressed the protests countries like the United States would condemn the british and call for indian independence which is what happened.

*** He killed people specifically? Of course he did. Let's look at why.

James and Lily were not collateral damage, they were enemies, people that directly opposed Voldemort only compounded by the prophecy. To say they were collateral damage is ridiculous.

To the muggle? If someone overheard important information you'd be a fool to let them walk away with it.

Neither of these is relevant as nearly anyone would do the exact same thing in the scenario. Prophecized enemy? They need to be dealt with. Someone overheard sensitive information? Needs to be deal with.

And no, not everyone would do the exact same thing. Many disregard divination as complete stupidity. Many would've totally ignored the prophecy. Voldemort didn't because he had an obsession with fate and death. About the muggle, there is literally a charm that can erase memory. Voldemort could've done that, but he didn't. Instead, he had the man killed.

Lily and James ARE collateral damage because of the way they died. If it was on the battlefield or Voldemort was specifically targeting them, then your point would be valid. But, Voldemort was specifically hunting Harry Potter. He went after them and his parents got in his way. He wouldn't have killed them if they stepped aside. Of course, they didn't and thus are collateral.

My main point is, Voldemort is not justified in this.

But I'm pretty sure it's canon that the death eaters went clockwork orange on muggles for fun, that's kinda hard to justify in the name of ideals.

***** Some of the 'greatest' and 'most powerful' changes humans have ever experienced are technological (e.g. computing and indoor toilets) and some of the most influential men are artists (actors and musicians.) Killing is an old-fashioned solution if you aren't creative enough to think of anything better (or if you're trapped in a failing society, maybe.)

Also, whether or not Voldemort is personally motivated by genocide doesn't matter: his Death Eaters are definitely motivated to subjugate/kill muggles and Muggle-borns and he is the leader who allows it.
