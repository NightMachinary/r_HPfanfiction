Have you ever had the experience where you legit stop reading and wonder if you should stop reading fanfics, could be a positive story too.


** The hogwarts x giant squid fic. I had seen it talked about so many times on this subreddit so I decided to check it out. I had to stop half way through and really think about where my life went wrong

** I occasionally pump the brakes on reading fanfic if I feel like the story is so predictable because I've developed familiarity with all of the tropes being used and become blunted to the story. Tropes are actually important for storytelling, but when we're also using the same characters from HP it can make me realise I'm flying through fics trying to find something new and not appreciating what people have made.

And that's a good indication that I need to read some original fiction for a bit, because it's more of a ‚Äúme‚Äù problem, rather than a problem with the writer. I don't hold it against writers for using some tropes, because they probably feel good for them to write, and because the stories do lend themselves well to some literary devices. Also, fanfic is ultimately a hobby - so I don't want to negatively judge writer's efforts because at the end of the day they made something for free and for fun, so who am I to say it wasn't up to my standard?

It's like film buffs that roll their eyes and call a film predictable - I don't watch a lot of movies so those kinds of people strike me as cynical sometimes, and I don't wanna become cynical in the hpfanfic space. So when I feel like I'm scrolling and scrolling wanting something fresh and new and well executed - I tell myself to go buy something that someone got paid lots of money to make, and come back when I'm ready and feeling more intellectually available for what people upload.

I'm young but I like HP and the fandom a lot. I wanna be here in ten years still enjoying it and contributing positively to this little ecosystem of writers and fans. So a part of that is me taking stock and making sure I'm here for the right reasons, and still enjoying myself, and - yeah, stopping and ducking out to read actual fiction from time to time, to protect that.

**** Hummm - for many AU fics, like for example soulmate AUs, they tend to unfold similarly, so I tend to value quality of prose and characterisation more, although I really enjoy it when the author explores an aspect that others haven't explored yet or subvert it in an interesting or unexpected way. But if the writing quality or characterisation doesn't stand out and the fic acts similarly to other fics in the genre I'll hit the back button or save it to read later and give it another chance after I've taken a break from that AU type for a bit.

Anyway, character-based examples include some of the predictable stereotypes that people commonly report tiring of. Things like Dumbledore being somehow both manipulative and foolish, Ron being jealous and unhelpful without the redeeming qualities we see in the books. Snape in pairings becoming a total darling in the space of 2 (two) make-out sessions, Draco secretly not being a bigot and also being a sweetheart despite what we read in canon.

So essentially, transformations of characters that are common enough that they have become fandom norms. These norms also seem to fluctuate in time as popular works change how fans treat characters or plots.

But like I said, people put effort into these stories and enjoyed writing them (hopefully) so I refrain from judging. Sometimes it's a small part of a fic and I really don't mind it at all. I try to read mindfully and understand why I don't like something or react to it, and give fics a chance and the benefit of the doubt. sometimes that means I just need to get away from particular AUs, characters or tropes to be able to enjoy them again later on.

** This was a long time ago when I was like twelve or eleven, early but not super early days of fanfiction. I never heard about gay sex before, and learned about it when a perfectly ordinary, normal fic midway through had a detailed, explicit sex scene between an 11 year old Harry and Wraith-Riddle.

** Not one specific story, but when an author has an obvious fetish that just shows up out of nowhere in a story that had no mature content up to that point.
