Been reading this on rrl [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26581/rebirth-in-a-magical-world]] and want to know if there is any other in a similar vein, the transmigration part at the start isnt the important bit but rather where its another character's story merely set in the HPU. With hogwarts included if possible.


** Here's one of us who finds herself in the HPU. It's a well-written example of this sort of thing.

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff]])

Aside from that, there are oodles of stories focusing on other characters, like backstories for various canon characters before Harry was born. Any particular characters interest you?

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** Also everything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]] - Alexandra Quick is an American witch experiencing a very colonial-American-inspired version of the Wizarding world. The stories were developed well before JKR ever mentioned Ilvermorny, and she would have done well to just partner with Inverarity to adopt his version rather than mess up as much as she has with bogus apocrypha.

I can't seem to find the year or the last chapter released so it could be december 23rd this year meaning it is still being released, or if its of a different year then im also still confused as it's obviously not finished yet.

** linkffn(The Family Clock)\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1724293/1/The-Family-Clock][The Family Clock]] is a story of Jamesina Tickes IV (known as "Jessie" to most others), a clocksmith working in Diagon Alley across from the Weasley twins. It's mostly centered around Jessie, though the twins (and later Charlie Weasley) feature in pretty heavily. It also gives us a glimpse of the Diagon business district itself, and its Chamber of Commerce. Pretty decent and interesting fic, even if it's not been updated in four years.\\
Took me some time to try it since a) it's an OC and b) it's first person. Normally I avoid both of those, but at the time of discovery I was bored and looking for something new to read and more or less liked the other two things I'd read (SS/HG crack...though im not exactly sure it was /meant/ to be crack.) so I thought 'what the hell'.\\
The only really big issue I have with it is that while it's mostly first person in Jessie's POV, the author eventually starts to switch it up, and it's sometimes takes a bit to figure out who we're with now.\\
Very little going on /in/ Hogwarts though...sorry.

Starnlicht is post-Hogwarts for the main character, but it's set in 1590's UK and dealing with the ancestors of some characters. It's also a fun action/mystery story which is complete.

A Difference in the Family: the Snape Chronicles covers Snape's life pre-Hogwarts all the way through his time as a teacher there. If you accept that it's Snape-biased you can appreciate the details that make it mostly canon-compliant. Also finished, and with an AU sequel that has Snape survive the war.

Changeling tells a version of the original story with Ginny sorted into Slytherin, which creates a whole other world and perspective on the canon setting.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.
