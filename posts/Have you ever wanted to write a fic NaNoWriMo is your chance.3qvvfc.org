What's [[http://nanowrimo.org][NaNoWriMo]]? It's the National Novel Writing Month and it's a challenge you can can win by writing at least 50k words (a novel) during November.

While a lot of people write original fiction, the lower entry requirements of fanfiction (the universe and the characters are mostly ready) make this challenge perfect for that kind of thing. Want to write an epic novel about Harry and Voldemort fighting together against an unknown and mysterious evil? Go ahead! Want to write a Parks and Recreation / HP crossover? This is your chance, you crazy person, you.

It doesn't matter if it sucks (...it'll probably suck) and it doesn't matter if you're not sure about the plot ([[http://blog.nanowrimo.org/post/62067178090/no-plot-no-problem-in-which-a-planning-limit-is][No plot? no problem!]]). The only thing that matters is to write as much as you can and being able to say at the end of the month that you wrote /something/. If you continue writing after November that's even better!

  50000 words? THAT'S A LOT AND I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO DO.
#+end_quote

1. It's 1666 words/day.
2. Lots of people do it! Every year there are thousands of winners.
3. Even if you don't win you can say "Hey, I tried my best, I wrote a lot more than I would have done otherwise and that's great".
4. ^{It's} ^{really} ^{about} ^{creating} ^{a} ^{writing} ^{habit} ^{but} ^{don't} ^{tell} ^{anyone.}

#+begin_quote
  Okay, you convinced me, what do I do?
#+end_quote

1. Make an account at [[http://nanowrimo.org][NaNoWriMo]].
2. Post your username here. Optionally add everyone as writing buddies but Reddit probably works better for communicating.
3. Write!
4. Post your idea and progress if you want!

It doesn't matter if you write in paper, or in Microsoft Word, or any of those fancy programs for writing. You can update your word count manually or by using the word counter in the site.

#+begin_quote
  Fancy programs?
#+end_quote

[[http://www.literatureandlatte.com/nanowrimo.php][Scriveneus]] and [[http://www.ulyssesapp.com/nanowrimo/][Ulysses]] are offering month-long trials during NaNoWriMo. They have cool features that can make your life easier. There are probably others but those are the ones I know.

#+begin_quote
  I'm writing!
#+end_quote

That's awesome! Feel free to use this thread for discussion or post in this subreddit for HP fanfiction stuff. [[/r/nanowrimo]] also exists if something doesn't fit here.

I'm [[http://nanowrimo.org/participants/makingabetterme][makingabetterme]] on the site. :D

Good luck!


** I love NaNoWriMo. I won in 2012. Sadly I'm so busy this semester that I'll be thankful if I get 5k not 50k. I'll probably give it my best shot, but I'm not going to worry about it.

**** It was an original story! Not publish worthy, but the entire thing was about 60k. I'm quite proud of it. I can tell people I've written an entire story, cover to the last word.

** Mostly offtopic, but there's a free program for writing called [[http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter5.html][yWriter]] which I've discovered recently. I guess it's a lot more basic than Scrivener (I wouldn't know since I haven't used that one) but it has stuff like separation by chapter/scene, word count and progress tracker, and assigning character & location for each scene.

That's not even the reason I started using yWriter though. I was just frustrated with ~10 second startup times of LibreOffice (even on an SSD) when I just want to jot down a few notes. Notepad is okay, but I'd rather have some formatting. yWriter launches in a second so that's pretty cool.

** I'm writing a doctor who / hp fanfic called "shadow and chrome" for nanowrimo.

The doctor meets Hermione Granger at a party and is thrilled to meet her . . .until he realizes she's not a witch, has never been to Hogwarts and is continually haunted by dementors. Must be something timey wimey going on!

Hopefully I'll have something workable tobpost at the end of the month.
