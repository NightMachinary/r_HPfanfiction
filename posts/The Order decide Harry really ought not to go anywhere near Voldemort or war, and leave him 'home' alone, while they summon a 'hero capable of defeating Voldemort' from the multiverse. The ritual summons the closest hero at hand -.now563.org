Harry's done the typical 'self-improvement' montage, they don't recognize him, and Ron and Hermione had informed him about the ritual beforehand. Harry proceeds to bullshit them with stories about 'his' universe. Ron and Hermione fake letters from Harry to keep up illusion he's still at home.

** It takes place just after OOTP, he's just been doing some mild calisthenics, getting a little sun and reading through some advanced books borrowed from the twins before they left. Just continue the through line of OOTP, by that book he's fending off and fighting multiple death eaters intent on capturing him and others, he just gets better rather Completely forgetting everything he learned and taught in the DA.

Only question is what do the order thinks Harry is up too over the time period of the story, like yeah Hermione and Ron make fake notes but the Order isn't just gonna not watch Harry or send him somewhere, so where would he be that is remote enough that the order couldn't have watchers but Hedwig could come to and from. Perhaps they send him off to another school in another country. All the Order Members have day jobs so they just sending Harry off to Australia and then accidentally summoning him back logically makes sense that they just won't get word back that their Harry is missing

*** Well, I thought in many of those bro-up stories, Harry makes peace with Dudley, and learns to box/work out. So Dudley agrees to fake Harry's presence in the house. After all, they didnt really stalk him that heavily - if the watcher didn't see Harry leave, they'd assume he was still in his room. All Dudley has to do is arrange for a Harry-shaped shadow to be seen every so often, or yell across house at him. Once in awhile, Fred or George might sneak over and make a Harry polyjuice appearance for a walk....but let's be honest, Harry didn't do much in summer. And the Order was there in case of things like rogue dementors, and Death Eaters, not to actually spy on Harry.

Edit: It's not necessarily an incompetent Order prompts, though those are funny too. But more, after realizing 6 teenagers thought that they needed to go fight Death Eaters, and start a Defense Force in school, and were just generally failed by adults, that they got a wakeup call and Dumbledore either won't tell Harry the prophecy, or he does, and realizes, like Molly says, the children should not be involved...and certainly not expected to defeat Voldemort! So maybe it's a 'prophecy comes true despite adults being responsible and trying to circumvent it' prompt.

**** I think that would be almost a bridge too far for everyone and force the story to take place in a unrealistic amount of time or worst the longer it goes the dumber and more incompetent the Order would seem. That's why I suggested they just send him to another country. There's a difference between Dementors attacking while one member slacks off and every member on every watch not realizing that Harry either hasn't left his room in 6 week or that he only appears to do chores when Dudley is home. That also means hiding it from people like Mad Eye, Tonks and Snape.

I can see it more they send him to Australia at the start of the summer and then 4 months later on Halloween they summon Harry by accident but no one's seen him in a quarter of a year so "Oh yeah you're totally different, your like 15cm Taller, in much better shape, you've learned spells Harry wouldn't even have access too, it's very clear you're not our Harry"

I love this.

Still bummed at Harry being kept out of the loop (it shows lack of trust and general interest in his person), but then again, if he was informed and didn't grab the Idiot Ball in time for "dumb teenager" routine, the main plot would not happen, since between a good and motivated Dumbledore and Super!Harry they would probably mop it all up on the spot :D

*** Which is fair enough: it doesn't matter if he's not some mystical summoned hero. They want him to fight in their war. Even bypassing the whole "child soldiers" shebang, if he's going to be acting as a soldier, he should be paid like one.

Higher risks and demands on his time and skill mean the remunaration should be proportionately higher.

Since if one takes Da ProffCee at face value Harry is the only one who can do it, then it folows that no demand he could make would be out of line - he'd be providing a service he'd have an absolute monopoly on.

** Harry could still be deeply upset about the loss of Sirius, or if you wanted to do it sooner, upset over the death of Cedric. He could study during the meantime. Ron, Hermione, the twins, and maybe even Neville could get him books to read, so he can begin to learn advance spells. Even if he can't cast them. in a Muggle place.

Harry could A: Fake his own death. Fred and George aren't living at the Burrow anymore. He could crash with them. Until this new Harry is "summoned"

Harry could B: Have someone, (Fred, George or whoever) Polyjuice as himself, so the Order isn't suspicious.

Harry could C: End up reconciled with Dudley, after the Dementor attack. And Dudley could even help him out. Sneak him more food during the night. Go somewhere private where he could teach Harry boxing, get him a set workout schedule that would help Harry.

Maybe even the Order is divided heavily, on rather they should let their Harry in or not.

Maybe a couple people from the Order find out that Harry is actually their Harry, instead of a summoned Harry from another universe, but decide to keep the truth secret, from the others. Whoever finds out, could also help Harry learn more magic, to make it believable.
