Hey guys! I am about to publish the 1st chapter of Carly Potter and The Serpent's Spy on Wattpad and fanfiction.net at 5 pm Philippine time (or 5am est). For a quick summary:

/❝ Trust no one, not even our closest friends❞/

​

/It all started when Carly, twin sister of the famous Harry Potter, received a letter from a gigantic man stating that she and her brother will attend a magic school for witches and wizards called Hogwarts, their parents apparently attended this school. As Carly adjusted in the magical school, she became a magical prodigy. In her very first year, things have gone unusual, even for wizarding standards. An unknown student slipped up and spilled information about 'getting to know the Potters more' and that unknown student called themselves 'The Serpent's Spy'. Carly teams up with her new trustworthy friends, Ophelia and Victoria, to catch this spy to protect Harry, no matter what it takes, like getting killed, or worse, expelled./

​

/But was Harry really the target victim?/

That's it! I'm mostly active on my [[https://www.wattpad.com/user/moonyxme][Wattpad account]] but I'll try to get used to fanfiction.net. I am a new ff writer so advice and constructed criticism is highly encouraged. Thank you for your time!

​

Edit: THE FIRST CHAPTER IS ALREADY POSTED ON BOTH SITES, GO CHECK IT OUT! <3
