I read a fic a while ago. Harry ran into Luna at some point and they started up a friendship. Basically he realized that she was using her wackiness to play a prank on everyone and was actually quiet sane. Any help?


** This is a jbern story: linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle). This fic is notable only for the fact it is in second person!

**** Yeah, I had the same problem with this and The Lie I've Lived, which is in first person. It took me a few tries to get used to it not being in third person, but once I got past that they were both really good fics.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
