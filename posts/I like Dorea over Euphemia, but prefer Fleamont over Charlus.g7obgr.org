I don't know why, but I just really like the name combination of Fleamont and Dorea Potter. 'Euphemia' is just... too much, even for me, while 'Charlus' is just underwhelming. What do you think?


** I feel like I'm probably one of the few people who actually like Fleamont and Euphemia. In fact, I like the new info on the Potter family tree, mostly. I find it hilarious about the hair potion thing.

I like the idea of Charlus being like a cousin or something to Fleamont, though. And I wish we knew more about Dorea and Charlus over all.

** Considering James is a beacon of normal naming in the weird merry fuckery of styles and conventions that is the Rowling-Magical world, I'd say his dad being Fleamont makes perfect sense. Who else would rebel so hard against Magical naming conventions than a guy saddled with the name 'Fleamont'? :D

** I have a literal note to myself that, if I ever use Harry's grandparents in a fic, they will go by Mia and Monty.

** Charlus is a stupid name. I'm aware that one or two real examples exist, but it sounds like someone lazily tried to make the name "Charles" sound Latin. Like Johnus, or Stevus, or Jeffus or something like that.

Fleamont is also a stupid name, but it's stupid in a funny and interesting way. Fits perfectly with the Harry Potter setting. Angsty fanfic authors who want everything to be superserious and grimdark won't like it, of course.

Euphemia is also an excellent name in the setting. It's well-known but old-fashioned, so you'd encounter it often in history books but never meet anyone called that. Fits with lots of other wizarding names.

Dorea, according to wikipedia, "is a Gram-positive and nonspore-forming bacterial genus from the family Lachnospiraceae, which occur in human faeces."

*** I think Wikipedia has one Charlus, some French athlete IIRC. Charles would be the English version, Carolus the latinized.

** I honestly don't mind either one. I would probably make Harry's grandparents be Dorea and Charlus if I were writting a fic centered around the Black Family, but otherwise Fleamont and Euphemia are perfectly fine.
