If it's one or both parents it doesn't matter. Bonus points if he is sent to the Dursleys anyway or if the parent(s) in question belong to a wizarding family. Only other requirement is that the fics are decently long. Thanks in advance!


** Although it is probably not what you are after, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][The Last Mage Of Krypton]], Harry's birth parents are Jor-El and Lara Van-El.\\
As per the (modified) Prophecy, Harry is /Born/*/e/* to those who have defied the Dark lord thrice.

TLMOK is the first book of four. Here are links to the others.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12357124/1/Rising-From-The-Shadows][Book 2]] - Harry gets a pet snake.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564837/1/A-Distant-Storm][Book 3]] - Voldemort and Grindelwald go on a road trip together (not crack!).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12831094/1/A-Challenge-Unexpected][Book 4]] - Triwizard shenanigans

** !linkffn(One Night Stand by Ulktante) is a sane!Voldemort fic where Lily and Voldemort, both in disguise, had a one night stand in the muggle world that resulted in Harry.

!linkffn(To Reach Without) has Sirius as Harry's father, though that isn't brought up for some time in the fic.

  Two people struck with frustration search out a way to relax. All starts from there. This is a sketch of a beginning to a story. It's finished and intended to spark your imagination! AU James Potter is not Harry's father Links to stories inspired by this one in my profile!

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.
