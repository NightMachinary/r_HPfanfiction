**** Would it be technically "parselmagic", though? In fanon, that trope uses some pretty unique and weird shit, sometimes. It implies that incantations in parseltongue would have some special benefit, alteration, or quality, except the more mundane "no idea what the hell they're saying" advantage.

Heck, Harry could speak Urdu or Badger, and I think most people would be like, "wtf", lol.

***** I'm not sure. Honestly, the most I've seen in fics with Parseltongue used for magic, it basically has the benefits listed above (Like Harry puts Parseltongue locks on his trunk, or casts Silencing Charms in Parseltongue so that they're harder to break.)). But you do have a point. Any differing language could work.

********* I like the idea.

Especially if it's only the tone of voice that afftects the exact shade of green that is produced.

As a result, it would be possible to make every spell look like Killing Curse, and force the enemy to tire themselves out with dodging or conjuring solid shields (becaise the KC bypasses magical shields) while the actual spell could be a low-power, easy, harmless tickling charm that ouldn't even penetrate cloth.

** I read a fanfic once that was a sort of essay by Hermione on how spells work. I found it fascinating. Things like, how different teachers would cast spells in different languages. I remember it said Flitwick used Welsh and McGonnegal used Gaelic except when they were teaching. How the language Harry heard Dumbledore using to undo the enchantments around Hogwarts was Anglo-Saxon. How Snape “invented” Sectumsempra. Need to find that again. It was interesting.

**** Here's the relevant bit about Parseltongue:

/All magical children make up their own incantations. Tom Riddle was exceptionally creative and disciplined at it, and in his Muggle orphanage had developed quite a range of verbal spells by the age of eleven. Probably many of his spells were in a mixture of English and Parseltongue, though he was always secretive about this. His childhood spell, "Tell the truth!" was effective enough for his purposes, but inelegant and clumsy and put his victims on their guard. (Typically the shorter the spell, the better it channels simple magic.) Dumbledore once told Harry that discovering the word "Crucio" was a revelation to Riddle: whatever word he had employed up to that time to cause pain, he found in the older "accepted" spell a word that much more aptly channeled the cruelty that came so easily to him./

** Honestly these kinds of prompts are a bit annoying.

It feels like you are trying to passive-aggressively fire shots on a fanmade trope.

And it's not really much of a prompt either. It's just a snippet of a story, but it doesn't inspire more story. It may inspire conversation, but not story-making (which is the point of a prompt).
