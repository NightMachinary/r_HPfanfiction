  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

** How the fuck do we know this? Pottermore or something?

Anyway, linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation) deals with it.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

  This is a story of the life of Harry Potter. From his disappearance with his friendly relatives to Dumbledore chasing after him around the world, while Voldemort and muggle secret services loom in the background. Technology, Prophecies... one word: power.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/anyanka_jenkins/FT.html]]

This is my first fanfic, based on an original idea of JK Rowling's. When she posted that "I don't think his history will ever make it into the books." I decided I'd have a go at telling the story myself. This fic is set alongside Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, this year Harry's fellow Gryffindor Dean Thomas discovers that everything he knows about his family is wrong...
