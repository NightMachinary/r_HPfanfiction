As the title suggests, I'm just looking for WBWL fics with a badass!Harry who's jaded and grey/dark. Bonus points if it's slash or if he's good friends with Draco. The longer the better.

For examples, The Prince of Slytherin is my favorite story of all time.


** I think the most infamous one is /Dodging Prison And Stealing Witches/, but I've never read it, so I'm not sure about its quality. Lot of bashing. Not slash, though. It's harem instead.

I from what I've read /about/ the fic, it's probably against the rules to link it here, but you should be able to find it by the title pretty easily.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16903200/chapters/39709665][Stargazer]] isn't a WBWL fic but there's a similar premise of Harry being underestimated and in the shadow of his siblings with James and Lily still alive. It's Snarry though.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
