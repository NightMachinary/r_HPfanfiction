Three questions. In your opinion(s):

- Given Wizards are significantly more durable than non-magical humans, how many Wizards would it take to wield one Infinity Stone?

- How difficult would it be to create an artefact to safely channel the power of a stone or stones? What existing artefacts could hold one already? For instance, which stone would you place on the Sword of Gryffindor?

- Which single stone, in evil hands, would wreak unprecedented destruction by HP standards while still being weak enough that a concerted Wizarding effort could overcome the user?


** People often conflate scale and power but I find this to be a very Muggle way of thinking, rooted in the concepts of physical law which we take for granted as part of our world view.

In truth, while HP wizards lack /scale/, within their local environments they are basically gods. They do not really defy the laws of nature by /overpowering/ them. Rather they just /completely ignore/ the laws of nature. For example, I doubt there's any amount of heat that can burn a person protected by the flame-freezing charm. The Charm is not a protective physical force counteracting the physical force of heat. Rather it is a /magic spell/ which says "heat is no longer harmful". Instead of burning you, it now tickles you. The spell's effect is not to remove or neutralise the heat, but to (very selectively) change what heat means.

If so inclined, wizards could probably have picnic on the surface of the sun. No doubt somehow there would still be an annoying bee attracted to the jam sandwiches, since that is an essential feature of all proper picnics and I can't see a little thing like the sun getting in the way of that.

For all their ability to achieve feats of scale, the Infinity Stones have an essential weakness: they are still operating within a system of physical law, albeit Marvel's alternate physics. And "magic" and physical forces are somewhat unified in the Marvel universe. For example, when you see Doctor Strange use a shield, his magic is not some entirely different kind of power which takes precedence over the physical world. It can be overcome by physical forces. From what we see, the Infinity Stones work in the same way: they are capable of extreme physical feats, but at the end of the day their power is still essentially physical.

For that reason, in a contest between a competent HP wizard and a person wielding the Infinity Stones, my money is on the HP wizard. They could probably just vanish the stones.

** 1. not enough to matter at least not really. Look at star lord, he held one and had issues and was part celestial, even if dormant. though I could see them using one like doctor strange for small uses.
2. not hard at all see doctor strange time stone, but this would not have full power and potential of the stones.
3. all 6 of them could wreak havoc, or be beaten.. as mortal minds and overconfidence can be taken out.

** Spoilers for Endgame, obviously. All answers only apply to the MCU, not Marvel Comics, since you specified Stones. Infinity Gems are much more powerful and would incinerate any non-cosmic being who tried to fuck with them.

1) Wizards aren't all that more durable than humans by comic standards. It would take roughly the same amount of non-peak wizards as it would non-peak humans, which is to say way, way more than would be practical.

2) For one Stone? Not hard at all. Ronan slaps that shit on a hammer. They apparently make a replacement Tesseract, Scepter, etc. after the Endgame battle and it's not even remarked on. For all of them? Incredibly difficult. Tony Stark needs time and it still kills him and cripples Hulk, who literally has superpowers tailor-made for surviving that specific circumstance. Eitri and the dwarves, the finest craftsmen and weaponsmiths in the universe work their magic-science and it still cripples a being as powerful and durable as Thanos.

3) The Power Stone can destroy a planet in a single blow.

The Space Stone powers Captain Marvel and can open black holes and portals across the universe.

The Time Stone... well, you see how fucky that can be. Time Turners are repeatedly stated to be the most OP thing in HP, and the Time Stone are a limitless, no-downside, no-paradox version of that.

The Mind Stone powers Vision, and can warp people's alliances. Hyperpowered Imperius, except no resisting and no downsides or focus necessary.

The Soul Stone is literally alive on some level and has power over life and death and souls. Remember how everyone said Voldemort should have hidden his Horcruxes? What if he just didn't need to, because you couldn't harm his soul at all?

And then there's the Reality Stone, the most OP of them all.

None of them are able to be resisted by canon HP wizards without the wielder doing something stupid or other factors on Marvel levels of strength coming out of the woodwork.
