For a long time I didn't think much of fanfiction. Sloppily written Azkaban fics were my only exposure. I thought of them as stupid things that you just read when you were bored. Waste a little time while that new game was downloading. It drifted in and out of my mind, like a vague dream that I didn't want to remember anyway.

I remember the day I got my first tablet quite vividly. It might as well be one of the most influential days of my life. I was excited to read books so I got FBReader. My father's library collection was still transferring so I started browsing the catalog.

The idea of copyright and free vs paid stuff wasn't quite embedded into my mind. Somehow I expected results to show when I searched Harry Potter. I had seen the last film and was excited to read the books. Unsurprisingly, no proper Harry Potter books were just available for free, but something was.

With a mysterious black cover with a crystal ball in the centre, smoke all around it. Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. I started reading, and I couldn't stop. Cringing wasn't quite something I could do back then and every word was wonderful. Every idea so "smart" and great. Above all, it was creative. I had dreams true but this was beyond my wildest imagination.

By strange twist of fate, I read a fanfiction before I even read the original books. I read them next of course but they were inexplicably stale. Why? I wondered. In time I have realized that they were limited. Even when I didn't know their names, I knew there were rules. I knew things that could happen and those that couldn't. I knew how it began. I knew how it ended.

Fanfiction was free. Not just in its price but I think it is the purest essence of freedom there is. Pure ideas from vague dreams in all our minds come together to create a story. The worlds are as real as we are. The characters our best friends.

Fanfiction is the Room of Requirement. It provides, whatever one needs and it asks for nothing in return. The only limit to it was our imagination. And food, I guess. Fanfiction or the RoR won't provide food.

I don't think 99% is trash. I think every single fic in the Room of Hidden Things is special. It all has a story, a person behind it. Maybe 99% of entertainment is trash. But fanfiction is not part of it. It's the one percent that is a basic human need. Maybe you call it worldbuilding, a DnD game or a fanciful dream but that's fanfiction too. It is my reality.


** I was probably around 10 years old when I started reading fanfiction (am now 24). And I agree. It's the room of requirement, whatever you need, you look and can find it.

I've realized, in my almost 15 years of reading fanfiction, that some are even better than those stories that get published. It's not just tweens/teenagers writing, there are some awesome, imaginative and intelligent people weaving stories out there.

It's definitely my happy place.

** My Immortal is special, but not because it's good

** When people say 99% of fanfiction is trash, they are talking about the quality of the writing by the standards of published fiction. Because for most readers (who don't have infinite time to read everything they would like to read), fanfiction is in direct competition with original fiction for their reading time.

Is all fanfiction special in some sense which is divorced from its writing quality? Perhaps for some. After all, a parent will consider their child's objectively shitty drawing special because it was done by their child. But for most people, I think quality is their primary, if not exclusive, concern.

*** Well it's not like there was any particular point to the post. Just needed to spill the thoughts swirling in my head.

Though if you would pardon the vulgarity, I think reading fanfiction is separate from reading published fiction and provide separate pleasures just like masturbation and sex are(according to some people)

** Nicely done. I did the same thing back in high school, but for looking for Hilarious stories.
