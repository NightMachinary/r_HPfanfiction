We see a few hints of it in chamber of secrets and order of the Phoenix and I think it could be a really cool new area of the hp verse to explore. So are their any fics that deal with the wizarding underworld?

  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.
