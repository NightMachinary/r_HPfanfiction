Does Snape go nuts and go on a killing spree? Does he have a pet alligator? Is he laying down mousetraps to catch a certain annoying rodent?

I dunno, but for some reason I inexplicably crave any fanfic which has the pun "Severus Snap" in it.


** Speaking of puns, sectumsempra means "to sever forever".

Severus Snape was a pun lord, no wonder he was bullied.

** Speaking of puns, apparently in the German translation the card game was called "Exploding Snape."

*** I hear the Weasley Twins liked to play "Exploding Snape" during potions class.

Harry Potter played also, but no one told him he was part of the game.

Edit: oops, bot comment deleted. linkffn(Snaps For Severus) I guess.

  Severus Snape never should have come to Thursday's staff meeting, for a horror beyond what his mind can conceive awaits him there: Teamwork building activities with his co-workers. Ths Snap Cup! (inspired by Legally Blond 2) Ch. 5 up! Complete!
