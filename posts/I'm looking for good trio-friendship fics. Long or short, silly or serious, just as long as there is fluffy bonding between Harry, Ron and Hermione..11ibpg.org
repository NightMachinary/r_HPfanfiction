#+TITLE: I'm looking for good trio-friendship fics. Long or short, silly or serious, just as long as there is fluffy bonding between Harry, Ron and Hermione.

Please no Harry/Hermione (or Harry/Ron for that matter)! Any other pairings are ok, as long as there's no drama within the trio because of it (i.e. Ron being pissed because Hermione's dating someone else, etc.). Slash or het are both fine.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2690061/1/A-Right-Hufflepuff][A Right Hufflepuff]] - From Ron's POV, short and always gives me a smile.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards with Purpose]]- already pretty well-known, but just in case :)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2221913/1/Chess][Chess]] - Another Ron POV, pretty great

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2516931/1/Evanescence][Evanescence]] - Written before Pre-DH, about finding Horcruxes, it's good from what I remember, but it has been awhile since I read it (just to warn you)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1399984/1/Recnac-Transfaerso][Recnac Transfaero]] - Kind of dramatic, but I still love the Trio scenes in this and it's sequels!

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter?]] A fun fic about Harry traveling and his friends trying to find him

Some might not be JUST about the trio, but they are some of my favorites!

*** Thank you! I've read "Backwards with a Purpose," it's excellent! Also "Chess," because righteous indignation is always great. I haven't read any of the others, though, so this is fantastic! Thank you so much.
