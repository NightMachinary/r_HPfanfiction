** Theories only:

Werewolf stories almost require angst, domination-style conflicts and characters being forced out of their clothing. Slash top-bottom dynamics are an obvious fit.

Also- big, muscle-bound, uncontrollable, hairy men with similar men = homoeroticism set to 11.

Big, muscle-bound, uncontrollable, hairy men with human women = rape allegory

Big, muscle-bound, uncontrollable, hairy women with anyone = the ugly side of lesbian stereotypes.

*** I would go a step further and suggest that the animal aspect of the werewolf in its physical location in the body is representative of bodily freedom. The slash aspect is an instinct being acted on because the animal/body doesnt care for social norms.

** A [[http://sshg-promptfest.livejournal.com/33324.html][werewolf!Hermione story]] was just featured on the sshg_promptfest page today. Severus Snape is her paramour. (Rated NC-17.) I'm not recommending it /per se/, but at least it's het.
