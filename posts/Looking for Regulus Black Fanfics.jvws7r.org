Hey, new here and I've been reading a fic that has got me absolutely obsessed with Regulus Black. Does anyone have any recs of some good Regulus stories? Not necessarily all about him but stories where he's heavily featured.

Preferably without Hermione being a lover of his (or any of the older generation).

ETA: Thanks for all the recs everyone!


** Hey! Another Regulus stan here, I've written quite a lot about him - my AO3 profile is [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/unspeakable3][here]]. My most recent Reg fics are:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23417602/chapters/56124778][A Transient and Embarrassed Phantom]] linkao3(23417602) - when he died, Regulus became a ghost and got transported to Hogwarts.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24095437][is this hell?]] linkao3(24095437) - Kreacher saved Regulus in the cave, and took him to Sirius

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23088040][Unknell'd]] linkao3(23088040) - Regulus's version of the King's Cross/afterlife scene

I'm also just finishing up a canon-complaint fic about his final years, hoping to start posting in December but in the meantime there are some snippets on my Tumblr [[https://unspeakable3.tumblr.com/tagged/lionheart][here]].

Other recs:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413][Blackpool]] linkao3(14760663) + everything else by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian][TheDivineComedian]], tbh, but Blackpool was the first Regulus fic I read and loved so it has a very special place in my heart!

One shots by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/such_heights/pseuds/such_heights][such_heights]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/thewhitebirds/pseuds/thewhitebirds][thewhitebirds]]

Unfinished/ongoing fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20233435/chapters/47951446][Bindings, Bindings]] linkao3(20233435) - Lily and James drag themselves (and Regulus!) out of the afterlife to sort shit out

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558][face death in the hope]] linkao3(5986366) - time travel Harry rescues Regulus from the cave

**** Thanks!! The first part is complete - I'm planning more, but there are a few other stories I need to get out of my head first - and it follows along with the events of Philosopher's Stone, but from a dead-Slytherin-reformed-Death-Eater's perspective which shines a light on some of Dumbledore's more questionable decisions in that book!

** Yeah, I've been obsessed with Regulus Black too lately.

So, recommendations. You didn't say exactly what you want, so I just went through my bookmarks. There are definitely no Hermione/Regulus fics on the list.

Multi-chapter:

1. Blackpool. I think it's one of the most recommended Regulus' focused fics, so you probably read it already, but it's brilliant: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413]])
2. Professor Black. Regulus takes Snape's place in canon linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17834201/chapters/42081641]])
3. Neither Lost nor Found. Regulus survives the cave. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16375733/chapters/38325272]])
4. renascentia: from the ashes linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11914698/chapters/26923794]])

It's set in the same universe as Neither Lost nor Found, but instead of staying in Britain, Regulus leaves for France after he survives the cave. There's a sequel too:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14495823/chapters/33487077]])

The authors also have a bunch of one-shots focusing on the Black Family. Everything's well-written and well-planned.

One-shots:

1. Is this Hell? linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24095437]]) Regulus as a ghost.
2. Stasis. A slightly darker take on the character. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12401754]])
3. Out of the Lake. It's a series of two one-shots. Wrecking. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23261428]]) and linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23594878]])
4. The second son, the second loved - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10421874]])
5. Someday you will grow up and learn to lie - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1016931]])
6. Blood brothers linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/808422]])
7. Voldemort's cousin (three times removed). So funny. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24579736]])

  Regulus Black comes out of the black lake quite mad, very much his mother's son. Hogwarts will keep him safe, says Dumbledore, who offers him the post of Charms professor.But Regulus hasn't stopped drowning (lungs saturated with water, mind torn apart) and the face of Harry Potter, who looks too much like James, makes him realize the war is never over.

*** Thanks so much for these!

To be honest, I'd be happy with anything with Regulus in it (without that pairing). So these will keep me busy for a while!

I've just started Blackpool as that one was recommended to me already and love it.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

  In 1979, Regulus Black goes to destroy a Horcrux, expecting to die in the attempt. But luck and Kreacher's ingenuity keep him alive...which leaves Regulus trying to negotiate switching sides in the middle of a war without getting killed. He hadn't planned past the cave. It's a good thing that both sides can find a use for a spy---isn't it?

  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

The summary is :“At first Sirius did not know exactly what he was looking at. He knew that there're was a person lying on the floor unconscious but still alive, who was soaking wet. It wasn't until he got closer the the person that he released who it was.

“Regulus?” Sirius says in disbelief.”

The second wizarding war the looming over the Wizarding community, even though the Ministry refuses to acknowledge this. With this uncertainty over them the order of the Phoenix is left even more confused when Regulus Black shows up not looking a day over 18.
