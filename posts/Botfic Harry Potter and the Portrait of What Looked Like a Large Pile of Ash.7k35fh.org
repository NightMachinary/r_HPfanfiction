** I'm still not sure what's funnier to me - that they trained an AI to write Harry Potter fanfiction, or that when it did it included Ron-bashing.

This thing's great.

*** It also decided that Harry should fall down a spiral staircase for the /entire summer/ and that the most appropriate course of action to defeat the Death Eaters was for Harry to cannibalize Hermione after dipping her in hot sauce.

*** I think you and the guy who responded to you misunderstood how this works. Some programmers fed the entire Harry Potter series to some program that was able to analyze writing, then using that analysis of the HP series it would try to predict how Rowling would write from some input.

Basically if you give a sentence like "Harry caught the golden " it would try and figure out how Rowling would write the next word, and would probably guess snitch among other things.

Then a bunch of people used it to write a chapter by cherry-picking the funniest responses it came up with. The whole thing is public, here's the [[http://botnik.org/apps/writer/?source=4210c86ded39e6380ad0e17cecd767f6][dialogue version]] and the [[http://botnik.org/apps/writer/?source=d08198a9a936f791b7ffe144a2e9b1e3,0e155979285771266d520c44607722a1][narration version]].
