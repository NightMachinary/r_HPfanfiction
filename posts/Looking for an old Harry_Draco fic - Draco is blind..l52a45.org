Hi everyone.

I'm looking for an old Harry/Draco fic where in an accident Draco is somehow blind. He has an orb that tells him acts similar to a guide dog. This would have been posted on Fiction Alley.


** Goddamn, I know exactly the fic you mean but I can't remember the title and none of my lists seem to have it. If you do manage to learn title or author then I can check my collections again 'cause I might have it tucked away somewhere.
