**** It's hit or miss for me. The casting I think is great (Emma Watson turned out to be a bit too pretty later on), but the writing was a bit off. Snape I think was better written to what Rowling wanted than what was in her books. Book Snape is an irredeemable jerk. Movie Snape is your surly neighbor who will help you out when you need help. Also helps Alan Rickman was amazing.

***** Movie Snape is nowhere near as bad as Book Snape. Especially that scene in POA really vindicated him.

** I think this fits. It's pretty funny, definitely smut, and Harry uses his fame for it
