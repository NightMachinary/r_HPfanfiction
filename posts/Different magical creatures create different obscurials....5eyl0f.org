Just an idea that came to me just now; what if different intelligent magical beings, such as goblins, veela, centaurs and merpeople, and house-elves, all had the potential to manifest obscurials if they had magic and didn't use it?

Furthermore, what if each of these beings manifested different obscurials, depending on their race? Or their individual personality/desires?

You could have metal-munching grey oozes, raging firestorms (perhaps the inspiration for the invention of Fiendfyre), transformations into werewolves/nundus/basilisks/etc, Morpha from the Legend of Zelda, haunted houses...heck, this could even part of the origin of dementors.

Has anyone written a story yet about variant kinds of obscurials? Or just someone/something's magic getting out of control to an extreme level?
