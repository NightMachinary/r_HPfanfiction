So after one too many stories where rape and abuse are used for cheap drama, I want a subversion of that trash. Instead of turning into a wreck or needing the protagonist to rescue her, I want a story where a witch is attacked but uses her magic to flay her attacker alive, with her mind.

I don't care if it's Bellatrix baiting lowlifes into trying something, Hermione taking a wrong turn or Snape's mother making a stand, give me a good thrashing of some wannabe rapists or abusers. Not Stockholm syndrome, not cheap drama or an easy set-up for a romance, just a good ol' beatdown. Magic, enchanted daggers or even summoned demons, anything goes.


** Wasn't there a fic where Daphne the "ice queen" has some literal icy magic that freezes a rapists junk off? I'm drawing blanks here...

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** I have nothing useful to add. I just want to say that this is a really obvious thing, but so often overlooked either for the sake of plot/drama/whatever, or just by forgetfulness. I would make use of this in my story, but there's no need for it.

I've already had Hermione taken to with a metal-tipped belt, but she was in a mindset where she was unable to react in her own defense and was genuinely incapacitated so that even instinctive magic wouldn't have helped. In the story I'm working on, she is a submissive, and this happened during her first public appearance as a trained submissive. She had been playing with other Dominants and was essentially in sub-space, which left her quite defenceless, and was bound, silenced and attacked. Fortunately, another nearby submissive noticed, raised the alarm and dickwad was dealt with. Very gently /s.

**** Well the first part means that I appreciate what the OP has said. The second part is just a really out of context summary of a specific part of my story, saying how I've considered what is usually nothing more than an oversight and used it in a way that is actually justified and not just for the sake of drama/romance/whatever.
