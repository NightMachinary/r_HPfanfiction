I was always disappointed in how Snape died in HP. It seems to me that his death was rather anticlimactic and deserved to be written way better. Is there any good AU fanfic that rewrites his role in the whole matter?

The cherry on top would be if Neville is the one who actually defeats Voldemort.

Thanks for any tips.


** In linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary), Snape has a pretty big role in taking Voldemort down. No Neville though. Also heads up that the fic starts off very cracky and is mostly in the form of diary entries.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
