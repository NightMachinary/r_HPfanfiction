Hi, do you know of any long(60k+ words) fics with this pairing, preferably if its during hogwarts, idc if its cannon compliant or au.

btw ive read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5276548/1/The-Beauty-and-the-Botanist][The Beauty and the Botanist]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3867967/1/Asking-for-Roses][Asking for Roses]]


** I like them in “Raindrops on Roses” by backinyourbox linkao3(373224), but they are not main characters there, just in the background. And I like “The Professor and his Landlady” by Northumbrian linkffn(7801923), although it is just one-shot. Also, for Hannah alone, “The Hufflepuff” by the same author linkao3(5727325).

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

  Hannah Abbott? She's no one special, is she? She would be the first to admit that. This is the story of an ordinary girl who lived in extraordinary times.

  Neville thinks his summer will be much like any other: working in his grandmother's garden and other lonely pursuits. After leaving Hogwarts many months before, Hannah Abbott believes she is trapped and isolated for good. They're both mistaken. PreTDH.
