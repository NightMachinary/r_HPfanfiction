So, Red Hair is a recessive gene. That means that it is not the dominant hair color that would normally occur. It can happen randomly even with non-red haired parents but it is rare, and even more rare for all children to have red hair even if both parents are red heads.

​

The [[https://www.livescience.com/4681-neanderthals-redheads.html][gene for red hair]] is recessive, so a person needs two copies of that gene for it to show up or be expressed. *That means even if both parents carry the gene, just one in four of their children are likely to turn out to be a redhead.*

​

How do the Weasley's all have red hair?! Is that a wizarding gene like how all the Malfoy's are blonde?

​

Prompts explaining this would be great!


** Actually, a redhead has two copies of that allele. Two redheads would only be able to pass on that trait.

*** If you decide to keep the redhead bloodline pure,wouldn't that lead to incest pretty soon?Sirius' parents were cousins(think they were 2nd or maybe 1st once removed.)

** I don't see why it's surprising that two redhaired parents would pass the gene for red hair down to their children, even without any magic involved.

** Both Mr and Mrs Weasley are redheads. That's all they have to pass on. What's more interesting to me is eye color. Ron's are blue, Ginny's are brown. Dunno on the others--which parent has blue eyes and which brown? Also, since Harry's mother was a redhead, then Harry and Ginny have a 50/50 chance that their kids will be redheaded as well. Harry also likely has a reddish beard due to that recessive gene from his mother.

*** I think Harry's kids have at least one or two sets of green eyes. Albus Severus is definitely green. I picture him as a young Harry in coloring.

**** Yeah, I understand that the only one that inherited Lily's/Harry's green eyes is Albus. I believe from what I've read that both boys are dark-haired and James has hazel eyes and Lily Luna has red hair, but I don't know about her eye color.

I find stuff like that fascinating and I remember back in the day when we didn't know what color Ron's eyes are as it wasn't explicitly stated until HBP. I'd been writing fanfic since 2004 and had him with blue eyes and I was very relieved when that turned out to be the case! It seems like such a little thing, but some people find it very important!

*** I think Molly has brown eyes (heterozygous, one allele for brown, which is dominant, one allele for blue, which is recessive.) Arthur has blue eyes (two alleles.) That would give about half their kids brown eyes (heterozygous), the other half blue eyes (homozygous.) I don't know if their eye color was mentioned in the books, or I just assumed because their kids had brown or blue eyes.

Eye color is controlled by several genes. I think green is just blue modified by some other gene with a smaller effect.

**** I think the only ones we know of the kids are Ron and Ginny. I love how eye color can be on a spectrum. My maternal grandfather had brown eyes with a thin ring of blue on the outside. My dad has blue eyes and my mom brown. I've always wished for a more exciting color, but nope---just plain old brown. In high school I had a friend that had legit green gold eyes. Endlessly amazing.

** Look up Mendelian genetics and Punnett squares. Two redheads can produce nothing but red headed children because red hair is recessive. Arthur and Molly don't have any genes for blond, brown or black hair, so they can't give their kids any hair colors other than red.

** So red is a recessive gene to other colors, so we will label it as ‘r'. Other colors we will label as ‘N' for not red. For a parent to have the red gene expressed, they need to have ‘rr'. Both Weasley parents have red expressed, so can be written as ‘rr'

Completing a punnet square, all 4 spots result in ‘rr', meaning each Weasley child carries two recessive red hair genes, and therefore have red hair.

Your ‘math' would only result if both parents were not red heads ‘Nr', giving a 25% of ‘NN', 50% ‘Nr', and 25% ‘rr'. This however would only be true if neither Molly nor Arthur had red hair, but both carried a recessive red gene.

** Because its fiction and it's easier to just make certain aspects a calling card of specific groups. The Weasleys are red headed and poor, the Malfoys traditional oligarchs and blonde, the Blacks with dark hair and aristocratic features, etc.

*** Actually, the magical families having family traits could explain a few strange things from canon. Narcissa has blonde hair because she married into the Malfoys. Molly doesn't understand how much maroon clashes with red hair because her hair was a much subtler shade before she married Arthur.

**** I'm pretty sure there was a three shot or so where Hermione's hair turned red after marrying Ron and Molly was talking about how her hair was dark brown before she married Arthur. There was also a joke that birth control doesn't work until after the second child is born in the Weasley family lol

** Hi, your friendly red head here. Your maths might be a bit out, one in four...?? Umm, not I'm my experience.

I'm the second child of a redhead mother and a dark brown eyes and haired father. My sibling has very dark red hair, almost bronze in colour, and brown eyes. I'm the stupidly rare combo of bright red hair and blue eyes (17% of the WORLD population as a whole), as is my mother!

My mother has two more children by a different father (blonde, blue eyed) and got one red haired blue eyed child from that pairing too. So one in four? My mother managed three out of four and the forth sibling is blonde with reddish tints.. My mother is one of three siblings and yes one of those siblings is also redhead, and believe it or not also blue eyed! So that's two out of three.

I've never seen a picture if my grandmother as a young woman and my paternal grandparents and my maternal grandfather were out of the picture before I was old enough to recognise them. I can't tell you if they also bucked the one in four thing you were gunning for, but it seems that it's possible.

*** My mother is a red head and father is black-haired, my sister and I are both red heads. Then again he gets a reddish beard so possibly recessive.
