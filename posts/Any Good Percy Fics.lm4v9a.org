I feel like fanfics tend to dismiss Percy Offhand. Percy's character is actually really interesting.

On a personal level, he has a strange dynamic with his family. His parents praise him for his ambition and desire to do well, while silmutanously he is outcast and bullied for it by the rest of his siblings.

He is pompous, and ambitious, but he is also intellegint. His position as an older but rule abiding student puts him in a position where he could have looked out for the younger students without being a quintessential jock like most of Gryffindor.

He was close enough that he saw how frequently his family gets pulled into danger because of Harry potter, but distant enough that he doesn't really know what the story was.

Anyway, I was wondering if there were any good fanfics about him.


** It's still on going but ‘Percy take the wheel' by kittysmith on ao3 is my all time favorite Percy fic! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14033613/chapters/32322168]] “A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.”

** It's part "missing scenes"/minor character perspective and part sequel for linkao3(Escape), bit linkao3(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by Singular_ Oddities) is a very pro-Percy fic.

And that's all I've got for you, my taste in Percy-centric fics runs towards things like linkffn(The Collaborator by midwesterngirl)

** A bit late but I'd like to recommend [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1998893/1/What-You-Left-Behind][What You Left Behind]] linkffn(1998893). It revolves around Percy reconciling with his family after the events of OOTP, focusing on Percy's regret, shame, and his desire to redeem himself. But what's really interesting is that the fic points out how his family mistreated and alienated him. The author is especially critical of Fred and George and, surprisingly, Bill and also acknowledges Arthur's own fault over what happened between him and Percy.

  COMPLETE (Sequel now posted) It's the summer after the fifth book and Percy's got choices to make. What to do when you've been proved wrong? But maybe he had valid reasons for walking out which aren't related to Voldemort at all.
