I'm just looking for stories that will break me into a smile or laugh uncontrollably. So any fic that made you happy or feel great would be wonderful. I have some stories I'm currently in the middle of but, unfortunately, they are all pretty emotionally charged in the wrong direction so... yeah. A change would be nice.

Everything is fair game for me, even slash.

(I'm keeping an eye on the one-shot, <10k comedy request post already up already, so nothing that fits those guidelines.)

Thanks guys.

linkffn(9526039) is a great Weasley-family moment-in-time fic. Canon pairings.

I recently enjoyed linkao3(7737991) as well. Post-Cursed Child, but also Weasley family-focused (note:slash, but family-friendly)

** The last fic I recall laughing (multiple times!) while reading was [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/kabeyk/TDDOSB.html][The Dating Disasters of Sirius Black]]. It's very dialogue heavy in a believable way, not too many Marauder cliches~, lots of idiotic but clever (but mostly idiotic) teen boys being teens. Quick moving, light hearted, and sweet. It is RL/SB slash tho, so if that's not your cup of tea be warned.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.
