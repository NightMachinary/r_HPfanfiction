Been reading linkffn(11540013) and I loved the idea that Harry is adopted by Voldemort. Looking for stories where Harry is either his bio son or adopted son. Stories similar to ‘Benefits of old law' where there is some politics involved, here Harry doesn't just roll over when he discovers Voldemort is his father. Would prefer stories where Harry doesn't become completely evil.

One thing I didn't like about BoOL is the slow pacing. 600k wording only spanned over 8 months is too slow for me.

Edit; if there is a pairing, please no Harry/Ginny, Harry/Snape or graphic slash. Thanks!


** If it goes for politicking and Voldemort as somewhat fatherly figure I think you might take a look at Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(3766574). It is a total overhaul of AU where Voldemort is an Emperor and Harry becomes his protégé, I think it might be worth giving it a shot.

It is a monster to read with over 1kk words but it seems to be abandoned...

** Antithesis linkffn(12021325)

It plays the concept straight so it can get pretty grim at times, but it is one of the better written fics I've read in recent times.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

*** I love Antithesis as well but I wouldn't say it fits OP prompt in any way, there is almost no Voldemort in it... (as far as 59 chapters go he appeared only in one scene which could be described as near political).

That's why I didn't link it, imho

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** There's /The Well Groomed Mind/, linkffn(8163784). Harry doesn't become evil because this story kind of reverses the roles: Dumbledore is evil, and after learning what he's done to Harry Crouch Jr. and Voldemort rescue him.
