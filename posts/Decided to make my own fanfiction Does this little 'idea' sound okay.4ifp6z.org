The year, in this story, is 2036. Muggles have discovered some very useful things. And there's a new problem arising: the evil organisation that call themselves the Silvers are slowly rising to power in the wizarding world. Led by the fearless, cunning, Elizabeth Grey, they are a force to be reckoned with. Can the young new wizards, Sophie Kara and her friend, Edward Price stop them?

Thought I'd make a fanfiction for the first time, and I craeted that idea. Does it sound okay?


** Original characters oppose an original foe in what might as well be an original world.

A very generic story proposal.

What ties it to the world of HP and makes it a fanfic instead of it being a wholly original story?

You drop names but those names mean absolutely nothing to us. Character 1 and character 2 oppose opponent X leading organisation FOO. That's all we learn about your story. Everything else is window dressing.

**** As it stands now I'd agree with you. Of course, there might be legitimate reasons for making it a HP fanfic, foremost among them to play with the "deep setting" of the Potterverse. But nothing of that shows in this story proposal, and the proposal is all we have to judge it by unless we project our own assumptions onto it.

And if we were to do that we stop talking about the proposed story and wholly enter something playing /only/ inside our own heads.

** It sounds like it could have a lot of potential for exciting world building, but without more detail I can't say much more than that. Make sure you have a detailed plan so you don't run out of steam or write yourself into a corner!

One thing I would caution is that it's very ambitious for a first fanfic. It might be worth practicing with a couple of one-shots or shorter stories first to get the feel for writing and work out where your strengths and weaknesses lie.

*** Starting with a couple of one-shots is a piece of good advice. I started writing about half a year ago, and compared to my first one-shots, I think my writing has improved a lot, even though it's still far from perfect. If I had started with a multichapter, I'd most probably either abandon or rewrite it.

About your idea, it has potential, but to be honest, your description here is a bit too vague to give a lot of feedback. What are the new Muggle discoveries, and how are they affecting the magical world? What are the motivations of the villains and the heroes?

*** Thanks for the feedback! One of my main weaknesses is, well, perhaps something that's one of the most important things. Character personality, I always found myself doing things I would do personally in RP (except if I was some sort of villain.)

**** Something I find helps is filling out character forms. [[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/forums/showthread.php?885-Character-Forms-and-Guidelines-for-Use][This one]] is pretty good.

To practice writing characters that don't become self-inserts, steer away from original characters until you're sure you understand how to write people different from yourself. Try writing a canon character that is different to you. Work from the books to understand how they act, the patterns of their speech, their motivations, their physical tics. It's a bit like acting. Start with familiar characters first so you can empathise, then move on to more unusual characters and finally OCs. As well as producing better fanfic, it helps you become a better writer when it comes to consistent character development.

***** I think this is fantastic advice. When we create a character, we fall in love, which is why I think dear JKR created Pottermore, and why we sometimes erase any flaws from our favorite characters. We don't want to see them disappoint or suffer.

Besides, my advice would be to write what you wanted to read. I did that with my longest story, and I fully admit it was self-indulgent. Good hobbies are. There are people, if you ask, that will tell you no---always there will be, but if the exercise brings you real joy, there will be someone out there who enjoys it, even if it's you alone. That is enough.

But it sounds like your ambition is organized such that you are going back and reflecting on your writing, and that is wonderful. So yes, I would agree with those that say that plotting it out and having a written outline is good advice---plus, it will make conjuring the details all the more fun, since you won't be leaving breadcrumbs and asking for directions.

I'm also nodding at the commenters who suggest perhaps you leave HP for this story. Unless you have a real character tie, you don't need it. There are plenty of magic stories out there and plenty of dystopian ones. Work out a whole world, and you could bring something refreshing to it. :)

** You're told us basically nothing about the story except that there are two protagonists who are opposed by a mysterious evil organisation lead by some antagonist.

I'd be much more interested in hearing about what the themes would be. Are the Muggles coming ever closer to discovering the Statue of Secrecy, and if so, how does this affect the magical world? What was the impact of the Second Wizarding War? Did the Ministry clean up, or is it still hilariously incompetent and riddles with corruption?

To be honest, the only thing that seems remotely interesting at a first glance is the date. If this wasn't specifically posted in this subreddit, I wouldn't have any idea that this would be set in the HP-verse. I rarely care much for OCs, a feeling I believe that many here share, so my recommendation in terms of what's reasonably realistic would be to either develop an original setting, or look at this idea of yours, pick out the parts you like the most, and see if you can somehow apply them to some time within the books.

If you decide to go forward with this, however, you should probably make it more nuanced. Calling the Silvers evil makes them much less interesting in my eyes. The early Harry Potter books were rather black and white in their mentality, but the latter ones had more shades in them. Furthermore, the Harry Potter fanfiction community is rather old, at this point. Most people have likely come far in their literary tastes from when they first read the books, and will, I believe, look for more interesting antagonists than some nefarious organisation. Have the Silvers have some good points, rather than just being reskinned Death Eaters.

Oh, and a final thing. The names seem rather... bland to me, somehow. Not just the Silvers (why Silvers? Is it meant to read Slivers?), but especially Elizabeth and Edward seems just to make me shake my head. Can't put my fingers on why, exactly, but thought I'd mention it.

** Given the degree of originality you have here i would try to deatach myself from the HP-verse alltoghether.

People (mainly , not only) read fanfiction because of the characters represented in it , I know that there are notable exceptions but even those have heavy connections with the source material.

So , if i were you i would outright go original story or connect it more with HP canon , otherwise i don't think you will get many readers.

I obviously hope to be wrong if you go ahead with this :D

** Sounds interesting but it's pretty ambitious! I do have some questions and thoughts. All three names sound very Muggleborn to me and Sophie Kara is a bit strange as that isn't really a last name. If they/some of them are meant to be wizard raised, you might need to tinker with the names. What kind of evil are the Silvers? Why is the wizarding world relying on children to save them? If two kids are able to take them down, are they a bunch of idiots holding the idiot ball? Must not be too cunning then.

** You've been too vague, but from what little you've given us, here's what I can say.

Might as well make it original fiction. You're not using HP characters, you've implied a change in dynamic by muggles discovering "useful things" (probably making this a muggle wank technology fuck yeah fic) and you don't seem to be using even the themes of HP. This idea is HP in name only.

If I'm judging this as a non-HP story, it sounds like every other generic trash YA story out there (this might just be a problem with your summary than your actual concept). Points for not being dystopia though.

** "Young new wizards" strikes me as hilarious for some reason.

I assume Slivers=Death Eaters and Elizabeth=Voldemort and the new (lol) wizards are Hermione and Harry, right? And the kids are stopping the DE, somehow, right?

**** Yeah I was pretty tired when I replied.

I feel that way because - two wizard children set to thwart an evil organization for... reasons? gee, where have I seen that before?

I grew out of my "kids save the world" phase when I was, like, 11. If there's an evil organization, leave the Ministry or the Order of the Phoenix to fight it, not two dumb children with no experience and no reason or duty to fight. It /somewhat/ worked with Harry because he was marked and everything, but it's generally a very implausible plot. And OP only described /plot/, there are no motives or themes or characterizations or visible /point/ to this story that I could find interesting.

** I hate to say it, but if I saw this description I would scroll right past the story. I think Twilight permanently ruined the name Edward for me, Other than that personal quirk, i'm just not interested. Make me curious, I want to know why I should care about these characters, especially ones so far in the Future with no tie to the HP characters I love. "Muggles have discovered some very useful things" In what way? Are they discovering magic? This has been done before, in what way is your version unique? What makes the silvers "evil"?

** Have you though about detaching yourself completely from HP world and create a completely different wizarding universe? You probably would have to change/ create different spells and world rules, but your story setting seem so different already, that it might not be too difficult.

Honestly, sometimes I really wish there were more books/ films around about witchcraft mingling with our world (the muggle society). I would definitely be willing to buy a book which had these elements on it...
