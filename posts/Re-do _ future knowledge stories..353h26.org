Basically anything where Harry somehow knows everything and can't make any mistakes. A nice fluffy Harry breezes through everything with no challenge fic if you please.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh god not again]] certainly qualifies. Forewarning: Harry immediately abandons any notions of taking things seriously.

** I'm not sure if this is really what you're looking for, but my absolute favorite all-knowing-AU-Harry fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][C'est la vie]]. Basically, a 22 year old Harry has beaten Voldie and is kind of bored, so Fate sends him to an alternate universe as a fourteen-year-old. His counterpart is a huge douche bag and Neville is the BWL, but Harry swoops in and is awesome at everything, but he does really try to change things. The friendships are really precious. He does face some challenges though, but they're usually resolved pretty quickly, and he doesn't do anything stupid.

*** IIRC the only 'challenge' he loses, is when Hermione decides that he's her new tutor.

**** I know right!! I'm still holding out hope that the author will someday pop back up and finish it. I first read it years ago, and it was updated just once in all that time...

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool]] is a fantastic one.

*** It's also terrible. Soul bond, cliches and major Weasley/Dumbledore bashing. This fic is a great study of pretty much everything not to do if you want to write a fanfic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5783428/1/The-End-and-the-Beginning][The end and the beginning]] nice and fluffy, H/hr both go back in time. Its one of the fics that sort of feels like home to me, deals more with emotional impact of a future that was =) plus lots of good interaction with older characters
