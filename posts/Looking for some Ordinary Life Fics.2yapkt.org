Obviously nothing will ever top [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/376071/Jewels5][Jewels5's]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]], but I was rather looking for similar stories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3137306/1/Bearings][Bearings]] was good too. You know, less "let's kill Voldemort in 3 months" more "hey we're in a wide and amazing magical world" sort of story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] is another example. I'm ideally looking for something set a little older, but I'll take anything good.

Long paced, non-action stuff in other words. Romance is fine, but I'm trying to find something that romance doesn't entirely overtake. Although feel free to recommend anything you think was really good.

I've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense]] series, etc.

Thanks in advance!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], and it is very definitely better than The Life and Times, which was too long and slow paced for my liking.

*** Yeah, I agree with you about The Life and Times. I think it's been Seinfelded a bit because of it's popularity, but it also just feels like every single L/J trope in one story.

I've bever been a big fan of Northumbrian, I think he's great at building a realistic world but it can be a little bit contrived and indulgent at times. The whole muggle-encounters-wizards is one of my favorite themes, so of course I can't stop myself from reading Strangers at Drakeshaugh (new chapter a few days ago btw) but it feels more like a guilty pleasure than anything.

**** If tropes are the problem, it would explain why I love it so much more, since I haven't read all that many L/J stories.

** I mean, little0bird fits pretty well with what you're talking about. Next gen fics tend to have more of the "Ordinary Life" stuff.

I'm not really getting a common theme between the fics you mentioned? Just something that's more focused on people living and interacting without a ton of conflict, or something more AU that gives more depth to the wizarding world as we know it?
