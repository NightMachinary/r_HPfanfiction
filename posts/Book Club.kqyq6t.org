Hello, so I know this is a bit weird, but obviously for the past year it's been hard to interact with people and I kind of just have an idea that I was wondering if anyone is down with

I have semi started a "book club" with someone online based around Harry Potter fanfiction and I thought it'd be cool to do like an official one.

Where every month we would all choose a completed Harry Potter fanfiction to all read and then we can either keep in touch over the course of the month or just all get together at our next meeting and talk about what we liked and didn't like about that fanfiction and then put forward new fics to be picked


** Sounds like an awesome idea! Though I can't see it working for myself personally; my reading habits are too sporadic for scheduled discussions.

I could see myself of few years ago be up for such a thing, so surely you should be able to find likeminded people at present!

*** That is my plan. I'm thinking a discord and a Google docs group so that we can have a shared schedule and list of fics that is suggested and chosen
