Other than JKR saying it's free out right, there is no other British school mentioned in canon - other international schools are mentioned, but Hogwarts is literally the only one in the UK - poor kids have no other option. Considering Hogwarts has a board of governors, it probably has an endowment (with people donating into it every once in a while) that covers some operating costs and the ministry covers the rest. The elves are free labour, most maintenance is done by magic, Hagrid or Filch, and the staff is pretty minimal. It makes sense for it to be free because it allows young magicals to be taught away from muggles which reduces the risk of exposure. The ministry would want every magical kid there.


** This tuition would be inconsequential even if it existed. It had been made clear in Voldy's backstory that a poor student is completely taken charge of anyway.

*** There exist real schools which charge extremely high fees for some pupils, offer means-tested bursaries for others (up to 100% discount), academic scholarships (again up to 100% of fees), and other scholarships for, for example, the children of impecunious ex-pupils (the Weasleys, for example). I went to two of those schools, despite the fees being completely unaffordable for my family, and could only do so because of scholarships and bursaries, as well as help from other charities.

You can assume that Tom Riddle was there on a scholarship (doesn't matter how he was selected for one - raw magical talent perhaps) while also still assuming that the fees for a single pupil are rather higher than a typical middle class salary.

** The usual reasons seen:

- The most common seems to be to try to address the contradiction that is that "All Wizarding kids go to Hogwarts" and "Hogwarts really isn't that big". It is really hard to explain a society the size depicted with such a small school class size. A common way to do that is to add other wizarding schools. But then you gotta explain why Hogwarts seems to have all of the "important" and "Elite" kids and all the random muggleborns. Charging Tuition explains the 'levels' of schools, and lets you pad the population without having to explain why everyone important goes to your Wizarding Harvard.
- The next most common one seems to be "Dumbledore stealing all Harryz Money to fund scholarships". I mean, once you make Dumbledore evil, you are so far from canon..
- JK was shit at economics. There is no decent depiction of the wizarding economy, no notion of how the government funds itself, but it doesn't seem like the muggle methods would work. Further, the government is kinda displayed to be... incompetent, small, and not consistent. So it is sort of hard to believe that Hogwarts is being funded via taxes. Or that wizards have taxes. Tuition makes Hogwarts economics self-sufficent so you don't have to explain its place in the nonsensical government system.

  - On the flip side, the ministry is show to have influence over hogwarts like you would expect if they were paying for it via taxes.

- Finally, it is sort of hard to rationalize the Weasleys without it. It is depicted as a hardship to put so many kids through school, but if anything if school was free, having your kids there (and not having to feed/house them) should relieve the financial burden. Unless you have some wacko economic system where school supplies are runiously expensive yet basic living expenses are free.

​

I mean, it is hard to believe the level of dysfunction and apathy related to the MoM if they were running the school/hospital.

This one is actually pretty easy if you add up all the stuff you know about wizarding world - books cost money, so do supplies like parchment, quills, potions ingredients and equipment and so on. On the other hand, if you need to feed a family all you need is some land (that you can 'appropriate' from muggles with clever use of charms) or a decent quality expandable tent/trunk/greenhouse.

Add to that the propable thing that only orphans with no inheritance receive funding for books - because it is a necessity to maintain the Statue and pull them into the wizarding world, and i can't see the purebloods shelling out their fortunes to help anyone else than temselves, and they don't need financial help.

*** The definition of tuition is the fees charged for teaching and instruction. Supplies are a different cost, and addressed in canon. (Students must buy their own, but poor students get money from the school to pay.)

But I can see where OP's issue is. "Tuition" is such an American term, and it's jarring to see a "can't afford Hogwarts tuition" plot point in fanfic. It's as bad as the other very American trope where Harry gets seriously beaten by Uncle Vernon and the Dursleys refuse to shell out for his medical treatment. In the UK, they have socialized healthcare. It's not perfect, but they're not going to let an injured, bleeding child stew in his own blood because his guardians didn't buy him an insurance plan.

** I don't think it's a deliberate decision by fanwriters to add Hogwarts tuition to the story. It looks more like an accidental Americanism. Or at least a lack of understanding of the implicit British cultural references canon is steeped in.

It definitely has the free state-run school vibe going on, and while those usually aren't boarding schools, it does happen. Add the fact that Rowling patterned some stuff on her own (state-run) secondary school, especially some of the teachers, and that she contrasts with and parodies fee-paying independent schools (Smeltings)---the ridiculous traditional uniform, Vernon's inflated pride at sending his son to his old school, and so on---and it just makes sense.

Although it doesn't help that the typical boarding schools stories (the famous ones at least) all take place in public schools (that is, expensive private schools in the American sense). So I suspect there are a lot of fanwriters out there that just mentioned tuition unthinkingly, without actual worldbuilding reasons.

** To answer your question: It can be a useful plot device, but otherwise it's just flavor. I have seen it used (usually poorly) as a barrier for the poor or for muggleborns.

To address you claim: Most of your post is speculation, and a tuition would address all of this. I tend to agree that it makes more sense for it to be covered by either public or private endowment, but there's no reason that has to be the case.

  "Who d'you reckon they are?" he said. "They don't go to Hogwarts, do they?"

  "'Spect they go to some foreign school," said Ron. "I know there are others. Never met anyone who went to one, though. Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil ... this was years and years ago ... and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad couldn't afford it. His penfriend got all offended when he said he wasn't going and sent him a cursed hat. It made his ears shrivel up."

  Harry laughed but didn't voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other wizarding schools. He supposed, now that he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite, that he had been stupid never to realize that Hogwarts couldn't be the only one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked utterly unsurprised by the information. No doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other.
#+end_quote

That's from book 4, chapter 7. To me, Ron's words (and Hermione not contradicting him) implies there are no other schools in the UK. Also, the fact that McGonagall is known to be the first point of contact for muggleborns like Dumbledore was before her, and Tom Riddle was offered a scholarship/bursary even though nothing other than his status as an orphan magical child was known about him, kind of says that everyone is expected to go to Hogwarts.

In book 6 Dumbles says to Riddle that they have a fund for orphans which implies that Hogwarts has a certain amount of discretionary funding.

Who said elves eat people food? Or need to be fed at all?

As for the Ministry wanting all kids in one place, this cuts down on the exposure risk which cuts down on how often the Ministry would have to deal with near-exposure incidents, reducing the workload which saves money in terms of operation costs. Having them learn to control their magic in a safe, controlled and isolated environment is beneficial to society.

What is not said can often say a lot. For example, the prices/financial burden of school materials is mentioned quiet often, but nothing is said of actual fees paid to the school.

But what the JK wrote on twitter or Pottermore is part of the Harry Potter work, the support doesn't matter that much. Those were expanding the universe in the form of writing, whether in a published book or on a 140-character message isn't what makes canon or not.

Death of the author isn't about subjectively selecting what part of a work you wan't to acknowledge or not, it's about separating the intent from the work. What Rowling wrote about HP on twitter or Pottermore stays part of the work and isn't really up to interpretation.

In the end, anything you write, per definitionem, deviates from canon. Otherwise you'd be writing the exact same thing again (and thus stealing it).

** It partly depends on how much you consider to be canon. If you only take the books as canon then there's no mention of school fees, but there's also no mention of the school being free.

There are also some clues in the text that it might /not/ be free. First, Harry's name has been down for years. In Britain that only happens at private fee-charging schools. Second, aside from the stupidity of going to lessons with your house instead of with your ability group, the school looks just like a private fee-charging school.

It does /not/ "make sense for it to be free". Magical society is portrayed as being rather old-fashioned, and compulsory and free schooling is a modern innovation in the real world. The first moves towards making education compulsory (the compulsion was on local government to make sure schools were available, not upon parents to send their children there) weren't until 1870. Fees were not abolished even in state schools until 1918 - until then they were means-tested.

And it also depends on how much you want to bend canon. Canon /doesn't make sense/ in lots of ways, especially economically and demographically, so it's reasonable to fix JKR's errors there, and one way of doing that would be to create other schools.

*** The 'his name been down for years' bit is about the book and quill that record the names of UK magical children when they perform their first act of magic.

Hogwarts predates mass education in the UK in general as at the time it was established the closest thing to schools available were monastries. Everyone was either privately tutored or illiterate (in some cases both).

It makes sense for it to be free because if there were other, free options then muggle parents would not be okay with handing their kids off to strange people to be taken somewhere they can't reach them to be taught in a system they have no way of evaluating. Dursleys sent Dudley off to Vernon's alma mater, they could call/pick him up any time they wanted, and they had a way of holding the school accountable should anything happen.

**** You don't have to explain it at all. Everyone knows that scholarships and bursaries exist.

***** Why did Ron Weasley get a scholarship/bursary but not someone else?

******* One of the arguments for tuition is that it explains the low student population, but if the Weasley's are able to get funding for every one of their 7 kids, even the most 'average' one, then pretty much every magical chid in need would get one and so the low student population argument is undermined. Also, Tom Riddle gets a scholarship without even knowing about magic and applying for it. The school didn't know anything about him, just that he was magical and lived in an orphanage. This implies a concerted effort to get every child into Hogwarts.

******** Maybe the weasleys could afford to pay for school fees for three children at a time but not five. Unfortunately the children's book author didn't show us the family's accounts so fanfic authors have to fill in the gaps. I'm sure that if she had it would have been a fascinating read for her hordes of young fans. I know that my nieces always ask me “uncle HiddenAltAccount, please can you read to me from the ACCA study guides” when I visit them.

Maybe they qualified for bursaries only available to the children of ex-pupils. But again,alas, the publishers cut out all the fascinating information on the Old Hogwartians Association's activities. The bastards.

** Well, it is a PRIVATE school (the ministry has some influence, but most things are done the way the headmaster wants - minimal interference even from the board of governors (which provide oversight more than anything else IMHO)) and most of those do have tuition fees!

Not to mention that it doesn't matter if canon doesn't have tuition, if you want it in your story? Go for it!
