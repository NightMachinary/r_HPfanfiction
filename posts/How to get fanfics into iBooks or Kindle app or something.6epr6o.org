Hi! I have been an avid fanfic reader on FanFiction.net for years and have used an app for doing so but recently I have wanted to branch out and read fics from other sources such as Hawthorne and Vine (since I love Dramione stories) and Ao3 but since I haven't found any apps that will let me do so, is there a way to save them in a format I can get onto my phone/iPad?

Or any other suggests on ways to read fics besides the FanFiction.net app would be greatly appreciated. Especially ones that don't require internet access beyond the initial download/transfer/etc...


** Please check out my article called Reading, Downloading, Archiving in the [[https://reddit.com/r/hpfanfiction/wiki/reading][subreddit wiki]]! It shows you how to do it on many different devices. Hope this helps!

** I use Calibre for the download and conversion, then send it to my Kindle with a wire like some sort of caveman.

*** On windows 10 they've really blocked it in your computer app and it's annoying, I want to read them on the plane dangit!

**** For kindle, if I remember right, they blocked you putting in files yourself to the kindle app

** On ao3, you can download a fic as a MOBI file and then email that to your kindle email and it'll show up on your device

** Below link is my all-time favourite. Will turn fics into EPUB (ideal for iBooks) and can email you the file! :) It will also work in Safari on your phone/ipad and can be downloaded into iBooks directly from the device's browser!

*** This is what I use. I dont direct email myself but download them (in mobi) into folders which I date, and then send them to my kindle via kindle email address as wanted. This way I have them backed up in downloaded Mobi form on my computer.

** Calibre with fanfic plug-in to download the story, then send by email to your Kindle email address. Amazon Kindles have an email address that converts and forwards documents you send it to your device. I do all my fanfic reading on my Kindle Paperwhite.

*** Yep! This is pretty much the easiest way to do it. I also do all my reading on my kindle (voyage I think?)

You can skip the calibre step if you use Ao3, since you can download directly from there as a .mobi file

** For iBooks-

You can message the bot with linkffn(... and it has a direct link to an EPUB of the story.

The website which does the conversion is ff2ebook.com (on mobile, no link, sorry). Basically on that website you can put in the link for any fic on fanfiction.net and it'll convert it for you. On an iPhone/iPad you can open the files directly into iBooks.

** I download .mobi files directly from AO3 and email them to my Kindle account. They also have fics available in .epub, .html, and .pdf formats. Just hit the download button in the top right to select which format you want.
