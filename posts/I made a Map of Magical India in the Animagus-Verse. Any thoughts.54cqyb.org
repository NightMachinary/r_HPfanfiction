** The Animagus-Verse comes from my story, /The Accidental Animagus/, linkffn(9863146), and its sequels. In the Animagus-Verse, the magical countries in the ICW mostly line up with the muggle ones, with a few changes. But Magical India is a confederation of pre-colonial empires, Princely States, and post-colonial republics. This is the map I'm using for a planned one-shot set in Magical India.

*** Bangladesh would be part of Bengal. Bangladesh used to be East Pakistan and seceded with the help of India a couple decades ago. But it was created because of colonialism.

*** I doubt the Sikh Empire would exist as a unified state as well. I would include Tibet. What happened to Gujarat? Sindh would be smaller. Include Singapore.

Hope this helps, and look into some more Indian history because honesty this map needs a bit of work to be historically accurate in any world. Sorry for the harsh criticism but slightly annoyed.

*** I'm starting year four on my third read of that story now. Looking forward to anything more in that or the Arithmancer series.

** I'm not really familiar with India or the Animagus-verse you refer to -- looks cool and I definitely think we need more exploration of wizardry in the East, so could you provide a bit more context?

** Interesting map of India for sure, not sure what the Animagus-verse. Lol at the Sikh Empire. Also when is this supposed to be set in?

*** There was a historical sikh empire in India, which comprised much the same area as shown... Actually, all these countries existed at some point, although often in different centuries. Bangladesh is the most egregiously modern.

** My biggest thought is I have no clue what this is. Decent looking map I suppose though. Maybe remove the names and run it through a "parchment" filter or something like that, then add the names again to make it look more map like if you're bored with it or whatever

** I hope you do spend some time exploring and incorporating Indian mythology as well. Plenty of Gods and wars can be easily reinterpreted as magic. That being said I am excited about this branching out because I am from India and I am a huge fan of your works!!

** If I were you, I'd look into Indian mythology and geography to come up with some better names. There's a lot of baggage associated with some of these names, since they were (or in one case, are) real countries.

Indian history is full of religious conflict and invasion - by picking names like Marathas or hyderabad you're saying that an Islamic invasion happened in the wizarding world as well (the Marathas revolted from the Mughal Empire, and Hyderabad comes from the Deccan sultanates). Bangladesh and Ceylon imply British colonization, etc.

It might be best just to come up with your own names that don't have anything to do with history. How about Ayotha Amirtha Gangai, the mythological River? Or Brahmapura, the land of the gods? Shambhala, said to be found in Tibet?
