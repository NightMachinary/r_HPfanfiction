** ...wat

Man, this could go either way. Death could be a submissive male-entity-thing...or as some sort of femDeath sex slave. Master of Death, literally.

  A strange child has become interested in an even stranger lady. She comes and goes as she pleases, but his fondness for her always stays the same. He may be scrawny, but he would get her attention.

*** Fair Lady is really good imo. Yeah the chapter length was kind of a bummer, but I just really love their interactions with each other(especially since I think usually Harry is the only one that can see her).

  Kuroka had thought she would fail. Her nine lives had been used up trying to save her sister, but it had all been futile. She had resigned to simply escaping, but out of the blue, a random man claiming to be a wizard appears, wielding powers beyond anything anyone had ever seen. With his help, she may just yet be able to save her sister, altering fate. The Master of Death comes.

** There are a couple in the Harry Potter/Supernatural crossovers. The best is possibly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11503732/1/Angel-Nip][Angel-Nip]] linkffn(11503732). It might in fact be Harry/Death/Death by the looks of it (with two different pantheons). Maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10838794/1/Taking-Tea-in-Dreamland][Taking Tea in Dreamland]] linkffn(10838794)? It really isn't romance at all though. There is impiled Harry/Death sort of in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11672231/1/The-Great-Escape][The Great Escape]] linkffn(11672231). [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1158203][His Companion Was The Grave]] linkao3(1158203) is meant to be Harry/Death, but as it is 1st person POV I didn't make it that far into the actual story. By the same author, again 1st person POV, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2344985][Silver Filaments of Chance and Circumstance]] linkao3(2344985). [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4839173][Fate is a Whimsical Mistress]] linkao3(4839173) has female death in a pair with Harry, but the other pairings put me off, so I can't say how good it is.

Does it have to be 'death' or is other death gods acceptable? For example, there is some Harry Potter/Thanatos action in Percy Jackson crossovers if you look, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10746114/1/Another-world][Another world]] linkffn(10746114) comes to mind. Same with Harry Potter/Hades, like [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5689390][Queen of the Underworld]] linkao3(5689390) or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11534763/1/Broken-Together][Broken Together]] linkffn(11534763). Death Note and Bleach crossovers might be worth looking into if you count Shinigami as death too. Azrael as character too, in Supernatural, and some other fandoms (Good Omens maybe?). Lord of the Rings/Hobbit corssovers with Mandos maybe, but I can't think of any. Avengers has death too (as Hel) but most of the ones which she plays are major role have her as a sister or daughter figure.

  There was no such thing as the Master of Death. By collecting the three Deathly Hallows, Horatia Potter became the Heiress of Death. It was only a matter of time before she became Death herself because Thanatos wanted to retire. Meanwhile, Hades had tired of his charade of marriage.

  "Words have a magical power. They can bring either the greatest happiness or deepest despair." For a magical-less child, this truth is alive in shocking clarity. Squib Harry has been rejected by his world, his family, but is he really as magic-less as they believe or will he find a power in words that has never been known? Death is determined to show his Master his true worth and purpose.
