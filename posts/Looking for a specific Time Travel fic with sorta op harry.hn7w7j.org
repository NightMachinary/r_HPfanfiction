I really just remember that one of the premises of the story was that harry told Cedric to run from the graveyard over the course of the year making Cedric really paranoid.


** Might be Oh God Not Again ? I haven't read it, but I recall several posts on here talking abt Harry conditioning Cedric to run away from graveyards or something in it. Hope you find it! Linkao3(4701869)

  “Graveyard?" Harry said, seemingly random.

  "Run like hell," Cedric replied, having been asked this a good four dozen times since he'd been chosen as a champion alone.

*** Definitely that one! He kept telling Cedric so many times “graveyard?”, and his answer was “run like hell!”...

And it's funny reading snarky af Harry...

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** Is it [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/chapters/7419224][/C'est La Vie/]] by Cywscross? He doesn't explicitly mention graveyards as far as I remember, but he does repeatedly warn Cedric about the dangers he would face in the tournament. This leads to Cedric becoming a lot more cautious while competing.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
