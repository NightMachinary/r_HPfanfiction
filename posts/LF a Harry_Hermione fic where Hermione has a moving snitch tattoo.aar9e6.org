Hi!

So a couple years ago I read a fic in which Hermione gets a moving snitch tattoo, but doesn't tell Harry. He sees it moving around the hem of her clothing sometimes, but doesn't know what it is. Eventually he sees it and it ends as them becoming a couple. I think I might have read it on portkey? I'm not 100% certain though.

Thank you for any help!!


** Saw this post and instantly recognised the ff.
