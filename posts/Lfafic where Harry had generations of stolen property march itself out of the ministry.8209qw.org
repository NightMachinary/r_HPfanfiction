I remember there were several events where the ministry came out with some egg on its face (is that the correct expression?) and was a humorous incompetent/evil ministry type of fic.

*** Oh god. I haven't read it, but I imagine this is like the Atlas Shrugged of HP Fanfiction :D

**** As someone who's never read Atlas Shrugged, but has read this fic (and wishes it was longer, dammit), what do you mean by that?

***** So, again, I haven't read the fic to the end nor have I read Atlas Shrugged but here goes:

Atlas Shrugged is about all the productive, creative individuals of society going on strike to fight oppressive government regulation, thus collapsing the government. The book is shot-full with the writer's, Ayn Rand's personal philosophy.

A positive imagining of this philosophy is that government regulation should be light and only be applied where necessary to make sure that short-term gains do not cause overt long-term damages.

A negative imagining would be that the creative, successful people should proudly stand at the top and any governmental oversight is oppression of those of true free will and capability. The weak oppressing the strong.

You can probably see that Atlas Shrugged is very influential and well regarded in libertarian circles. On the other hand it is very badly received in many liberal circles, and is regarded as a corrupting influence on the young. (It is actually being passed to high school students in large amounts by the Ayn Rand Institute.)

So similarly, looking at this fic going balls-to-the-walls with the "I have no time for the weak" sounds very much like a Harry Potter imagining of the same philosophy.
