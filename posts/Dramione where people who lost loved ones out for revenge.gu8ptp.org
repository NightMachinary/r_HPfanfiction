:END:
There was iirc:

- A scene where Hermione and Draco join Theo and his intended (former Ravenclaw) who idolizes Hermione at some sort of music concert/performance?
- When she leaves to get a drink, someone (Marcus Flint) tries to Avada her, but is pushed aside by Draco. Along with Theo and his fiancee, She fights back and incapacitates him. Aurors come and apprehend Marcus, Theo, and Draco.
- She argues with the head Auror who plans to send the three of them to Azkaban to let Draco and Theo go.
- Head Auror planned to kill Draco and Theo during transfer to Azkaban because his daughter died at Battle of Hogwarts.
- It's a completed fic.


** Found it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3876231/13/Ambition-s-End][Ambitions End]]. Forgot how it ended because it all but my interest dropped after the main mystery conflict was solved. I couldn't get into the romance plotline lol and it felt like it didn't even get to Hermione attempting her ultimate goal for the arrangement in teh first place.
