I understand that there's a whole part of the fandom that doesn't like the Dramione pairing and I get that it's out of character and not for everyone. But there are so many weirder pairings!

Hermione with Tom Riddle Jr., with Fenrir Greyback, Thorfinn Rowle, even fucking Lucius Malfoy. The pairing of Hermione and Luna is weirder and more out of character for me than her with Draco.

Can anyone explain to me why the Dramione pairing sticks with people more than any others?


** Hermione is the most fleshed-out female character in the series and therefore the easiest one to cast into the role of either protagonist or main secondary character in any story. Thus she's also the easiest female character to put into any sort of romantic relationship.

We all already know who Hermione is, therefore writing about a romantic relationship with her in it has a lot of the work done already.

Compare that to say, Hannah Abbot, who is basically a blank slate. If you want to write about a Hannah/whoever romance, you first need to spent lots of time and effort writing about who Hannah is.

*** I understand that part, it's the choices of who to put her with that I question. Why not choose characters like Dean, Neville, Tonks, Ginny, other Weasley brothers, any of the other characters at Hogwarts that we became familiar with over the course of the series. But shit like Hermione with Bellatrix makes me just ask why.

**** The same thing happens with Harry - he gets paired off with all those weird romances too.

I think a big part of it is just that a lot of people like the idea of the Good Girl together with the Bad Boy. Kind of a, "They're not totally bad, just misunderstood," story. Or a fantasy about fixing/changing the Bad Boy through the power of /love./

I've never really understood what there's to like about such stories though.

**** Easy pairings aren't interesting to some people. I want conflict.

Also, some people get in to the rape or Stockholm syndrome fantasy. Not what I'd choose for anyone in real life, but for some reason I occasionally like a story with it. I suppose my wiring is off ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**** It's because those characters make for a more exciting romance plot full of conflict, angst and whatever other tropes/kinks people want to read about. There is a reason why girls often fall for "bad boys" instead of normal slightly nerdy guys like Neville.

Draco pairing is a classic bad boy falls for good girl trope. It has potental for a friends to enemies set up, a redemption plot as well as angst.\\
Snape has the redemption plot line, sarcastic humour, more mature outlook. Also seems to be a popular choice for teacher student/ teachers pet fantasies and BDMS kink stuff if you go by the AO3 tags.

Other death eaters make for a great dark set up for non/dub con, manipulation, BDMS and dark Hermione. Bellatrix pairing seems to often be about exploration of stockholm symptom, imprisonment or torture themes, although sometimes redemption plots as well.

I don't actively ship anyone in the Harry Potter fandom or care much for romance fics, but I still would prefer to read a darker Hermione pairing than her paired with someone like Dean or even Ginny. I realize that the pairings are often messed up, but I find the plots to be more interesting to read about and these fics have less sappy relationship fluff.

**** I get Bellatrix and Bellatrix only for death eater pairings, and that's mostly due to a similar logic to what Ianthine9 was saying about Pre-HBP Snape. We know enough about Bellatrix to have a image in our mind when she is brought up, but not enough information to see how she became who she is and where she is at in her character arc. Also it has enough well written stories (including an excellent AU which just tosses out all the baggage) so it's inevitable that people want more stories with the pairing. The movies are a huge influence too, because Helena Bonham Carter is a well known, beautiful, passionate actor who has a connection (an bad one granted) with Hermione in the the last movies.

****** Don't get me wrong, I'm not at all interested in Hermione being paired with most of these people. But I'm also not interested in reading yet another ordinary teen romance where nothing much happens. Those sorts of pairings are best in fics where there's a strong main plot about something else. If you want to have a romance-focused fic, the relationship needs to be interesting enough to carry the whole story.

**** Once upon a time (in the pre-hbp days, when we knew so little about Snape as a character) it was a fairly logical pairing for people who imagined Hermione growing up to be 110% done with the bullshit and who imagined Snape to be an asshole who was an asshole cause he was a smart guy who was stuck in a job he hated for Reasons. It was easy to cast Snape as a sort of brooding anti-hero who was able to match Hermione in intelligence. It was one of my favorite pairings back in the day. It was a lot better of a pairing when so much more of the characters were left to the author's imagination

Then DH came around and, well, it's stopped being one of my favorite pairings. I still go back and read the fic that was written pre-DH, and especially pre-HBP, but anything that tries to reconcile what we learned about Snape in the last two books with what made HG/SS good has a lot of work ahead of them, and I've only read one or two fics that did it well.

** Draco is an "interesting" (for lack of a better word) character to write since he's "darker" while still being (sort of) redeemable, such as when he's shown in HBP struggling over his mission to kill Dumbledore and his behavior in the epilogue. "Bad boy"/"edgy" characters are popular, and Tom Felton is also pretty attractive.

Hermione's the female character given the most development. So fans of "redeeming an edgy guy!!" pairings will be drawn to Dramione. The same is true for Tom Riddle, Jr. and Lucius Malfoy.

Not sure about Greyback or Rowle though.

** I'm actually pretty into Lumione (judge away). I think a lot of it is because I started reading it when I was 15, and was into older men. Plus, Jason Isaacs is so goddamn handsome. And many contained BDSM elements, or forced circumstance, which I was into it. I also like them as fantasy -- I don't want those relationships as an adult /at all/, and in fact have only had very healthy relationships. But I still contain that teenage impulse, what can I say?

I still read them, somewhat out of habit, but I do recognise most of them are predicated on bad premises, and too many don't do the work to redeem Lucius, if that's their aim. A lot of them also have a habit of making Hermione very OOC -- very submissive (not in a D/s way, just her whole personality), and weak. I hate those. Coming back to FF as an adult, I realise there is very little good Lumione fic out there -- which is a shame because I'd still like to read it. I'm also not into dubcon the way I used to be.

I don't understand Snape, and never well, but it's probably hypocritical of me. Glass houses and all that.

** Just like Harry is the most common male self-insertion when immersing yourself, Hermione is the most common female self-insertion.

Basically, people identify with Hermione, and they like the thought of being together with a certain person (the movies "help" a lot here), so they write fics pairing Hermione with said person. Draco and Tom ticks people's "bad boy" urges, and Snape ticks the "dark and mysterious with a troubled past" box. No matter how unrealistic the pairings are when you think it over for more than 5 seconds (especially HGTR -- the other 2 can be written if you try hard enough, but it's far below the "most likely candidates" and requires significant groundwork).

This is why Harry and Hermione has far more pairings with various people than everyone else.

** Who's the most beautiful female teen casting in the movies? Hermione. Who's the most handsome male teen casting in the movies? Draco.

Weird pairings are bound to happen, because people project themselves into these characters and want to explore the world.
