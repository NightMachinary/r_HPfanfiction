I was wondering what the different characters called their parents. Mom, Dad, Mother, Father, Da, Ma, Mum, Daddy? Has anyone made a list of all the “nicknames” or terms of endearment different people have used for each other that shows it? Or just a list of what characters are called by other characters?

​

Specifically I'm interested in Luna with her father and mother. The Weasley kids with Mr and Mrs Weasley. Draco with his parents. And honestly, anyone else you know of might be helpful.

​

Unfortunately I don't have digital copies to do a quick search (or even all the books on hand) so if someone could help me out I would really appreciate it. I know its a little detail but I would prefer to get it right in my story if I could.

​

Edit: Thanks everyone who has commented so far. I thought I had remembered Luna calling her father Daddy but I wasn't certain. It's nice to have it confirmed. Mum and Dad for most with friends. Mother and father with people they are less close to and mother and father with Draco and Percy. Mam for Seamus. Again. Thank you.


** Luna calls her dad 'daddy' many times in the book. Ron is mum and Dad, And almost all the other characters would do the same.

A northern character might call their mum 'mam' And a character from Birmingham might call their mum 'mom'. But the vast majority of British people use mum and dad. Mother and father is a bit old fashioned, I've never met anyone who calls their parents that.

Ma and Da is Irish.

Basically you can't go wrong with mum and dad.

** Luna calls her dad "Daddy" pretty regularly. She refers to her mum as\\
"my mum" or "my mother," since we never see them interact, obviously. Everyone else in the books pretty much always uses "dad" and "mum," with the exception of Draco, who of course uses "father." ;)

** I don't think anyone was called “mom” anyway since it was set in the UK

*** In the US edition of the first book (at least the one I have; maybe they changed it in later editions), Harry and the Weasleys use "mom." It's switched back to "mum" in the rest of the books, but it still trips up American readers occasionally.

** I think Luna called her dad "father", and Ron called his parents "mom and dad", just based on their personality

*** As [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] pointed out, no Brit outside of Birmingham would use the term "mom". And Ron lives in Devon, not the West Midlands.
