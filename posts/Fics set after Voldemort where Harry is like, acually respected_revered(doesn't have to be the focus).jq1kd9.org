It seems in every fic set after Harry beats Voldemort there are like, a couple of folks whom become big fans but most of the the written characters are like "Oh yeah, you, whatever". I would like a fic where Harry, is like, acually treated like someone whom died, came back to life and destroyed Voldemort would be. Not saying everyone has to like, freak the fuck out every time he does anything, but like, fics that show even folks like Malfoy or his teachers as like like, kinda in awe of him. Maybe showing the Weasley's having to like, figure out how reconcile this person they love like family but whom they also have now just, the most ridiculous level of respect for.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

** Linkffn(3850462) is a good one. Maybe not quite what you're looking for but definitely in that direction.

  James Potter wants to be a Weasley. His mum, aunts, uncles, and grandparents tell him why it's pretty cool to be a Potter, too.

** I've been hijacking a few posts like yours because I've been hoping someone will help me find one fic I read once on this topic. At the end of the war Harry is really worshipped as the hero he is but since people are really outraged at all the people who were close to Death Eaters, even if they had no part in the war (such as Andromeda or the Greengrass sisters), Harry advocates for forgiveness and peace in order to protect Teddy. One of the main themes of the story is how fickle the public admiration is, since after Harry holds his speech, everyone starts hating him. I cannot remember either where I read the story or what it was called, but it was really well written and covered several themes that you would not usually find in a JK written book such as PTSD, the post-war chaos after an entire government is removed, the downsides of celebrity, forgiveness and friendship. Also the Death Eater trials are done in a very realistic way.

**** No but after Harry fucks up his public addressing, he does get called "the champion of Slytherin" or something. And at the end he holds a rally for all the misfits to join him in the final battle in order to prove that not all Slytherins are as bad as people think.

  What if Hermione's parents had pulled her out of Hogwarts after she was nearly killed by a basilisk in her second year? How would Harry have managed without her? Years later, she returns and learns about his life in her absence. H/Hr
