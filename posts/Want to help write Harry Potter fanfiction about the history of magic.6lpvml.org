Two months and a half ago (about an in character year), we released Model Hogwarts, a [[https://discord.gg/SPkBB3B][discord]] role playing simulation for wizards and witches who /just/ missed their acceptance letters. Just to catch you up:\\
The year started great! Well, great until some students found a bottle of firewhiskey. Don't worry, the caretaker is still getting used to his duties around the castle. When classes began, a mysterious ghost started appearing around Hogwarts, provoking students that antagonized it. Professors had to come to the student's aid, and some of the students ended up in the infirmary after losing a duel with the ghost, but by the end of the year by gaining clues and solving challenges, the students solved the mystery!

Classes are going well, and everyone is excited for the new year! In Transfiguration, for example, they discussed the theory and origins of magic, and in Defense Against the Dark Arts they learned about magical creatures and classifications. We started off the year with the basic classes (Charms, Transfiguration, Astronomy, Potions, and Defense), however we have gone through three history of magic professors! We're starting to think this is worse than the defense curse... So we need someone to prove our superstitions wrong! Someone excited to make up stories and timelines! If you think this is you, we'd love to hear from you and have you fill out our application and join our discord server (linked below). If you don't feel comfortable teaching History of Magic but would like to teach in general feel free to apply for any subject on the professor application sheet. We will gladly consider your application! Or maybe you'll come up with an original class!

*Why are we advertising this on [[/r/HPFanfiction]]?*

I know most of the requests on here will probably be for specific fics or prompts, but this is an opportunity to teach by telling stories, as well as RPing with students and faculty if you like RPing. It's a chance to give assignments and read/critique student writing, and let your imagination go wild. We only know so much about canon history, the rest is yours to invent.

You get to join a team of super passionate teachers who want you to succeed in whatever subject you want to teach! You get access to a castle of students (we currently have ~40 active students!) and as much creativity as you can dream of. You would teach two 30min-1 hour classes, depending on your availability and how many students sign up for your class, one for first years and one for second years. You get a small class size of 5-10 on average of engaged students.

** *What do you need to be a professor?*

   :END:
First of all, you need to love Harry Potter. You need to be willing to devote an hour or two every week to classes and our weekly staff meeting, but we hope you'll have so much fun that you'll stay longer. You need to be passionate about making this project succeed, and invested in its future. You need to be able to work well with others, and be creative!

So, if you're interested, apply! We'd love to have you, so start packing your suitcase, Hogwarts offers a great (/very safe/) opportunity for teachers, and is world renown! Fill out our quick [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMzeCoyXl9LDz98Fwhb8N_APh--uG720e19ZUlqIkEyq7a_g/viewform?usp=sf_link][application]] and then check out our [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelHogwarts/comments/658v71/introduction_post/][subreddit]] for details, before hopping onto the [[https://discord.gg/SPkBB3B][discord server.]]

If this sounds awesome, and you'd rather attend as a student this year, check out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelHogwarts/comments/658v71/introduction_post/][our reddit post]] for more information for signing up as a student (and still join the discord!).


** It's a great sim. Be sure to apply!
