I'm just wondering how you all keep track of the fan fictions you have read, or plan on reading.

Personally, I do all of my reading on my phone, so I have a ton of folders in my mobile bookmarks that are sorted into like: completed, unstarted, no more interest, unupdated, etc.

I usually leave a small blurb at the end of the bookmark title (<25 characters) and a rating (which are always random xD some are out of 5, some 10, and some have other random numbers like 7 or 13).

Please share your methods below :)


** I just bookmark the ones i like or am waiting for updates on incase i want to reread them. The omes im currently reading are usually open in multiple tabs

*** Haha I feel you. I have 2 different browser (one with an adblock for fun links) that are both around 90 tabs open >.<

Do you have your bookmarks sorted in any way? Or just a while bunch you need to sort through at some point?

**** Organized chaos i guess? I have a bunch of fics im waiting for updates on from ffn followed so if they update i get an email ao3 is harder cause update emails from there get spam foldered for some reason but i domt have many there.

Most tabs for fics ive had was around 35 at one point. After i lost that cause my phone went stupid i started bookmarking them all and if i decided to drop them id jist delete them from the folder.

***** If you mark your fic to read later on ao3, then go to history you will see if it has been updated since you last viewed it, that's how I keep track of the on going projects I'm currently reading. The only downside is that you cannot filter your marked for later.

** I'm surprised it's not here yet: the AO3 subscription feature!

I subscribe to ongoing fics on AO3 and get an email update whenever the author publishes a new chapter. It's pretty reliable---emails come through within an hour of the new chapter going live---and I have a record of what I've read and not read yet. It saves me work, as I never have to think about which fics I've checked recently, and it's easier for me to manage than keeping a bunch of tabs open. The email also tells you the meta details of the fic, like title, summary, tags, author, etc., so it's easy enough to remember the context of the fic when I go to read the chapter.

*** Exactly, and the Follow feature on ffn and other sites. Then I just wait for the emails. When I get an update email I delete the previous one so my inbox isn't too cluttered. Stories I like I favourite on ffn or bookmark on AO3. If I need to I can go back through the alert/favourite lists on ffn, and bookmarks and subscriptions on AO3.

Plus I've got alerts set on the sites so I get emails if I get replies to my reviews or PMs.

No need to go looking for updates.

** I have an excel sheet since I just can never keep up with anything.

So I copy and paste most things in there to catagories it by genre and era etc. It's nice to have it all in one place.

Also there's a great satisfaction in seeing how many fics ive read 😋

** I keep a spreadsheet for the stuff I've read, as well as downloading it onto my kindle. I use the “mark for later” button on AO3 to make a list of things I want to read and go to that when I want something new. I generally don't follow incomplete works, but the few I do I have the series bookmarked and I check in on them every now and then.

** I have bookmarked about nearly 60 on my ao3 account. I have marked the ones that are WIPs so I can easily check in if any have been updated. I also have started to write a short summary into personal notes because it sucks when you see a deleted story in your bookmarks but you can't remember for the live of you what it was.

I don't read nearly as much on fanfiction.net but I usually bookmark them in my google account.

** I bookmark the Fics I read on ao3(closr to 100, diff fandoms), then sort them by Update date. That way I get the newest updates to show 1st.

If I read a finished fic and I like it enough, I save it to my phone. ao3 works wonders for me.

** I have four top-level folders: 'Currently Reading', 'Awaiting New Chapters', 'Read', and 'Archived'.

Currently Reading has two subfolders - new and rereading.

Awaiting New Chapters is just one folder with a long list of fics bookmarked to the last uploaded chapter. Things stay in there until they're complete, then I delete 'em. Doesn't matter if they're WIPs, on Hiatus, or completely Abandoned, I leave a bookmark there until they're complete.

Read has five subfolders - To-Calibre (when I've decided I like a fic enough to bother bookmarking it, a bookmark of the first chapter goes in here and I fanficfare it, even if I'm not done reading it yet), Non-Calibre (anything from a site that Fanficfare doesn't recognise or in a format that doesn't download), Lists for Later (any time I find a good thread, search parameter, or post on something with a list of fics I might wanna revisit, I bookmark it here), Non-working Links to find other copies of (does what it says on the tin), and Finished (where I put the bookmarks once I've calibre'ed 'em).

When they're in Finished, they get put into a folder with a short code to represent the fandom (Harry Potter is HP, Life is Strange is LiS, Pitch Perfect is PP, etc) and a tiny snippet definition to sort them by. That snippet is what I regard as the primary 'thing' for that collection of fics - eg. I have 'cowboy Harry', 'Harry/Fleur with Sap', 'Harry/Fleur with Drama', 'Specialist Misanthropic Harry with a Cause', 'Harry is an angsty crankypants', etc. I have a hundred or so of those. Some have two fics in, others have more.

Archived is just a big list of bookmarks from my old collection that I haven't gotten around to resorting yet. They're all calibre'ed, I just can't remember what the hell any of them are, so I'm slowly working my way through 'til I can get 'em all sorted.

** I wish FFN had more options than follow and favorite. My personal categories are:

1. mark for later (A03 has this option)
2. actively reading / follow for updates
3. mark as read, but not a favorite. Don't want to accidentally waste my time in the future by re-reading one of these
4. favorite

On FFN, I wound up creating a community for the express purpose of accomplish #1 (mark for later) in order to clean up my follow list. I copied the idea of someone else (thank you to that mystery person) and it has worked pretty well.

Unfortunately, FFN only lets me create one community, meaning that #3 and 4 above can't be separated and I have to use my memory.

** I don't. Usually I go for recommendations that are below 200k words. If I like it, I read it. However there are a lot these days and often time I forget them... few had made an impression on me and I remember those. For some reason I tend to remember better those that I read when the HP fanfiction community was in its early days (but then again I was like 10 so any cool idea made a big impression on me), many of them no longer exist and for many I can't remember the name but I can remember the plots quite accurately.
