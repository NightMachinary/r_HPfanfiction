I've recently read an old post ([[/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9rq2jb/what_are_the_plot_holes_in_the_series/]]) about the plotholes in HP and wanted to add my two bits to the discussion and perhaps pick your brains on possible explanations of the events that seem like a plothole, yet may not be.

1) Fake Moody, Barty Crouch Jr., borrows the Marauder's Map in GoF, is never seen to give it back. Harry still has it in the next book.

Explanation: Dumbledore, or any other teacher, returned it to Harry's possession after searching through the faker's belongings.

2) Marcus Flint sticks around for a year longer than is supposed to graduate.

Explanation: Failed his NEWTs so his family forced him to attend further. (Though I honestly think this is bad planning on Jo's part.)

3) Lily and James die on the night of Oct 31. Harry is delivered at Privet Drive on the night of Nov 1. Where was he during the next 24 hours?

Explanation: Hagrid arrives with the baby at Hogwarts and looks after him under Dumbledore's orders. McGonagall is sent to observe the Dursley household. Dumbledore investigates what happened in Godric's Hollow, checks on Harry's health and reports his findings to the ministry. The news is leaked immediately, thus the wizard-kind take to the streets to celebrate. Dumbledore decides on a course of action and sends a patronus, or an owl, to Hagrid with the orders to bring Harry to Privet Drive.

4) The overly long and complicated plan in GoF. Fake Moody's long performance that, against all logic, isn't discovered.

Explanation: The ritual may need certain elements that take time to prepare or may only be performed under specific conditions that are unexplained, like most of the magic is in HP world. Voldemort managed to infiltrate the ministry at the beginning of the seventh book, a month or so after the death of Dumbledore. It isn't explained how he accomplished that, same as it isn't explained why it is Voldemort used such a complicated plan because it isn't necessary. Most of the books are from Harry's perspective and we all know he's not the most knowledgeable character, and I also doubt Dumbledore would feel the need to explain the specifics to a traumatised Harry.

On how Dumbledore didn't realise Moody was an imposter. I don't find it difficult to believe Dumbledore didn't exactly have time to ponder the few times he sees Moody acting strangely. The moment we see Moody, it is explained, through Ron and other Gryffindors, that Moody has been acting strange for a long time and that he's considered obsessively paranoid. Someone who is that paranoid would avoid other people at every opportunity. Add that to the Dumbledore's already crowded schedule and he just trusts the man he thinks the imposter is and doesn't investigate. No matter the portrayal, Dumbledore is no god. He's not omniscient. He's a man.

5) Harry's escape to the Burrow in DH. Why did the order use such a ridiculous scheme instead of taking a portkey or other instant teleportation methods?

Explanation: While I haven't read the DH recently, I have re-watched the movie a week or so ago, so I'm not sure if this scene exists in the book but after the death of Muggle Studies professor, Snape tells Voldemort of the plan to take Harry to the Burow, and explains how the other date told by a fellow death eater is just a false lead. That means someone in the order knew Snape was one of the good guys, I think either Moody, Remus or McGonagall, otherwise, Snape wouldn't know about the plan. They might have used that opportunity to strengthen Snape's position as Voldemort's most trusted.

6) Why didn't Dumbledore investigate the Horcruxes before HBP?

Explanation: In CoS, Harry gives the diary to Dumbledore who investigates what, exactly, is the magic at play. He discovers Horcruxes. Before he can research the subjects further, Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and his attention is diverted to the safety and protection of Harry Potter, whose safety is more important. He can investigate the matter further, as Voldemort isn't back yet. The danger, while still substantial, is yet to come.

During PoA, the talks about Triwizard tournament begins, further dividing his attention. During the tournament, his attention is wholly on Hogwarts and the tournament, he has no time to investigate.

In OotP, he begins his investigation in earnest and learns all he can about Horcruxes and begins suspecting Harry's tragic circumstances. Harry's dreams are further proof that, against all hopes, he has a piece of Voldemort in his scar. He starts researching ways to find a way to get rid of it without killing the vessel, Harry. He orders Snape to teach Harry occlumency to see if the dangers of the connection can be mitigated and to see if it has any effects, though he doubts they would get lucky enough for the second part to be true. In the sixth year, he signs his death by putting on the ring, thus he starts making a new plan, one that hurts him as much as, if not more than, the curse he's living with. He doesn't have time to find a cure, so Harry has to die.

"Either must die at the hand of the other..." He realised it doesn't actually say one of them must die. It says both of them must die. But that raises the question, how can Harry defeat Voldemort if he's dead? "Maybe... maybe he can survive his death." He grips his wand. "Maybe he can be the one to actually conquer death." Thus, a new plan born. It is risky, and unlikely, but stranger things have happened. This is the boy who survived the killing curse. Maybe he can do so again, but this time without the sarcifice of his mother?

"Sarcifice of his mother?" Now that's an idea. Harry, a boy who killed a fucking basilisk to save a girl he barely knows, the boy who jumped on the back of a troll and fought off hundreds of dementors to save his loved ones. He is the definition of 'self-sacrificing'. So, maybe, even if he doesn't survive, he can save everyone else, but only if his sacrifice is made under certain conditions. Only if Voldemort's horcruxes are already destroyed.

P.S: Damn, I think I'm going to write a story of Dumbledore's perspective of the cannon. That was intense.

1353135: No one notices Peter Pettigrew's name on the map.

Explanation: Selective attention. He's just a name to the Twins and Harry and co. His name means nothing. And when it does, Harry immediately sees Pettigrew's name and investigates but before he can figure it out, Lupin takes the map, and by that time, the rat is living around Hagrid's hut, probably out of map's range.

64684: Fidelus. Why didn't James or Lily act as the secret keeper?

Explanation: Fidelus is latin for loyal, devoted, trust worthy. I presume the spell needs someone trusted to act as the protector of the spell and its contents. Having the protected act as the protector defeats one of the most important parts of the components. Or as [[/u/Fredrick1994]] points out: "My personal fanon on that charm is that it can't truly be used directly to protect the Secret-Keeper, and that it needs absolute trust in the person who acts as Secret-Keeper."

65165465465: Why did Hagrid take Harry to Diagon Alley and why did he take the stone in front of Harry?

Explanation: Knowing Hagrid's devotion to baby Harry, Dumbledore decided the gentle giant would be the best person to do the job and also put the fear of god... Hagrid into the Dursley family. He used the opportunity to discreetly transfer the stone from Gringotts to Hogwarts because Hagrid going to Gringotts any other day may have attracted notice.

687675434: Why the protections were seemingly tailored to Harry and the co? Did Dumbledore want Harry to confront Voldemort?

Explanation: He needed protections that wouldn't be too hard to pass as the real trap was the mirror itself. And maybe he thought it would be a good chance to create a sort of playground for the students, as Voldemort couldn't take the risk of attacking the students, he would have a harder time of investigating the protections, thus delaying him further.

There is one point here I'm having a trouble explaining and that's Quirrel and how Dumbledore didn't realise the truth. But still, I doubt he wanted a Harry vs. Tom scene.

There are further suggested 'plotholes' but I'm having a trouble remembering and getting tired. If you remember any, please point out so we can discuss.

It was explained in the books in Snape's memories that Dumbledore came up with the scheme, had Snape Confund Mundungus Fletcher into presenting it to the Order as his own scheme, as well as changing the date of the departure. And yes; it was a plan meant to assure Voldemort that Snape had turned coat on the Order completely.

*** Since the whole thing could have been done without any risk with portkeys we can only assume that Dumbledore thinks Snape's position as a spy is worth risking the life of half the Order and Harry. And it's not like Voldemort would have suddenly distrusted Snape if he told him "the Potter boy will be transported by portkey, there's nothing we can do" because that would have been the reasonable thing for the Order to do, the one that Voldemort probably expected anyways. Also, Snape only told him the date anyways, so I doubt that was the one and only way for Snape to cement his loyalty.

But even if Dumbledore has his reasons and everything, why did the Order ever agree to that plan in the first place? They got the idea from Mundungus Fletcher, who is probably the least trustworthy and able member of the Order and even if anyone else had recommended it they should have realized the idiocy of the plan immediately.

**** I would assume the easiest explanation would be that the occupants of Hogwarts are really used to intermittent ambient noises. Considering Harry asked if the others heard a voice, they wouldn't be thinking a hissing or distant stone grinding sound could be what Harry was referring to; the sound would be too easily explained by any number of other sources. The simplist source im thinking of would be the moving staircase that near constantly is making a stone against stone grinding sound at random levels of the castle. That sound when reverberating off of multiple stone walls could come off as a distant hissing sound in certain locations of the castle, so the kids would assume a hissing sound would be the staircase moving.

Didn't Harry/Hermione/Ron just get off of the staircases when Harry started hearing the voice? Seems like they would think a hissing sound would be a staircase moving far away from them.

#+end_quote

Unlikely, as that implies Hagrid flew first to Hogwarts, and there's no Invisibility Booster mentioned on Sirius' Bike like the Weasley's Car has. Godric's Hollow is in the West Country/Devon to the Highlands of Scotland, somewhere near Inverness and Loch Ness. (Highlands near a Loch, it's the best guess on Hogwarts Location) That's over 600 miles and THEN flew the same Motorcycle from Hogwarts to Surrey. That's another 560 odd miles.

We know Hagrid can be irresponsible, but carrying a baby on a flying Motorcycle close to 1200 miles is a stretch even for him, isn't it?

Technically a Plothole, and from an interviiew "JKR: I know, exactly! That's how I feel as well. Yeah, so okay. Obviously Dumbledore could cast a spell on a dwelling that would immediately alert him if something happened to it. (SU: Oh.) So he could know instantaneously. That's not a problem at all. And then he could dispatch Hagrid and so on. I think The Scottish Book will have to answer that question. (SU, MA, and JN laugh) I'm gonna have to really go back through notes and either admit that I lost twenty four hours or I don't know, hurriedly come up with some back story to fill in. (SU laughs) Either way, you either get to be right, or you get more story. So you can't complain."

** 5) Harry escaping? Well Snape got the info from Mundungus who is too useless to keep information. But he wasn't in the "Light" side anymore (at least to Voldemort's eyes) so he hadn't even to give this information to Voldemort to consolidate his place as he wasn't supposed to get such info in the first place. He could just have said nothing and still give Mundungus the idea to portkey Harry earlier or something like this. But hey, it was Dumbledore's portrait plan so... as always with him, why do simple.

64684) I also like that a Fidelius secret couldn't be given to a protected person as it wouldn't really be a show of trust. But why not put Dumbledore as Secret Keeper? There was hardly any easier choice as he'd have been so hard to get the information from and really who could think him a traitor? Pettigrew? Ok they may not have thought him possibly a traitor compared to werewolf Remus and Black Sirius (and even this is a weak argument as I don't think James wouldn't have trusted them after so knowing them for so long) but clearly when it comes to fighting capabilities, Sirius (and Remus? I don't remember if he stated it or not) seemed to think Pettigrew the least talented of them and clearly a follower so I would think James would think so too so why give him the secret as he would have been the easiest to break.

687675434) "A playground for students" Sorry but that's like the worst idea ever. All those traps could have killed unsuspecting students while letting Voldemort pass unscathed. It would have been way more intelligent to make harder traps that would have make it even harder and longer to analyze and while passing through it, would have fatigued Voldemort if he had to fight him later. Still using the mirror (maybe as a trap but I doubt JKR thought so hard about that) while not putting the real stone in it as more protection (secretively giving it back to the Flamel or putting it under Fidelius). As for the student safety, an age line and a Caterwauling Charm would have avoided useless risks of injuries while letting only adults and informing Dumbledore if someone was to try to access this place.

875) Another thing that could be passed as negligence from Dumbledore, how could he not know it was a Basilisk if Hermione found it. Potentially dangerous beast most likely linked to snakes that can petrify (+Myrtle -> maybe kill?). Even if he hadn't thought the chicken killed as another clue, the rest should have been enough. Last, how come no Ghost or portrait saw such a huge beast while it was roaming in the corridor. Ok he was mostly moving through pipes but the petrified students weren't attacked in pipes. This is possible that it was not seen but I think it highly unlikely.

I once read an interesting one in which Lily suspected James to be the traitor, and therefore the Fidelius couldn't be cast upon him, nor her, because their trust was broken.

***** We know magical ownership can be a big deal in the series. It's entirely possible that the issue here is property ownership. Since James owned the Potter estate, he cannot be the secret keeper if a condition for the spell is that the true owner must trust /someone else/ to keep their secret. Lily is disqualified for the same reason- by marrying James, she was recognized as a Potter with a joint claim to the property, shared with James.

However, I can't recall if Shell Cottage /belonged/ to Bill and Fleur, or if they were just /borrowing/ it from someone else. If they owned it, my theory holds no water. But if they were just borrowing it (from Great Aunt Muriel, I think), then Bill and Fleur aren't disqualified from being secret keepers because it's still somebody else's property, magically and officially speaking. As long as they merely borrow the property, they can be the secret keeper on behalf of the real owner.

** I believe JKR said something at some point about Harry sneaking back in to get the map back off-page and later regretting that she didn't take the opportunity to dispose of it permanently.

As for how Dumbleore was fooled... well, he's good, but he's not infallible. Barty is the only character to successfully fool him in the entire series, backstories included. Grindelwald kind of did, but manipulated emotions more than anything else. And Barty, frankly, was brilliant. He'd already demonstrated a solid acting ability in court, plus Moody was right there in his room to be interrogated at will.

The plan might seem a little convoluted at first glance, but it would have allowed Voldemort to return without it being publicised. People would have presumed Harry had been killed in the maze and as a bonus, it would have destroyed both Dumbledore and the Ministry. We also don't know the requirements of the ritual. Some form of trial or hardship may have been required within a certain time range to prove their emnity.
