  I had always been confident of my place in the world. But as my friends were one by one corrupted by the whispers of a rising terror, I found my world turned upside down. Soon, I would be forced to make the decision between sticking by the ones I loved, or fighting for what I believed was right. Sirius/OC

  [SIRIUSxOC] It seemed they had met their perfect match. He's arrogant, talented, and a Gryffindor. She's poised, brilliant, and a Slytherin. They may be the perfect pair, but every rose has its thorns, even for Gryffindor's beloved Sirius Black and Slytherin's Princess Tessa Rosier. A love story during the rise of a Wizarding War.

** linkffn(10841322) is about a canon compliant Muggle OC/Sirius set in OotP. It's pretty decent and a quick read at 44k. There are a few other stories in the series, but I think Dark Birthright is the best of the bunch and the rest are a step or two behind. (They get more fanfiction-y)

#+begin_quote
  Working in the Ministry archives, Julia finds a document she really has no business seeing. When she discovers that the Muggle world is threatened by an ancient and terrifying evil, she seeks Albus Dumbledore's help. He sends her to Twelve Grimmauld Place where she has to persuade the enigmatic, troubled, and very bad-tempered Sirius Black to help save the world.
