** I based this tree on physical resemblance between the various species. Note that I may go back and classify Ghouls as Large-People rather than ogroids, because I'm not quite sure. On the one hand, they clearly look more like trolls than ogres. On the other hand, the wiki refers to them as "buck-toothed ogres", suggesting a close link to ogres. What do you think?

Not included:

- Acromantulas and Manticores, who, in spite of being sapient, clearly didn't evolve from humans.
- Centaurs and Sphinxes, who can't really have /evolved/ from humans either --- I'd guess they were created by wizards consciously altering themselves with magic.
- Dementors and Poltergeists, who, not being made of conventional matter, are also probably something else entirely.

** Humanoid may be the wrong classification here. All of these species are "humanoid" - "of human-like appearance". The overall logic of it is alright, I guess. I wouldn't see anything wrong with it in an EU or AU fic. Its just that the classifications may need a bit of rework.

Also, I think you forgot Gnomes. They are sentient (though of very low intelligence), so I guess they'd qualify for this evolutionary tree.

With vampires I'm not sure if this is all that accurate as well. They're more of a mutation, undead humans, are they not? I'd also question if Veelas are an actual different species, or more of a race of humans. After all, they can reproduce with humans - but then again, you could just "lol Magic" that away.... you can, after all, reproduce with giants and goblins as well.

*** Yes, I'd say veela are more of a different species, like goblins and co. And HP Vampires may be a species rather than a werewolf-like curse, since we know of a 'half-vampire'.

As for gnomes, I followed the idea that they are not truly sentient, but more like mandrakes of pixies --- creatures to whom ambient magic gave human-like traits even though they're no more humans than an automaton.

**** Fair enough. Have you thought about the classification thing?

***** Well, 'Humanoid' here had a different meaning, on par with 'Goblinoid' and 'Elvoid'. Any thoughts for an alternate name?

****** Can't really think of any. I'm just saying that the word is pre-defined.
