Big glowing eyes in the dark of pureblood mansions, watching through the night...


** Never seen one myself, but I can imagine that if house elves watched everything all the time, that would make for some awkward scenes. You know how some dogs follow you everywhere and stare at the [[https://barkpost.com/answers/why-does-my-dog-follow-me-to-the-bathroom/][most]] [[https://www.fatherly.com/health-science/why-dogs-watch-people-have-sex/][embarassing]] times? Now imagine that you can't keep the dog out because it teleports, and you'll start to get an idea of how strange living as a pureblood might be.

(sorry for the disturbing mental images. I'd offer [[/r/brainbleach][r/brainbleach]], but now you probably /don't/ want to see pictures of someone's dog.)

** I have read exactly one such fic, though I don't remember the name, and it's kind of a reveal that the house elves are the horrors.

Also, I didn't care for it.
