Looking for stories that are similar to The Black Bunny. With Harry/Tom Riddle/Voldemort by windseeker2305. Would love some suggestions, and any that have Tom as a cute animagus (ex: black bunny, lol) The black bunny part is not required, ;) he could turn into a kitten.

Thank you for reading this.


** Anything by RenderedReversed is perfection. I think she's more active on AO3, so just look her up there. She's got a bit of a problem with finishing her fics though xD Still, the journey is always filled with endless feels.

** I suppose linkffn(A Snake Named Voldemort) is close? I enjoyed it.

But in regards to good fics? Kyella is 100% right, RenderedReversed is a brilliant author. The Fictionist also does complete AUs while staying true to their characters and I'd rec any of their fics.
