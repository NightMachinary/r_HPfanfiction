Oooooh. I love the Ravenclaw and other house badges. Where do they come from?


** They were the original flair issued on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], so if you got it there it shows up here. But then they changed the flair to match Pottermore, but this subreddit kept the old badges. Which is good, because I actually like these better. I think you can get them by applying to a house on [[/r/harrypotter]].

** I guess we'll never know. I was wondering myself.

** The mods can assign them. I'd shoot a mod mail and ask how many chocolate frogs it takes to get some flair. Or shamelessly plug, like below

I'd love to see some yellow and black on here, seeing as I'm a proud Puff in the HP boards. Hint hint mama badger...
