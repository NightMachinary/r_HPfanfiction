** They had the /entire/ library of bad HP fanfics at their disposal to make fun of and this is the level of satire they managed to come up with?

** Me from four years ago though HP fan fiction was nothing but Draco & Harry sex scenes.

After reading HP fan fiction nearly constantly over the last year, I'm pretty sure that's not the case.

** It truly is unfortunate people perceive fanfiction this way. While much of fanfiction is terrible, not many people read or care about those fics.

Many of the better works in fanfiction outdo most books and novels /by far/.
