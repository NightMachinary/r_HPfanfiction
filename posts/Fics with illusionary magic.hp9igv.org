I've just finished reading linkffn(The Wizarding Chronicles : Return of the True Descendant), where harry uses illusions and I really loved that concept. Are there any other fics that use illusionary magic?

** Illusion magic is very interesting to me, and I like the idea that it doesn't exist for a very simple reason: It takes more work to force magic to not make stuff. An illusion of a bear is more work than an actual bear.

The only instance of illusion magic I can think of is the potion Albus drank in the sixth book.

*** Well for illusions, instead of not making something, it could also only make light to fool the eye or for more advanced illusions it creates light, sound, smell and everything else except touch

I think Grimmauld place might've been hidden by illusions given it literally pops out of nowhere (although it been a while since I've read the books) but that could've been the fidelus charm too

**** Realistically, it would be easier to do the illusion or influence their brain with a vague suggestion.

But I really like the headcanon idea that magic doesn't really /do that/. That magic is literally more prone to make the bear. Magic is sorta turning your illusory fantasies into reality, so if you want the illusion of a bear, magic fills in the blanks and makes an actual living bear.

***** Yeah i like that headcanon too, I was just pointing out some other ways it could be done. And yeah realistically it would be much easier to feed the illusion directly to the brain.
