:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
He goes to Durmstrang at 11, makes friends with Daphne and some other people. There are no Houses like in Hogwarts, but students can start their own groups and get rewarded points for them. In the meantime, Harry is trained by Voldemort, who demands perfection from him. I think in the later chapters Harry also goes to Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament & enters it, and then Voldemort gets angry at him for that? Anyway, what is this fic? Does someone know? Pls help

  After Lily's death, her elder son was sent to live with the Dursleys. Abused for six years, Harry was rescued and adopted by Voldemort. He grows into his powers as the Dark Lord's heir at Durmstrang and, eventually, Hogwarts. Before the end, Harry has to face his biological family once more as the heir to the Dark Lord. Dark!Harry (adopted)Father!Voldemort
