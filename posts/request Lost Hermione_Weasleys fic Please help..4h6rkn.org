Hey guys

I've been reading fanfic for years, and about 8 years ago I read a fic about Hermione and the Weasleys. It's a def NC-17 so look away now if easily offended!

I think it was called 'Seven' or something like that. Either a dare or a drinking game ends up with Hermione having to sleep her way through all the Weasley siblings. It's a fic which goes into detail about the different approaches of each sibling to the act..

I've been searching for years (knowing my luck someone will link it on FF.net) so any help appreciated. Thanks guys!


** I know this one with all the Weasel kids except Percy, Ron and Ginny taking her simultaneously: [[http://inell.livejournal.com/439126.html][Just This Once]].

*** Okay...well to address a few issues raised here

1) I don't know if some people prefer to stay away from NC17 rated fics. Some people dislike hearing about them and reading about them. I was being courteous and giving people the chance to click out if so needed. For instance if someone was looking for a Fic about rape or incest, I wouldn't be interested.

2.) I can't remember the initial catalyst for the Fic. I think this is the most likely starting point hence I've written down. It may be Hermione herself just wanted to do it. It's been a while.

3.) As your so interested, this is why I'm looking for it. It was the piece of writing that led me to realise that sex is different with different people . I'm a rape survivor and refused to let people touch me. In the grand tradition of things, I stumbled across this Fic in a late night browsing session and started reading before I realised how explicit it was. It served as a way to realise that not all experiences are the same. Fanfic exists as a way to continue a story yes , but a lot of people use it to explore various facets of themselves . I want to see how well it held up, and it's a bit like saying goodbye to an old friend who helped me.

You seem to have taken personal affront to this request. That's fine. But I've addressed the issues you have raised to the best of my ability and explained my thought process. If all you want is to berate me go ahead. I am comfortable in my own reasons for wanting to search out this particular Fic.

Thanks for your help.
