Indie Harry tries his bullshit at the Wizengamot but all the adults think he's a bratty little child. All the laws proposed by him get vetoed by every single member. Eventually they strip him of his titles.


** There was a similar thread a couple of weeks ago, this is what I said at the time:

More hilarious is if you think about a likely outcomes of an 11 year old attempting to make a speech like that.

Option one: "Will somebody summon this child's caretaker, so that we can be rid of the odious little squit?"

Option two: "I am Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryff/voice breaks/indor" /assembled crowd cracks up laughing/.

Option three: Harry makes stirring, passionate address to the assembly, then looks around and notices that none of them are paying the slightest attention, with the possible exception of two middle aged witches with an "aww, isn't he cute!" expression on their faces. Basically, your average school play.

Option four: Harry makes stirring, passionate address to the assembly, then sweeps out of the room with a regal air. Thirty seconds later: "Is he gone? Thank God that's over. Right then, let's get on with the real Wizengamot meeting."

** A story I am writing has this.

More specifically it has a manipulative Dumbledore that specifically went out of his way to make sure harry grew up to be this bratty arrogant idiot with clear and obvious weaknesses except for his extreme magical power.

Harry is not the main character in this
