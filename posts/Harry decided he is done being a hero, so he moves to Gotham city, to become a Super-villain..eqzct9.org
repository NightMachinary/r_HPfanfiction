Only problem? He is too good to do any stereotypical villainous things.

So he starts prank people of Gotham city with his brand of insanity. Like confounding Batman to think he is a low-level thug or Joker to think he is the real Batman, or placing public places like parks/schools under the Fidelius charm.

*** Yeah read a few of those as well. Have started rough drafting a different one in response to the prompt. More an agent of chaos and fun than anything else with little moral framework.

Basing him off the storybook Peter Pan a fair bit. The one that thinks it's okay to let someone drown when they are playing with mermaids and killing people is perfectly acceptable so long as your having good fun about it.

Have posted in this thread my basic idea so far. Will take some time to clean up the rest of the way though I think it has some promise. Let me know what you think of the premise if you don't mind.

***** The story has him deaging himself for a fresh new childhood minus his memories. They will come back later after he has had plenty of time to make new better ones.

He will live in with the bat clan and cause them all to go grey early. Pretty much tons of divine irony and punishment that the bat clan can't stop him from accomplishing.

** Harry was so very tired. Tired of Ginny dragging the Man-Who-Won around like a prize dog at westminister.

Tired of seeing nothing getting better despite supposedly winning the war.

Tired of being looked at with respectful fear and awe everywhere he went.

Tired of seeing reminders of those who were lost constantly. He was so very tired, so tired of it all.

A few fun facts Harry had never thought of until it had hit him like a train.

Transfiguration was permanent, human Transfiguration allowed you to change your body to look however you wanted, and Transfiguration was permanent.

Seems redundant to say Transfiguration was permanent twice but it was not.

After the final battle he was scarred to hell and back. Allowing himself a bit of vanity he had used human Transfiguration to hide the scars and make himself look healthier.

Now five years later he looked the exact same as he had that day. Not a single sign of aging had hit him. He didn't even need to shave after that.

Realizing it was his potential ticket out of here he had started looking into why everyone wasn't Transfigurating themselves immortality young.

Turns out the ministry and the goblins had thought of the problem decades ago. The ministry had enchantments in the atrium that forced a transfigured person to age despite the transfiguration. The goblins had a similar enchantment on the lintel of their doors.

Harry had avoided both places like the plague since before the final battle already. Afterwards he had done so with even greater vigor saving himself from the extra enchantments.

He had an idea and had found a way to accomplish it. Magical tracking followed the impression someone made in the worlds schema. There were hundreds of known factors that built an impression and Harry had learned the biggest ones.

His magical resonance, how his magic felt for lack of a better term, was the biggest. His mental echo was the next largest. A mental echo was built from a person's memories, thoughts and feelings. The last largest factor was the Physcial Connection, what his body was essentially.

He had thought about ways to change his mind and had not been a fan of any of them. It was his research into the Oblivate spell that had gotten him the break he needed.

The Oblivate had been compared to the french word obliutte which was an inescapable prison. He thought perhaps the Oblivate didn't erase memories so much as trap them.

While he wasn't sure if that was the case of not he had created the Libertatibus spell. It held memories in a sort of reverse obliutte. The memories were hidden and could only release themselves.

Through marking the memories with the first half of the spell he attached a trigger to them with the second half. As time passed he would slowly regain his memories until he remembered everything again.

He wanted to gain the memories at roughly half the rate he had lived them. As he was planning to dump a majority of his 23 years of life so far it would take some time to get it all back.\\
Leveraging a few favors had gotten him a large dose of liquid luck, enough for a week in fact. So first he had taken enough for a few hours and spent time in disguise in a magical language learning school.

His luck had shown through and he learned the top 20 most spoken languages in the world, including Mermish, Auroral, and Gobbledygook.

Next he had taken enough for 2 days worth and focused on maintaining his Transfiguration without worrying about others forcing him to age. His luck again held strong and he had stumbled upon a strange combination of Alchemy and Transfiguration that would set his features until he used a specific counter curse to remove it.

The second to last dose had been one that took him 4 days of pure good luck to happen. He had found a way to fuse the Elder Wand into his body allowing him to cast wandless, wordless, intent magic.

All at the low low cost of feeling like splinters were constantly stabbing his entire body. He had spent weeks getting used to the pain enough that he could perform basic tasks again.

The pain refused to subside and it took him nearly a year before he was able to live normally with it. It would still catch him off guard sometimes and he would collapse without warning.

He wasn't sure if an eternity of pain was worth gaining powers Merlin would be jealous of or not. To late to change it afterall so best to just accept the situation.

Those last few hours were reserved for now. He swallowed the remainder and set to work on killing Harry Potter and being reborn.

First he wanted to get a new look and the perfect plan struck him. He had been denied any form of childhood so far and so he would start all over again, sort of.

With a thought a bottle floated over to him unstoppering itself as it did. Soon he downed the alchemical concoction and preformed the specialized Transfiguration.

Harry Potter vanished and now stood a handsome little man who looked to be all of 6 years old. He had given himself silly bright red anime style spikey hair with playful blue eyes. (Young Lindo Tachibana for reference)

He next opened a world book and chose a random location. Creating a under layer portkey, illegal as hell and equally untraceable, he had his destination picked.

A Libertatibus spell later and he felt a strange pulling sensation before finding himself dry heaving on the sidewalk with no idea what was going on.

He could count on one hand the number of things he knew. He was a boy, he was in incredible amounts of pain (though oddly enough it seemed like he was used to it), he could will reality to follow his bidding, he was eternally young, and lastly he was in a city named Gotham.

Everything else was a fair bit fuzzy though he found plenty of other things. He was especially good at astronomy, high level math, seemed to know a smattering of languages, and could name most plants he saw.

Things were slowly filling in as he looked around. Gotham city was an absolute shit hole he could tell, even if he had no idea how or why he could tell.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

How's that for a start? If it's okay I have some plans for it that I'll follow up with.

*** Could stand to triple what I wrote above in length, at least, by cleaning it up and expanding it. As I am currently sitting in my gazebo over my frozen pond drinking coffee from a thermos I just want to write more. So here is some more of this insanity. Including some notes to myself as well if I rewrite it into a proper fic.

Also Italics are translated speech.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Looking around it was dark as hell in the random alleyway he had found himself in. He had no idea what time it was but late at night seemed about right.

Shrugging his shoulders ne started walking when he realized he was wearing what looked like an oversized dressing gown. Deciding to have fun with it he raised his left hand into the air and thrust his right hand forward while shouting in French "Putain j'ai l'air bien!". A light flowed around him as he spun like a ballerina laughing the whole time.

The ugly as sin robes changed into a nice little ensemble of black leather shoes, black slacks, blue button up with a light gray vest. Laughing gaily at the silliness of it all he started skipping down the alley towards the light at the end.

He was startled when he saw a strange man in a suit and wearing a bag on his head starting running down the Alley his way. The man stopped and began talking in a rough vibrating voice.

"Are you lost little boy, perhaps afraid of the dark scary alley? Let me show you real fear!"

The man tried to spray some stuff at him but he waved it away from existence and looked at the man.

/"Lord in heaven you are so ugly you have to wear a bag on your head. I'm so sorry, and no thanks, I would not like a free sample of perfume."/

Scarecrow was trying to parse together what little French he could remember. Somehow the boy had erased his fear gas from the air and that was interesting.

/"I'll help you out just this once okay. So a quick makeover and maybe a geas to stop spraying people, that's just rude. Oh, great idea! For every person you have sprayed you must help ten people! Until then you will ummm..."/

He placed his hand under his chin and began thinking. Scarecrow was slowly making sense of what he was hearing though it was rather broken. He had heard the word geas though and he knew what that was.

Cursing his luck for upsetting some magic user he started backing away trying to save himself.

The boy noticed the strange man walking backwards and thought it was silly to see. Reaching out he snapped his fingers and changed the man.

/"You look funny mister. I curse you to help ten people for every person you have sprayed or you will only be able to walk backwards, slowly!"/

Seeing the now extremely handsome man walking backwards at a glacial pace set the boy off. Falling to the ground from laughing he kept laughing for a while until the pain snuck up on him.

Suddenly his peals of laughter became scream of pain as the pain broke free in his moment of lasped concentration. Passing out from lack of breath he never noticed the large dark shape swoop down into the alley.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Bruce had noticed the encounter and his French was good enough to follow what the boy had said. Whatever this boy was he was powerful.

To casually erase Scarecrows fear gas, place a geas and add a curse to it required some serious firepower. Watching to boy like being fall to the ground in laughter had been a sight. He really hoped this wasn't a Batmite type being.

When the laughs had turned to screams of pain he had flew down quickly incapacitating Scarecrow as he went.

The boy was in tremendous amounts of pain it seemed and he had no idea why. The scream itself reverberated in the air flowing like waves of pain never ending.

It took the breath out of him as he fought the waves to get closer to the boy. It abruptly cut off as the boy passed out from lack of air.

Bruce stood straighter and looked down at the being. This may have happened in his town but this being was league level business. Tying up Scarecrow and getting confirmation the police were coming for him Bruce approached the boy.

"Two to transport, possible reality warper, medical assistance required. Request J'onn for mind scan and Flash for assistance in possible detainment."

As they were teleported up Bruce began reviewing plans in place for situations like this. They would need to keep the being unconscious for now. Though until they knew what it was they couldn't even be sure what drugs to use.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

The medical scans were a mess, even by league standards they were confusing. The DNA had bits of Homo Magi scattered throughout the tangled mess. It was close enough to human to be kissing cousins, though so was Kryptonian so that didn't mean much.

The absolute kicker had been the honest to goodness Death Being DNA. Death beings were not undead, they were anti-life beings who existed in a opposite reality. Death beings could not coexist with this reality.

The Justice League had sealed off that portal and left it well enough alone since that first encounter. That also helped explained the pain the being was in. Having the DNA of a Death Being in your body would cause immense damage to it, much less incredible amounts of pain.

The scans showed it was somehow stabilizing and it would settle in a few centuries. That had been a kicker as well, the beings DNA was hard locked and they had no idea how old he was. It was apparent he was functionally ageless.

They had managed to synthesize something to keep him asleep but the beings body kept burning through it rapidly.

Giovanni had been called in due to the Homo Magi markers and he had performed some divination. Nothing had come up except he was young. J'onn had scanned the sleeping boy and had found almost nothing.

The boys memories were minuscule at best. Mostly nothing more than motor functions, a desire to have fun, some seeming instructions to enjoy life, and what looked like a download of languages. Including four J'onn had never came across before.

Giovanni identified them as Goblin tongue, Mermish, Snake (that one was strange) and most interesting Air Elemental.

Air Elementals were the most common Elemental magic users could come across. Even then though unless you knew what to look for they nearly impossible to see.

Combined with the fact Air Elementals were almost impossible get into a conversation with and so few bothered to learn the language at all, much less have native speaker level fluency in the language.

The only memory J'onn had found was of a flying woman who glowing a golden hue with brilliant red hair. Looking down at the boy she was cupping his face with an expression of love and sadness.

(Edited scene from seeing his mother during the resurrection fight.)

J'onn had tried to explore the memory more and found he could not. Someone, or something, had been responsible for editing the memory and erasing everything except that moment. Incredibly even the background was missing from the memory.

That had led to them comparing his DNA to that of Tamaraneans. Surprisingly only a few genes had matched. Whatever this boy was he was a melting pot of DNA.

(Note add into start of story obtaining Re'em blood and using alchemy to fix his eyesight by gaining traits of an animal, probably eagle and mantis shrimp concoction. Ensure references to Basilisk and Phoenix are here. Drinking liquid luck before starting an alcheminally based custom made human Transfiguration leads to best of all parts seeping into his new form.)

Giovanni had looked over the footage of what the boy had done and declared the boy at least at the level of a Lord of Magic, likely higher.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Probably close to the character limit. Interested slightly in rewriting it, plan to make him a loosely held ward of Bruce Wayne. Will have the Bat clan in existence along with Damien and his mother living there.

He will be less superHero/Villian and more agent of fun/chaos. Should be interesting.

**** Continuing on with my hastily and extremely rough draft/brainstorming thing this is I'll keep going for now. It's been fun posting it out and letting people see the raw hot garbage my first run through an idea usually is. Feel free to comment :)

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

The Boy-Who-Was-Once-Called-The-Boy-Who-Lived-But-Now-Doesn't-Know-His-Name woke up to a moderately bright room feeling the pain like a freight train. Gritting his teeth after gasping in pain he took a few deep breaths and pushed it aside.

Sitting up he opened his eyes and promptly closed them again.

Taking a peek he closed them quickly flummoxed quite a fair bit. He wasn't sure completely what normal was but a man dressed in black like a giant bat was not normal.

The tall green dude besides him was not normal either. At least the third had seemed normal enough. The last dude in red and yellow was a trip.

Taking a deep breath he started his introduction.

"I'm not sure if it's my birthday or not but I am sure I didn't order two leather fetish daddies, a captain planet wannabe exhibitionist with a leather fetish as well and their pimp."

Flash busted out laughing at the kids humor, though he was worried how a 6 year old knew what a leather daddy was.

Bruce was inwardly slightly amused though mostly he was taking note of the boys reactions. He had immediately taken note of his surroundings and used crude humor to gauge the situation.

A quick mind that was used to handling new situations while under pressure. Definitely someone to keep an eye on, that sort of skill is developed not inborn.

J'onn had to search his memories for the appropriate understanding of what had been said. Linking the words to the knowledge he had almost smirked at the crude humor. He could see how the applied labels were witty and possible interpretations of the four justice league members.

Finally Giovanni broke through past the sound of flash laughing and started the conversation.

"Interesting ideas you have young man though they are not appropriate. We four are members of the Justice League. We are a group dedicated to helping the world and turning back evil."

He then proceeded to introduce Flash, Batman, Martian Man Hunter and himself.

Making it clear he would like the boys name as well he waited for the boy to speak.

J'onn was monitoring the boys mind as they were introduced and it was difficult. The sheer amount of pain was nearly overwhelming his ability to hear any thoughts and he was getting the pain second hand.

/"I am Doctor, um can I be a doctor, yes I can I guess but to I want to be one? Nah sounds boring, what about Professor? Professor Awesome of the School of Cool. Sounds good, totally using it. Yep, my name is Professor Awesome of the School of Cool."/

Bruce raised an eyebrow, not that anyone could see it, at the boys declaration.

Replying in English Bruce questioned the boy.

"If your a professor you have to teach something. You also need a campus tho teach as well. Where is this campus located at exactly?"

Bruce had found to key to working with semi-sane beings of incredible power years ago. It was actually his constant interactions with the Joker that had brought about this breakthrough policy.

Don't question the validity or even possibility of their statements. Instead question what those statements would imply. If your a Professor what do you teach instead of you cannot just declare yourself as Professor Awesome of the School of Cool.

It would throw them off their game a bit most of the time and they were usually easier to handle. It didn't work occasionally though mostly it was a great strategy.

Professor Awesome stopped and had to think. He had no idea what he could teach to be frank about the matter. Ummm perhaps Professor Awesome was not a good name afterall. Well, no sense in giving up already though. Perhaps they had some ideas.

"I have no idea, what do you think I should be teaching? Never taught before, I think at least, not really sure, though I'm sure I'm great at it, really sure, honestly."

Batman was glad his strategy had paid off and nodded to Giovanni. Giovanni got the hint and stepped forward while giving the boy plenty of room.

"Perhaps for now we could have a class on who you are, what your plans are and what powers you have? You seem like a strong magic user, perhaps we could talk shop."

Professor Awesome brightened at that, he could do that for sure. He had an idea and the room morphed around him. Suddenly the man was smoking a cigarette and wearing a fedora sitting behind a thick wooden desk.

Professor Awesome was sitting in a hard backed wooden chair with a light shining in his face. The room had a vintage American cop film vibe, even having everything in black and white with the other three dressed as old timey cops. He started talking with a Russian accent to top it all off.

"Tsch... Okay, I will tell you all I know. Firstly I am a Professor of Awesome ya. I am teacher, you understand yes? My plans are to enjoy my childhood for the next 45 years until reality catches up"

Stopping he began thinking real hard. That number seemed solid, like the statement was something he knew for sure. It was eerie yet comforting at the same time. Shaking his head to clear it he continued his newest game.

"My powers are they magic? Maybe, I don't know, maybe they are not or maybe the are magic with something else. That is good question comrade."

Giovanni and the other league members were shocked at his casual display of power. It was a smooth transition with only the Flash noticing the changes as they happened. He realized it was harmless after a few moments of thinking in speed force time.

They were all aware of his slip up with the dates. It seemed he had not been aware of that until he had spoken it. There seemed to be much more going on with his missing memory than just erased memories.

Giovanni was interested in seeing if he could revert the room and said as much.

"Well that was fun but let's see if I can do that in reverse now? /Egnahc siht moor dna eht elpoep ni ti kacb ot lamron!/"

The the room was flooded with esoteric symbols and diagrams as his magic went to work. To change a beyond state of the art med-bay to a black and white (even the people) 50's interrogation room was impressive. Turning it back was not much easier.

It took him almost a full minute and wore him out slightly. Still he had accomplished it so he was satisfied and it confirmed the power the boy like being held.

Speaking of the boy he shrugged his shoulders with grin and waved his hand. The world snapped into focus and they realized that it had been grainy like an old television set beforehand and they hadn't noticed.

Bruce asked if the boy had anywhere to go and got an unexpected reply.

"Gotham City, not sure why, just know it's where im supposed to be. Nothing I'm supposed to do, just need to be there for some reason."

That made Bruce uneasy to say the least. If cosmic forces were choosing his town to play in he needed to know and prepare.

"Alright we will go and see if we can arrange someplace for you to stay in Gotham if that's alright? Would you like something to eat while you wait? Anything special you would like?"

"That would be nice of you to find me a place. Some food would be good as well, anything's fine really."

They nodded and left the room. There were other league members keeping an eye on the room and it was located against the outer hull in case they had remove the being.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Most of the founders were present for the meeting. It seemed batman would be their best bet to watch the being. They were reviewing everything they knew so far.

J'onn had just finished speaking of his experiences with the boy. They all were interested in the 45 year timeframe he had given.

Instead of Batman watching directly Bruce Wayne would take the boy in for a time until they had a better handle on the situation.

Bruce currently had his 14 year old son once again living with him along with Talia. That was already a handful, trying to also keep track of a 6 year old reality warper was beyond even him.

He needed a full time magic user on site to help and possibly a few others as well.

He had access to the Failsafe of Pandora and was tempted to use it. Jon was no longer a problem, having erased hinself from existence, and reality was stable. They had thought perhaps it would be best to let her rest. Now though he really needed someone of her level to help.

Barbara and Pandora had gotten along well the few times they had met. If he opened his home to the Titans and let them use it as a staging ground like Damien had been asking that would increase the numbers to something manageable.

Mind made up he addressed the league.

"I wish to use the Failsafe of Pandora. She has over 10,000 years of experience in magical matters. Hopefully with really stable I can convince her to stay. Damien has co-opted a new Teen Titans East that I can help supervise. Using those two resources and getting Barbara to help should be enough to keep this new being from causing undue trouble."

The members debated for a few minutes before agreeing to his plan. It wasn't ideal but it would work, that it also would help train the newest generation was a positive addition.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Good enough place to take a break. Please comment any thoughts about it. Not sticking to pure DC new canon, playing around with it obviously. Still should be fun overall. This is more back drop than anything else, gives the story room to move forward easily. Also looking forward to having fun with Gar 😄

***** While he was waiting they had delivered a tray of food for him. Mashed potatoes and gravy, steamed vegetables and baked chicken. A rather alright meal all things considered. He was currently turning his mashed potatoes into a lifelike village of potato people when he was interrupted.

"While my folks taught me to never play with my food I'm not sure how they would react to this. Are they alive or are you just moving them?"

The boy shrugged as he started at the perfectly shaped man in red and blue.

"They're alive as long as I want them to be. Here, look."

The village and people grew to cover the bed and changed from potatoes to crystal. The colors altered and it became a little crystal village filled with people. They waved to the boy and he waved back before sending them off to the side of the room.

"It bothers you why?"

He was genuinely curious, it was clear as day the man was uncomfortable.

"It seems frivolous, to create life solely for your enjoyment. You could do great things to help others."

Ah, now he understood. This man was a responsiblity comes first type, putting his own life in a far second place.

"You need a vacation, or to get laid. One or other, wait! Perfect, I got it!"

He concentrated for a second and felt it click into place. Suddenly the man was more, more everything.

"Wow mister, I have no idea who you are but you sure are a good person."

Clark turned and looked in the mirror to see what was going on. Dianna and Hal were staring at him like they had never seen him before.

Hal Jordan spoke up first, his voice filled with wonder and awe.

"What did you do, he's like a god now."

"Wow, you really are a good guy. Everyone sees how his actions have made their life better or worse. The better he has made your life the more amazing he seems."

Dianna nodded, that was easily one of the best gifts a godlike being had granted to someone. Most of them were more of a curse than helpful. Well this was still a curse somewhat for Clark.

He would have to give up his Clark Kent persona until they fixed it, learned to hide it, or it wore off though.

Nodding happily to himself he went back to playing with his not so little anymore village of, now crystal, people.

Dianna caught herself finally and stopped starting. Clark was getting embarrassed, he had only done what was right, nothing more. Heading out here went to find Giovanni, hopefully the magician could help.

"If you are interested a friend of the Justice League has offered to house you in his mansion. That way you could stay there in Gotham while you find out more about yourself."

That seemes really nice of them. These Justice League folks were good people.

"Of course we will need a name to use besides just Professor Awesome. It's a great name, just it dosen't fit in well."

Professor Awesome didn't care about fitting in though he did understand she was just doing her job.

Another one of those weird suddenly knowing things happened and he blurted out a name.

"HJ, call me HJ."

Dianna and Hal both noticed the reaction was similar to when he had spoke of the 45 years. So HJ was either his real name or a nickname.

That was an unexpected windfall though how useful it would be was still to be seen.

Hal Jordan had startled at his old nickname and then stopped worrying about it. HJ while not a common nickname was far from unique.

Dianna took a few steps and bent down beside the young boy. Shenwqs close but still outside his personal space. Smiling she asked the little godlike boy her question again.

"Well HJ, would you like to live in a mansion with a friend of the league. He is housing several other children with powers as well you could play with if your interested."

Smiling at the idea of having others to play with he nodded his head firmly.

"Yes please that sounds wonderful."

Dianna stood up and held out her hand for the boy.

"First lets see about getting you some clothes again. The ones you arrived in are dirty so we gave you this hospital robe."

HJ jumped out of bed and the hospital robe flowed around him. Spliting apart it turned into socks and trainers, underwear and pants, and finally a t-shirt that had a picture of a T-Rex on it wearing a collar with the name Little Doggy on it.

Dianna refused to bat an eye at the spectacle and simply offered her hand again. HJ took her hand they walked down the hallways. It was a short walk to a large room with big circular platforms all over it.

Dianna told the green man there were two to transport to Wayne Manor. Standing on the pad he felt a tingle and then suddenly he was outside a big mansion.

Standing at the door was a happy looking family. The father smiled and introduced his family.

"HJ, meet my wife Talia and our son Damien. I'm Bruce Wayne and this is the family Butler Alfred."

Dianna let go of his hand as she gently pushed him forward. HJ skipped up the steps and stood next to the older teen.

"You want to play? I love to play!"

Damien agreed as he led the boy into the mansion. He remebered the brief father had given everyone on the boy.

Reality warper of unknown power, mischievous, missing majority of his memory, ageless and total power level unknown.

Damien planned to introduce reaction games and test the boy's intelligence while playing.

Making their way to a toy room Bruce kept for visitors children they started playing around.

They had started building a block tower that had evolved somehow into a block fortress. After a half hour of playing with the blocks the fortress was larger than the room had been.

The playroom had expanded as they needed room and their was always more blocks when they needed them. An army of stuffed animals was now laying siege to them as they wore medieval prince outfits with silver crowns.

Damien was giving a rousing speech to their assembled stuff animal army as the prepared to fight off the invaders.

"You may be soft and fluffy but your heart are made of steel! We will not fall at this, the final hour. Now follow me into battle friends as we defend the Fortress of Blocktown!"

HJ was giggling like crazy as he and Damien led the small army out the gates and crashe into the worlds best cuddle pile ever.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Bruce and Talia were watching the monitor with avid interest as the game had grown.

They had both noticed when HJ had reached out for a new block and it had just appeared in his hand. Damien had noticed it as well it seemed from his slight pause.

The boys had kept playing and the room slowly grew in size and the number of stuffed animals grew as well.

Bruce had pulled up the other monitors to see if they were showing the growth or not. They were not, so it had to be some form of localized spatial distortion.

When the game ended with a fluffy cuddle pile of stuffed animals Bruce made sure to grab a couple stills. Embarrassing pictures were a parents prerogative after all.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Alfred knocked on the door and opened it. Taking note of the huge fortress made of blocks, the gigantic room, and the pile of stuffed animals large enough to fill a swimming pool.

"If the young sirs are interested in tea now would be a good time. Masters Bruce and Talia would like to get to know you better young sir."

HJ nodded and tried to get up. Damien and himself were stuck in an especially deep part of the pile. Getting frustrated he willed the room back to normal.

Suddenly the extra stuffed animals vanished and the room was normal sized again. Looking around HJ willed it all to be organized again.

"All cleaned up, let's go have tea! Come on Damien, you have to show me the way!"

Damien led the exicted kid to the palor where Bruce and Talia were waiting.
