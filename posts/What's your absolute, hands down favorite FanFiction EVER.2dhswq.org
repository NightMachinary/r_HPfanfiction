** Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness

Neville is my favorite character and this story shows how he comes to be a significant player in the fight against Voldemort. Also it is very well written.

** Oh boy this is a really though one.

I've been reading Fan-Fiction for years now, about a decade, so I've read what feels like thousands of stories.

Out of all of them though the one that made the largest impression on me is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/1/Casting-Moonshadows][Casting Moonshadows]].

It's been on going for a *LONG* time and the author maybe updates a 5,000-10,000 word chapter once a year at this point. /Maybe/.

But there is just something about it that I absolutely adore.

However, in my opinion it's gone a little down hill in the last ~5 chapters or so?

I can't put my finger on it but things are starting to wrap up and while I know the ending is going to be canon, I just don't like the way things are heading there.

All in all though it's a fantastic story and one I recommend to everyone.

It was also the story that got me into Sirius/Remus.

Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour."

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/536450/chapters/952621][The Never-ending Road]] by laventadorn is my favorite WIP. Last updated on my birthday, which was an awesome present! "AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet"

The Snape/Harriet relationship won't happen until Harriet is of age, and after over 400k words they're still in 4th year, so don't worry if underage squicks you.

** Right now, my latest favourite, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] is definitely up there. Characters spot-on, almost canon-compliant; certain characters' backstories (notably Tonks, the Weasleys, Lupin, Narcissa Malfoy) are extremely canon-compliant and believable. The best thing about it though is that it's complete and has a sequel currently in progress.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] is another long one and probably my overall favourite, but Innocent is definitely a close second. PoDK features Hermione and Draco Malfoy as siblings which I haven't seen often; its a really great dynamic, and despite certain major changes, a lot of the characters are nicely similar to their canon counterparts. Also features powerful!Harry with a sensible, rational explanation behind it and reasonable development.
