Everyone has things that will make them put a fic down within the first few chapters - but what about when you've been enjoying a fic, read 50k words into it, and something happens that makes you put it down and walk away? I didn' think I had something that would make me do that - but then the author killed off Madam Pomfrey offscreen and followed up with killing off several other characters in the same battle. This story hasn't been fluffy, but up until this point Quirrel and Filch are the only people who've died. So now I'm curious - what's made you put down something and walk away despite your investment?


** Harry's father being suddenly revealed to be Snape, from a night of passion with Lily because, in the author's depiction, James is too busy being an overgrown frat boy to understand her needs and the literal death eater is apparently a more acceptable romantic partner.

No, I am actually not even describing one specific fanfic, I've seen this dozens, maybe hundreds, of times. And I immediately close the tab every damn time.

Where would he have the time to duck Death Eaters, who would know who he was on a glance, and womanise as fanon likes to present?

And James, who was shown to be an incredible parent who loved Harry for the year they had him. Why would he spend years pining over Lily, get her, marry her, have a child, and then go gallivant off during a war to get drunk, cheat on her, or whatever? D:

Also he's American and the point of the fic was mugglewank, so I think he just picked a cool name based on the Muggle government at the time (Harry is adopted by a Squib in the army, the government totally knows what's up and is pissy the wizards are a bunch of paternalistic pricks who don't share information about terrorists, and Harry is more or less raised as a method to get a British intelligence agent into the wizarding world).

******** Pretty much, but it's all relative. Like, I used the stringing along as an example because in my opinion "stringing someone along" implies that the person doing the stringing knows they're not actually interested in the person being strung and are doing the stringing on purpose and I see what Ron did with Lavender to be a product of being a teenage boy lacking in the ability for introspection who went "someone wants to kiss me? Of course I want that!" without stopping to think about whether he actually did want kisses with that person. However, I can absolutely see other people holding a different definition of stringing along so using that as narration doesn't necessarily take it into bashing territory.

It's tough, because some people say highlighting any bad things about a character at all is bashing, whether or not those things really did happen. I personally think characters are allowed to be complicated, or good people who sometimes do bad things, and it's not bashing to be open about or showcase those bad things. The difference, in my opinion, is that when an author has /nothing/ but negative things to say about a character and it's clearly the author's opinion that the character is trash. Narration is often the way that the author's opinion most comes across and is the easiest way to bash (and the easiest to interpret as bashing, whether or not it's intended) so if you're having to walk a fine line it's the easiest thing to pay attention to.

Like, it would not be necessarily be James bashing if Snape talked shit about Harry's father, unless the story made sure to only focus on that part of James Potter where he hexed Snape because he was bored, ignoring all context and all other parts of his character.

**** I'll be honest: coming off as bashing isn't something that you should stress over too hard. Bashing isn't well defined and everyone has a different threshold for what counts as bashing to them. you can give the same fic to three people and one will say "that sounds about like canon," another will say "oh my gosh you made them seem like a monster" and the third will say "you're being too nice to them." If Lavender's your viewpoint character and you make her think Ron's terrible and all sorts of bad things about him then we're dealing with Lavender's opinion. Fiction doesn't have to be unbiased. It shouldn't be unbiased if our viewpoint character IS biased. If Lavender isn't our viewpoint character we probably shouldn't be hearing her thoughts on the matter, only things she says or does.

****** If you don't want to drag him through the mud, then don't. But I guarantee that if you show any character as less than a perfect and pure angel, someone will call it bashing, even if what you're dealing with is canon behavior.

Bashing in and of itself isn't bad writing just like having a super rich Harry who can buy half the planet isn't necessarily bad writing. Bad writing fails to deal with the consequences or implications of the trope the author decided to play with. Bad writing fails to represent characters as people with understandable motivations.

Tropes are tools. You don't blame the hammer when some idiot decides it would make a great power drill.

- Overly Americanized. I get that a lot of fanfic authors are from the US, but not even attempting to research and incorporate British culture into their writing is just lazy.
- Bad spelling/punctuation/grammar. I can ignore the odd mis-spell, grammatical mistake, etc, but if it's so bad I'm struggling to follow the story, you'd better believe I'm gone.
- Constantly spending heaps of writing space describing clothing down to the tiniest details. I. Don't. Care. Get on with the actual story.
- Really obvious OOC for no reason. I like that Snape is an emotionally repressed arsehole and don't want to see him being all effusive with his feelings. I also hate when Ron is portrayed as a massive bigot. Double nope points if a character's speech is obviously overly Americanized.
- Gratuitous violence/rape, especially when it is outlined in great detail. I don't mind when it is mentioned if it is important to the plot and character development, but I really don't need all the gory details.
- 3 chapter-long wedding scenes. Nobody cares, move along.

** I'm not really answering your question since circumstances led me to finish the fic I was reading but here's what happened:

I disliked it when a certain self-insert fic started out well, with a believable struggle for the SI to learn about the magical world, but during the last few chapters the SI became Dumbledore-level powerful, with no obstacles blocking his way anymore. To be fair, there was bit of a build-up to the SI's power up but I hated that he no longer had any matching struggles. He made some dubious decisions and the consequences of those decisions weren't explored anymore. Every choice he made was simply better than Dumbledore's.

I left a review for the author and decided to leave the fic. A few weeks later, I got an email alert for the next chapter and still being curious about the fic in spite of my decision to no longer read it, I clicked on the link. The author's notes said that it was the last chapter of the story already. So I read it. After all, what's one more chapter? I then found out that this "end" was really a closing of Part I and that the author was already working on Part II, which he would post as another story. I'm no longer going to read Part II.

** Authors writing accents. Stop it. Just tell me what accent they have and write normally.

The occasional dropped letter for Hagrid is fine, but I'm specifically thinking here of Swung by Seraphim, where halfway into the book an annoying cockney OC suddenly becomes the main character and her illegible dialogue takes up 90% of each page.

*** See, the 'Harry is weak' is actually canon, sadly, to a large degree. He starts out as really strong but kind of lazy, look at what he does in PoA. But as time passes, Rowling kind of dropped that and he becomes an unlucky everyman. He doesn't feel like Voldemort's equal in any way at the end.

**** I can see were you are coming from. I guess I observe Harry as more of an archetypal Christ/hero character as a whole rather than his overall characteristics. Idk I haven't read the HP series in a long time. But his decision to forgive his relatives, accepting to die in his second year while comforting Fawkes, and finally choosing to die accepting his mortality against all odds really stuck with me a lot. For me his compassion, forgiving nature, and acceptance/ wisdom in the face of death make him a different kind of equal when compared with magical powers etc. Yes Voldemort has more knowledge but the knowledge that Harry carries, holding on to his humanity despite his hardships is a different kind of strength in my opinion. Though I can definitely see were you are coming from and I am biased. I guess I've always seen this story as a series of archetypes the hero, the mentor, the villain. And I feel like there is something worth seeing in the simplicity of it all.
