in canon voldemort and dumbledore are portrayed as nearly invincible and that the only reason they lost was because of mistakes that they made not because there was someone more powerful than them around

i dislike this idea. The flamels had centuries of experience on both of them and should be more powerful than either of them or what about any wizards that fought during WW2 against grindlewald and his armies, war veterans that should at least be able to fight against the death eaters

Magiks of the arcane and Wind Shear are both good example of what i mean


** there is a difference between experience and power, so the flamels aren't necessarily powerful magically just cause they have that experience, especially since they might have forgotten alot of knowledge in their 600 years, plus while they might know stuff that doesn't mean they have done alot of COMBAT so might not actually have combat experience

*** yes i know

but they still survived centuries while fending off people trying to take the stone they should be fairly skilled

and it doesn't have to be the Flamels specifically just other characters that are equal or greater than voldemort and dumbledore

**** Nicholas Flamel at least is indeed fairly skilled if you go by Crimes of Grindelwald. He's also however extraordinarily old and somewhat cowardly. Not to mention later dead.

A lot of older witches and wizards are probably similar.

*** there is no such thing as magically powerful in the cannon HP universe. Magical cores are fanon. I do not know WHY dumbledore is considered powerful because as far as I know it was never explained, outside of his abundance of knowledge.

***** Most adult wizards can't even cast a shield charm.

Harry fought off 100 dementors at once with a patronus when he was 13. He's proficient enough at DADA to teach it by OoTP. He summoned a broom from very far away- it's at least implied that the summoning charm is more difficult with distance. He resisted the imperius curse of Voldemort and one of his top death eaters as a teenager. He also mastered several useful and very rare spells from Snape's potions book. He also dueled Voldemort and managed not to be killed instantly at the age of 14 (priori incantatem and dodging helped but it counts).

Also if we're just talking feats, assisted or not, 12 year old Harry killed a goddamn basilisk. He's a fairly self-deprecating narrator but when examining the sum of his accomplishments over the books Harry Potter is a goddamn beast.

**** Magical cores don't exist, but natural magical talent clearly does. Ginny is naturally talented at Charms-specifically the Bat-Bogey. Harry has a natural talent for DADA. Snape for the Dark Arts. And Dumbledore and Voldemort are naturally talented all round.

***** I always thought being attuned to these talents mean you are more emotionally inclined to feel the right emotions. Snape is a depressed emo, harry is a self sacrificing protector and Dumbledore and Voldemort are geniuses... not attuned like one would be attuned to an element.

And if Dumb and Voldy are just powerful for being geniuses then what about the phlemels? Are there no other studious geniuses in the world?

****** Quite possible.

Dumbledore and Voldemort are merely the most powerful. Nicholas Flamel is at least powerful as established in Crimes of Grindelwald, but also somewhat cowardly. And I presume other places have powerful individuals just not needed to be mentioned in text.

**** No, there is no magical brute strength, but that doesn't mean that there's nothing separating Dumbledore from Goyle. Skill, knowledge, understanding and mental strength still set wizards apart from each other in terms of power. Dumbledore may not have "more" magic than Goyle, but he can do a whole lot more with his magic than Goyle, making him the more powerful wizard.

** The super-long fic by Lightning on the Wave (7 parts, starts with "Saving Conner") introduces other "Lord level" wizards from all over the world as OCs, but IIRC not until pretty late in the fic so it would be quite the time investment. She does it really well though IMO, they're well-developed characters considering they're side characters, and the fic as a whole examines the idea of "powerful" vs. "Lord level" wizards a fair amount. Seriously though, it's like over 2 million words.

It does a great job on expanding on the wizarding world and gives magic a whole lot more of variety than canon does.

A couple of foreign big players end up in Britain for the war, on both sides.

** There's always gonna be a few people at the top, that's what being the best means. There's still some powerful wizards than those two as well. Amelia Bones was killed by Voldemort personally, Bellatrix is obviously very powerful. Sirius and Remus are pretty strong in their own right. Flitwick is a duelling champion. Just because those two are above the rest doesn't mean everyone else is weak

** Says the people in Magical Britain. They also think Hogwarts is the best school in the world too. The place where they can't hold on to a DADA professor for more than a year, a pathetic Potions professor, Muggle studies is a joke, rife with bigotry, and people almost die every year.

​

You also have to remember that all of those powerful people are probably dead right now. Grindelwald happened. And then shortly afterward Voldemort showed up.

*** Grindelwald fought as the leader of the magical axis in magical WW2. He was undefeated and in fact we get the impression the he was invincible until Dumbledore stepped in to duel him.

Dumbledore alone was begged to fight him for years - if there had been equivalent wizards than where were they when needed? Remember this is a world war - everyone in touch with the world was involved.
