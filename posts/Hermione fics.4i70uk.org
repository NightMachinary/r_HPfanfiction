Are there any good Slytherin!Hermione fics? I just read 'the green girl' and it was amazing, couldn't put it down. Preferably over 100k wording. With or without her being Harry's friend or paired with a neutral/grey Draco. But not dark Hemione. Also any Hermione time traveling back to their first year and act upon the knowledge she has?

Thank you!

There was a thread that was requesting fics like /Green Girl/ a few days ago: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4i161l/request_fanfiction_from_the_slytherins_point_of/]] .

In terms of what you requested,

- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) is currently /the/ Slytherin!Hermione fic, IMO.

- linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them by White Squirrel) has Hermione travel back in time to act on her knowledge. It's only 31k words, but that's because a Hermione who pulls that off and doesn't run into fanon obstacles like a GreaterGood!Manipulative!Dumbledore doesn't need 100k words to fix the problems.

- linkffn(Palimpsest by Larry Huss) isn't time travel as such, but Hermione sends a telegram back in time to herself, and acts on the information. Unfortunately, the author has passed away recently, so the fic will almost certainly never be finished.

- linkffn(The Brightest Witch in the Darkest House by Belial666) and sequel are not about Hermione as such, but an OC who is supposed to be a more ruthless version of her. (Yes, Hermione is plenty ruthless in canon, but the author had bought into the AuthorityWosrhiper!Hermione fanon, so he or she decided to use an OC instead.)

*** Seconding both Applied Cultural Anthropology and Palimpsest. Even if Palimpsest will never be finished it is definitely worth the read. I laughed so much reading it.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

*** I did enjoy it. According to the author's page the sequel is already written and she is updating it on Fridays. She is planning to do the story up to MMVII (?) or something high like so.

The story, for me, is a good read. It isn't a romance at all. It's about her finding her place.
