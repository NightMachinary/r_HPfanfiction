Hi! I am looking for 2 fanfictions I'd read long ago on ff.net but I can't remember their names.

The first one was a wbwl where James and Lily where in coma and Dumbledore took one child and spoiled him while abandoning Harry. Harry was friends with Voldemort's son and his name was Red.

The second one was talking about Harry where he knew about Voldemort's resurrection and modified the ritual to make Voldemort his slave. In addition to making another self using time turner that helps Voldemort

I know it is hard but I really liked them, yet I can't remember their names or anything else Thanks in advance

  James and Lily have been put into a coma, Adrian Potter is the boy-who-lived, Dumbledore raises him and drops his twin at his aunts. Harry the twin brother of the boy-who-lived comes to Hogwarts and gets sorted into Slytherin. Harry is different from what anyone expecting and he holds a few secrets. Dumbledore bashing, select Weasley bashing, Hermione bashing. (HarryxDaphne)

  Harry has spent years pretending to be someone he was not, but in his fourth year he had finally had enough. He would no longer pretend. Now the real Harry Potter is out, and everything is changing. Dumbledore bashing, Hermione and certain Weasley bashing. Grey/Dark Harry.
