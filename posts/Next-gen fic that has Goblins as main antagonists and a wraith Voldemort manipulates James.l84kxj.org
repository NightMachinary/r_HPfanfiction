I've been trying to find a few obscure but pretty good fics I read many years ago. I hope I'll have a bit more luck with this one so thank you so much if you can help me.

The story is written from all three Potter children's POV, but one of the main plots involves on of the sons (I believe it's James) running into a projection of Voldemort's mangled soul and tricks him that he needs to help Harry Potter's children in order to atone for his sins and escape limbo.

Meanwhile there is a war that doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon between wizards and Goblins. After Harry tries for a truce but refuses to give them the Sword of Gryffindor, he goes missing. Then Voldemort tells James that the war would end if the Sword was returned to the Goblins so the children steal the sword and give it to the Goblins who then proceed to slaughter the wizard army. When James confronts Voldemort, Voldemort says that he told him the war would end but didn't mention in whose favor.

If anyone remembers having read such a story and give me a link to it if it still exists, I would be eternally grateful to you. Thanks!

Edit: also if it's of any help the story involves a lot of healing from all the harm Voldemort's done to the Potters (including Ginny) and it ends really sweetly with the Potters finally able to move on and turning their backs on an impotent Voldemort who desperately shouts insults and trying to provoke them.


** Huh, I thought I'd at least started most of the next-gen fics out there, but this one is new to me. Went through a quick ffn search and I think it's linkffn(Inter Arma by Pitry)
