It's how he was able to beat his opponents at chess. Of course, being lazy, he never realized the extent of his powers and rarely used them. He just thought he was good at chess.


** It seems more likely he knew what moves his opponents were planning because of his seer ability. There's other evidence he was a seer, but I can't recall any other evidence that he's a legilimens.

** But, this won't explain why he was good playing chess against a non-existent human opponent (first year). Maybe he's a seer that can subconsciously see the next few moments. It could also explain how he can be a good keeper if his nerves don't get a hold of him. It's like dbz ultrainstinct but only on a mental level lol.

** Might even be that he is realy strong because he has been doing it passively for so long.

*** Where they turn legilimens abilities into literal mind reading, /exactly/ what it's described to not be in the books? No thanks.
