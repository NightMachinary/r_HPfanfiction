I'm looking for something like linkao3(dead things) or linkffn(The Eyes). Something where Harry just goes completely crackers, either through the AK in his childhood or in book 7, or something else. I've read the nightmare man trilogy as well.


** I just read this oneshot in which Harry was creepy as hell, you gotta read it.

**** I loved it too! I want to read their Antithesis story? If that's their style of writing I want more!

These aren't Harry stories but the other "Dark but brilliant" stories I've read are linkao3(Blackpool by TheDivineComedian). Tbh everything by this author is completely brilliant. A bit dark and gruesome and just brilliant.

linkao3(Manacled by senlinyu) is also VERY heavy but was really interesting. Not what I'd normally read but I dunno, I like that dark, ruthless tone I guess.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve until her mind can be cracked. Now illustrated by Avendell.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

**** I have read this and have to say the starting few chapters were interesting but it gets boring after a while .. Fudge character in this is overblown in opinion, HP is so OP and creepy that he gives Dumbles & Voldy pause but Fudge is considered an opponent for him .. even if he is a minister, I didn't like that part.
