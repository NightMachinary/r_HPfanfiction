I had an idea for a rather unique time travel fic, and was wondering if anyone either knew of something similar, or would be interested in writing it. It was brought on by a post asking for ultra-violence fics in which Harry rips and tears through everything ala Doomguy.

The premise is that of recursion. At the end of a long and bloody war, Harry and Co. are about to lose with no hope in sight, so instead they run from Britain and let Voldemort win while working on a weapon capable of defeating Him for good, the weapon being Harry. Hermione creates a magical paradox in which any time Harry dies He loops back in time to some time near (but always after) Voldemort's resurrection. She uses the bit of Voldemort's soul in Harry's head as an anchor for the paradox so that it will not be released until that soul is eliminated from the world, aka Voldemort gets killed. The reason why Harry always appears after Voldemort's resurrection is that the time travel uses Voldemort as a sort of destination coordinate to send Harry to the right point in time, and the when Voldemort is a wraith He isn't present enough in reality to act as a target for the time travel. Additionally, Hermione figures out a way to ensure Harry will always be in the best physical condition possible when he goes back in time, essentially resetting him to the age of 22 every time he does so in order to give him the best fighting chance possible.

Eventually, Voldemort catches up to them on the run, after they've successfully created the recursion paradox, but before they've managed to make it precise enough to send Harry back to the moment of Voldemort's rebirth as was the plan. Voldemort attacks their hideout and Hermione is forced to activate the paradox immediately while Ron holds Voldemort off similar to how James did, buying them enough time to activate it before He's killed. Voldemort busts in and kills Hermione just as the process is complete and then turns his wand on Harry, hitting him with the killing curse and simultaneously removing the Horcrux from him and sending him back in time. Harry appears sometime between the end of book four and the beginning of book seven, essentially blowing up the version of Harry that was already there and replacing him with the Harry from the future. (Its really important that Harry's physical body gets sent back in time.) And thus begins a series of Dark Souls-esque attempts to kill Voldemort through trial and error and dying many times along the way.

The actual story begins with Harry arriving back in the bedroom he shared with Ron in Grimmauld Place at Christmas in book five, right at the beginning of attempt 73. (And right after failing in attempt 72) by this time Harry has changed alot, he has learned a lot about fighting but seeing as his time is entirely focused on the war, he hasn't really been able to get proper training in anything, rather his knowledge is all acquired through trial and error. In addition to acquiring a motley assortment of warfare related knowledge, Harry has also changed physically, sometime around attempt 27 Harry started trying to gain physical advantages that would help even the odds. By now, he has used magical rituals to give the strength and skin of a giant, eyesight that sees the entire electromagnetic spectrum, echolocation hearing, increased physical stature, bones replaced with a goblin forged titanium alloy, penguin like antifreeze proteins in his blood and dragon blood imbued protection from flame, essentially Harry becomes the Terminator. And since his physical body is sent back in time, he retains these advantages with every reset. However, Harry isnt the only one who has time traveling advantages.

During attempt 15, Voldemort figured out what was going on and began trying to make a recursion paradox of his own. He anchored it to Harry to ensure that it would always work, and since Harry's paradox was anchored to Voldemort the only way it would fail is if either Harry wins properly or Voldemort does. Harry realized what was going on and decided to reset the attempt for fear Voldemort would manage it. (He does this by killing himself, something he would be forced to repeat several times in future attempts). However, Voldemort managed to partially succeed, sending an echo of his consciousness and an awareness of what's happening with Harry every time He goes back in time. What this means, is that by the time attempt 73 rolls around, there are 58 echoes of Voldemort's consciousness settling into Voldemort's mind and bring with them their instincts, intuition and a bit of engrained skill. Voldemort was stopped before he could manage to send memories, so Voldemort doesn't have knowledge from the past, but he does have something even more dangerous. The combined consciousness has the side effect of curing Voldemort's insanity, resetting his brain and making him perfectly sane again, and all the more dangerous for it. Additionally, the echoing intuition and instincts from his past selves cause him to rapidly remove his own arrogance, and his obsession with killing Harry in a symbolic and personal way, as well as of his need to do it himself, instead focusing on just getting Harry dead as quickly as possible. This isn't an instantaneous transformation, rather it is a gradual process that ends in Voldemort being sane, methodical, pragmatic, logical, and wholly dedicated to annihilating his enemies as quickly as possible. In other words, about ten times as dangerous as He was before.

By the time attempt 73 begins, Harry has spent nearly a Century and a half waging this war over and over again, and losing every time. Some attempts last no more than a month or so, such as attempt 29 which failed after only 5 weeks, others last for multiple years, such as attempt 57 which lasted fifteen years and in which Harry was about to win before being hit in the back with a killing curse by an adult Vincent Crabbe before he could strike the killing blow. Something that led to Him spending the entirety of attempt 58 devising a way to be immune to the killing curse (which he did in fact achieve using an anchoring method similar to Horcruxes to trap his soul in his own body in order to make himself immune to the curse) before resetting the clock and beginning attempt 59.

This would be a story of all out war on a magical scale, waged over and over again across time. Fighting alongside the same people who adapt And evolve to the situation differently each time, who leave Harry with stories and memories unlike anything else each time. And I think it would be fucking awesome.


** The fic you have described sounds like a lot of fun, and I would probably enjoy reading it.

I will note that your story idea has a lot in common with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] as well as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]].

The similarity isn't necessarily a bad thing (afterall, fanfiction tends to be iterative), but many of your potential readers will probably have already read the other two fics, so you should try to ensure that your plotline is unique enough to not be overshadowed by what's been done before.
