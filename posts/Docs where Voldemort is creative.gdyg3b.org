Voldemort is such a lazy chump. His go to is just killing curse all the time.For someone so dramatic you would think he could be more creative. I just watched a Batman episode where Mr. Freeze tried to kill the Dynamic duo by turning them into snow cones. Flavored so cones at that. Are there any fics where Voldemort is 1) scary 2)creative with magic.


** Well, Voldemort's quite creative and scary in several of my stories, and when he fights, he doesn't just spam the Killing Curse.

You might like "Divided and Entwined" and "Patron".

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
