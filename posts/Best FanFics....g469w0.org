** This is one of the most popular for good reason.

*** The writing is dry, the science is wrong and it features an OP, smartass 11 year old Harry... just so bad

**** The OP, smartass Harry is balanced by the OP, smartass Quirrel, so it balances. OP, smartass characters are a mainstay of fanfiction.

***** Maybe? I'm fine with a powerful 15/16 year old but my problem is that he acts like an adult at ELEVEN. I don't know what interactions you have with 11 year olds but they are completely irrational, childish and most definitely never act like adults

****** Yes, that's the point, he doesn't act like an 11-year-old because he's not an 11-year-old. When he sees his name on the Marauders' Map, it doesn't say Harry Potter.

********* No? That was the point in Prisoner of Azkaban. POA is written well and makes loads of sense. But MoR is written badly and doesn't make sense... not even comparable

********** Did you get to the point where “Harry” sees himself on the Map? That's equivalent to the point at which Scabbers transforms in POA. It changes the meaning of everything that happened before.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
