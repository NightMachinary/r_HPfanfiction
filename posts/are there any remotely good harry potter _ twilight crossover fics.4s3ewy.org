I was recently having a discussion with a friend of mine about the lack of interesting (to me) Harry Potter crossover fics. For the most part they dont interest me and the only ones that had, related to Star Wars. She suggested a few other options, and the only crossover she suggested that I had NOT tried yet, was a Harry Potter / Twilight one.

Now thinking on this, I feel like since Vampires already exist in the Harry Potter universe, it feels like incorporating Twilight characters into a HP world would be somewhat easy, although the reverse might be harder.

Therefore, I am curious if anyone has come across any decent Harry Potter / Twilight crossover stories?

I would note that I am primarily taking about ones that take place in the world of HP, and preferably with a Harry Potter/Bella Swan and/or other female Cullen member pairing. No slash as such stories (of any world) do not interest me.

Even if you think a crossover is mediocre, feel free to suggest it, especially if there simply are not any decent stories

*Edit:* It seems as if I will have to ask for ANY HP/Twilight works, since by saying "good" apparently I have reduced the pool to zero. Perhaps something someone suggests as crap, I will at least think worthy of reading.

*Edit 2:* Well it seems like theres just not much thats not slash based, and even that is often limited in scope, and mostly based in the Twilight world instead of the HP world. Oh well. Thanks for the suggestions all.


** Honestly I can't even think of any "kinda decent" ones that aren't slash. HP/Twilight crossovers were a big thing back when the first Twilight movie came out but, that unfortunately means most of the writers at the time were female teenagers. LOTS of Edward/Harry fics with Bella as the "super mega jealous b*tch that should just back off!!", lol.

*** There are a few 'older Harry raises Teddy in Forks' fics that are pretty cute, but those are slash, too. I doubt there is anything for OP out there.

*** Thanks for the suggestions. I appreciate it. As for slash... generally I just have no interest in slash, although I dont mind non main characters being involved (like a HP based story that has Remus/Sirius in a relationship), hence why I put no slash. Perhaps I may stumble across one I enjoy, but generally it doesn't fit what I enjoy in a story.

**** The problem is, in order to have a "good" fic, there's a few necessary bits:

1. A good author

2. An author interested in writing the crossover

3. Luck

The lack of coinciding bits equals no fics.

****** I did encounter a few ... readable bits, but they were singular chapters of some authors' doodle bins (so to say) rather than being full-length stories, and right now I don't even remember where exactly those are. Also, they were all humour-centred or even crack, rather than anything ... you know, normal.

Also, as far as I remember from what I read, people really aren't keen on writing anything centred on the female characters of “Twilight”. Which kind of makes sense considering that Bella was a bland self-insert and the other characters were for the most part only present to make the readers not ask questions about why there are no females in the world of the story.

So yeah, the thing with “Twilight” that makes your request more difficult is that, no matter how you feel about it, for many people “Twilight” isn't as much a book as it is a bad romance fanfic that somehow got published. Which ... kind of limits the writer base.
