I wanna know if wizards use smartphones.


** I mean, frankly they were screwed ever since the invention of the security camera. It is a real shame, because I wasn't alive in the 1990s, so I find it harder to engage with than something set now, but realistically a masquerade that large and incompetent nowadays is immersion breaking. Even back then I head canon that certain parts of the intelligence agencies and probably police knew about the wizarding world and were actively helping to keeping it concealed to avoid the headaches of the uproar that would come from its disclosure.

*** Depends how they hide themselves, maybe it's like Grimmauld place or the Leaky Cauldron, both of which are physically there, yet you can stare right at them without noticing, someone videos them and noone who watches the video notices anything odd.

** I read somewhere that in the 20's wizards use mirror phones based off of the one that Sirius gave Harry.
