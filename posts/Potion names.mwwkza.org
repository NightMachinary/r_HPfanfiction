My biggest pet peeve is when people are writing about a potion and the name sounds like the opposite, now even if it's a real thing I dislike it. For example Headache potion. It sounds like it should give you a headache right? Well no its suppose to relieve it. So why don't they say headache relief potion? It bothers me so much. There's probably more but I don't remember them. What about you? Any potion names bother you?


** not quite a bedbug with the name, though it is related to that, people thinking that Pepper-Up is like a form of magical caffeine rather than just a cure for colds, I suppose that that is an example of canon doing what you were talking about.

Also, as we see in canon many potions have almost branded/product names "Skele-grow", "Pepper-Up", "Sleekeazy" now it makes perfect sense for people to use the proper names for potions during classes, after all I can't see Snape approving of people not using proper nomenclature, but outside of Potions class i'd love to see a bit more ingenuity, so we get things like "Dog's Hair Brew" instead of "Hangover relief potion" etc

I like this... especially if it actually contains dog hair. XD

*** I can identify three types of potion names in canon: self-descriptive/boring, Latin-based, magical-sounding/edgy, and branded/product.

Boring: Burn-healing Paste (most common in fanfics)

Latin-based: Amortentia/Felix Felicis (second most common, good when done right)

Magical-sounding/edgy: Draught of Living Death (like D&D potions)

Brand/product: Doxycide/Sleekeazy's Hair Potion (uniquely Potter)

While all types of potion names are technically supported by canon, I love it when I see any of the latter two in fanfics. To me, it makes the world feel more alive.
