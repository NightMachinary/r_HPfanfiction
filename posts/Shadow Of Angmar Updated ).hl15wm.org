Guess lockdown does have a silver lining.


** He said on Discord he's been back since months before lockdown, so even if/when lockdown ends this rate should continue.

*** I feel like COVID has been getting far too much credit for the updates. I got back in the saddle at the end of January, nearly two months before lockdown hit me.

Really, being stuck at home has probably slowed me down compared to what I was pulling in February.

**** Well that sucks then but tbh quite a few fics that hadn't been updated in months got regular updates in May and half of June. But now those updates slowed down too :p So I figured COVID was the causative factor.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
