Looking for a story where the long-lost sibling of Harry Potter is living in the USA (possibly California area?). I believe it is a girl, not sure if twin, or younger. I can't recall if she knows she's a witch or not.

I remember it happens to be in the beginning of the story and I THINK Dumbledore visits her.
