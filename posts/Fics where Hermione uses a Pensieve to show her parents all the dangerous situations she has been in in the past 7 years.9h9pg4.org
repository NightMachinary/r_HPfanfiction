Or something similar to this. Maybe Ron using a Pensieve to make his brothers understand exactly what he went through, etc. The general idea I had for this was Hermione trying to explain to her parents that she was in a war but they're safe now, but her parents just don't quite understand how dangerous her teenage years had been. So to /make/ them understand, she decides to /show/ them what happened.


** I'm pretty sure there is a few 'Reading the books' fics that have that plot if that might interest you.

** I believe linkffn(Harry Potter: Neko's Mate) has this, although it takes place after 2nd year instead of after the war.
