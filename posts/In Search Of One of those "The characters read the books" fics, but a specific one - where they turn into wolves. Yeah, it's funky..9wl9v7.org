*EDIT:* [[/u/SilverCookieDust][u/SilverCookieDust]] had exactly what I was looking for! And the first comment too! Thank you!

Okay! So! These fics seem to have disappeared from ffdotnet (which was the only place I'd found them on). If anyone knows of an archive somewhere where they still are or has a copy, I'd love to re-read them - they were amusing.

So! Onto the descreiption!

- These were a "everyone reads the books" except it was "everyone looks back at Harry's years in school in a pensive" - and more than Harry's memories were used, other people put theirs in too, like McGonogall
- Death lets Harry bring 3(? don't remember exactly) people back to live because he's the "Master of Death"
- BUT! in exchange! Harry and a few other people have to become this weird human/wolf hybrid (not a furry - but not a werewolf?) I think called lycans?
- Draco gets some love in a "I'm sorry you went through shit, lets try and heal" way
- Lots of people becomign wolves
- Remus cured of lycanthropy by becoming a lycan
- I /think/ there was more than one story?

Honestly, I'm just curious if these stories were a crazy cookoo dream I had or if they were real. I haven't been able to get them out of my brain for a while, and my home-grown-download-stuff-I-like archive/collection/thing has failed me.

Yeah! If I didn't imagine them I'd love to hear if anyone knows where they went or it'd be great if they had a copy!

I know they disappeared off ffdotnet when they did a purge of those "characters read the books" fics, and I my Google-fu has also failed me in terms of searching and the wayback machine.

So any help would be appreciated!


** Could it be [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwfE6l6RtZAsV3JUdHl4U2Q4QW8][Harry Potter and the Gift From Death]] trilogy, by Powerofthewolves18? I haven't actually read them myself, but I picked up a few details when I was formatting them and it sounds like it might match what you're looking for.
