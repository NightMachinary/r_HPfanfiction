Are there any H/G stories where Ginny is a better-developed character than in canon? Where she is more than the redheaded Quidditch girl who has a decade-long crush on Harry?

Please no Hermione bashing, Ron/Hermione or Hermione/"any male Slytherin".


** linkffn(The Thorny Rose; The Thorny Rose 2: A Bustle In Your Hedgerow; The Thorny Rose 3: A Spring Clean For the May Queen) Ginny retains all of Tom Riddle's memories from the Diary, and helps Harry with the Triwizard Tournament and beyond.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

** I'm sorry, why do you think Canon Ginny is only a long red haired Quidditch girl with a yearlong crush on Harry? There is so much more depth in that character, in canon! Did you only watch the movies or what?

**** I'm not one of those people who say that people who only watched the movies (or maybe like the movies better) aren't real fans. I, personally, think the movies are great, but the books are better. In my opinion the books have much more depth and character progression. But if someone prefers the movies over the books that's okay.

***** I think I'd probably agree about the depth and character progression.

The issue for me was simply that I already knew the plot, so I wasn't pulled along by an interest in the plot. And the characters weren't engaging enough for me to read through just for them (that was also probably affected by knowing where their characters are headed as well).

Just one of those things I guess. I've found I generally tend to prefer Movie or Book dependent on which I see first.

*** Because she has very little "screentime" in the books and I have read far too many stories where she is just a "red haired Quidditch girl with a yearlong crush on Harry". And the few stories where she is developed all are Ron/Hermione, the single biggest reason for me to ditch stories. My suspension of disbelief can handle magic, but not that pairing after reading books 1 to 4.

**** Okay, you're right, there are a lot of those stories out there. But I think in the books she isn't just a redheaded Quidditch girl with a decade long crush on Harry. Still, not enough screen time :P Yeah, good Harry/Ginny stories usually have Romione in it. I like them, but you apparently don't...

***** I just can't see them together after how Ron behaves in PoA and GoF. By the time Ron had gotten his head out of his arse, there's too much water under the bridge IMO. Stuff like Ron's actions around the Yule Ball and how he rallied public opinion against Hermione about the supposed murder of Scrabbers.

#+end_quote

You say that, but the evidence that Crookshanks killed Scabbers was pretty strong. There was ginger cat hair right where Scabber's supposedly died at Ron's bed. The fact that Hermione was so against the idea of Crookshanks being guilty, eventhough it was entirely probably hardly paints her in a better light.

******* That, and Hermione is pretty callous in book 3, she's offending people left and right. If my roommate overheard that my pet died and was just like 'ya that sucks, but at least it proves that your favorite subject is useless' I would be pretty sympathetic to another friend when Hermione turns around and is like 'my cat didn't eat your rat, but he's a prey animal so if the cat did, it's a dirty old rat anyways.'

****** I don't want to change your mind, you are allowed to have an opinion, but I like to think he grew up a bit over the course of the books and even more so after the books. And even in the books he had some great moments, they just tend to be forgotten because all his lines were said by someone else and he only had the funny lines in the movies...

******* I'm not denying that he grew up, but remember that Hermione held her grudge against Crouch past his death. There's no way she'd let the Scabbers thing or the Yule Ball go. There would simply be too much baggage for a successful relationship. Perhaps something short and physical, but if more than half of your memories of someone are really bad, forming an emotional attachment becomes implausible.
