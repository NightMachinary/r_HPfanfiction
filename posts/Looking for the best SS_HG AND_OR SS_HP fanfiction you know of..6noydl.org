  Harry's always been known as The Boy Who Lived. Only Severus knows that this is a lie. (Or: a portrait of Severus Snape, in seven acts.)

  After the war, the last thing Severus Snape needs is the memory of a fleeting wartime kiss and a very persistent Harry Potter thwarting his plans to live a peaceful and solitary life. It's only when Harry's life is endangered that Severus is finally forced to confront his feelings head on.

** I haven't ever seen it recommended here before, but The Burning Pen ([[http://www.angelfire.com/planet/snarkyrose/]]) has some pretty decent SS/HG smut. It's all written by the same author. Don't let the website design scare you off--she writes better than she designs webpages.

** For Snarry,

linkao3(The White Road by perverse_idyll)

linkao3(Requiem At Dusk by Femme (femmequixotic))

linkao3(Snape: the Homes Fries Nazi by pir8fancier)

linkao3(Chrysalis by starcrossedgirl)

The snarryficfind community over at livejournal/dreamwidth is really good for finding fanfiction, especially particular kinds of stories you you want to read through their tags.

  When Harry defeats Voldemort, all those marked by Voldemort lose their magic. Snape decamps to the United States, where he becomes a fry cook in a diner. Five years after Voldemort's defeat, Harry comes to him for advice. AU, obviously, as Snape was still alive when I wrote this story.
