** That's typical. There seems to be as many Labour voters in UK as there are wizards and witches.

** He would have to register to vote beforehand of course, but that probably wouldn't be a problem. He would vote labour because he's basically a decent person. Unlike, it appears, most of the electorate of the UK.

** Eww, no. Please keep those dirty politics away from my entertainment, lest they contaminate it. Also- is Harry even registered in the muggle world? Like a birth certificate or an ID or even a bank account? Just imagine him trying to vote only for the people at the poll station to ask for ID like they've never heard of Harry Potter.

**** Well I don't live (or vote) in the UK, but when I do go to vote I need to show my ID card. Otherwise I can say I'm just anyone, can't I?

***** In Britain voter ID has been trialled on a very small scale but is generally not a Thing. Given the basically non existent level of voter fraud at polling stations there's no point. When I voted yesterday I told them my name and address and that was enough. If I'd told them someone else's details and they'd already voted it wouldn't work, and likewise if the real person shows up later after I've stolen their vote then provided they could show who they were then my earlier vote in their name would I believe be invalidated and a police investigation opened.

**** Obviously. Survival, fighting for your life, growing up, friendship, realising adults have faults and even people you look up to can make mistakes, doing what is right instead of what is easy.

There are obviously parallels about racism in today's society. However, it is not the main point of the series. Far from it, in fact. And real-life politics like labour vs conservative are never discussed or even mentioned. And if they were the series would have aged terribly. Stop bringing real-life politics to entertainment. This is not the place to push your agendas.
