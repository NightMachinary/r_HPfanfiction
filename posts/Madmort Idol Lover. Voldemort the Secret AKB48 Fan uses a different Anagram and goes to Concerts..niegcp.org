(Obviously moves the timeline forward a little) It wasn't Albania where Pettigrew found Voldemort. That was a false trail that was set up to throw off Dumbledore. It was in Tokyo Japan. Voldemort might have been a Dark Lord, but everyone has their vices. His was that he loved J-Idol Music, and finding out about AKB48, he spent most of his time as a Wraith, invisible to others, watching concerts. And the first thing he did when he got his body back? Find a way to get his Tom Riddle Looks back. He couldn't go to a Handshake Event as a Snake-man. They're the Idols you can Meet!


** Voldemort didn't really care about J-Idol music until he parted his soul into Horcruxes. But after that, one day he heard a record of AKB48 and his shattered soul seemed to mend, just a little.

It seemed improbable but as Dumbledore said, music was a sort of magic as well. And AKB48's idol music should be the greatest of all such magics!

Portkeys and Apparition made it pretty easy for Voldemort to go to the other side of the world to explore this mysterious magic. A part of Voldemort knew that he couldn't torture or kill the practitioners of this mysterious art, idols - and so he joined a idol fan group to explore this culture. And thus, Voldemort realized that some songs had a greater soothing effect on his soul. For some reason, AKB48 group's songs were the greatest salve for his spirit.

Knowing this, Voldemort immediately moved away all his Horcruxes away to Japan. Placing his Horcruxes in Muggle Tokyo of all places had rankled him, yet it couldn't be helped - only this land of idols was the perfect resting places for the vessels that housed his spirit.

Even though his conquest of Wizarding Britain was ongoing, Voldemort never paused his research into the mysterious magical musics of the Orient. While the idols of AKB48 were the greatest salve for his soul, they were still muggle - Voldemort was convinced that if he could hear the songs of magical idols, his soul would be made whole and complete.

Yet unfortunately, the idol culture had not influenced Magical Japan. They were as isolationist and muggle despising as Wizarding Britain...

Voldemort's idol appreciating and Britain conquering days came to a abrupt end when his bout of family extermination was interrupted by Lily Potter booby-trapping her baby. Yet his plans succeeded and he was reborn as a wraith in Japan - so he could keep up with his idol appreciating while roaming around as a ghost in Japan. No... he couldn't waste his time with such petty pursuits.

Now that he didn't have Wizarding Britain taking up his time, he could even gather a magical idol group that could surpass AKB48 in musical ability!

Producer Voldemort, Let's Go!
