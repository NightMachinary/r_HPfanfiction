I'm tired of Peter Pettigrew has been evil all along. But I'm also not looking for redemption of Peter Pettigrew post Potters betrayal. If that is even possible.

No crack please.


** The /Different Path/ series by Moonybird and Dtill359 has a really nice arc for Peter. It's not Peter-centric, but more about the Marauders overall (including Regulus, a young Snape and a couple really amazing OC's). I think it's technically classed as a Snape/Lily fic, but it's wayyyyy more of a genfic. Plus, you get /tons/ of scenes with the Marauders, who all have very solid, definitive character arcs; the growth in each character is so well done. James goes from ringleader to the strong, caring leader we know him as. Sirius processes all the dysfunction in his family and comes out the other side. Lupin works through his furry little problem, and what it means about who he is. (I won't spoil Peter's story.)

Lily and Snape are probably the characters with the least amount of screen time. I think maybe they had more at the start, but it definitely wanes and becomes a really cool action story.

One consideration is that English is not the author's first language, so there's some funky wording here or there. But it is well worth it for the story.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
