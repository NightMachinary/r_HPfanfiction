** Not the sheet you're looking for, but the lexicon has a wizarding money to muggle money [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/currency/exchange/][converter]] that keeps track of the exchange rates up to january 1971 (eg. you can look up how much 5 galleons is worth in gbp in 5 january 1995)

The galleon to gbp exchange rate is fixed though
