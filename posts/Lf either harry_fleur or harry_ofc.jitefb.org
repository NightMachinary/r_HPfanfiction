I cant remember much but I think it was a harry/fleur or harry/fleur/ofc. I remember there was a transfer student 4th year that was related to fleur somehow and I think was supposed to be a succubus or part succubus. Pretty sure there was romantic competition between the 2 girls. That's about all I can remember
