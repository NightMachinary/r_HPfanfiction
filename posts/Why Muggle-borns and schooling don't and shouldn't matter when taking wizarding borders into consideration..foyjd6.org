I've seen some people in archived thread about European wizarding borders bringing Muggle-borns and magical schooling into the discussion. But then it got me thinking, why should wizards even care about a minority that doesn't know about their world until a given age? Even more so if this minority doesn't even make up ten percent of the wizarding population if we go by the books. I just want to point that out, but the Europeans never took the Jews into consideration when drawing new borders, and some of them spoke a different language than the Christians, so why would they suddenly do so for another cultural minority spread across the continent?

The thing is, a society who has a small population, who lives in small, isolated and concentrated zones and with insanely advanced potentially illegal ways of transport like the wizarding world will have at best fuzzy borders. Also, seriously, everyone, when was schooling ever a factor into making borders? You have a society which has straight up three common and easily accessible ways of instant teleportation and you're whining about transportation to reach school? Now, I know what you'll say, you'll compare the situation on the continent to the one in Britain. Except that exactly what tells us that Muggle-born students who live in Scotland have to go to London by car or plane and that the Ministry or Hogwarts doesn't just give them a Portkey? Everything seems to point at Hermione and her family living in the South/South-East of England if not in Greater London so that would explain why she never talked about it, she didn't needed such measure.

Honestly, it's like people only care about one person on ten when the borders they talk about would force thousands of witches and wizards to go out of their country or speak another language because some stupid Muggle fancied drawing a line at random over a map without consulting the population that would be affected (not that they even knew they existed, but you get what I mean). It's all well and good if you look out for the poor little Silesian Muggle-borns who speak Polish but the magical government that rules the land speaks either German or Czech, but what about the German witches and wizards who live in Prussia and Czechia and South Tyrol or the Hungarians in Slovakia and Vojvodina and Transylvania or the Natives and Aborigines in the New World or the French in Canada and Louisiana, the Arabs in the Middle-East or the Russians in Belarus and Ukraine, the Turks in the Balkans, the Italians in Dalmatia, the Bulgarians in Northern Macedonia, the Boers in South Africa, the Greeks in Turkey, and all the African tribes who were divided during the scramble for Africa? Should they all change their lives for some measly, insignificant, faceless, worthless, and nameless Mudbloods? Because, from where I stand, it seems like some of you think so.


** Regarding the car thing, the Weasleys literally drove from Devon to Kings Cross. That's a four-hour or more trip, I'm told. And there are apparently rules (according to Pottermore - [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-hogwarts-express]]) that students have to ride the train or not go to Hogwarts at all, and the train was to replace the older system of Portkeys. It doesn't directly state that they don't take Portkeys to the station, but there's nothing to suggest they do, either.

And I sort of agree with you regarding the borders thing, but I think the long-lived, stagnant, and tradition-focused magicals would probably stick with whatever borders were present in 1692 with the Statute. They likely wouldn't pay attention to any changes too far after that point, eg. the incorporation of the former German States into Germany as a single country.

*** I do know about the no portkey/mandatory Hogwarts Express decree (though let's be honest, the students living at Hogsmeade don't use it) but I was referring to taking a Portkey to London. I do know governments like to turn to eleven the application of their idioties, i.e. The Apartheid government taking mixed race children from their family and putting them with parents with the same skin colour so as to keep telling the public it was impossible for white and black people to breed together. Giving Portkeys to Muggle-borns keyed to Platform 9 and 3/4 seems tame in comparison.

**** As far as I'm aware, not a single student is mentioned as coming from Hogsmeade. There probably are some, but it's never mentioned or otherwise alluded to in the series at all.

Certainly does seem rather tame, you're right, but there's an equal argument to be made that they'd simply see it as wasting time - Muggles have their trains and planes and automobiles, so why should Magicals have to waste good magic and/or time they could be using for better things on them?

** I think that for a relatively short amount of time for the WW (say, a few centuries or less), you're certainly right. However, over longer periods of time, there'd need to be a closer look at it.

For instance, German speaking/dominated wizarding community in Prussia would still make sense to me. However, if an author wanted to make, say, a continuation of a magical Roman/Byzantine Empire, they'd need to explain/have a solution for all the Turks in Turkey! Because over 800+ years of being in Anatolia, even a relatively low rate of muggleborns would have grown to a big fraction of the population, let alone the wizards of the groups that moved in in the first place. An option there could be an agreement, where the communities might have made a deal to split the land (eg - the Turkic wizards getting the Anatolian plateau) and having muggleborn go to whichever community they're more associated with.

Obviously Western Europe is the one least touched by this - I'd expect the Middle East, Balkans, and Americas to have markedly different approaches to both the world in 1689 /and/ the current one.

(We also have to remember that the Wizarding World in 1689 wouldn't necessarily have matched the muggle one - so Turkic wizards might not have been in charge of the Balkans, it could have been local communities. And indeed in canon, we know that Bulgaria exists in the magical community, so either it did split off, or it's a remnant of one of the earlier Bulgarias that wouldn't have been conquered by the Turks in the magical world. Extend that line of thinking across the whole world.... and it gets complicated /fast/)

** In my stories, after the SoS went into effect, magical borders didn't change any more when muggle borders changed, but had their own border changes.

** What you are proposing is insane and a recipe for disaster that will never work.

In order for the HP-style of secret society to survive the muggles need to be in on it and play their part in the masquerade. Hence why Britain has meetings between the PM and the MoM, as well as the parents and the children themselves. The entire system would collapse without it.

There is no way in hell that a magical country could not be the same as their muggle equivalent or this system would collapse. And if you add language issues in the mix it would become completely impossible.

The kids/parents would never consent to this and neither would the muggle government, they would break the statute immediately.

*** I never said Muggle governments shouldn't know about it (though Rappaport's Law in MACUSA from Fantastic Beast suggests that some magical governments go the extra way and don't tell their Muggle counterpart). It's sometimes even essential. But witches and wizards also have a right to have their own country and it is supported by canon that not every single wizarding country has the same hasthe Muggle ones. Scandinavia unites the five Nordic countries, Ireland doesn't have a Ministry, Transylvania is independent or a greatly autonomous region, Mesopotamia appears to be still hanging around and it seems implied that, for some obscure reason, Crimea and Ukraine would be both sovereign states post the dissolution of the USSR.

You say the kids and parents would never consent to that? To what, borders they have and had no say in both the wizarding and Muggle worlds? I don't see why the parents should care unless they're hardcore nationalists, because either way what I suggest is sending Muggle-borns from country x at the same school as the wizards who come from the equivalent of country x in the WW. So, if a child was born and lived in Silesia but speaker Polish he would go attention school with the other Polish child, not with the Germans or the Czechs. And what do you think the Department for Magical Cooperation is? If the German/Prussian Ministry wants to do something in Pomerania, they'd just have to cooperate with the Polish Ministry so they can get in contact with the Polish Republic if needed. If needed being the key terms because the Muggle governments barely know any moves made by the magical governments. Hell, they don't even need to know the wizarding borders are different from the Muggle ones.
