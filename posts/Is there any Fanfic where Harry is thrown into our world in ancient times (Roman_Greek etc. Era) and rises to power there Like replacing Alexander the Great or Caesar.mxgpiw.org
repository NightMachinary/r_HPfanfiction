  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

** Oh no, there was one where a female Harry gets thrown back to ancient times and teaches Merlin? And there's one where he is taken in by Salazar Slytherin. They're both pretty great, but I don't know of any where he's a conquerer (let me know if you want me to get you a link)

  What if the Dementor attack in 5th year had ended with Harry losing? What if someone had stepped in to save him? And what if Harry ended up in the past with a chance to be more than he ever was before? A story about a forcibly time travelled Harry and its consequences...

** I think this is quite a common crossover trope, so maybe if you can think of media that is set during the period you're interested in, you might have some luck by doing a crossover search on ffn or ao3. For example, although it's not quite the same thing, there are loads of game of thrones crossovers like this, and others where he has adventures in Middle Earth etc
