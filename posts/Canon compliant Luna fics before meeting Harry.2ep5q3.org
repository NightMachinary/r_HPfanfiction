Does anyone know of any good fics that follow Luna's first four years before she shows up in OotP? I'd prefer if they were canon compliant similar to Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness.


** I recall there was one in the TVTropes fic rec, although you'll have to dig it out. It has been made AU, since it was written before the series ended and the author clarifying stuffs. So it is about as canon compliant as DAYD, which ignores the epilogue and word of god.

I'm not sure if it was 1-4, or just 5 in her PoV though
