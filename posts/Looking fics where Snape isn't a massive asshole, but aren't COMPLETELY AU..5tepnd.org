Basically, fics that aren't /totally/ AU, i.e Harry is still the BWL, etc etc, but simply have Snape be actually nice. Not completely OOC, but definitely somewhat. Perhaps a McGonagall-type character, perhaps just similar in personality without being a straight up asshole, etc.

I've already read To Shape and Change, but let's face it: its Harry is a complete Gary Stu. So, looking for somewhat better plots. Thanks a lot!


** Will crossovers be acceptable? Because snape's 'faceturn' in littlewhitecat's godemperorless heathens actually made me like snape. For that fic. It's fairly au because of the xover but more stranger in a once-familiar land instead of everything is different.

It's a Snape adopts Harry story, somewhat realistic. Very well written.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
