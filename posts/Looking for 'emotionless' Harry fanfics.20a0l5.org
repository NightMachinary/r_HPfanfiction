** - In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][Runemaster]] Harry joins the Ancient Runes class with Hermione after ditching Divination, and it helps him awaken his analytical thinking skills.

- In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]] series (warning for slash ang gore contamination later on) he is not truly emotionless, but often uses various techniques to drain his emotions and operate without their influence for long periods of time.
