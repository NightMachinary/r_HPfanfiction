There seem to be plenty of fanfictions out there that completely change the characters' personalities, their strengths and weaknesses, and the events that take place over the first year at Hogwarts - but they almost all end the first year in the exact same way: Harry stops Quirrell and protects the stone. Are there any stories out there where Quirrell actually gets the stone and Voldemort rises 3 years early?


** linkffn(Enveloped in the darkness) technically has this, with one minor difference from what you are asking for. [[/s][Spoiler]]

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
