Hello! I am looking for some good marauders fics with no romance that are pretty canon. I can use any website (I have no preferences) I am just looking for some good gen fics.

Much appreciate.


** Quite difficult to find, I know. I'm still looking for Marauders fics that focus on the friendship, well-written and canon-compliant.

Today I found /Raging June/ by /TauraNorma/

A short story about the famous prank in 5th year. Very nice.

I also recommend reading /The Last Enemy: The Howling Nights/ by /CH_Darling./

It has romance. Well, not right now, but the pairings are tagged, so there will be some focus on romance, but the portrayal of characters is amazing, Marauders seem very real, and the story has a lot of Harry Potter vibes.
