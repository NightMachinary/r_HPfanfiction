Are there any Fanfictions centered around Neville? Thank you.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17186567][Mistakes]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/felix_atticus/pseuds/sebastianL][sebastianL (felix_atticus)]] - Neville/Original Male character (with past Neville/Ginny); Neville as a professor at Hogwarts. I'd recommend trying this one even if you're wary of the Neville/OMC pairing or first person POV.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/258555][The Lions of Gryffindor]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Lyras/pseuds/Lyras][Lyras]] - Gen; Neville's seventh year at Hogwarts.

** Plenty, but perhaps easier to find on FFN than on AO3. I'm writing a story in which Neville becomes best friends with a time traveling Draco... don't know how that happened

**** Oh, I know how it happened within my story. I think there are some pretty good reasons for it. But how I came up with the idea of making those two best friends and write a story with them being the main characters is kind of a mystery to me, lol.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
