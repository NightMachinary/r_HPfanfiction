Anything goes as long as it's not any non-con/Stockholm syndrome, slash or dark!Harry.

Oh, I prefer it to be while in Hogwarts.


** Jillian Jacobs has some rather sweet H/G fluff:

** linkao3(21280616), this just came up in another thread. A post-Hogwarts unintended Hermione pregnancy, extremely sweet. I had to stop reading about halfway through due to diabetic coma, but that's just because I'm a curmudgeon. It might be what you are looking for - give it a try.

  A broken-off relationship and a mistletoe led to some pretty extraordinary things. A drunken night. A dilemma worthy of the brightest witch. Mainly, for others its easy to mistake a child's father when they're both redheaded Weasleys. At least for her ex.Two, she made a promise never to talk about how it happened in the first place. When the shaky foundation cracks what's left of the build for family?

** These are some of my go to fics when I need some fluff. Copy/pasting the below, but only Thresholds takes place at Hogwarts:

The Pranksters Apprentice (George/Hermione), Strange Bedfellows (same pairing and author but an earlier attempt, not as good, but still solid.)

Another fun but of fluff Harmony, no Voldy, just some au 7th year fluff: Thresholds

One of my wife's favorites, I'm still not sure how I feel about it, but it was a story that made Dramione make some sort of sense: The wrong strain.

  Sometimes, George would find himself out of his depths when working on a prank. Problem is, Fred was always the one to help him out. With Fred gone and a business to run, George is desperate for a little assistance. And he knows the only person who can truly help him is the one person who is guaranteed to say 'no'. But he's been told he's quite good at convincing people...

  A few years after the War, George is in search of a flatmate. Coincidentally, Hermione's just kicked her out. Forced together, they have to see if they can live together without killing each other. Becoming friends? Now that's a laugh.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

  Everyone knew what veela were. Veela were magical creatures, breathtakingly beautiful, who captivated men with a single look. It would have been nice to have been that strain. Instead, Hermione Granger was infected by another. Instead of captivating all men, she was captivated by one. She'd die without him. She was already in almost constant pain. DRAMIONE. COMPLETE.
