I'm fairly new to the hp fandom and while I've found plenty of wonderful fics on ao3 and ffn, I know theres a lot of fics that aren't on either website.

I'm not too picky since I really just want to get more familiar with other fanfic websites, but I do enjoy world-building, dark or grey!Harry, slytherin/pureblood politics, and found family relationships. I'm not interested in any harry/Ginny, harry/Hermione, harry/Tonks, or harry/fleur fics that focus on the romance; if it's background that's fine.


** There are several other sites out there.

I like DrT on ficwad. found [[https://ficwad.com/a/DrT][Here]] the site can be a little clunky but he's a decent writer with several stories. Im sure there are other authors/stories here that are worth reading, but I haven't devoted a ton of time here in a long time. I reread DrT every now and again.

The best other site is probably fanficauthors. I have yet to find an author there I don't like. Found [[https://www.fanficauthors.net/][Here]] most of the unfinished stories are abandoned, but there are many which are finished. Jaconis the owner of the site is my favorite ad has some of the absolute best stories found anywhere!

There is also a site dedicated to only Hrry/Ginny named Sink into Your Eyes. Found [[https://www.siye.co.uk/][Here]] I haven't read anything here in a long time, but it still seams to be pretty active.

There's another site that doesn't appear to be valid anymore called fictionalley.

Happry searching.

** Well, there is [[https://www.fanficauthors.net/][fanficauthors.net]]. Jeconais founded it and invited many of the big names to join up in the mid 2000s. Many fics posted there are still exclusive to this day and could be counted as classics of the fandom. Some examples:

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/]]

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/]]

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/White_Knight_Grey_Queen/index/]]

[[https://crys.fanficauthors.net/Scion_of_Gryffindor/index/]]

[[https://jbern.fanficauthors.net/The_Lie_Ive_Lived/index/]]

[[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Apprentice_Potter/index/]]

[[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Journeyman_Potter/index/]]

[[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Master_Potter/index/]]

Possible that some of those have been reposted to ffn in the meantime, but I'm sure that you will find some good fics if you just look through the website a bit.

** Heyy um, shameless self-plug? Even though we're barely on other sites? The fic I'm currently co-writing is available on ao3, ffnet, Potions & Snitches, and incompletely on Harry Potter Fanfiction (I got a little lazy haha).

But I noticed your preferences are /exactly/ what our fic is about. It's a canon-divergent gen longfic, heavy on worldbuilding, involves blood politics, a greyish Harry, and heavy themes revolving around trust, recovery from trauma, & found family. And all planned romance will be subplot at most, but we're not interested in any of the ships you listed anyway.

If that sounds like it might be your cuppa, here's the ao3 link: linkao3(A Lamb Before the Slaughter)

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?
