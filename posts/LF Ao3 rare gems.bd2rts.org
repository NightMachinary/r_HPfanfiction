I've recently started reading fics on ao3 and going through the high rated fics as well as some recommended on here. I was just wondering if there were any rare gems on there that many people miss.


** I only read on Ao3 so apologies if you've seen these elsewhere.

​

the end came as a cold shock to a pocket full of rocks, to a mouth full of water linkao3(14818256) the only Cursed Child compliant story worth reading

Tower of Air linkao3(108274) it's been rec'd on here a few times, but worth the read it's about Dumbledore's regrets.

for as long as you need us linkao3(16957743) oh my, get ready to ugly cry

and yes i said yes i will yes (or: four weddings and a funeral) linkao3(234550) it's pretty highly rated, but I keep coming back to it

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.

  Tabitha beamed. “I wanted to run an idea by you. We were thinking, you see. It's coming up to the end of October, which means the anniversary of your first defeat of You-Know-Who. Thirty years! So we thought it'd be great to have a whole feature on, you know -- your life now. The Boy Who Lived -- Thirty Years On. No Longer a Boy ...” She was leaning forwards now, tone hushed, fingers wiggling to emphasise the supposed enthrall of this title. “We'll interview you, ask you all about how things have changed for you -- and we were thinking we'd go to Godric's Hollow, where it happened, to do it --”Harry blinked. “You want to go to the scene of my parents' death to ask me about my life?”“It adds an emotional dimension, you see,” explained Tabitha, apparently without irony.“There is already a fairly emotional dimension for me,” said Harry. “You know, since they died and everything.”

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”

** I never see it mentioned here (except when I mention it) but linkao3(Holly at Hogwarts) is among my favorite series. It's a next gen fic, following Dudley's daughter Holly.

A couple of things I really like about it: Holly has a rare magical power (she's an empath). Because of this there's that fun discovery of magic that you associate with the original books. Dudley is still (mostly) Dudley. He's not too keen on the whole witch for a daughter thing. And, in a complete divergence from canon, when horrific crap happens to the kids, there are actual consequences for the kids.
