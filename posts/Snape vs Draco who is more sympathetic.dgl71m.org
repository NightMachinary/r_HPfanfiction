Both are pretty devisive characters who often get fanonized to make them seem like better or worse people than they are.

Snape was a horrible bully to multiple children who never did anything to him apart from be Griffindor or in Harry's case have James Potter for a father. He was so bad he made Neville's nightmare his class. He outed Lupin as a werewolf simply because he was denied an award and wasn't able to get Sirius magically lobotomized for a crime he didn't commit. He joined wizard Nazi's out of sheer bigotry and killed and tortured multiple innocent people willingly and told Voldemort about the prophecy only changing sides when Voldemort killed his onesided crush.

He was also instrumental in taking Voldemort down learnt to stop being such a bigot became a spy at his own risk and went along with Dumbledores plan despite knowing that this meant that everyone would assume he was a traitor and sentence him as one if his true allegances won.

Draco was a rich entitled bigotted petty brat who would have been happy if all the muggleborns dropped dead his second year and harrased Harry for not being his friend and was probably estatic that he'd be a death eater in the future.

He got a reality check really quick only continued being a death eater to save his family, became desperate for a way out, still couldnt bring himself to kill Dumbledore, chose to hide Harry's identity from Bellatrix despite knowing how fucked hed be, and rejected his childhood beliefs as an adult marrying someone far more progrssive in spite of his parents.

So on the one hand you have someone who did far more terrible things but was very important in stopping Voldemort and did get somewhat better as a person but still continued to do unforgivable things to kids out of misguided spite.

On the other hand you have someone far less terrible and did far fewer positive things to compensate but as far as you know does not persist in his assholerey as an adult.

There are reasons to hate both there are reasons to wish both could have turned out to be better people.

Very often though I find that people are more willing to hate one and not the other or be ok with sympathetic narratives with one and not the other.

So who do you think is more sympathetic/redeeemable/like to see redeemed more in stories? And why?

If you like both pick one you find more sympathetic

If you hate both pick the one you hate less.


** Snape has a better moral standing at the end of DH IMO. He's an asshole, but apart from his stint as legitimate Death Eater until 1980, I always considered him on the side of the Light. Draco ultimately "defected" only to save his own skin and was ultimately a coward.

However, Draco, simply by surviving, has plenty of opportunity to end up a better person in the end, an opportunity Snape doesn't get.

Fanon-wise I consider them both to be entirely redeemable without any weird implausible events being needed for it in the aftermath, assuming you make Snape survive DH. Snape probably managing it all by himself by virtue of stopping to becoming a teacher (a job he probably hated) and thus stopping being a horrible person to children, Draco after being "encouraged" to by the Light side clearly winning -- he's a Slytherin and would gladly take the opportunity to recover the Malfoy name.

*** I agree with your arguments, I just came to the opposite conclusion. Snape dying made him more sympathetic than someone who weasled his way out of consequences for his actions. I have no faith he will ever change his opinion and full faith that he will turn up as a supporter of the next dark lord (and lets be honest here, with the way the wizzarding society is set up there will be a next dark lord within the next 50 years).

** Draco easily. Whatever wizard laws say about age of majority, he was still a kid full of hormones and youthful stupidity by the time of Voldy's final end. He saw the dark lord's sanity crumble in real time. He saw his father's cowardly nature laid bare. It won't be easy; he still has a ton of bad thought habits to abandon. But he might end the bigotted streak in at least one Malfoy branch. He has his whole adult life ahead of him, with a truly Voldemort-free future, with most death eaters either dead or imprisoned. If he has any sense he'll soak in the new mores, adapt and grow etc.

Snape lived through two wars with basically the same antagonising forces and it still took death to redeem him. He didn't learn from his mistakes. I don't think he ever renounced Death Eater ideology, not in his heart. He blamed James for turning Lily away from him and then himself for indirectly causing her to die. He held on to his resentment toward James and piled it upon anyone he felt remotely slighted buy in any, with harry in first place. All that time to make something of himself and he just wallowed in hate to the sticky end.

*** I mostly agree with this Snape had a couple lines illustrating that he was less than comfortable with anti muggleborn sentiments. But all things considered that is pretty bare minimum. And Voldemort didnt come back till Harry's fourth year. Plenty of time for him to become a better person even after the Potters death and he did probably the least he could to capitalize on that and you get proof of this. You dont know every thing about him but you know this much.

Draco is only 17 when you last see him. Hes been surrounded in a bigoted echo chamber all his life and you dont even know if hed be more of a Sirius style rebellious kid with the proper influence. The fact is you really know little about him and in the realm of fics this means he basically could be any number of things just depends on how you want to potray him much more room for interpatation.

Also the pining after a girl who wants you to leave her alone gives off Incel vibes to me so at least one thing Draco doesnt have and its and it is definetly a bonus for him

** that depends on what you're sympathetic to. wrt who's a better person:

draco. he was a teenager during the series, &his bark was, inevitably, worse than his bite. he abandons pureblood supremacy as an adult

snape is braver. he's capable of more bad&more good

** I think if being a stupid child counts as an excuse for Draco it should also count for Snape. He was also pretty much a student when he joined Voldemort and changed his mind pretty quickly (I mean, he was also like 20 when the Potters died, so he was also still basically a teenager).

And I wouldn't say the Lupin thing was just being petty because of the denied order of Merlin. Sirius and Lupin did kind of try to kill him at school, got away with it, Lupin knew of the secret ways into Hogwarts and that Sirius was an animagus but did not tell anyone although he thought Sirius tried to kill Harry, he endangered students by not taking his potions,... it's not like he had no reason to dislike them.

*** Alright i will give Snape that since i dont know why he joined and he did Join young. However he was free to be a good person for 14 years after that without having to even play double agent and he used it to shit on Griffindors and bully a kid for looking like his dad.

As for Sirius thing Snape was stunned during the conversation so he could have heard the conversation and have known Black was innocent and if not by then he would have been filled in my the morning after Sirius's escape which is when he reveals Remus's secret, something he had been trying to do all year unprovoked. Outing a werewolf comes with consequences Snape is very aware of. Doing so because of their history is childish but understandable for a child or teenager. He was neither. His frustration is understandable but he is way past the age that kind of behavior can be excused due to childhood impulsiveness and stupidity.

**** I didn't say he did it because he thought Sirius was the bad guy. I said Lupin did all of this while thinking Sirius was the bad guy. And Sirius and Lupin did try to kill Snape in school, I don't think you just get over something like that so easily.

Bullying children is of course not okay, but I also didn't comment on that.

***** Not getting over it doesnt mean your actions can be excused more than a decade later. You cant claim defense for actions that happened over a decade ago.

Sure Sirius should be held responsible too i cant say remus because i was under the impression Sirius tried to get him killed by wolf Remus not Remus tried to do anything.

And while this is meta on my part Umbridges anti werewolf legislation went into effect conveniently righr after the scandal of Lupin being outed as a wolf. It almost makes more sense if she was able to use that scandal to her advantage.

Again thats not confimed or anything just a funfact. Though if she could draft that so quick Snape would at least be aware how bad being outed was.

****** I know that Remus did not know about the prank, but I'm not sure Snape believed that. Remus still did not tell anyone what he knew about Sirius even though he thought Sirius wanted to kill Harry and had already made it into his dormitory. And nothing excuses any behavior. It just explains it. Same goes for Draco. He was young, yes, but that also doesn't make his actions okay. Same goes for every other character. No matter how well meaning or understandable they are, it's no excuse for wrong behavior. But what more do you want of a person than honest regret and striving for redemption? That's literally all a person who has done something wrong can do to make up for it.

This is fair though I personally dont think hes very remorseful about getting Remus fired.

To me personally Snape seems to have more lasting overall damage and I can definitively say he didnt age out of being an ass.

While Draco was an ass his damage was more limited and i couldnt say for sure if he became a better person. But the narrative also didnt redeem him like it did with Snape.

So personally although I do like seeing both redeemed (yes even though i call snape out on all his bs i still like his redemption stories) if I had to pick id prefer them with Draco but partly because its something new that wasnt canon.

*** You're ignoring the fact that Snape did not grow or mature in any way once he became an adult. Not being a death eater any longer does not make you a good person. There is no excuse for how he treated Harry and other students. None.

And blaming everyone else because a woman doesn't love you the way that you love her is pathetic. He held onto that self pitying behavior for his entire life and took it out on her son. He was directly responsible for her death and still took his anger out on her son.

** Neither, both deserved death, life behind bars or if you want to be merciful then obviation, magic removal, and have them dropped off in Canada.

Regardless of upbringing or circumstances we all have free will, and are capable of thinking outside the norm. (personal experience )

but if I had to pick then it would be snape because whatever

** Neither. But if I have to chose I'm picking Snape for the simple reason he had the decency to die. Malfoy is a biggot, and will always be a biggot and a danger to first generation magical people. Just because he was to much of a coward to kill doesn't make him a decent person since he still support Voldemorts message.

** Draco is more sympathetic than Snape. Snape abused children and turned around because of Voldemort breaking his deal.

Draco, despite his actions, had a conscience. He was a coward and a terrible person, but he's still miles better than Snape.
