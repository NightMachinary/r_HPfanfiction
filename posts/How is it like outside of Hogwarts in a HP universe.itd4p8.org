Hello! I'm currently trying to build a scene that is actually outside of Hogwarts, bringing the fan fiction outside of the world of quests and spell-bounds! So more of like the cityscapes, the little shops, and bars, eateries maybe. Am looking for some suggestions as to what would be seen in the streets of a HP universe! It would be cool if there are vanishing apothecary where one has to talk to a flower to get inside! Do let me know some of your fun suggestions! :)


** You have to remember, [[https://www.quora.com/How-many-wizards-are-there-in-the-Harry-Potter-universe?share=1][there are just thousands of wizards and witches in UK]] (give and take, there are different calculations with results from five to twenty thousands). That's one small village in the Muggle world. So, I guess we have just one fully magical village (Hogsmeade), some larger groups of wizards in some Muggle villages (Godric's Hollow), a community around the Diagon Alley, and isolated magical settlements spread in the Muggle world. How is it possible to live in the lifestyle completely isolated from the Muggle world is a mystery to me.
