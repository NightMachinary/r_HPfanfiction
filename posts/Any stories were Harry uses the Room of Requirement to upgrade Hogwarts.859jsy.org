Any stories were the Headmaster of Hogwarts used to use a Room hidden in the Castle to trigger an upgrade of Hogwarts and then the Knowledge was lost maybe deliberately by a Bigoted headmaster who also spelled all the Headmasters Portraits to not be able to tell new headmasters.

and Then threw harry Accessing the room using the Room of Requirement( Or the Room is the Room of requirement)

The Upgrade would be an Automatic thing once triggered so Harry would not have to manually do anything with Hogwarts using all new Knowledge from when the staff and students wears the Sorting hat , and new books added to the library. So first Hogwarts would Process all new information that has been gather since the last upgrade before starting the Upgrades.

also any Stories were Harry uses the Room of Requirement to break the Curse that makes it so that Hogwarts get a Defence against the dark arts to last for more than a year?


** This made me picture Harry entering the RoR and meeting this crazy old wizard (picture Radagast from The Hobbit movies [if you've been tainted by them already, don't afflict yourself unnecessarily]). This wizard is the personification of Hogwarts who was locked in magical space. Harry frees him to resume growing like he used to.

Harry would then find out that Hogwarts was locked up for a reason as the last time he was loose he did all sorts of “improvements” to the castle that took a long time to fix (like making the stairs go crazy until the headmaster was able to make them only have the ability to move). Harry now has to fix his mistake as Hogwarts is now changing the castle drastically (making it float fifty metres in the air, attracting dragons to “protect itself”, etc).

I think this would be awesome...

** Errrr... sounds a little too straining to the suspense of disbelief for my tastes. The Room of Requirement is OP as fuck, but it's not THAT OP. I mean, what next? Harry using the Room of Requirement to create a big button labelled "push to fix everything"?

...I mean, that was the kind of Deus Ex Machina I wrote into stories when I was eight and couldn't think of a way to end a story. I literally had the main character find a button labelled "push to fix everything." My only defence was that I was eight years old, I'd written myself into a corner, and I was sick of writing that particular story.

*** I don't see how it is OP if it can only affect things in the castle and mabye the grounds.

**** Affect, not effect. Also, there's a few fics where the RoR has the "soul" of the castle inside it, and Harry finds her (like 99% of the times, its a woman) and THEN she's the one that changes shit. Would that still work?

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unexpected Powe by kb0) is one of thoses. But there's a lot, just check this reddit.

***** Yep that would be fine, I don't really want Harry to be manually doing to upgrades (although I will take what I can get) I would prefer the castle itself to do the upgrades.

****** There's another one that i remembered, although it isn't quite at that point, he just discovered her, fabulous story tho. linkffn(The Merging) Like I said, there's a bunch of fics with that premise, you just have to look a bit. Search for "Sentient Hogwarts" and you should find a few.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

**** One single room that can change everything in the entire castle and the grounds, on the whim of a student? And do automatic updates like some sort of computer program, AND break a curse that nobody's been able to break for fifty years? That is OP. I mean, that is RIDICULOUSLY OP.

  As the chosen heir to Hogwarts, Harry feels it would be more cost effective and safer if the school was a little smaller and brighter. then came the war. Another oneshot.
