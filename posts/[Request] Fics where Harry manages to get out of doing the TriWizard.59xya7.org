** Have you read linkffn(The Champion's Champion)? There's some pretty major Ron bashing but imo it's hilarious.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

**** I really like Harry/DG, but I know there is a lot of crap in the pairing. That summary sounds like a fic someone makes up to describe all the bad tropes in the pairing. I have total faith in your assessment. Might get a chapter or two later just to see how bad.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
