:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It starts in the 4'th year when Harry's bullied for being the 4'th champion and starts getting lessons from salazar slytherin in the chamber of secrets. He eventually ends up being involved in wizard politics.

Any help is appreciated. Thank you in advanced


** From Salazar itself or a portrait of Salazar? Or maybe a ghost of Salazar?
