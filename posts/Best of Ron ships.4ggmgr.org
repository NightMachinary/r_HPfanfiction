I'm reviving the wiki project! So here's how it's going to go:

I'm going to comment below some ships (such as Ron / Lavender) and then you comment off of my comment your favorite/best fic for that ship. Please use the bot (see usage guide in sidebar) and say why you think its the best. Please only comment recommendations under the top-level comment provided (or else I won't be able to link to it).

Now, if you aren't suggesting fics, please upvote the recommendations that you have read and think are good. Please don't downvote because you don't like the pairing; someone does, so don't judge.

If you don't see a pairing, then submit a top-level comment of that pairing.

Thanks for contributing to the wiki!

*EDIT: I'm kinda flying blind here. I haven't read many Ron pairing fanfics, so I don't really know who he is usually paired with. Please submit top level comments if you know fics that meet that pairing.*

*** linkffn(Disbelieving in Trees by potter47) is probably my favorite of the lot. Slightly rom-com-esque, but fits Ron and Luna perfectly, I think.

linkffn(Bare Feet and Blubbering Humdingers by A Million Ways). post DH romance, pretty decent stuff.

linkffn(Ron's Admirer by Goldy). Mildly amusing.

A couple of oneshots that are pretty good:

  Non-epilogue compliant. Four years after the war ends, Ron quits the aurors and moves back in with his parents. Luna has returned from her world travels, older, wiser and now her owl has low self-esteem. Oh, and Harry finds the whole thing hilarious. A Ron/Luna fic because it's weirdly perfect.

*** linkffn(Survivor by atruwriter) for all that it's not the focus of this story, I enjoy the way it feels natural and the way Luna is very human and real, they avoid the whole ethereal prophet trope.

Granted, I think Ron might be a fair bit ooc in this, so that could raise some eyebrows.

Just seconding pretty much anything written by HalfASlug, plus the little0bird and Northumbrian canons - while there aren't a ton of standout stories from the latter two authors, the general universe is nice and full of these two.

  Ron and Hermione talk about their feelings at Shell Cottage and realize they may never get a chance to be together. Based off my personal headcanon of what happened and is entirely in sync with the scene from the Deathly Hallows book. Rated T for angst.

*** Probably, and it completely proves Ron's jealousy in the book too, which is oddly ironic.

We don't care as much about Ron because, well, he is less interesting than Harry and IMHO Hermione. He doesn't have that many skills other than chess and is negatively portrayed a lot in the fanfics I read at least (eating habits, study habits, jealousy, etc). But I also think that makes him one of the more believable and human characters in the series. He has flaws and isn't extraordinary in many ways, much like many of us. That is supposed to make his character more relatable to the audience more as well, but I don't think that really happens. Maybe because everyone else has a specific character trait they are known for in the series, everything is supposed to be extraordinary in HP and he isn't or, perhaps, we don't like him because he reminds us too much of our flaws, whatever the reason is, he is ignored and cast aside in a lot of fanfics or used a plot device to show how Harry has no friends.

That was a whole lot of connected thoughts in one paragraph. Please read with caution lol.

LIES! SLANDER! LIES AND SLANDER EVERYWHERE!

To give a more mature response, the reasoning behind less fics and pairings for Ron is simply because Harry is the main guy character and Hermione is the main girl character. So what does that make Ron? The next male character? When you look at it from that (admittedly shallow) perspective, it's no wonder he has less fics.

I've also noticed that there are people who don't ship Hermione and and Ron together because they love Hermione and hate Ron, but it's never the other way around. I've seen some people who love Ron and don't like Hermione but still pair them together. Hence why Ron is almost exclusively paired with Hermione.

But yeah, the bashing of him is ridiculous. I would rant about that, but I've already gone on more than enough times about my overflowing hatred for Harmony shippers, so I won't.
