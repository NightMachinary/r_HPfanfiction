Inspired by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/dsf4t1/if_harry_and_ron_has_been_killed_by_aragog_and/f6oycmn][this post]].

The way I see it, Pettigrew would return to Riddle out of fear when he gains his new form from Ginny and summons his followers. Except nobody knows he was serving Voldemort, not even this version of Voldemort. So he ends up fleeing to the real Voldemort as he does in canon. Queue Voldemorts return and a new war.


** The thing is.. I don't think that young-Voldemort could rally his followers. If he doesn't have Voldemort's knowledge and experience, if he's limited to his 17 year old self's knowledge/experience/capabilities, how would he even know who his supposed followers were?

His most skilled and powerful death eaters won't be able to tell the difference between a 70 year old mass murdering master of magic and a brilliant 17 year old schoolboy?

*** He'd know some of his supporters - he'd know to expect the malfoys, etc. He's charismatic and most of his supporters are loyal to his power (the ones out of azkaban anyway) rather than to him himself. If he doesn't rush he'd be able to get enough to support him that the rest will also fall in line because he's the one with the power

** Basic premise of linkffn(A Black Comedy) is BWL Neville gets consumed by the diary and is declared dead yet Voldemort comes back and ends up fighting him.

Edit: Adding spoilers for one of the most popular fics ever.

** I think it would be more interesting, if when Harry died since he is a Horcrux, his Horcrux takes over and rises to power. He would have the fame of Harry Potter and the power of Voldemort.
