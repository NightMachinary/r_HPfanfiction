Hi, I read an old fanfic (or maybe two different stories) where Harry was really good at transfiguration, like better than Dumbledore or McGonagall good.

I remember the first task where Harry conjured a bunch of metal then used it first as a fan type thing to block the dragon's fire then as armor to block its tail.

I also remember him taking the transfiguration NEWT (I think) it was an obstacle course where he was only allowed to use transfiguration and he just walked through the entire course without pausing and without a care in the world.


** Alright, on my umpteenth search, after I posted this I figures out what story I was thinking of. It's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2772010/23/The-Power]]
