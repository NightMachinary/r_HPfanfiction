As in, a story starts off with a cool premise, but ends up falling flat for whatever reason. For me, it has to be Blindness, linkffn(10937871), and My Life Is My Own, linkffn(5276974).

Blindness starts with the simple premise that Harry is blinded by Voldemort, what now? But instead of creating something original, it devolves into "Harry is a child prodigy" Harry Stu crap in literally the next chapter.

My Life Is My Own starts with the premise of Harry having a perfect Eidetic memory. It starts off interesting with Harry using his ability to free Sirius, but then it just dissolves into Harry somehow being the last remaining descendant of all 4 founders. And he's also a dick who demands being called "Lord Potter" at the sorting. Ugh.


** For me it's linkffn(Rent a Hero). It's a good basis, especially the divination parts, but it turns out to be a story of everyone walking over Harry and him not reacting to it in anyway. It just frustrated me reading it. Besides, the author asks for money to continue and that's just tacky.

***** I always feel that divination is shit on a lot in fanfiction, but that this is the obvious solution. Authors can still call Trelawny a fraud, but why not have Harry explore the divination books in the library and find out about scrying for things, and other related topics under the divination subsection of magic.

****** Trelawney wasn't even a fraud, just doom and gloom focused that led to misinterpretations. All those Grims in the tea leaves weren't the Grim, but Sirius. She warned Lavender to beware the red-haired man (Ron, and the eventual heartbreak). Tarot cards in HBP both told her that Harry was nearby, and that Dumbledore was going to die.

The problem with Divination isn't in getting the information, but understanding it.

** I'm one of those who think that A Cadmean Victory had potential, that just went straight down the shitter when summer came.

But I think the big one is actually The One He Feared. While an amazing fic, Taure was just trying to be too clever with his story structure, and it just couldn't go on past the 4th chapter. This could have been capital-G, Great. Right now it's /the best/ Harry-gets-someone-else's-memories fic, and that's with four damn chapters.

*** Came here to say A Cadmean Victory. I loved how the author showed Harry slowly going down the path to accepting darker and darker spells while getting more powerful. So many authors automatically make Harry dark or powerful without a good explanation. There were so many things I loved in this fic during the school year and then it went downwill after that. Culminating in that super weird chapter where the author totally changed the writing style then the epilogue where the author took the easy way out and didn't have Harry die or live outright. I would've been fine either way, just wish it would've been an actual ending and not what it was.

** Oh god, I have one that has been pissing me off for months. Seriously, I stopped reading months ago, but it still annoys me, because it had such potential!

The fic is linkffn(11047955) One Step Forward, Two Decades Back. The premise was original, I loved the the side characters, especially the Blacks, and it was very well written.

The problem? It tries too hard. It throws soo much at you, and after a while I kinda felt like I wanted to have a note pad and a pen nearby to keep track of the story.

So, spoilers, some of the stuff that annoyed me.

So Hermione gets thrown back in time and wakes up as the twin to Sirius black. She keeps both her old memories as well as memories from her life as a Black. The story moves back and forth in time, sometimes telling Harry´s POV, who also has memories from his old friend Hermione, as well as memories of growing up with his god mother and teacher Hermione Black. So far, really interesting! Yeah, but Hermione is animagus, a phoenix. She was also literally born a phoenix cuz that's a first-Black-born-in-a-generation-thing. Her dad had been born a manticore or something. And she befriends Lily, Remus and Snape, and teaches Snape to become an animagus too, to hang out with wolfy Remus. (Lily thinks animaguses are icky.) But since they're "pack", wolfy Remus slobbers on them, and they're wolves as well. Not werewolves per se, but more like a secondary animagus. Because that's thing. And James and gang are assholes. Sirius tries to reign them back and such, but James and Peter are bullies to the extreme, almost killing Hermione at times. BUT, this is because Peter is a grown, imperiused man in a childs' body, thanks to Dumbledore, and he is there to cause a rift between Blacks and Potters or something. So he poisons candy with stuff to make them all bullying and mean. And speaking of Dumbledore, the only reason Fawkes hangs around him is because Dumbledore has imprisoned Fawkes' mate, to use their eggs. Because phoenix eggs are used to travel in time or something, so he's been travelling back in time to make Snape Senior a abusive bastard, Lyall Lupin hate werewolves, etc. Oh, and also, Hermione and gang are becoming all famous because they're developing wolfsbane, and Umbridge does not approve. So she tries to set up a wolfy father to kill his daughter, but instead gets kinda (?) bitten, and gets turned into a pink werepoodle. Yeah. She is thrown into Azkaban were she turns the rest of the prisoners into werepoodles. And also, Lyall finds out his wife is a werewolf too and tries to attack her, and he also is thrown into jail, where he instantly soul bonds with Umbridge, and wolf-slobber turns him into a werepoodle as well. Prison full of werepoodles. Remus' mom gets a job as a groundskeeper and meets Moody and, again, soul mates, slobber, Moody werewolf. Phew. Also, when Hermione and gang finds out what Dumbledore is doing, they find all the phoenix eggs, and also "time cells" where Dumbledore keeps different Hermiones and Snapes, whom they rescue. So we have like four different Hermiones and Snapes from different dimensions all living in the same one. And they save all the phoenixes and aaall their friends get one! That's where I stopped reading. Also some pureblood things that are fun, apprenticeships with McGonnagall, etc, Hermione is best friends with centaurs, family stuff, etc. Seriously, a lot of it is good, and the writing is very good, but, phew, soo much!

For example, Daphne Greengrass is an Ice Queen, one of the Slytherins in the same year as Harry that isn't a pureblood supremacist. She does this to protect herself from the other Slytherins, and uses it to her advantage in gathering information. She's also a spout of Pure blood tradition, and laws.

I didn't actually copy the Daphne is an Ice Queen cliche. I was writing my own Fanfic, and the idea popped in my head when I wanted add a couple of Slytherins in the mix, so I wrote her as a cold and aloof character, with Tracey Davis as her best friend, who was in turn the more open and bubbly one. It was only after I really started reading Harry Potter fics that I realized it was somewhat common.

Normally Daphne takes the spouts of pureblood tradition because she is a more "proper" pureblood than the Weasleys, and knows the ones that are mostly exclusive to the upper crust that the Weasleys wouldn't due to their poverty. Same with the laws. Hermione doesn't know all of them, she know the common law, yes, but the older ones are the ones Daphne would know due to them only really being relevant to the higher rungs of society. At least, that's how I wrote it.

I think a lot of the fan made cliches are copied simply because we love the idea of them so much. Ice Queen Daphne Greengrass, the Goblins and their "May your sword drip with the blood of your enemies" and "May your vaults flow with gold" greetings and farewells, along with Harry having a lordship, and him being more abused than we're shown in the books.

It's mostly due to Rowling not fleshing out her world except for when absolutely necessary, and there being so many characters she names once, and then never mentions again.

It's something that starts small, one or two people write something this way, and a lot of people read and enjoy it. Then, a few of those people who read it, like the idea, so they borrow it for their own story. Then it snowballs out of control to the point we sometimes forget that it's a fan trope, and not canon to the actual story.

To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

** oh my... a lot of them.

Fresh in my mind is "A Switched Chance". Harry and Hermione timetraveling back together and waking up in each others bodies. The premise was a wonderful foundation for a crackfic... yet it fell completely flat.

The Ilvermorny Champion had me at chapter 1, but lost me quickly. The Murica wank in it is just too much to handle combined with just weird and awkward characters. Harry's sister Rose outted herself as bisexual at 11... I outted myself as loving chocolate ice cream with 11. That is what 11 year olds think about.

Blindness has already been named by you. That could have been amazing, and I even liked the "Harry sees magic" thing. But over time the author made his blindness into this uber-sense of awesome and the fic lost all appeal.

And well, so so so many more.

The positive thing was the introduction of Slughorn. I like that character a lot, because he represents someone who I always thought would be 100% Core-Slytherin.

But then the good stuff gets rapidely less. The book was the first thing that just pissed me off. I get that Hermione effectively defines herself over her values and her grades. Having someone undermine one of those gets a strong reaction from here. I get that. But seriously, after a month or so you wonder why she isn't at least curious as to why this works so much better.

Then the whole deal with Draco. I get that Dumbledore is kinda like "Yea, let him succeed, I'm done anyway" after he curses himself with the ring (and lets not talk about the year long extra-lessons that could've been done in a week or less). I was so torn out of my immersion when Hermione and Ron refuse to believe something is up. That felt so incredibly forced, its not even funny. Your best friend tells you the Wizard-Nazi upstart looks suspicious. You even see him acting suspicious. There is real reason to believe that he is actually doing something as he is the son of an Inner Circle Death Eater. And yet, nothing.

I'm not even gonna start on the teenager romance part of it all and the Evil Chest monster of Harry that was so incredibly forced upon the whole thing that people almost immediatly got the idea of love potions. Even when I read it the first time as a teenager, I was reminded that at the start of the book we even read about Weasley made lovepotions. Then we hear Slughorn talk about them and /then/ we even have Ron being poisoned by the one from Romilda. I know, that is not what happened, but I think the amount of love potion fics that came up after that and that still refer to it as "evidence" of Ginny using love potion tells you enough about the poor execution of that romance.

Not to mention Hermione (maybe Ron?), don't believe or don't care when Draco Malfoy is /obviously/ up to something. Then again, Ron spent too much time snogging Lavender to notice anything else for a good portion of the book.

Then there's Harry using /Sectumsempra/ on Draco when he DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES. You would think Harry would do something, like I dunno, test the spell on an inanimate object or something.

  Hermione gets angry because the Half Blood Prince 's potions book has extra tips and stuff to be more useful
#+end_quote

She gets angry over a book that gives additional information beyond the standard text. Why? When did she start to reject information? She's /obsessed/ with books, knowledge, information. It makes no sense.

Could it be that she rejects anything that disagrees with the printed text? That doesn't make any sense either. There's no way she's read tons of books and none of them disagreed with each other.

Could it be that the information was hand-written? No, she routinely let Ron and Harry read her own hand-written notes. Which, by the way, is just as much cheating as reading anyone else's notes.

So then it's that the information comes from an unknown source? Is she so narrow-minded that she rejects any information without an author's name on it? Well, that could actually be it. She seems to worship authority to such a degree that she'd reject anything not proven to come from a position of authority. She more or less bullies her way into Gryffindor because Dumbledore was there, despite her being the quintessential Ravenclaw. She also goes straight to the professors when Harry receives a broom from an unknown person.

I think that meshes with the rest of the books. She's more afraid of being punished by an authority than death. /"... or worse, expelled."/

Well, that one I can almost understand. Harry's not a diligent student. He's very much a Gryffindor, as in jump first, think later. And it was marked "for enemies", so Harry used it on his enemy. Wasn't it also self-defense? And what would that spell do to a rock? Scratch it?

That was a bit of a surprise. Ginny is mostly a non-entity in most of the books. Book 1: Fangirl. Book 2: Damsel in distress. Then a whole lot of nothing until Bam! Girlfriend!

And with all the incessant bickering between Ron and Hermione, I didn't expect them to end up as a couple. Quarrelling like a married couple doesn't make for a good foundation for later marriage. Hermione: Studious, progressive, afraid of flying and dislikes Quidditch. Ron: Lazy, conservative, loves flying and Quidditch.

It must have been "opposites attract", because they have almost nothing in common.

On the other hand, with 2 boys and 2 girls, how do you make them into 2 couples? Most everyone else are non-entities, so there's not much to choose from.

** linkffn(Rise of the Wizards) had an interesting premise with nail-biting implications. Harry suffers for his hubris during the Hogwarts-focused arc, and I experienced genuine concern when it was apparent that he'd overstepped the mark.

Unfortunately, the large-scale battles and Muggle-maiming intrigue came at a heavy price, what with all the dressings of your typical Indy!Harry fic. Attempts were made to subvert a number of the more tired cliches, but they're not accommodating enough for a back to back re-read.

The most grievous offence is unquestionably the ending, though. Shaving off the last five or six chapters (before it went all Magitek-style like Emperor) might have served well.
