i'm having quite the internal conflict when it comes to time traveling AUs (e.g. lily/harry/sirius fall into the veil and come back 10-18 years into the future.)

what i love: any redemption arks, angst, etc (e.g. snape redeems himself when lily is still around.)

what i hate: literally every character's personality just pulls a 180 and every plot dynamic is ignored. it's like the war never happened. (e.g. ron and hermione split up, dumbledore is still alive somehow, half of harry's friends just disappear.)


** Love: time travel fix-its, raised by others, alternative sortings and day 0 AUs

Hate: power wanks, lord everything-under-the-sun, main characters being dickish assholes

I'm rather forgiving about bashing etc as long as it stays entertaining. If it's just there because the writer hates the character... probably not. But if it has a purpose in the plot or is just funny? Then sure.

And here we go with the xbox meme again?

** I love Slytherin Harry/dark Harry stories but so many of them are so bad and tropy

what i love: a darker Harry who is actually somewhat changed by all the bad things that happens to him.\\
I think it‘s realistic that you don‘t Just walk away from 10 years of neglicene and borderline abuse. Even if you manage that somehow, there is also the point of being nearly killed five times at age eleven, shunned and again nearly killed at age twelve, hearing your parents die a whole year while thinking your parents traitor is after you only to be nearly killed by a werewolf and nearly lose your soul... and that‘s literally the better half of Harrys Hogwarts years. I like Dark!Harry Fanfics because they actually adress all the sh* that happens to him.

What i hate: Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin and whats not; bashing of the good guys/ apologicing the bad guys; out of character without plot explanation (you can change a character in your ff - but it needs time and reason that fits with the original character); „friend of the goblin nation“; unexplained OP Harry (you can make him stronger than canon - but I want a in world reason for it that isn‘t some Deus-Ex-Machina bullsh*)
