Happy Sunday, all!

I've been struck with inspiration for a new fic with the central premise being time travel. I'm talking traveling 20 or so years into the past (think traveling from 1998 to 1978-ish). I have my characters and general plot line figured out, but I need some help with (or some help finding good resources) related to how to neatly and plausibly tie-in time travel so that it is close to canon or at least believable. As a note, I don't plan on anything in the present being changed by the time travel.

Main questions:

1. *Travel using a Time Turner?* As I understand it, most time turners can only go back a few hours at a time (with the exception of Cursed Child using one to travel years back). Would it be plausible to have a time turner without the typical limitations, say maybe one tampered with by old or Dark Magic and held by a pureblood family, that a character has access to?
2. *What happens to my time-traveling character in the present?* This may be a stupid question, but what will happen to the present version of my character when they travel back in time? Does time continue to march forward for them in their present version while they're "gone"? Or does time "freeze" until they come back? If they spend a year in 1978, does a year pass in 1998? Is there anything in canon dealing with this or any suggestions? In POA, it seems like time stands still for Harry and Hermione when they travel, but they are only gone for a matter of hours. Would anything change if they were gone for months or a year?
3. *How to integrate time-traveler into Hogwarts?* If my character travels back in time during the school year, how would you explain their sudden appearance at Hogwarts in the past? Like suddenly a new student appears in seventh year; how would they have a dorm assignment or class schedule or anything else related? Would not explaining this annoy you as a reader?

I appreciate any input on these topics, as well as links to resources for more information on time travel as it pertains to the HP universe. I may have more questions to add later on and depending on any responses that anyone is kind enough to leave, so I'll add them as they come to me! Thank you all!

EDIT: Already remembered another question I had! (Added as Q3)


** With a time travel fic, I wouldn't necessarily worry about making the time travel process feel canon-esque. If you want your character to know how to return to the present, then a time turner is probably the best way to go. If they're time travelling by choice, then you can have the time turner work but if you need them to be stuck in the past for an indefinite amount of time, just have the time turner break. Otherwise, I would just stick to a magical accident or a ritual... neither of which explicitly fit with canon but don't feel out of place.

With your second question... well, that depends entirely on what you want to do. In the classic time travel set up, a character travels backwards or forwards and then returns to the same moment they left. From the perspective of everyone who didn't time travel, they weren't gone at all... even if they spent years time travelling. However, some kinds of time travel don't work like this. Ever watched the Days of Future Past X-Men movie? Or (spoiler) Deja Vu? In those movies there's a set ratio... time spent in the past is equal to some multiplier of time spent in the present. In Deja Vu they have a 1:1 relationship (though, strictly speaking, they don't time travel in that)... they see four days into the past and can't go back further or less than that. In DoFP, Logan's body is in the present and it's just his mind that travels back.

To your third question? Well, the way I have done it in a handwritten WIP of mine is just to have Dumbledore and Moody intercept James Sirius when he first arrives. They interrogate him a little bit, decide he's not a Death Eater, help him come up with an alias and then pass him off as... ooh, I can't remember if I was having him be homeschooled or "family returned to Britain from overseas". Of course, I also had James arrive before the school term began.

(I should note my James fic isn't just a time travel fic... Harry and Ginny accidentally got transported to a parallel reality before James was born, and James accidentally travels to the real world as a teenager but arrives decades before he was born when the Marauders were at school. The reality hopping part is why Dumbledore and Moody help him out.)

The best thing I think you can do is get a feel for various time travel tropes is by reading or watching them. Obviously a lot of fics use them but you can also look at how non Harry Potter stories do them.

** For Q3, I'd say that the most common explanation is that the time traveler is a transfer student. Depending on the timeframe, it may be explained away as a late transfer because his/her parents or guardians or tutors were either recently murdered by Death Eaters or decided to send them to Hogwarts for safety reasons because of Voldemort/Death Eaters. Typically the student ends up in Dumbledore's office, gets sorted, and gets his/her schedule from his/her Head of House.

I think you need to have some sort of explanation or back story, which could be explained to the reader by showing the sequence of events or telling it through the time traveler's conversations with his/her fellow students, who will undoubtedly be curious and asking about where they came from and why they're there.

** 1. Honestly, some of the better time travel stories I've read either make something up out of whole cloth (like when Binns throws a hissy fit and start randomly tossing around time tuner dust because reasons) or simply doesn't say (there's a Harry raises himself where Harry had no idea how he ended up in the past, he was just there). Whatever you do, don't make a huge deal out of it - just pick something and roll with it.

2. Whatever you want. Either the time-stream splits, or it alters to accommodate the changes the time traveller made, or it's already happened and nothing changes at all. Pick something.

3. Transfer students happen - new 7th year student? Home schooled kid goes to hogwarts for NEWTs. Sign him up and done.

Don't overthink, just write and see where it leads you imo. You also don't need to write in order!

**** Not overthinking is a hard lesson, sometimes.

I have a /very/ extensive ilvermorny fic set in the 60s that I burned myself out on by just... Over the top world building, I suppose. Pages and pages and pages of it to go along with the outline. To the point where I wrote out curriculums and made a course calendar and... If I had just wrote the story instead of mathing out the population of wizarding na in 1966 and assigning governments to fake countries I could be done lol.

Probably I should post the wb stuff - maybe somebody could find it useful, as I dunno if I'd ever return to it.

** 1-- when in doubt, the answer to a lot of logistics questions is 'because magic'. Make something up and be confident in it.

2-- I personally find it incredibly annoying when there are 2 parallel streams (everything from alternating chapters to brief interludes) in a time travel or dimension traveling fic. If you want to show things changing, do it at the end. To me, it's a filler and just about always prompts me to find something else.

If that's not what you meant--if your question is when should your traveller return, again my advice is to make something up 'because magic.'

*** Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of the parallel streams either. I want to use time travel in this fic to sort of fill in the gaps of how an event in the past happened rather than trying to change past events.

** 1. Canon never confirmed what where the limit of a Time Turner. It is not impossible (and even probable) that a Time Turner could be used to go into the far past, but it would just be incredibly tedious for the user to go back several year in the past with /one hour a turn/.\\
   Anyways, it's arguably canon since it's not in the books, but Pottermore has (or had?) a story about how the Unspeakables sent one of them several decades or centuries into the past. They managed to sent her there and get her back without any troubles, but things got weird because of the disrupted timeflow (she aged several decades instantly and died, there was no night for several days . . .).\\
   So, while I'm not sure a Time Turner would be the best choice, far past time travel are possible. And the "limitations" of the Time Turner are more for user safety rather than performance issues. Though you could probably use something like "Old Family Magic" or "Deathly Hallows" to protect your MC from the bad side effects.
2. There are no clear rules about time travel (since it's pure fiction), so I think it's up to the author and what I'll be saying next is more of a personal headcanon of mine than anything else.\\
   In HP, the Time Travel seems to follow the "singular timeline" theory. In PoA, Harry and Hermione didn't truly change the past since everything they did was already done when they were in the present (and I see that it's pretty hard to explain that). This theory has several downside (like you can't really change the past since the past already happened, even with your intervention), but I'm sure authors could work around that should they wish to.\\
   What's important is that, with this theory, nothing will happen to the Time Traveler into the present, because they are not in the present anymore. The Time Traveler left the timeline (or rather moved into another point of the same Timeline), which means he doesn't really have any connection with the present. It is important because it means that the Time Traveler doesn't have a "return to the present" button he can press. If he wants to return to his present, he rather has to make another Time Travel in the opposite direction (toward the futur).\\
   Because of that, it's entirely up to the Time Traveler to decide where (or when) he will come back. He can come back moments after his first Travel, or several months later so the same ammount of time as passed for the people in the present as for him in the past. He can also technically comes back one day before he went to the past so he is well rested when people ask him question.
3. Personally, I would use the good old excuse of "Transfer Student". Time Traveler went to another Magical School or was homeschooled, but for some reasons he now has to go to Hogwarts so here he is. It's what most author of Time Travel do and it works pretty well.\\
   The main difficulty is that Harry (or any other Time Traveler) can't really create a whole fake identity by himself, but it's relatively easy to find him some suppoter:

   1. The DoM monitor Time Travel and quickly find him in the past (their present). After hearing his story they decide to support him and give him an identity.
   2. Goblins don't care about Wizards non sense. If he is from an old family (like Harry), Harry has the key of a vault and (even if it annoys me) a blood connection with the current owner so he is free to use said vault. Money can they be used to buy an identity.
   3. Dumbledore is already Headmaster of Hogwarts and, after hearing about the quest of the Time Traveler, decided to help him.
   4. Any living wizards (the Potters, the Blacks, hell I even saw one with Slughorn) met the Time Traveler by coincidence and, with or without knowing about the Time Travel stuff, decided to give him some assistance.

*** Wow what a detailed reply, thank you! I'm trying to mirror the time travel in POA, where it is a singular timeline and the future (or present) isn't changed at all by the character's travel back to the past. I really like your explanation about the " no return to the present button"!

After reading everyone's thoughtful responses here, I'll probably go with the transfer student excuse as it seems the easiest and least confusing to do. Again, thank you for taking the time to write this all out!

** (1) I assume that a Time Turner can only send someone back a certain number of hours (12-24 seems to be the most common in fanfiction) because of HOW they cause time-travel. The limit to how far back a Time Turner can send you is , in my head, due to one of two factors, if not both: *A*) The past (12-24) hours are the only flexible period of time for an individual when time-traveling via Time Turner due to HOW said device works; *B*) The limit is a "built-in" safety feature whose purpose is to prevent either time-related "disasters" or health issues. It's possible that two or more of the same person at the same time for a prolonged period of time can have negative effects on the traveler's health. I know that it's not HP-related, but look up the /Dragonriders of Pern/ series by Anne McCaffrey. Some of the later stories in in-universe chronology give a valid example. With that said, there could be a ritual requiring multiple Time Turners that could send one farther back in time. */BUT/* due to HOW Time Turners work, it would have to send the user to a point in time significantly /prior/ to their existence/birth.

Furthermore, Time Turners are generally depicted as having the ability of sending someone back in time, but NOT the ability to bring them forward. Essentially, time-travel via Time Turner is "Okay, I just sent myself back 12 hours. How am I going to spend that time?"

If you want to use a different method of time-travel, go right ahead, so long as you are consistent and don't over-think it.

(2) That honestly depends on personal preference, where you want the story to go, and how you choose to have them time-travel. Just be consistent and don't over-think it.

(3) Once again, that honestly depends on where you want the story to go, just be consistent and don't over-think it.

** Love time travel fics, always a really interesting concept.

Regarding Q1: most fics have long distance time travel as an accident or ritual of some kind. I have read some where a time turner is hit with a spell as Harry is using it and this obviously messes up, sending him years back rather than hours. I, personally, would be okay with the dark/old/unknown magic affecting a turner to send him back much further, however i'd like a bit of theory about the how. I.e, 'this time turner has been sat in a hidden room in "ye olde dark pureblood manor" which used to be a ritual room and was used as a storeroom. the time sand inside soaked up the "ambient magic" or some such and so was much more powerful'

​

Q2: I would base it on your situation. If the character is simply going back for an hour with a turner, then they live through that hour and *cannot change* anything that has already happened. in cannon H + Hr couldn't interrupt in the Shack in PoA and just kill Pettigrew because from their perspective an hour ago a different H + Hr didn't bust in and do that, it creates a paradox.

That said, there would be nothing stopping them warding the surrounding area of the Whomping Willow to stun rats when they move a certain distance from the tree. H + Hr saw Peter escape when Remus turned werewolf, and know that in the past they didn't capture him, but now as they have no further interaction with Peter at this point, they could capture him and take with them, just not showing him until they "caught up" with themselves. It is all based off of paradoxes, but essentially for it to work *the time would have effectively "frozen" for anyone who was* */with/* *the time travelers before they went, but didn't go with them, like Ron in the hospital wing,* H + Hr were in the hospital wing the whole time, but suddenly teleported from the middle to the door.

As for a time skip whilst in the past when travelling back to the future it depends on how you get back. linkffn(10709411) concept for time travel requires that Harry live all the way through the time he travelled back (multiple years) so he goes the long way around so to speak. this is a similar concept to time turner - as the idea of the time turner isnt to then travel forwards again, but to repeat the time you travelled backwards in full. In this fic someone travels back with a ritual and meets Harry whilst in the past. This person then travels forwards again,>! but because there is no fixed point to travel to in the future they die within hours. !<

If your premise was to change things in the past - major things like character deaths - then you're kinda creating a new reality, so say Harry saved Lily and James in the past, when he travels back to his future and current times, he wont have grown up with the dursleys, so does he remember that life or not ( if not then creating a paradox) But if he does remember does he remember his life with the Potters?

A time skip would be cool, however going off of canon rules no, it wouldnt.

​

Q3: linkffn(4198643) has Harry as a transfer student although he appears right at the start of the year. if it was mid-year then maybe a homeschooled student that lost their parents to a fire or DE attack? Problems arise with fooling/convincing Dumbles and having papers/OWL results to prove it.

​

I personally love time travel fics and thinking and discussing the mechanics of the time travel. if you ever want to chat about it then please message me, i could go on for ages. good luck :)
