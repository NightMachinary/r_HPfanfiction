Why does no one takes Dumbledore's lemons?


** If you've ever had a sherbert lemon or any other boiled sweet you should know that sometimes if they get warm, or just old they become horrendously sticky. Dumbledore might have spelled them to be fine but would you want to risk getting sticky disgusting fingers all over Dumbledore's nice office?

** You mean aside from the rather creepy implications of a celibate old man offering candy to children in his private office?

Can't imagine why.

** It's a very British sometimes-true-stereotype thing. We're often very hesitant to be a bother or to inconvenience others. An American might visit a grandparent and eat heartily from whatever they cook, but an English person would be far more likely to say "Oh, only if you're cooking already, I suppose I'll have some, if that's alright with you." etc.

It's also a thing in older literature, usually with sweets and biscuits like that.

Either that or Cave Johnson already took them and turned them into incendiary grenades and the magical world is now wary as shit over anything even mildly lemony. :)

** You talking about his lemon drops?

Hmmm, I think because they might be expired. Who knows how long they have been sitting there on his desk.

** Because Dumbledore drugs his candies with psychedelics so he can deal with the stress of all his titles and jobs.

** My grandparents always had a dish of ribbon candy out. I tried to take one once and they were all stuck together. Okay, so they lived on a lake and it was probably because of humidity, but as a kid all I could think was that it was because they were so old. So, if nobody takes the candies, they just get older, making people less likely to take them. Vicious circle.

But really, my headcanon is that he doses them, not with psychotropics like somebody else mentioned, but with something that lowers a person's mental defenses so he can pry information out of them more easily, and maybe something that makes them more susceptible to suggestion.

Or maybe it's because Snape is paranoid, Minerva doesn't like lemon*, and Harry has never been offered anything good except to have it snatched away from him (I can totally see the Dursleys doing this) so he won't play that game anymore.\\
*Lemon is not exactly everybody's favorite candy flavor.

** Because he only has like a couple and if people did start taking them he'd run out so people don't want to be rude and eat them all. :(
