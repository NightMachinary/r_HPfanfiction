So no OP! Harry, Hermione, Voldemort, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, or Luna (yes, yes there aren't that many with the latter two but I've read a few). So an OP!Dean Thomas or OP!Parvati or OP!Mundungus Fletcher or OP! any minor/secondary canon character will work.

Thanks in advance!

PS: No need to rec Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider or Hunting with Hagrid also since I've never actually read an OP!Ron work besides Red Knight, that's acceptable too.

  If Enjolras wanted to build his own pyre, let him. Grantaire didn't need to burn at his side for the sake of some doomed quest for equal rights. Paris, 1971. Grantaire is a werewolf, reluctantly persuaded into letting a recently-bitten journalist Enjolras interview him for a book he's writing about lycanthropy, and the prejudices and practical difficulties werewolves experience, from job discrimination to being hunted for black market potion ingredients.
