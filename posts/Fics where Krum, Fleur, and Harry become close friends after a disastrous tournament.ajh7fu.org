Whenever I read about the TriWizard Tournament I'm reminded about some show or movie or anime idk where there's a similar tournament and the competitors go from rivals to best friends. Perhaps they stay close friends and toast to Cedric every year.

Edit: I realized what I was thinking of. It's a anime but it wasn't a tournament. I was thinking about that science in naruto where orochimaru, tsunade, and jiraiya survive the battle against hanzo and he dubs them the legendary sannin. I'm looking for something like that but with the tri wizard tournament.


** Had an idea for a 1-shot the other day where Harry takes Teddy to the Quidditch World Cup. After the match Harry introduces Teddy to his old friend, the greatest seeker in the world. Viktor smiles and elbows Harry, "But I never out flew a dragon."

/"With help from friends, Harry realises that being "THE Harry Potter" in the Tri-wizard tournament can only be a good thing.  That, and learning to be a Blacksmith can't be anything other than cool."/

4th year fic. It's not really a 'disastrous' tournament, but it does build up a strong friendship between the Champions (and families).

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Linkffn(10870770) is part of a longer HP/Pokemon crossover but their Triwizard tourney is way cooler with their analogous tasks being more creative if you throw Pokemon into the mix. Fleur at least sticks around after the tourney.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
