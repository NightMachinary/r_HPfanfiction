I don't know if this fic exists or not, but you could kill Gregoryavitch the wand maker for rights to the Death Stick, because Grindelwald didn't kill him, he just stole the wand. Tom/ Voldemort did kill him though, so you'd need to get there before the sixth book.


** You don't need to kill to take the wand. That's shown quite clearly in canon. Grindelwald takes the wand by theft/defeat, Dumbledore takes it by defeating, but not killing, Grindelwald, Draco takes it by hitting Dumbledore with a non-lethal spell (full body-bind) and/or arranging for Snape's killing of Dumbledore, and Harry takes it by disarming Draco. So up until the 6th book you'd have to defeat Dumbledore in some fashion to claim it.

*** Yes but Dumbledore said that he could do great magic because he was a great wizard, not because the wand was great. That suggests that the wand wasn't helping him, which means he wasn't it's master. This is the wand that could win you a fight you entered naked, you'd think Dumbledore would know if it was helping him or not. However, Voldemort killed Gregoryvitch, though he only did so after dieing to Harry. It isn't the wands fault that Tom didn't stay dead. And so when Tom killed Gregoryvitch the wand skipped him and went straight to Harry, and it resisted Tom. Harry gained it and was its first master since Gregoryvitch. Though Gregoryvitch didn't die until some time between the fourth and sixth books, but the person he got it from was dead by then. We know that Harry had to become the wands master in the end, because he uses it to repair his old wand, something which shouldn't be possible otherwise. So Harry got it from somewhere, and if Dombledore wasn't it's master then that means Grindelwald wasn't either, which only leaves Gregoryvitch as a possible known holder of the wand.

Though I suppose it's technically possible that Harry got it some other way, that wasn't the point of the question. I'm looking for a story in which an inserted character from our world kills Gregoryvitch and gets the wand, steals the stone from The Gaunt Home and steals the Cloak from Harry. Not a story where Harry gets the hallows from blood, magic and conquest at Gringotts. Though I'd like to see a fic like that, too.

** May I introduce you....

Asshole OC!

--------------

I blink and stand up, not noticing the difference of the room I'm in, my vision blurry and only focusing on getting to the bathroom to throw up.

/Did I get hammered?/

Thinking back to the concert last night, probably. After opening the door, I shielded my eyes from the glittering surfaces of the bathroom interior decor.

/Where... Who... Did I fuck/ I ghastly thought.

Blindly going to where the blurry vision of toilets lined to the side, I threw up last night's burger and fries before flushing the vileness away and did number two before exiting the stall and heading to one of the sinks and washed my hand.

Sleepily looking up to freshen myself up by splashing my face with water, I gaped at the reflection the moment my vision focused.

I have a beard. Grey hair. Glasses. /Wrinkles/

I was Dumbledore.

After staring at the mirrors reflection, stupefied for at least ten minutes, I decided to turn off the water by turning the handle of the sink sideways and laughed.

... /I'm Dumbledore/

This is great. Fantastic.

I exit the bathroom and let my feet lead me back to the bedroom I was in and let out a sigh.

...This is. Hogwarts?

I pondered and noticed how... Medieval and magical the interior decorations the hall had. Definitely Hogwarts, what with the... Gryffindor colors this bedroom (Dumbledore's?) has...

I grinned. Wasn't there something about immortality in this fictional world and how Dumbledore already has two of them in his grasp in the beginning of the story?

I paused and searched for a wand in my robe, and pulled out a spectacular looking one.

Elder wand?

... Probably not.

Hmmm...

"Accio Elder Wand and Invisibility Cloak!" I uttered out loud and with the body's muscle memory, I waved the wand in an odd pattern.

The wand and cloak came out from a closet to my right and I received the two deathly artificats in my grasp and smiled.

If Dumbledore still has the cloak, it means Harry and his classmates aren't here yet and the events of his first year hasn't happened either...

Time to hire a curse breaker on the Gaunt's family house... Goblins keep quiet so long as you hand them gold right? I'm sure Dumbledore has a lot in his vault...

A cough broke me out of my thoughts.

"Dumbledore, you've been called by McGonagall..." A sulry old man told me (and doesn't it freak me out that I'm an old man myself right now, but I'm certain there are spells to deal with that).

I smiled and nodded. "Thank you, you may tell her I'll be on my way."

The painting raised an eyebrow at me but vanished from the empty frame and left me alone to my scheming thoughts. Probably not an uncommon activity Dumbledore himself have taken a part in if I were to be honest.

...actually, now that I feel my mind calm down from excitement, how the hell am I here in the first place ..? Ah, fuck it.

Immortality, Invisibility, interacting with the dead, and unlimited power would be pretty grand.

Plus, this is all just a fictional world anyways, the amount of shit I can get away with as Dumbledore is pretty fantastic. Heh.

** It exists on Questionable Questing. It's in the NSFW questing section, so you need a membership to see it. [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/wizarding-world-ascendant-potter-verse-cyoa.4517/][Here's the link]]. Just a warning, it is very horrifying and squicky.
