  She had fallen through the veil of death, unaware of the path she was doomed to walk. It all seemed like fun and games at the start - another chance. She'd never been so wrong. OOC. fem!Harry. Lovecraftian Horror. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash. Rated M for language, extreme violence, and mature topics.

** linkffn(Too Young To Die)

Harry Potter is not the BWL, but his brother and their parents didn't die to Voldy, but instead allowed their youngest daughter to die and don't seem to care about it. Harry does not like this and goes very, very dark.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

** linkffn(liquida tenebris) is a really messed up fic, I won't spoil it too much, but Voldemort is Voldemort and Harry just forgives him for all he's ever done because apparently Dumbledore manipulated him into killing his parents. Like, you can't ignore that he still killed them and loads of other people!

Yeah, I'm really pissed off about that.

  Something is 'wrong,' with Harry. He's hearing voices. or rather, a voice. Its telling him he's been on the wrong side since the beginning. Harry doesn't believe it. But for how long? Dark!Harry, eventual HP/LV slash. Don't like don't read. Complete with epilogue. Sequel up.

  FemHP/TMRJr. Those icy green eyes swept along the man's body with clear disgust, seemingly able to pierce the mans flesh with the cold knowing in them. "The difference between Tom and I, Headmaster, is that Tom doesn't know the difference between good and bad. Me? I simply don't care."
