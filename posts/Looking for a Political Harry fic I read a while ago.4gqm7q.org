Hey guys, I am looking for a fic I read a while ago where Harry decided to be a political player and he makes allies with Cornelius Fudge, etc through corruption ("donations") and power plays, which pits him against people like Lucius Malfoy, etc.

I would also like to read HP fics which have a House of Cards-type political set-up (not crossover).


** linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth) has some of that later on.

*** It does, and specifically some of the things you're looking for, OP.

But it's not worth it. Starts okay, but keeps on having jumps to higher and higher levels of shit. Don't touch it with a barge pole.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

***** Pretty much. Now unless things get better. I would do the spoiler thing, but if you read it you probably know what I mean idk what to do with this story. The one thing makes all of the work seem like a waste. Like after that point it might as well be a different fic

*** I don't think this was the one I read ... from what I recall, there was no trial and Harry and Fudge make their alliance earlier.

Thanks in any case.
