But in a literal sense. Obviously OOC.


** Actually, HPMoR did that one before you; while possessing Quirrell, Voldemort gives to Harry the same grade on his first Defence exam that Riddle had on /his/ first, just for irony's sake. (He doesn't expect to actually fulfill the Prophecy that way or anything, he just enjoys being diabolically chestmasterly to people for no reason because it makes him feel clever.)

*** Oh yeah! It's been a while since I read HPMoR. It has its problems, but it does so many things well.

I was looking more for a reply where his friends react to said grades though.

**** Very well. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). Be aware that it has its problems and is quite controversial, but also does some things very well. Also note that some of the of the science in it is wrong, though never in a way that breaks the story, and it's from an 11-year-old Harry's perspective so it's somewhat excusable. If you like it then there are a bunch of continuations and spin-offs too.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
