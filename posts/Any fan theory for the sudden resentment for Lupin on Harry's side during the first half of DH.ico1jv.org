It seems that whenever Lupin talks to Harry during the first half of DH, Harry is always annoyed or angry with him. It starts showing when Lupin tells him that the reason Voldemort identified him as the real Potter is because of using the Disarming Spell against Stan Shunpike but the tension between them increases until the point it explodes at the Grimauld Place.

What are your thoughts for why Harry had all of a sudden such resentment for Lupin?


** I don't think Harry did resent Lupin.

In the first incident you mentioned, Harry was frustrated by the situation. He didn't want to kill Stan Shunpike. He didn't want to be in a war at all. He never chose any of these things, people were dying around him, and here was this teacher he respected telling him to go further than he was ready to go. Harry's anger was situational, not personal.

In the second incident you mentioned, the anger was personal... because Lupin was on the verge of making a terrible decision. Leaving your pregnant wife isn't a good look even when your lifetime of fears and insecurities are telling you it's for the best. Harry kicked Lupin's ass because Lupin needed his ass kicked. Lupin realized that Harry was right and made Harry godfather, and things were fine between them. The explosion at Grimmauld Place was an isolated incident, not part of a pattern of Harry resenting Lupin in general.

*** I gave as examples the moment it begun and the moment it reached its peak. Harry is ashamed of how he treated Lupin when he meets him again at the Shell Cottage. But throughout the whole first half of DH, he is annoyed by him. He is annoyed by the fact that Lupin criticizes him from using the Disarming Spell instead of a Stunning Spell or a Killing Curse against Stan Shunpike. He is then annoyed by Lupin for feeling judged because he stated he trusted everyone in the Advanced Guard. He is also annoyed by Lupin because he doesn't take him seriously when he claims that he didn't do anything but it was his wand that defeated Voldemort during the Battle of the Seven Potters. Finally, he is completely ruthless against Lupin when he says that he wants to join the trio in their Horcrux hunt.

Edit: he doesn't feel that way towards anyone else in the Order. Not even Mrs. Weasley who is really annoying.

** Pick any one or multiple from:

- There is an ongoing war that only Harry can end and the stress is getting to him a bit.

- Harry might have wanted to bang Tonks and is jealous.

- Harry resents Lupin for never caring for him when he was younger

- Harry is sick and tired of being told what to do in the way oh so many teenagers are

- Lupin represents the adults of the Harry Potter world always claiming that they want to help Harry but never actually doing anything to help and often making things worse

- Harry always blames himself for everything. Lupin telling him something was his fault would feel redundant to Harry and therefore frustrating. He knows that somehow he as good as killed Hedwig with his actions and then Lupin comes and tells him how he killed Hedwig.

- Lupin can't help. Harry feels frustrated in his own inability to do anything and just vents at someone who he feels should be more help but is equally unable. Lupin taught Harry but he never taught him how to hunt horcruxes and that's what he needs right now.

- Harry's a fucking mess. Understandably so. It isn't just Lupin that he vents at, see his horcrux induced blow up with Ron. Lupin appears multiple times so he gets shouted at multiple times. The more shit that happens the more messed up Harry gets so the worse he takes it out on people.

*** While I agree with some of your points, I would still argue that Harry was never a mess, all things considered.

** First instance has Harry being bitched out because he didn't (in his mind) murder someone. He didn't appreciate that. And at Grimauld Place, Harry felt Remus was abandoning his wife and child. He was, but it's debatable if being home was more useful than the help he could have provided the trio.

*** I would doubt it that Lupin would have been of any use to the trio. He didn't know about the Horcruxes and Harry had no intention of telling him. He might have known a lot about the Dark Arts and he might have been a skilled duelist in his prime, but a lot of the trio's adventures in DH were successful because they outsmarted the enemy rather than dueling them to death.
