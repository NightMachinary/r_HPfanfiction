Because just a few minutes ago I had a thought on what if Voldemort's horcruxes were golems that could move, fire spells and otherwise actively defend themselves, or just run away.

...What would horcrux-robots even look like, anyway? What kind of theme would they even have?


** In my fic, linkffn(A World Unseen, Vol II) Horcruxes can be used as a dark magic battery, and if not powering something, it gets greedy for magic and can create a shade that can physically interact with the world. (The Locket absorbed the curses and boggart in the drawing room of Grimmauld Place.)
