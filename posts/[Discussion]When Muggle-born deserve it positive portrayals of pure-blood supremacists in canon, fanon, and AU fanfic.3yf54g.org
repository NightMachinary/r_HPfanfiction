I've been whinging a lot recently about illogical fanon excuses for pure-blood supremacists. Though I enjoy the /idea/ of there being something logical and substantial behind their fear and hatred of Muggle-born, it is so seldom you see a really well done explanation for why first-generation magicals deserve so much hate.

Usually when it comes up, one is asked to sympathise with such dreck as, "they refuse to integrate into the deep and interesting magical culture that I just wrote three binders full of notes about;" Or the oldie but goodie, "you can't explain magic with Muggle science or logic, and Muggle-born even trying to is bad for reasons."

--------------

I'd like to see what /good/ explanations other people have come up with, or what their favorite rational and logically explored "Muggle-born really /are/ bad" ideas are from fanfic. Maybe some links to those fanfics, as well.

--------------

So what's my best shot at "blood supremacists are right" fanon? I'll do three +real quick+. These are meant to be compatible with canon but not directly supported by it. For best results in your Slytherin-Harry fic, combine all three and join Voldemort in his ethnic cleansing campaign to free the world of their filth.

1. *Family matters in magic.* A great deal of post-Hogwarts magic is based on a sort of ancestor worship or bloodline tapping. This is the stuff that holds up things like the Trace and permanent protective magic around areas like Diagon Alley. There is power in blood. Wizards are literally unable to do certain large-scale things if they don't have a well-cultivated bloodline from which to draw power and support. No one talked to Harry or his friends about this as it is post-Hogwarts material first mentioned in seventh year, and is all tied up with blood politics in any case. It is very awkward to talk about this to people, like muggle-born, who will never be able to personally contribute to these great works--the kind that made Hogwarts, legendary artifacts like the Sorting Hat, and the ancient family estates (more fanon, but still...) Hermione's campsite protection charms and beaded bag artifact are about the limits for someone without a family tree full of magicals, but little snots like Malfoy think that means she shouldn't even be able to do magic at all. Because he's stupid. But he's not /wrong/. Her family will always be weaker than those more purely magical in heritage. People /assumed/ Voldemort was pure-blood because he made up for that lack in half his family tree with dark rituals (which is in canon what Dumbledore says--he gained power through dark magic). The Gaunts were mentally disabled, uneducated, and insane, not magically weak. Blood is, in fact, important, and Muggle-born who finally realize this are very resentful. Better to put them in their place now so they don't get ideas about stealing the magical works of their betters.
2. *Muggles are fucking scary.* Muggle-born's parents are a real and present danger. Wizards mind-wipe Muggles as part of the Statute of Secrecy, but not Muggle-born parents. They once did so in Magical Britain, making cover stories for Hogwarts attendance or just memory charming them, but modern Muggle-born won't stand for it and several sued the Ministry over the policy during in the early 1900s. After getting stonewalled and then threatening to take it to a higher, mundane British court (which they technically legally could), they won rights for Muggle-born's parents. In Magical Britain, more so than anywhere else in the world, the magical and mundane governments work together. The Queen knows about magic, as do certain members of the royal family. There is an accord such that every Prime Minister is informed of the secret magical branch of HM's government (it is the Ministry of Magic, after all, not a separate magical nation), but that doesn't mean Scotland Yard will be called if some Muggle-born's parents kidnap a wizard and try to torture the secrets of magic out of them. Which has happened. Multiple times. It is the magical world's lookout, the Statutes are getting harder and harder to keep, and some day soon some Muggle-born with a Muggle aunt dying of cancer (and not eligible for magical treatment) will go on live national TV and blow the whole thing. Yes, /some/ pure-blood wizards know that is a very real threat, if perhaps being a little vague on the details of how broadcast TV works. Some modern magical nation, somewhere, will fail to keep the Statues first, and pure-bloods of Magical Britain are afraid their country will be the test case for what the international magical community's response to that will be. They don't take Muggle-born from their families, like in Russia, or cloud their parent's minds with compulsion charms, like in France, and all in the name of Muggle parental rights. Instead of being cowed into line, Magical Britain is full of Muggle-born with very dangerous ideas indeed.
3. *Muggle-born are a genetic X-factor.* Magical traits, like affinity for Dark magic, or metamorph powers, are genetic. Magically genetic, which is a poorly studied field. Though being magical is either off or on, some other things come along with being able to use a wand. Muggle-born having magic at all is an unsolved problem for this field, but what is known is they often carry...undesirable new traits. The first werewolf, for example, was thought to be a Muggle-born with really twisted magic--"cursed" by their own magic to turn into a beast who could infect others with a similar affliction. Also, their magic doesn't always breed true. Muggle-born traits are wildcards. They can't be predicted, and sometimes they bring strange things even generations down the line. Best just to marry into pure-blood families, unless you want to put your relatives in danger. Muggle-born aren't just harmful to the magical community by posing new and dangerous ideas, they can curse even good wizarding families for generations with their fickle blood. If a Muggle-born returns to the mundane world and marries a Muggle, it is likely that the bloodline will simply peter out. But sometimes Muggle-born marry magicals and pass their odd traits on to their magical kids. This is one reason Harry, son of a Muggle-born, can go from hero to feared so fast: the wizarding world is afraid he literally does have some sort of weird inherited dark powers that will drive him, and possibly those around him, insane. Or he'll just explode with magic one day and kill everyone in a ten foot radius, like with Voldemort. You can't really tell until it happens. And some people don't want to wait for that sort of thing to happen around their children. Best to drive the Muggle-born back where they belong: the Muggle world from whence they came.

  *Gun Safety Program Sets off Community Dispute*

  Wasilla Alasksa: The dispute began last year when the Wasilla's school board passed a resolution allowing middle schoolers to carry loaded handguns on school property.

  The board initially restricted this practice to only those students who could demonstrate their understanding of firearm safety but has recently made handgun ownership mandatory for all incoming students.

  "This was a matter of practicality and safety" explained board member Cornelius Fudge, "Firearms are a tool, and one that is key to both our local economy and the safety of our towns residents. That is why the board has always supported Firearm Safety classes as a core part of our curriculum."

  These firearm safety programs have historically included 'Theory of Firearms', 'Marksmanship' and instruction of 'Defense Against Dangerous Creatures.'

  Fudge went on to explained that the board's decision came about after two students were badly injured by a polar bear attack. "We realized," explained Fudge, "that disarming students wasn't the way to keep them safe."

  Some parents, including local trapper John 'Fenrir' Greyback, disapproved of this move. "Our society limits underage firearm use for a reason. Yes, I've taught my son to shoot. But he knows that he can only use a gun when I, or another responsible adult, am there to supervise. I trust him, but for god's sake, he's only a kid."

  Asked to respond to these remarks, Local Principal Albus Dumbledore explained that the school keeps careful watch over students. The Principal pointed out that the middle school had four instructors who, except for their other duties, are entirely focused on supervising students.

  The controversy expanded when Principal Dumbledore announced that, as of the beginning of the year, all students would be required to carry a loaded revolver as part of their school supplies.

  "We realized," said Garrick Olivander, local gunsmith, "that many students came from households where neither of their parents owned a gun. In fact, many of these parents didn't even know how to find my shop."

  Several parents, mostly long-time Wasilla residents, have protested the policy of arming children from non-gun-owning households.

  Leading the opposition was local guide Barty Crouch, "I trust my kid," said Crouch, "I've been teaching him about gun-safety and woodcraft since before he could walk. He's responsible, even if he is 11. But it's different when you're talking about kids who've never seen firearms outside of a movie."

  Crouch said that he'd told his son to stay away from students from non-gun-owning households, at least until they'd had a chance to receive basic firearm safety.

  These remarks were echoed by local parent Narcissa Black, who added, "These policies are terrifying. I've seen these kids from newcomer households. They're waving their pistol around like it's a toy. Some of them are even using their guns for games!"

  Dumbledore pushed back against these remarks, saying that games like "Exploding Snap" or "Cowboy's Checkers" were an accepted part of the NRA's curriculum and built students accuracy and comfort with firearms.

  The principal's strongest words were reserved for parents advocating different treatment for children who'd grown up without knowledge of firearms.

  "You can hear this unreasoned tribalism in the way these parents talk." said Dumbledore, "They draw lines between 'locals' and 'newcomers', as if a child's bloodline determined their ability to eventually become an expert marksman or skilled trapper. Worse, they even try to push this horrible notion onto the next generation."

  "There is no reason, literally no reason at all, to think that a perfectly responsible middle-schooler shouldn't be given free and unsupervised use of an instrument of destruction, merely because they've never had an adult role model teach them how to use it safely." concluded the principal.

** As for the “blood supremacists are right” thing, I really like how Racke explained it in the second of the three one-shots in 41st chapter of his assorted Harry Potter stuff collection (linkffn(8527691)), the one titled “The Founders”.

It does not present them as right, per se, but it does give us a realistic case of how it could have started: the discrimination, Salazar's disagreement, the reason for the existence of the Chamber of Secrets. I'll let this quote, a mere fragment, show what I mean:

#+begin_quote
  "The witch-burnings that are nowadays laughed at for the ineptness of the muggles performing them, take on a very different tone when you realize that it wouldn't be muggles dragging the 'witches' to the pole. [...] To teach muggleborns, is to invite spies. Both from children who wouldn't know to keep certain things quiet from dangerous ears, but also from desperate children wanting to be loved, even if it means to betray their own peers and sentence them to death."
#+end_quote

And from there, as time passed and the wizards did not interact with the muggles all that often, it has gotten twisted into something ugly. Because after some time, isolated from that which they hid themselves from, they forgot the reason why they hid in the first place. Fear became arrogance. Caution became delusions of superiority. A justified but hard potential choice became propaganda of blood purity. There is no “right” to be found there, only “left”, a leftover of what once was, a history with truly no history to learn from, and in the end made into one big mistake. The blood purists feel safe in their arrogance, feel better with their delusions of superiority, because they do not remember how it was to have been afraid, to have been forced to be cautious. How could they have remembered, after all, if the rare dealings with single muggles can as far as they know easily be taken care of with a memory charm and if none of them even remember anyone who truly interacted with muggles.

So they aren't right, as far as I see it. They were justified. And then they were lost, like children wandering in the fog. And that is it.

** Magic is a scary and familiar thing. It's able to conjure whimsy and deal death with a mere whisper.

Wizards saw first hand what non magicals were able to do without this terrifying comfort.

Non magicals have wiped out entire species with little thought and wiped out more with thought.

There's a certain pause that anyone would take as an outsider looking in.

And while wizards should advance a little more technologically seeing what non magicals are capable of can make them pause.

Genetically wizards are superior at the base level because they can seemingly make things appear from nothing.

But just like the mutants in comic books they are not superior in numbers.

So if they take caution it's understandable. They've witnessed their kin be demolished and eradicated in the blink of an eye.

They've witnessed their culture forced to concentrate and hide.

**** There's no reason for hate. Not if it had started out as hate.

But it didn't. It started out as fear. Because muggleborns were a link, and when something links you to those who might hurt you if they so desired, it is bad. And when you no longer remember why you feared something, why you felt disgust at that which was happening, what is left is bitterness. Bitterness that turns into hate.

That that happens is “rational”. Because this is a process we had seen many times with humans. You fear something, so it is bad. Then you no longer remember why you fear it, and it remains bad. Then you no longer do fear it, and it still remains bad. And then your mind makes up an excuse for why it is bad.

Admittedly it is not “rational” if by that you meant that it would have only come from logic. Because it comes from emotions and from how human brains work. But it isn't a piece of nonsense the way some people think. Just something with a lot of lost history behind it.

***** I am afraid that you've rather misunderstanding what rational means in this context. Allow me to explain:

Rationality: a way of looking at the world that is based on testing things to achieve accurate beliefs about reality. Involves figuring out the inherent biases of the human mind so that they can be worked around or ameliorated. Often utilitarian.

Rational hatred/discrimination: reality being such that after dispassionately collating all the facts and looking at all the options, a person decides that hatred or discrimination is best for everyone. For example, if there were a fantastically beautiful and appealing race similar to ours with the exception that children of mixed race relations exploded like megaton bombs at random it would be rational to try and avoid letting the two races intermingle, because teenagers will be teenagers and that will kill lots of people.

I might sound mean, but I already replied to that when another person commented on it and I personally don't reply to comment without reading other comments leading from the one I am reply it to because I know being asked the same question over and over when the answer is visible for everyone is not comfortable.

That being said, what I meant by the word when I used it, and the quotation marks are being used to mark usage different from any accepted one, was that people in-story perceive their reasons as rational and accept them as such even if it truly isn't rational for us; since the post itself deals with searching for a rational explanation in-story, I'd thought that this could count too, even if it shouldn't if people in-story actually tried to look at it more deeply.

You want to lead from one point to another, what you wrote was a bit... disjointed. If you're countering a particular point someone else made, you should include it in quotes or try to point back to it somehow.

Try to refer to things directly. For example, in

#+begin_quote
  Sometimes the fact that a certain phenomenon occurs is taken as
#+end_quote

you say "[...] a certain phenomenon". You want to refer to whatever that phenomenon is. People can only hold so many indirect reference's, words like "it, they, object in question, the point, etc" in their head at once.

When you can, try to tie your points into reality directly. Give examples if you can, or ways to "test" if your point it true.

Honestly, I think you're the first person I've seen use that word in that manner. I don't believe I've ever seen "rational" as "it's happened before."

I mean, people do irrational things all the time. Multiple times. Does the "irrational" suddenly become "rational" through sheer repetition.

No, I'd call that "understandable" or "predictable." Prejudice towards certain minorities is depressingly predicable, and even understandable given certain conditions, but not "rational" simply because similar processes have occurred in the past.

It is hard to read and pretentious. So yes, you apparently are. I can't argue with what you said, because it had nothing to do with what /I said/. You never restated one of my points or quoted a line you thought deserved expanding on. You hardly made a single clear declarative statement at all.

Your response suggests you are aware of this, and just don't care. I'll still explain why I said that, though you seem to be cattily licking your wounds rather than attempting to engage in the original topic--hardly useful.

My issue was the series of chopped up, incomplete thoughts in sentence form not resulting in complete sentences and thoughts.

One can sometimes assume "it is" as a subject, but that should be used sparingly. And "because" should only be used with a main clause, as it will form a subordinate clause *always*. Use of conjunctions at the start of sentences is annoying, especially when it doesn't serve to enhance understanding of the subject of the sentence, and /especially/ when those sentences are so damn short--though isn't technically incorrect sentence construction in modern usage.

Also, all that had little to do with the subject--which again, you still aren't talking about. If you just like to read your own written words, fine. Do so. But I was expecting more than a Sociology 101 textbook formatted as beat poetry intercut with missing dialog from The Matrix.

People in-story do perceive it as rational and make up the reasons for why it would be rational because they no longer remember why exactly they had something against the muggleborns and it's much easier to ascribe inferiority to them rather than potential danger, especially since the muggleborns that people would care about---the ones at Hogwarts---are still children and it is therefore hard to see them as dangerous. Much of the anti-muggle and anti-muggleborn sentiment we see also comes from the most extreme elements rather than the regular populace, so it is not the level of hatred that most people actually feel.

** Muggles are even scarier when the wizard contemplating their danger is of decent intelligence and merely lacking knowledge of their capabilities. In 400 years, muggles went from dumb assholes with knifes and the ocassional musket into a state of mystery thanks to ever advancing technology. While most wizards will probably have a basic understand that blackpowder makes stuff go boom, many of the newer stuff will be out of their understanding. Imagine living a hundred+ years and suddenly your mansion gets blown to the skies by some horrifying metal machination dropping weapons of unparalleled destruction. Muggles must seem like an ever advancing monster of destruction to the average pureblood and the worst: they are multiplying at an alarming rate. WW1 fucked them with mortar fire, WW2 with bombers, just imagine the horrors that are awaiting you in the near future if you let those cunts continue. Heck I would want to strictly control their movement and advancement if I could. Thx to random occurrences of the magical gene in the population, more and more wizards are born that are not immediately assimilated into your society. Could you imagine if the ever imaginative muggle monster would succeed in understanding or absorbing these universe shattering powers? Imagine hearing rumors of the weapon that ended WW2, imagine a weapon that can level an entire city. Imagine discussing this weapon with your friends and family and then imagine finally asking a muggle about it years later. He looks at you and says, "oh yeah, almost every country worth mentioning has hundreds of them." I would shit my fucking pants that those violent things could kill me and everyone I have ever known whenever they feel like fighting each other again.

At least that's the reasoning I will be using to justify muggle hatred in my FF.

*** I've never understood the irrational fear authors in fanon give wizards about muggle weaponry. I often read things like "guns shoot one bullet and take minutes to reload" or "we can stop the bullet but not the kinetic energy" or "their bombs would destroy us". It's like authors are attempting to incorporate magic into a logically and physically bound world when this isn't the case at all. Magic has its own rules and a prepared wizard would trump muggles nearly every time. I can concede that a muggle firing supersonic bullets from a sniper rifle might take out a wizard who wasn't expecting it but otherwise the wizard will win every time.

I've never understood /this/ argument. There's no canon backing for it. When it comes to combat we have no idea how well a shield charm can hold up against a bullet, let alone explosions. Generally when I see this argument it boils down to "It's [[http://i.imgur.com/YsbKHg1.gif][/magic/]], so /of course/ it will trump technology, because it's [[http://i.imgur.com/YsbKHg1.gif][/magic/]]." and that's not a valid argument.

In fact, a wizard who tries to take on a muggle with a gun directly is likely fucked, even if a shield charm can easily stop bullets. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you can maintain a shield while casting other spells. If you could, people would have been idiots not to have done it all the time during battles in the books. So you have to drop your shield to cast and then you're dead, because spells are /slow/. Like really, really slow compared to a gun. You have to make these wand movements and say these words, and then at least some spells have a travel time perceivable by the naked eye. In contrast, the muggle pulls the trigger the second the shield drops and you have a dead wizard.

Where magic /actually/ trumps technology is subterfuge. They can hide, manipulate, etc. very effectively. They could wage a reasonably effective guerilla war, though it may still be a losing one given how badly they're outnumbered. Really, the only truly effective way they could fight a real war against muggles would be to use tactics we (and most of the magical people we know of that aren't Death Eaters) would consider completely abhorrent.. like Imperiusing random muggles and using them as suicide bombers so they never have to expose themselves to carry out an attack.

On the other hand, muggles wouldn't be able to wage an effective offense against magical people either. You can't bomb people you can't find, or who are integrated with your own population.

A conflict between muggles and magicals would be a horrible mess. Consider the level of paranoia created by terrorism in the real world and then consider a world where you, your neighbor or your ninety year-old grandma could be suddenly mind-controlled into being a suicide bomber. The Statute of Secrecy is probably for the best if there's even a chance of conflict.

1. Magic breaks the laws of physics in ways that are completely irreconcilable with what we know about the universe.

2. Magic doesn't even behave in ways analogous to physical forces, taking into account subjective human concepts as if they were intrinsic parts of the universe and permitting perpetual energy. A beetle is easier to transfigure into a button than other objects because, apparently, the words "beetle" and "button" sound similar. To be honest I think it's somewhat absurd to try to unify a magic system that behaves in this way with any kind of scientific understanding of the universe.

3. JKR has stated that magic has the general power to overrule "mundane nature", which all but declares magical nature and mundane nature to be separate.

There are various "light effects" that accompany physical spells but we have no idea how quick they are. Often a spell is interchangeably described as a "jet" and a "flash", implying that spells move too fast for you to follow their travel with your eye - all you get is a flash of light, like a muzzle-flash, with maybe the jet becoming visible over longer distances.

Furthermore, there's nothing in the books that implies that these light shows happen /after/ the incantation. In fact most of the evidence (HBP duel with Snape) seems to point towards the various lighting effects and spell travel happening /during/ the incantation, and when you finish saying the incantation, that's when the spell is complete i.e. when the spell hits the target.

Incidentally, there isn't a single example in the books of a wizard dodging a spell that was already "in flight".

***** The difference between fan fiction and canon is that we can allow ourselves the oppourtunity to think of a world larger than the one created by Rowling. With JKR, this world would not exist, but think of it this way: it takes you a single thought to shoot off a spell. A muggle will actually have to shoot off a gun by aiming and then pressing the trigger. By then the wizard could have apparated and shot a stunner, if they wanted to be nice. Or they could simply transfigure the muggle's weapons into flowers.

Muggle with a shot gun > than wizard. But in a war you won't have civilians fighting. You'll have specially trained soldiers vs wizards trained to fight. Also muggle troops will have to worry about the imperious curse. Any information they have can be gained through truth potions + cruciatus.

This next bit is a quote from the fic "In Light of Silver Memories":

There was a subtle quality that he added to his voice, and both the Prime Minister and the Director-General found their eyes drawn to him. Harry stared hard at both of them, and allowed the full weight of his seriousness press on them. "And now, Prime Minister, Director-General, allow me to address something you have till this moment been ignorant of: you have absolutely no idea how powerful magic can be. Of course, your experience with magic has been severely limited: you have only met wizards such as our former and present Ministers, both fools, and Auror Shacklebolt, who while powerful in his own right is nowhere near the upper echelons of the wizarding world in terms of magical power---it is time to correct your view of magic and the so-called strength of your science."

Harry twirled his wand, drawing their attention to it. "With this wand, this single wand alone, I can destroy Muggle London---and nothing you can do could stop me. Would you fire your guns at me? I could create a ward that would turn every bullet into a lovely flower. Would you direct your missiles in my direction? I would've been warned long before because of my proximity wards and Disapparated instantaneously to a location hundreds of meters from where I had previously been. Would you attempt to overwhelm me with numbers alone? With two words I could kill a man---now allow me to ask, how long do you think it'll take to whisper two words over and over again to destroy a battalion of hundreds of soldiers? Not too long, sirs, not too long. All the while I would have a magical shields that would protect me from any lucky shot, dragonhide clothing to protect me from those that manage to get through the cloak---and a single wave of my wand to heal anything truly powerful enough to damage my person.

"Would you hide within your mighty structures of concrete and metal? I could Apparate through walls, I could conjure a fire so fierce it would burn water, let alone melt metal; I could send a storm so powerful it would blow your walls down, or I could transfigure cement into sand and metal into straw. I could drop the earth beneath your feet, call lightning out from the sky, summon the ocean in the middle of your city, or put your nation to sweet sleep. Would you believe your hiding would save you? I have spells that could search whomever I wanted, wherever they may be. You will have no where to hide, to shelter, to cower from my might and power." Harry leaned back into his seat and stopped twirling his wand. "I may not be able to destroy Muggle London in a single day, or even perhaps a week, but if I direct my wand and my magic to her destruction, in the end, she will fall."

There was a stunned moment of silence. He sighed slowly, and asked gently, "A single wand, gentlemen; what can you possibly do against a single wand?"

The Director-General suddenly met Harry's gaze with a fierce blaze burning in his eyes, and he answered slowly but with authority. "I would snap that single wand."

Harry looked at him sadly. "Oh, Director-General, but I have another, and another, and another after that." He sighed again. "This, gentlemen, is what Lord Voldemort is more than capable of. And he has not just one wand, but many under his command. You say your people are dying? That you would do anything to protect them? To defend them against this unknown power? Sirs, the unfortunate truth is that you cannot. You cannot. At least, not on your own. In fact, you must be thankful that what I have just detailed for you has not yet taken place.

***** Eh, I say let the quote be. Instead, you could concentrate on the fact that nobody, ever, could be prepared all the time. Maybe when you are prepared you can be invincible because magic. But what about when you are not prepared? When you are sleeping?

And one could argue that of course you could sleep in a place where no muggle could reach you. Except muggles, the ones that are parents of muggleborns, have their own children with their own magic, children often enough desperate to give their parents a reason to love them, to lead them to you anyway.

So really, it doesn't matter who would win if wizards were prepared. Because you can't live with your guard up the whole time; somewhen your guard is going to slip and then anyone and anything able to hurt you when you are /not/ prepared will be terrifying.

The only supposed limit is resurrection of the "completely" dead and even that is not empirically proven. An AK kills a person but leaves the body intact. There are spells to animate corpses. The resurrection stone summons spirits of the dead. Who is to say that there isn't a means to combine these magics to bring someone back to life?

Most wizards are less competent then everyone we see fight in the books, who all either have training, experience, or plot armor. The average wizard uses magic for household chores, travel, and work. Not combat.

For muggles to win they would need to discover magic without revealing they knew, and coordinating several bombardments to wipe out out every major magic outpost simultaneously with no warning. Even then, a single determined wizard seeking revenge could cause some serious problems.

** One thing that I find is a lot of people talk of Muggle vs Pureblood and relate it to race. The pureblood supremacists are the KKK and the Muggleborns the hated minority group.

But you can think of it another way. The Wizards with their traditions in the wizarding world are the Tribesmen living in the wild and the Muggles are the British Empire. Coming into the land of the Wizards decrying that their ways are inferior and stupid and then attempting to change thousands of years worth of tradition that they do not fully understand. Yes, wizarding culture is stagnant, because it doesn't need to move past where it is now. They don't need cars, telephones, tvs, planes or any of that. Magic can replicate, or do better and due to the nature of magic they don't need the distraction of television.

Slytherin hated muggles and muggleborns because during his time muggles where attempting to murder magic users. To me that's a fairly decent reason. Current witches and wizards hate muggles because of a now deep seated idea that the muggles either want to kill them again or that those that don't wish to kill them wish to exploit them. They hate Muggleborns because many walk into the world of magic, shit all over traditions that are ancient and try to convince others that the muggle way is better, the muggle way is better, if you lack magic. Ie, some muggleborns portray classic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior_narrative_in_film][White Savior]] tendencies.

That's not to say that the Wizarding World is without it's problems. They are rather discriminatory towards other races, however I feel that in many of these ways it is not without cause. The Goblins and Wizards have waged on and off wars for centuries if not millenium, some distrust is only natural and it is rather clear that Goblins are just as dissmissive towards humans as vice versa.

That's really all I have to say, I disagree with many of the methods of the Pureblood supremacists, but they do have some legitimate gripe with Muggleborns in particular.

** The system I tend to gravitate towards is, I think, a combination of all 3... in a 'sort of, kind of' manner:

Rather than it being some manner of ancestor worship, muggle-born magic is different in the sense that it's more generalized. Think Specialist Wizard in DnD compared to a Mage.

In a DnD party of adventurers you might what the generalist because finding out your prohibited school would be super useful right now is a major inconvenience.

But in a society of wizards? If the Yaxleys are known for having a family knack for 'charms that relate to fire' then if you don't cast them yourself, you're probably going to want to hire a Yaxley to install your home's fire suppression charms.

Providing a rational basis for the purebloods reaction to muggleborn is easy enough if you assume that not only do they lack a specialty, but that any kids you have with one might not get your family's specialty. Especially if you couple that detail with a tendency, back in the day, to be a security liability during witch burnings.

Obviously the way magic works is probably far less rigidly defined than straight genetics would usually indicate, but you could even establish a a basis for the definition of pureblood being no muggle grandparents if that's how long it takes a wizarding line to settle down and stop bucking family traits. It might be that Muggleborn merely introduce some randomness to the outcome and that introducing some new blood to your family line can kick out an old trait that was lost (Like Nymphadora being a Metamorph. That might be Ted shaking out a trait that used to be a common thing for blacks.)

The idea above originally came from a Peggy Sue / Dimension Travel fic I read once but I can't recall anything else about it (like the name) at the moment.

** I much prefer the ideas you call "dreck" to any of your "good" explanations.

Incidentally, numbers 2 and 3 are not canon compatible. The Ministry of Magic has no institutional or legal connection to the Muggle government. And we know Muggleborns descend from Squib lines, they're not spontaneous.

Number 1 is I suppose compatible with canon in a very minimal sense of canon. Everything we're shown indicates Muggleborns are the magical peers of Purebloods and everything that magically authoritative characters say affirms this. So it's an idea of canon-compatibility where something is still compatible even when it contradicts those things the characters tell us about magic and which we see borne out in magical interactions.

******** I don't want to be taken as arrogant (sorry, we ended butting heads in a different comment line, and that ended up being kind of sad to be honest, and I really don't want a repeat because I think it is possible for us to interact civilly if we try not to aggravate each other), but I think that this is actually the point. And by “this” I mean the fact that the blood purity propaganda is not rooted in anything rational and is instead just something that had formed over time as people kept on forgetting about specifics from their past (namely the exact reason for their separation from the muggles, and anything pertaining to the time before the Stature of Secrecy).

I mean, in an AU story it's fine to set up a situation in which the blood purists are right, the idea itself is sound and honestly I'd like to read a well-written story exploring that. But in canon, there's really no support for blood actually meaning anything (the one known metamorphmagus is a child of a witch and a muggleborn; the so-called “brightest witch of her generation” is a muggleborn; the one to neutralise Tom Riddle for so many years was either a half-blood or a muggleborn, depending on whether you think it's Snape's or Lily's part that mattered more; and so on, and so on) and the blood purists are clearly meant to be taken as extremists. And to extremists who forgot why blood ever mattered and now just take pure blood for superior, to the extremists who think that being a squib is no better than being a muggle, I don't think it actually matters any that the muggleborns are really from squib lines.

Well, that it's from me. And I'll add that I did not mean be arrogant or demeaning here, and I hope to get a reply if you are willing to talk about it. And I apologise if that very mention (about me not meaning to be arrogant or demeaning) is something you find insulting; I just really think that our conflict earlier was really bad and I hope we can talk without going to another war, and since the previous time we both seemed to presume the worst of each other I am hoping that this mention will prevent that.

I think it means something that the most unusually perceptive and intelligent girl who isn't Hermione is Luna, another pure-blood. The bravest and most classically heroic characters? Ron, Cedric, and Neville, all pure-bloods.

It really looks ugly when no other Muggle-born or even half-bloods seem to do well in the story.

That someone has to be from a lost wizard lines means /blood does matter/. There is a line to carry on, a single point spreading out through history.

#+end_quote

Ah, that is true, and I have to admit I failed to consider this particular angle of the problem in my previous comment. I could say that “in my defense ...” and follow with a note about how I was looking at the propaganda of blood purity as applied to muggleborn with the default assumption that the muggleborn are inferior, but in the end that would only be making excuses since I was the one who didn't note that.

Though I don't think it's necessarily bad storytelling, per se. If anything, I think the fact that this wasn't actually explored properly (and many people, probably including you, will agree that the recurring problem with the last books are that they were too narrow in scope of the world presented while trying to show some sort of big conflict; things weren't explored properly, in other words), is what can make it bad storytelling. I mean, the idea itself that blood matters even if people are not aware of it and that spontaneous occurences of people with some sort of special power (being a wizard or a witch, in this case) is a result of people not tracking their blood properly, rather than it truly being spontaneous, is nothing new and I've seen it presented fairly well a few times.

And to be honest, it would actually be ironic, and I think in a fairly delightful way, if Hermione really was descended from some really important wizard from times long gone; it most likely isn't the case, but the possibility is something I find amusing. I do agree about the fact that it all being genetics takes away much of the magic; however, I will note that we only care because we are adult people trying to get into it in-depth, and children usually don't try to analyse it that deeply so for them the magic still holds, sort of like with Santa Claus or any equivalent.

#+begin_quote
  I think it means something that the only Metamorph is the daughter of one of the oldest bloodlines around.
#+end_quote

Yes, but on the other hand her blood would be considered tainted by some because of her father being a muggleborn wizard, so I think she's meant to be an example for both sides. But I do agree that the trait of metamorphmagic passed down in the Black family does mean something for this, yes.

The entirety of metamorphmagic is woefully underexplored in canon, though, I have to say; the ability is supposed to have very wide boundaries, and yet in the books it amounts to a bag of tricks with no real use.

#+end_quote

I think this is mostly because, “cool factor” aside, changing into an animal probably isn't all that people think it is. It did help Sirius escape from Azkaban, yes, but we still see him being pretty much a broken shell of a person (constantly mistaking Harry for James because something isn't quite right with him, for example). And if we ignore Minerva whose reasons we don't know and Rita whose reason is probably her want of a good (and scandalous) story, the only people we see changing into animals are people who actually have a good reason for even trying, a reason that has nothing to do with blood (Remus's lycantrophy, namely, and the fact that werewolves don't attack animals).

Also, I have my own headcanon, which probably has no grounding in anything in the series but as far as I know isn't contradicted by anything, that being an animagus isn't about changing into an animal but about being able to retain one's self fully in this form and being able to change back on their own and then finally being able to change without a wand; we did see people get changed into animals (Draco and Victor, one by someone else and the other partially on his own), so I think it stands to reason that if one wanted they could transfigure themselves into animals, they just would have problems changing back on their own unless they trained for that which would make them animagi. On that note, I use an extension of this to explain why it was only in Prisoner of Azkaban that the map actually picked out Peter Pettigrew: he could have simply allowed the rat to take over rather than being a rat himself, which would make the map pick up a rat rather than a person, but after Sirius's escape he was simply too self-conscious to be able to do that anymore.

But yes, it is possible for anyone trying to write a story to ascribe one's ability to become an animagus to the purity of their blood. I don't think I've seen it happen yet but it might make for an interesting plot point.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Good point with the heroic characters, though that might or might not be because of their upbringing (or the fact that they simply happen to be important enough characters by Madame Rowling's random choice) rather than because of their blood; still, the fact that Harry and Hermione aside we don't really have any prominent non-pureblooded characters among the children is fairly telling.

With Luna however ... well, I do want to agree here, especially since I do like her portrayal as someone perceptive and intelligent (for as long as it's not overdone), but I think that canonically she might actually be meant to be a character used to show that being wrong is fine. And I think this kind of muddles the whole point that Luna might be used to make, because we can never be sure if anything she says is being perceptive or intelligent or if it instead is her making things up and just happening to be right.

#+begin_quote
  It really looks ugly when no other Muggle-born or even half-bloods seem to do well in the story.
#+end_quote

That is true, yes, and very telling. Because even with how rare muggleborn would be with the decision that Mademe Rowling made, even if there aren't all that many half-bloods in the series, we only see two muggleborns (Hermione, and posthumously Lily) who amount to anything plot-wise, and four half-bloods; of note is the fact, however, that all of those half-bloods are fairly important characters: Albus, Harry, Tom, Severus. I think many people forget about blood status of three out of four of these characters, really, but I guess it's understandable since Harry is the only one that isn't “just sort of somewhere there”. Still, there were half-blooded and muggleborn characters just waiting to be used in the seventh book at the very least, so I think the question should be “why didn't Madame Rowling actually use them for anything worthwhile?”

#+begin_quote
  That someone has to be from a lost wizard lines means blood does matter. There is a line to carry on, a single point spreading out through history.

#+end_quote

A scary though, isn't it? I wonder if Madame Rowling actually noticed that at any point. It still does not justify their approach towards muggleborn, mind you (especially in case of Dolores Umbridge, who is just one big ball of emotional issues), but it does put some things in a different light.

And it goes even further: If muggleborns are not actually a thing and are simply old blood reawakening, are wizards even truly human? Or are they simply something looking like humans and able to reproduce with humans but that's it? And could it all have been avoided if only the wizards of the past had simply killed off all of their squib children rather than allowing them to live?

#+begin_quote
  I just happen to think they're not exploring the logical conclusions of JKR's casual breaking of her own world.
#+end_quote

Hmm ... yes? No? Sort of?

When I called their behaviour not right, I was referring to the dismissal of muggleborns on the basis of blood purity. Because no matter which version we choose, in the original material this dismissal has no leg to stand on and is just nonsense; and based on Madame Rowling's words about why the Stature of Secrecy happened, I think the reason for this dismissal is fear that is long-forgotten and is now only being remembered as “muggleborns are bad”. And since I was mostly writing about that particular but, I might have come across as fairly close-minded in that regard, yes.

But if we get to the part that is not about the muggleborn, yes, I'm with you there. Because if we throw the bits about muggleborns from the propaganda of blood purists, all that they preach about how blood matters is actually right, even if the way they deliver it isn't (since they're kind of jerks, in many cases). And I am aware that the world of the story is really broken and can be moulded into many other things; I just like the challenge of putting the broken thing that is canon together without throwing away any of the pieces simply because I don't like how they look, which basically leaves me AU for exploring most of what Madame Rowling did to her world. Though, of course, what one calls AU varies from person to person, so I guess I should be asking myself if it truly matters whether it's AU or not.

I'll end here, since the character limit is hitting me with a stick.

Neither of these are irreparable, I think:

- Item 2 could have happened not due to appeals to the Muggle legal system but as an idealistic reform pushed by Dumbledore and Nobby Leach.
- Item 3 can be fixed by postulating that Muggle genes can interact with magic in unpredictable ways: there is no way of knowing how a particular Muggle's genes will manifest when crossed with a Wizard's, and doubly so for Muggleborns. Now, Wizard genes can interact in weird ways too, but since they come from Wizards, how they are likely to manifest is a known quantity. We do, IIRC, have JKR's word that Vernon Dursley's would have suppressed any magical potential, so that's not inconsistent with canon.

There's all sorts of reasons why purebred wizards might be better at magic.

** I'm not sure why you think its hard to justify, the muggleborns are newcomers coming into the wizarding world with ideals and values that don't necessarily mesh with those of the WW. Culture clash is very much a thing even in the modern world ie Refugees.

Super patriotic American raised during the Cold War might like very much to hurt those evil Reds.

Someone from the American Civil war might want to enslave humans or even their fellow wizards.

A Traditional Muslim might try and force their views on women onto the Wizarding world, or use magic on other muggles to force their compliance.

Okay. What are those? What would cause this sort of conflict? What sorts of jobs or reforms would lead to this level of hate?

I'm not really interested in answers that just boil down again to "they're racist shits." That's already canon.

**** I already listed several examples of the friction between the two. Muggle patriatism/loyalty to their muggle country, religious observations especially those of an extreme variation. All temptations for the new wizard to 'break' the SOS for a greater purpose.

It only takes one bad egg lying about the return of a Dark Lord...

***** I don't see* Magical Britain's Wizards not thinking themselves British. They aren't a separate country. It's more like a religious enclave.

Though now that I think, while I've seen some really cringe-worthy "Hermione is a devout Catholic" or "Wizards are really quite religious behind the scenes" fics, I don't think I've ever read a Muggle religions vs. atheist/Old Ways Wizarding world as a central conflict. Sometimes as a sidenote, or a "they'd burn us for heretics" angle. But not as just pure religious strife and discord. Hmm.

****** I'm not sure why they would identify with the British Muggles idea of The United Kingdom, over three hundred years have passed since the separations of the two. Nor did they part on good terms, increasing violence and persecution marking the decision to create the SoS.

*** I think I agree.

Number 3 works for me as an idea /they/ would hold, because it has a steampunky, Victorian pop-culture understanding of how science and genetics works, which I think plays into pure-blood supremacists thematically.

Huh. Why aren't there more Steampunk + Harry Potter stories? I'll write one.

** To explain Magic Britain, we need to have a reason why it exists in the first place.

If Wizard life is really as safe and easy as the books make it seem (+/- the danger from other wizards) then prejudice is irrational.

But so is having an oppressive day job, or continuing to live in an English war-zone when you could easily teleport to anywhere else.

Muggle Britain hangs together because people need each other for food and shelter. Muggles can't just pack-up and leave a country because they'd lose their fixed assets and jobs.

Those things don't apply when you can teleport, magically multiply food, and live in a cheap, condo-sized tent.

Instead, it seems like British Wizards come together for mutual protection. This implies that there's some sort of major danger that can't be solved by just teleporting to Fiji.

One option is that *Magic Is Really Dangerous*.

Maybe Dementors come from some sort of relatively-easy magical mistake. Maybe there are magical accidents that summon unquenchable fire.

If so, Wizards need their society to keep tabs on one another and prevent humanity from falling to the unkillable, soul-eating demons or endless fire.

In that case, you can justify prejudice by pointing out that magical ignorance (born of too much focus on muggle matters) is legitimately dangerous and anti-social.

Another option is that *Magical Creatures are Really Dangerous*.

Make magical-diplomacy hard. Or, at a minimum, harder than, "all problems are due to wizards being jerks."

Perhaps England -- every square foot of it -- was made by an ancient goblin spell. The wizards thought they purchased it in 1066. The Goblins thought they were giving Merlin a short-term loan.

Now the Goblins want their property back. And they see every English resident, wizard and muggle alike, as a thieving trespasser. Did I mention that Goblins are ok with debt-slavery?

If the British Wizards leave, their country will fall to a bunch of magically-armored goblins. Or to trolls, who gain intelligence as they gather in groups. Or to centaurs who are peaceful now, but tend to fall in behind a sufficiently powerful leader.

This puts Britain into a continuous, slow-burning war. Everyone has a cousin, or a brother, or a parent who's fallen in defense of their country.

Everyone, that is, except for the people who go live among the muggles.

Those people slip out of the war. They're free-riders who let Magical Britain bear the costs of protecting society.

Those people don't have to build clocks that let you know that your children are safe. Because "Mortal Peril" isn't so common, in their world, that it's an option on living room fixtures.

** If you want a fanon explanation that would make both sides have valid points, a version of #3 could work. Let's say that studies suggest the influx of Muggleborns and Muggle blood will eventually weaken magical ability. Thousands of years down the road, magic could eventually become very weak with too much breeding with Muggles. Hence, Blood supremacists have a valid reason to fear the mating with muggles.

On the other hand, there isn't enough magical individuals to maintain an appropriate genetic variance. Wizards need muggles to continue to survive. So it's a bit of a catch-22. Wizards need to mate with muggles to continue to survive. But by mating with muggles, they are diluting their magical abilities. Not only is this a conundrum, but it also poses an interesting debate. Incredible Power for the few vs A little bit of Power for the many.

Of course, this goes completely against canon but it might be interesting to think about in an AU.
