** (I assume you mean HPMo*R*.) Basically, Harry is a genius, and he does various genius things, such as:

- Doing experiments with Hermione to investigate the nature of magic

- Befriending Draco and trying to convert him away from pureblood supremacy

- Violently disagreeing with Dumbledore's view that "death is the next great adventure" and actually sympathizing with Voldemort's fear of death

Quirrell is /also/ a genius--/apparently/ evil, but it's hard to tell--and takes Harry up as his protege.

The story appears to have something of a hatedom around here, since it's a giant propaganda piece for research into immortality and artificial intelligence, the author has asked for donations to the research organization for which he works in author's notes, and lots of people find genius!Harry to be a stuck-up self-insert Gary-Stu. Still, even though it's propaganda, I find it to be an extremely enthralling read.

The author says that the story will be completed on March 14th. You can download ebook versions of it [[http://hpmor.com/info/][here,]] if you want to read it offline.

** Fun story.

Harry is a genius fighting other geniuses.

A shame the author has to insert so much of himself and go off on random tangents. He clearly has a hand for suspense. Read it with an open mind. At some point, you either buy into the idea that magic can be rationalized or you just ignore those portions and enjoy the moments with genuine tension.

** HPMoR, or Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality has two main premises: Harry grows up in a loving family raised by Aunt Petunia and Professor Verres, and Harry has increased logical skills and by the age of 11 is attempting to live a more intelligent life. The story is really well written and it is going to be completed in two weeks, so you don't need to worry about it being incomplete. There are moments that are genuinely funny and real plot twists that are hard to predict. The biggest reason I read it is because the author aims to make the characters rational; they don't do stupid like in the original books just to move the story forward. Harry is more powerful, but then so are the baddies. There is a lot of effort to cut out or explain away things in the magical world that make no sense. The downsides are few. There are many philosophical instances in the story where one of the sides to the debate is the author's fear of death. It's more subtle than it's made out to be and certainly not an effective piece of propaganda if that is what it is accused of. There are other criticisms of HPMoR that end up being explained by really crucial parts of the story, so in order not to give spoilers, I will just say that it is worth keeping an open mind and not assuming things. Tl;dr well written, suspenseful and sometimes funny, long story where all the characters act more rationally than in cannon. Would recommend.

** TLDR: Petunia marries an Oxford(?) science man, Harry grows as a genius boy with the ego of a mathematician in a engineering convention.

It was some genuine funny and good first chapters before it descends into complete and utter shit

**** I /don't/ think it descended into shit (I still very much like it) but I think Notosk could be referring to how it gets notably less funny/more serious after the first few chapters. It starts off a little like a crackfic in some respects and if you're reading it for the funny stuff, that starts to tail off after a bit, to be replaced by more action/tension/science.

**** I think once the author decided he could make some money for his non-profit out of it and changed the tone of the story from fun and interesting to a massive propaganda piece.

****** See my issue is I think the plot is abysmal. It's gone nowhere, the timing is terrible and the characters themselves unrealistic and the entire plot exists to service the propaganda. Earlier it was less noticeable though and made for an enjoyable story.

************ Yeah the writer certainly has an inflated sense of himself though. He didn't finish high school and has no other formal education, he is clearly smart and entirely self-educated which is impressive enough, but the only person who can say how clever he is...is him. Frankly from his writings he isn't as clever as he thinks and he has said several times he writes Harry as himself...a fully grown adult, not an eleven year old. Oh and Hermione and Draco not having much range at the start makes it much worse, they have had less than a year to go from intelligent eleven year old to as smart as most adults, it's totally absurd. Although that goes back to the horrific pacing.

And no I can't offer specific examples as there is very few individual things I can remember from a story I haven't read in a month or two. It's the combination of the whole thing really. He simply knows more information than any eleven year old could even if they studied 15 hours a day with no breaks.

And honestly, if you can't show me the facts or remember any particular examples that support your claim I don't see the point in continuing the discussion. Let's just agree to disagree.

********* If we ignore for a second the fact that the intelligence of these three are explained in the story in much more detail than just "hey they're smart", I think you underestimate what a child prodigy is. Our world has seen, not one but tens of documented children making nuclear reactors by age ten. Kids who play chess at grand master level by age 10. Some people are really that gifted. It's really insulting that you don't really consider them to be real.

********** Oh no I consider child prodigies to be real, but those people building nuclear reactors aren't also developing vaccines and speaking 7 languages whilst sculpting great art on the side. They are focused on one thing, the MoR kids aren't they know whatever is relevant to the situation and it is completely unrealistic.
