** Harry woke up at 5:30 as usual. He gave a huge yawn as he stretched his limbs. He grabbed his wand and the jar at his bedside and went to work.

He crept to his best friends bed and lit his wand up. He carefully scanned the bed and moved the spider he spotted into the jar with his wand. He then looked under the beds of all his dorm mates to make sure a spider does not crawl out and frighten Ron. After he was sure that he had captured all the spiders he put the jar in his bag.

He brushed his teeth, took a bath and put on his uniform before once again going into his dorm to wake them up. Hearing Ron say thanks mate with a pat on his back never failed to make his day.

** Always thought it would be funny if Harry had a spider animagus form. I recall him watching them as a kid in his cupboard, and it would have been a great running joke with Ron's arachnophobia.
