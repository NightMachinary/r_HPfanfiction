** I'd recommend Jeconais's [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]] and sequel, [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Matryoshka_Vignettes/index/][Matryoshka Vignettes]].

**** Glad to be of help.

Jeconais is pretty reliable for romances. Though his stuff is a bit formulaic, it's all of considerably higher quality than the norm for fanfiction. And he's been around since forever, having invented many of the tropes we see today. (The oft-copied "Daphne as Ice Princess" trope started with /Perfect Situations/ is a case in point.)

** Most of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649126/James-Spookie][James Spookie]] work is Harry/Daphne. Also you can read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6926581/1/Thanks-to-a-Snake][Thanks to a snake]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9750991/1/Angry-Harry-and-the-Seven][Angry Harry and the Seven]]. These are the typical romance haphne fics.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8266462/1/Moving-On][Moving On]]. Can't remember much about this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9132770/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Connection-Reversed][HP and the Connection Reverse]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6245561/1/The-Lies-that-Bind][The Lies that Bind]]. EDIT: Dark story. Not sappy romance. (Thanks tru_bearshark)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/A-Fine-Spot-of-Trouble][A Fine Spot of Trouble]]. One of my favorites. Recovering alcoholic!Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4379372/1/Ruthless-Revenge][Ruthless Revenge]]. One-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9051934/1/A-Cunning-Slytherin][A Cunning Slytherin]]. One-shot in 4 chapters (total < 6500 words).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][The Pureblood Princess]]. Lots of people like this one, but I only liked the epilogue. Daphne's POV, except for the epilogue.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5864749/1/Ice-Princess][Ice Princess]]. One-shot in two chapters (~15k words).

Matryoshka Vignettes, as already recommended by truncation_error is very good. It also, ironically has the best Luna I've read.

*** I can second mostof these, but The Lies that Bind is NOT a sappy romance it is probably one of the darkest stories I've had the pleasure of reading

** Does it have to be sappy and romantic? The best Harry/Daphne story I've ever read is Unatoned by SeriousScribble. Murder/mystery story, focusing on the aforementioned couple.
