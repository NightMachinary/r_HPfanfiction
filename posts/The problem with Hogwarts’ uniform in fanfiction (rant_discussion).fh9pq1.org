I prefer the students in black robes, but doesn't Slughorn wear trousers and waistcoats?

*** And Crouch wears a pinstripe suit, and that one guy at the World Cup where's a nightgown because he likes to feel the breeze against his balls. Wizards are super wonky when it comes to Muggle fashion.

Although, really, I don't think it's that big of a deal. Mugglebornes would be a lot more likely to wear Muggle clothes when they don't need to be in uniform, or underneath their uniform, the students would probably have some knowledge of Muggle fashion and wear some either for comfort or out of rebellion, and the stuck up Pure Blood crowd would stick to their traditional clothing. Assuming that you set up the world that way and don't simply make it so that wizards wear similar clothes to Muggles, just with a different style, more flair, and accessories like cloaks and robes.

People wore pants and gowns in the Medieval Era, so it's not unreasonable for wizards to wear pants and skirts. If we're going down the hostorical side of things, though, I WANT CODPIECES

*** I guess my problem lays more with the concept of the Muggle uniform and the short skirts than the trousers minus some exceptions. I don't think trousers would never find their way in the wizarding world because you can be sure most Muggle-borns will introduce them and some people like Arthur Weasley exist. It's just that you have those author's who want to go even further than what Rowling did in the books and make wizarding and Muggle fashion even more different. Slughorn wearing trousers is perfectly okay since he has a strong Edwardian vibe, but when your story has a whole legislative assembly with ninety percent of the seats being hereditary from old and noble families (meaning nobles hold the power) and make Hogwarts - which has Lucius Malfoy as the Head of its board of governors - it just doesn't make sense to have the school make its students wear Muggle uniforms. That would be like if SS Lucius Malfoy and his other SS friends tolerated their sons and daughters wearing David's Star. You see what I mean?

** So far as I can tell (and it's far from clear), your position is that fanfictions should depict robes as per the books rather than the movies, which is to say, wizards should not be wearing Muggle clothes in combination with robes?

If so it sounds like you need to reread the books, because wizards definitely at times combine robes with "Muggle" clothes.

As for Victoria Potter, it's set in an AU with its own system of robes. The fashion is /other/ or /parallel/ to Muggle fashion, not just Muggle clothes from a few centuries ago. Although the characters wear robes, that does not mean they have Victorian conservative social norms about what is considered too revealing etc. The wizarding world has its own norms in that regard.

And for the avoidance of doubt, there are explicitly no "noble houses" or courtship traditions. As explained by Dumbledore in chapter 18, from the time that wizards overthrew the Muggle King's Wizards Council and decided to govern themselves, the wizarding elite no longer held titles of nobility (which are granted by the Muggle monarch).

*** To make myself perfectly clear this time, I am talking about fanfictions only. When I referred to the books I meant more ‘wizarding' fashion than the movies. But even then, a great number of fanfictions go an extra mile to make wizards' fashion even more... wizarding and different than the Muggles'. My problem is only with Hogwarts' uniform. Trousers are an article of clothing that is reasonable to have in the wizarding world, except when a writer shows the opposite before contradicting themselves by making students wear them. As for short skirts, when a writer depicts witches as wearing stays or corsets as undergarments and that every witches' robes/dresses are floor length it doesn't make any sense for this society that the writer voluntarily depicted as backwards and more conservative to allow its daughters to wear something this revealing and, in the way of thinking attributed to the society due to its depiction, scandalous.

I was fully aware of the lack of actual nobility and titles in Victoria Potter when I wrote this, you made it perfectly clear inside and outside the story. I also never stated wizarding fashion in your stories or any other writers' to be solely old-fashioned Muggle clothing. I simply came to the logical conclusion than an entire society that covers itself from the watching eye like Christian priests or medieval scholars would have more conservative views regarding modesty. I went to look at your document on robes and found myself to be unable to access it but I read how you described robes in Madam Malkin's shop as some being short. I'm sorry for the assumption I made regarding your story seeing as most of the chapters I've read was over a year ago. I'll even edit my original post to not include the passage mentioning you and your work if you want.

I stand by my arguments, though.

** I'm very much not an expert on fashion (past or present), but I've seen paintings of men who found good old pants "undignified". And let me tell you if I imagined Harry Potter looking like that and doing anything badass or serious I would start laughing. And wearing a skirt that goes slightly over the knees while wearing stocking exposes no skin and shouldn't be that scandalous IMO.

*** The thing is that showing one's knee doesn't suddenly becomes acceptable in a society that is said to be conservative regarding clothing because they're covered by stockings. It doesn't work like that. Also, unlike trousers, which work for people like Slughorn or Arthur Weasley, no woman in the books is said to wear anything besides long robes/dresses except maybe for Tonks, but that's Tonks so it's more talking about the exception than the rule, here. Taking this into consideration and the fact authors will often describe wizarding fashion as more backwards and conservative, why would school girls suddenly have to wear short skirts? It doesn't make sense. Particularly in stories in which wizarding nobility is shown to hold real power via the Wizengamot and that Lucius Malfoy is the Head of Hogwarts' Board of Governors. It also peeves me that writers will be book-accurate about everything in their stories except the school's uniform.

** All that bothers me about fanfic uniforms is that they use the movie idea that they were color-coded by house. There's no mention of that in the books. The book uniforms seem to be, you know, uniform.

**** They don't seem to be that certain. It may have been in Chamber of Secrets if I recall correctly, where Harry and Ron were trying to get into the Slytherin dorm, so they asked some kids they thought were Slytherins, but they were actually Ravenclaws.

***** You are right, except that I think even with coloured trims it could still happen considering blue trims lit by orange flames in dungeons could pass for green in the distance, I think. I actually pictured this when I read CoS for the first time. I thought it was quite smart.
