:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I thought of this fic for a different request, and while it isn't the one that person was looking for... I can't find this one again. After hours of looking through my history, because it's apparently not in Calibre. So.

- MoD!Harry isn't aging, and the unspeakables are starting to notice.

- In order to get away, Hermione created a spell/ritual that'll send Harry to a different dimension that's tied to a bracelet. The ritual is a bit rushed iirc as the ministry shows up at grimmauld place (?)... but it works.

- The bit that doesn't work is that Harry can't get the damn bracelet off and he isn't sure how long he'll stick around before being sent off again - has no control over it.

- There are two MCU stops that I remember - one where he's on asgard and tutors a very young Loki, and one circa the Avengers film (which is where the fic is abandoned)

- A third stop in between those two has him in a magic-less version of his world... in the early 80s. He meets his parents, his not-self as a baby, Sirius, Remus, et all - and they're coppers. And Voldemort is a mobster, and still has that ridiculous name for some reason.

Any help would be appreciated, because now it's driving me bonkers.
