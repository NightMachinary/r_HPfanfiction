*interesting in the Hagrid sense of the word.

Sphinx, manticore, acrumantula, kelpie or even magical snakes as Harry can talk to them.

I've read some cool characterizations, but usually it's a one time meeting during the tri wizard tournament.

Often the magical beings are comparable to humans in intelligence but have a very different way of thinking and/ or life span. I think there's a lot of potential for interesting non human characters, but I don't think I've read any..

I'm definitely not looking for another 'goblins/ werewolfs are secretly house elves who'd do anything for a pat on the head ' fic or some 'draco is Harry's veela/ vampire/ whatever mate and they must get one another preggers and sparkle for eternity' fic.

TL;DR looking for fics where intelligent magical beasts/beings play an important role while being clearly different from humans in their thinking.


** linkffn(Antithesis) does this, mostly with snakes and the basilisk, and the thestrals are also featured in much the same way. Animals in general feature heavily in the fic. They have far different perspectives from humans.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** There's currently a plot line in linkffn(All According to Plan by LysandraLeigh) featuring a nonhuman character. She is from a sort of reverse-animagus race and acts clearly nonhuman, and her interactions with Harry and the protagonist explore cultural differences. It's not a major part of the story, though. Inwardtransience's (one of the authors of AAtP) older fics also frequently involve exploration of the psychology of immortal and/or nonhuman beings as a theme.

Linkffn(Grimm: A Fairy's Tale by Krahae) features fully inhuman fairies who greatly influence Harry's development and follows his path away from humanity. There are quite a few varieties of fairies and they all have their own perspective. It primed a sequel but the author never wrote one, so just ignore the weird evil doctor scenes.

  Pre-Hogwarts. The stuff of legends, myth and majesty were the realm of the Fey long before wizards named him Boy Who Lived. Maeve of the Unseelie Court has decided to take one of wizarding kind's myths, to shape as her own. Vastly AU.

** I have a couple chapters of a story in my google drive featuring an OC reincarnated as a half-giant and his adoptive brother, a manticore that escaped from a wizard smuggler, who live together with a bunch of dragons in a dragon reserve. The reincarnated guy was abandoned by his new mother as a baby and had some panic-induced accidental magic that altered his body and convinced a nesting dragon to raise him.

Let me know if you want the link. It's /barely/ a Harry Potter story, though.
