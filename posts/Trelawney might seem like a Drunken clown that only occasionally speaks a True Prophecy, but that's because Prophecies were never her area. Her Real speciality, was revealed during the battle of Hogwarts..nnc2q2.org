Sybil Trelawney might seem like a fool to most. To anyone that doesn't know the truth. Her Prophecies are just a leftover from being related to True Seers in the Oracle of Delphi and Cassandra. Sybil Trelawney on the other hand, had a different Speciality in terms of Divination. Combat Divination.

She could see into the Future. Not like a long term vision, but just a few seconds at a time. Someone is trying to kill her? She knows exactly where the spell will travel, and exactly where to dodge. Even Dozens of spells, she'd know exactly where the spells wouldn't be, and could just be there. She was actually one of the few in the world to beat Flitwick and Dumbledore in a duel.

When Voldemort attacked Hogwarts, he wasn't expecting the "Batty old Drunk" that was Sybil Trelawney to stand against his army.

"Avada Kedavra!" the Death Eaters all cried in tandem, each wanting to one-up the other, and impress their master, but Trelawney ducked, dodged and weaved through each spell, not a single bolt touching her.

"It's slow" those two words infuriated Voldemort, but his Death Eaters were mostly pitiful fools. They knew so few spells useful in combat, and them attempting to use Fiendfyre would just cause the blasted woman to apparate behind him, and the Flames to consume his forces. He was just glad Potter didn't have this power. That would have been the real threat in the Prophecy.

But little did Voldemort know, Harry was told to take Divination for a reason by Albus Dumbledore. And those years of "Remedial Divination" lessons were going to truly pay off soon.

It turns out her All-Seeing Eye was towards Combat, not Prediction.

(Basically What if Divination could be used like Future Sight Haki)


** You know its surprising how much she actually got right. It's just unfortunate she was often misinterpreting the signs

When she asked about Harry being born midwinter, okay Harry was born in July, but if you take the horcrux into account then she was right on as Tom was born midwinter.

She predicted the thing lavender was dreading would happen, okay lavander only received the news on the given date but she was still right.

Harry being stalked by the grim, not a death oman - just Sirius. But big black dog? Right again.

And by that logic I out forward - Professor Trewlawnly had predicted the death of at least one student per year since she started at Hogwarts (and said by mcgonagall), assuming she could only predict those she had met in her class, each of those student died either during Voldemort reign of terror or during the Final Battle. Including Harry.

*** Also, in book 3 when she refused to join the professors at Christmas dinner because that would make thirteen people at the table, and that the first to rise would be the first to die. While she didn't join them, if you count Pettigrew, who was in Ron's pocket at the time, there were thirteen people there. And Dumbledore was the first to rise, and guess who died first out of the characters in that scene?

Of course. I'm not saying that her power is equivalent to Contessa's. But she also has magic of her own, and in a magical duel knowing what your opponent will do seconds in advance is definitely helpful, even if your opponent will use a targeted spell. After all, duels aren't usually over the moment someone uses a targeted or AoE spell.

****** Can she, though? Magic useful in a fight? Canonically all we see is an incompetent "drunken clown" who basically sucks even at the subject she teaches. I don't recall seeing her cast ANYTHING, and given that the Weasley twins made a killing selling shielding hats that auto-cast a tenth grade spell because most magicals couldn't be bothered to learn it... I don't have a very high opinion of most of the wizards and witches because JKR painted them as useless idiots. Unless shown otherwise, I assume that they know just enough magic to survive daily life, meaning cosmetic and household charms, most first- and second-year charms, and whatever their specialty is that they use to live, which 9 times out of 10 is NOT wandwork. Potions, herbology, creatures, specialty charms for clothing or bottomless bags or whatever. NOT combat spells.

******** True, but the prompt is Trelawney with short-term precog, not Trelawney with short-term precog AND combat expertise. Just because something CAN be used in combat doesn't mean that practitioners are combat monsters. I present as evidence McGonnagall, who's pretty mediocre at combat even though transfiguration is amazing in combat, as evidenced by Dumbledore. You could go further AU and say that Trelawney IS a combat monster, but if you're extending it why not also say that she's got all the combat knowledge of her entire ancestral line and channels the magic of Hogwarts? There's no limit to how OP one can make her, or any character, but sticking to the actual prompt she'd still be fairly mediocre-to-bad.

***** But then, isn't part of the art of divination taking clues into account and predicting accordingly ? This reminds me of a scene in Diana Gabaldon's "Outlander" (first book).

>>

/I was curious again, and opened my palm voluntarily./

/"What am I, then, according to my hand?"/

/Mrs. Graham frowned, but did not pick up my hand again./

/"I canna just say. It's odd, for most hands have a likeness to them. Mind, I'd no just say that it's 'see one, you've seen them all,' but it's often like that - there are patterns, you know." She smiled suddenly, an oddly engaging grin, displaying very white and patently false teeth./

/"That's how a fortune-teller works, you know. O do it for the church fete every year - or did, before the War; suppose I'll do it again now. But a girl comes into the tent - and there am I, done up in a turban with a peacock feather borrowed from Mr. Donaldson, and 'robes of oriental splendor'- that's the vicar's dressing gown, all over peacocks it is and yellow as the sun - anyway, I look her over while I pretend to be watching her hand, and I see she's got her blouse cut down to her breakfast, cheap scent, and earrings down to her shoulders. I needn't have a crystal ball to be tellin' her she'll have a child before the next year's fete." Mrs. Graham, paused, grey eyes alight with mischief. "Though if the hand you're holding is bare, it's tactful to predict first that she'll marry soon."/ [..]

** Idea:

- The information you get out of divination, coming straight out of a piece of raw time magic, takes on a fundamentally inhuman form. No one can do anything directly with a 4-dimensional magical fractal that appears fully formed in the mind of a seer. It takes extensive training to make divination useful to humans.
- Prophesy specialists spend years training their language centers to make useful linguistic representations of divination results.

  - Anyone with any divination talent can do a mediocre job, but mediocre prophesies are only comprehensible in retrospect.
  - Like telling Harry there's a grim in his future. In retrospect it's obviously Sirius, but that wasn't clear from what she said.

- Combat divination specialists spend years training their motor cortices to respond instinctively to divination results faster than they can think

  - Like the Jedi letting the Force guide them in fights
  - Combat divination expertise makes you twitchy, because time magic keeps trying to steer you around minor discomforts. Trelawney drinks to suppress those twitches so no one suspects her.
