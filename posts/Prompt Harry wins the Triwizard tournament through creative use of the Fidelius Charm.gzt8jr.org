One possible outline

Task 1 - Harry puts the location of the dragon's eggs under Fidelius, then the dragon panics. The dragon ravages the crowds while Harry calmly picks up the egg and tells the secret to the judges.

Yule Ball - Harry puts the Great Hall under Fidelius and thus does not have to attend.

Task 2 - Harry puts the Black Lake under the Fidelius. Ensuing chaos results in no one but him able to rescue a captive. Harry rescues all of them. Judges change the rules to require no locations to be put under Fidelius.

Task 3 - Harry arrives at the trophy first, puts it under Fidelius so he can watch to see the machinations of his enemies. Cedric agrees that it's obvious that someone is interfering, and an indeterminate stall has Barty Crouch breaking into the maze to try to force Harry to claim the cup. Harry claims the cup after Barty threatens Cedric, and he is cast into the graveyard.


** The Fidelius Charm is a very difficult spell to do. It would be very difficult for a fourteen-year-old Harry to use the Fidelius in the first place.

*** Yes, but so is the patronus. If Harry started learning it earlier, given his ridiculous aptitude for picking up spells, it's feasible for him to be able to cast it during the tournament.

*** The Patronus Charm is, according to the very skilled Lupin, "ridiculously advanced" and "well beyond NEWT level". Harry learned the basics in a month or two, figured it out by the end of the year.

**** Ah. I guess it's easy to forget because of how he can teach his classmates the charm in OOTP.

***** Perhaps there is an alternative explanation, then. Perhaps these spells aren't nearly as complex or difficult as they are made out to be.
