Not one set up by his great grandfather's mother's great uncle, or some type of agreement.

I'm talking one where he draws up the stipulations and shit himself or a group of lawyers and with the other side.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive.

*** Yeah, it'd kind of be an entirely different story. The dramatic tension relies on it not being his idea. It's like the Triwizard Tournament where he goes "sounds good, I'll put my name in" -- that's a different book.
