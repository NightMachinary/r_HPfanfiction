Obviously, the summary has to be good, at the very least. It's just that most people won't read a fanfic, if it is written in the summary that it has a terrible summary or "bad at summaries". Would the opposite appeal to you?


** If an author has to mention their opinion of their summary in the summary itself, it doesn't give me much confidence in how the fic will be written

** Entirely depends on the summary of the story. If it presents an interesting concept I'm up for anything I suppose.

** The best summaries I've read tell me what the story is about without any fluff. I don't care if the author thinks their summary sucks or if it's "the best EVER!!!" - I just want to know what the fic is about. Even stories I'm not interested in reading I mentally give the author kudos if their summary gets right to the point without interjecting their own opinion. With that said, if the story sounds interesting enough, I'll give it a go.

** That sounds like what you'd get if Trump started writing fanfic.
