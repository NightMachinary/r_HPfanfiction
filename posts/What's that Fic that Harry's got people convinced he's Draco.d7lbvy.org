:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
From what I remember Harry gets people thinking he's Draco and Draco is the spawn of Narcissa and Snape and that he has black hair.

I can't really remember what else happened but I think he once flew in the Hogwarts train on a broom through a window at one point I can't remember if it's the same fanfiction.


** That would be !linkffn(Oh God Not Again)

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
