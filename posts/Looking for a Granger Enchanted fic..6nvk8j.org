Now I don't remember the title so I'm going to do my best to list what I remember and hopefully it jogs someone's memories. I have no idea if it was finished as chapters were sporadic so I only checked when I remembered. It was in the 30s or higher for chapter count.

*Was a Dramoine

*Started as noncon

*Hermione winds up pregnant

*Malfoys decide Draco will marry her

*Hermione is the first witch born to a magic bloodline in many generations, she inherits a house, vault, elves

*Draco gets her a half kneazle kitten

*Hermione is giving a tour of the house to her parents and hiccuping purple? bubbles as a side effect to an anti morning sickness potion.

And that's all I remember for sure about it, hopefully someone at lease remembers the name so I can try and track it down if not has a link. Thanks!


** Oh, I remember it. It wasn't complete I don't think. Doesn't she interview men to marry and even though she is going to pic Draco, she is fair and interviews others. I think the Weasley twins interviewed just to give her a business proposal.

I think Dean Thomas might have also been in it as a wizard artist maybe too.
