Do you guys have friends who read fanfictions? Like your school mate or college mate? Your office buddy even anyone in your family? Just wanted to know if you guys have people, who you meet in person regularly, who read fanfictions like you do?

I personally do not have anyone in my friend circle or family that read fanfics?


** Same. No one I know does. Hahaha I hide the fact that I read and write it. :P

** I had one good friend in high school where not only we read the same fics we reviewed each other fics. I miss this!

Unfortunately when you are a certain age it's seen as a childish hobbie (some people even consider it perverted).

Now that I'm in college I am honestly embarrassed to even ask someone if they read fanfic. Like, how do you do this? I'm scared that the person might think me perverted or, worse, I think the person is LOL

*** Best way to bring it up IMO is in the context of HP in general. So if someone's like ‚Äúdamn, I wonder what would've happened if Voldemort killed Harry as a baby,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI wonder if Arthur Weasley was smarter than we think,‚Äù you can be like ‚Äúoh! I read a really fun fanfic about that once.

Immediately addresses that it's not all bad smut but really deals with interesting topics and shit.

**** I don't have any statics, but at least for me it seems like people consider fanfiction as a heavy porn/shipping thing, and people who read or write it perverted.

I don't know if there are studies about this tho, might only be my own social circle? I'd love to know if someone have a different perception of society's view about it!

***** Might have something to do with fanfiction is associated to the teenage crowd primarily, or at least the most vocally amongst those. Teenagers are horny idiots, so anything that closely involved is bound to be similar. Or some such.

*** I always bring up how fascinating it is to see people grow stronger with their writing skills. And I tell them that most long fanfics are about the same size as a novel but they do it without being paid for it. That tends to make people think more openly. Then if people bring up the smut aspect I just counter with the longest going joke in porn the pizza delivery. Does that mean you shouldn't order pizza because a few pornos have been made about it? That shuts them up enough to then I can explain most fanfics are tagged so you just need to avoid key words like lemon smut etc then

Edit: spelling

** Never actually discussed it to be honest. I think only two people know that I read and write, and that's only because I'm very close to them. And they aren't into it.

I know maybe two people in my class read Fanfics, and that's because they are open about it. I don't really socialise with them because our tastes differ too much to sit down and chat about it.

That and different Cliques.

** My friends don't read any but are still cool about it. We've had some fun conversations about the history and politics of the rest of the wizarding world as background for the fic I'm working on, like, ‚Äúwhat would the colonization of Africa look like from a Wizarding perspective?‚Äù or ‚Äúhow would a magical Anarchist utopia in New Zealand function?‚Äù They think it's fun to talk about but aren't really into it enough to spend time actually reading it.

** I have a great group of friends from college who are all into fanfic. During COVID we actually set up weekly check ins where we read each other's writing. It was great for socializing AND motivating ourselves to write!

Having fanfic friends is honestly the best. I'm not into their fandoms, generally, but that only makes it more impressive when I fall in love with the fics they write/recommend.

** Mmm I have friends who read fanfictions but never in the fandom I write in. They either like their fandom more than mine or just don't like HP. I do have a few Potter head friends that I share my fanfic with and they liked it. For some reason, I felt like their reviews and comments were ten times better than the reviews I normally get, which is saying a lot bc I normally get positive reviews.

Makes me sad that some people don't like Harry Potter, but I guess I can't judge/criticize them for their personal favorites.

Long story short I've branched out a lot. And I have another coworker now who also likes fanfics so we talk about them a lot. Or story ideas.

** No-one in my immidiate circle of people reads fanfics. I have been trying to get my gf into it, but she only likes reading real hard-cover books.

My close friends and family know that i read FF, family doesn't care and my friends dont care either, but they ocasionally make fun of me for it. (That is just our humor, me and my friends all make fun of eachother so don't think that they arent my real friends cuz they make fun of me)

I play drums in a band though, and our guitarist and singer really like harry potter and the singer reads FF too! But she is mainly into slash and im really not. But still, when we had 2 gigs in one day and we were driving 400km that day, during the journey we discussed HP so much. It was really fun bonding with them.

But I would really like to have more friends to fiscuss HP FF with, but It is hard cuz I live in the "redneck" part of Finland, where if you are different, you are ridiculed.
