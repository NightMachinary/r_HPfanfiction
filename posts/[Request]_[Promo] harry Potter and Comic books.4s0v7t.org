So I recently began work on a fan fiction based on a Harry that the Dursleys allowed to read comics to keep him out of the way. This Harry would become so engrossed in them, that by the time he reached Hogwarts he would want to learn to have super powers, or the closest you can manage with magic. legilimency instead of mind reading, apparating instead of teleporting etc. The idea is to have a Harry who is motivated to learn magic from the very beginning, without completely changing his personality to make him into Hermione. (First chapter is up here -[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12039874/1/A-boy-and-his-Heroes]]) Someone pointed out to me that the idea had already been done, and so I was wondering if anyone had read something similar? If so I'd like to read it, both for ideas, and just because I think it's a fun concept. Thanks!


** I like the idea and your first chapter, but I'm not sure where you can take it. Are you going to rehash canon(ugh) but alter the scenarios with Harry's superhero influenced way of thinking? I would also imagine this kind of story being very light hearted/PG.

*** Yeah, its going to be light hearted, I'm pretty sick of reading super dark angsty fics. Its slowly going to deviate from canon, because everything Harry does will be slightly different, which eventually build up - butterfly effect.

I have lots of ideas based on where his skills will develop differently to those of canon Harry - can you imagine this version of Harry not wanting to become a shape shifter? (animagus) So for example, he'll focus more on transfiguration than canon Harry, and maybe become more studious.

I haven't got a full idea for the story, because its a recent idea and this Harry is still evolving in my head. The beginning will be canon events, but those will end differently, leading to the next series of event being less canon, and on it will go. That was a bit of a ramble, but I hope it answered your questions. Definitely thanks for asking, being asked questions about this kind of thing brings on new ideas about it! :)

** linkffn(5747709) uses this concept, although it's short. But it's one of my top 10 fics in the fandom.

  A surprising discovery leads Harry to question the fine line between normality and the supernatural. Drawing inspiration from the generation's brightest minds, he seeks to answer the proverbial question. Is he a mutant or some sort of humanoid alien? Status: Complete.
