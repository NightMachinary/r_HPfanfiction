Like I said in the title, it's a pairing I have always been interested in but all the fics I've found are either criminally short or poorly written, often both. So if anyone knows about a good fic with this pairing could you please point me in its direction?


** I'm afraid that this is one of those pairings with a particular appeal limited to romance or raunchiness. Ginny isn't the main character so her adventures have to invented, and Luna as a counterpoint to Ginny isn't one to create problems so much as alleviate them.

There was an excellent non-relationship story by gr33nsleeves I think was called Glass Houses, but she pulled her stories a while back.

Other than that, seek romance with linkao3(This Stone At My Back by Lomonaaren)
