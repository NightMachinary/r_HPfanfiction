** I like to believe that people who write Ron-centric stories are civilized and intellectual people who while may criticize, would never bash Harry or Hermione.

All the Ron-centric fics I've read and I'm sure I've read a healthy percentage of them, while may have some general annoyance or clash of personality would not really take it further.

So while linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan) fits your request technically. It will fail to scratch any itch of BAMF!Ron beats the shit out of friends that think he is STUPID AND BETRAYER OF WORLDS!!!...ahem.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no one is perfect.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU
