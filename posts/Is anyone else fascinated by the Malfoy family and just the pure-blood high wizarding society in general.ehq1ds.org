I'd love to explore that world more. And I'm currently working on The Prisoner of Azkaban fanfiction if Harry was in Slytherin. That for the rest of the summer instead of staying at the Leaky Cauldron he's staying with the Malfoys. (I've already written 2 full fan novels and I honestly am loving this alternative reality) But I'm thinking of also writing some stories of younger Lucius Malfoy, Narcissa Black and the Marauders and stuff at Hogwarts. There's just so much to explore. So glad I came back to this universe as an adult now. Cause this world was my childhood. I'd love to hear if anyone has their own ideas and headcannons too about the subjects I've mentioned.


** No, but I'm interested in the Blacks.

I dislike Pureblood wank in general, but prefer to see them NOT as an arrogant, complacent, and ignorant bunch.

I think "Delenda Est" strikes a good balance in depicting them. I like this clever, power hungry, pragmatic, and sarcastic Bellatrix.

I think Arthur Weasley only asked the "rubber duck" question because he was trying to put Harry at ease.

Malfoys are for me the ultimate opportunists. They only look out for themselves, and will betray anyone and anything to save their own hides. Canon Scorpius might be the exception.

Finally, I like a dark!revolutionary!Trio burning down the old order post Voldemort, as in "The Sum of Their Parts".

Every time Harry becomes Heir of Slytherin through conquest after CoS or some such bs, I'm always a little bit irrationally sad for Morfin Gaunt, who is a lawful Heir of Slytherin and is alive in the Azkaban at the time. If Sirius gets to retain his fanon title in prison, so does Morfin!

Canon Lucius and Narcissa are about 5-6 years older than the Marauders. I doubt they'd even notice a few Gryffindor first-years while they're working on their NEWTs. Might need to AU that if you want them interacting significantly.

Yes, they faked it until they made it. How else would a family with a french last name make it to the forefront of Pureblood ENGLISH society? By spending lots of gold, kissing a lot of arse, and illegal activities.

  *pure-blood high wizarding society in general*
#+end_quote

I'm fascinated by how long it would take for wizarding Britain to collapse. You spend seven books seeing how bad most of the purebloods operate. You see generations of them blindly following a half-blooded idiot because he promised them what they wanted. And they try to keep Wizarding Britain Stagnant. And how many more generations before everyone gets as inbred as the Gaunts. Remember, it's already canon that inbreeding reduces magical ability. Look at Merope. But not directly, as you'll need brain bleach if you do.

It's one of the reasons I don't like the epilogue at all: 19 years later: "Oh, let's go put our kids on the old as fuck train. Unsupervised. It's not like anything ever went wrong on the train before, right? Or that we don't have ways of travel that are infinitely better? Or that having to go to a trainstation wouldn't inconvenience a lot of people or threaten the statute of secrecy where some shrew of a woman shouts about muggles or people entering/exiting a wall? No, we need to keep our traditions. Because we're dumb as shit. No, we're going to ignore all of those points, because once you hit 30, your incompetence raises at an exponential rate."

That alone showed me that Britain was doomed. DOOOOOMED

** Yes! I've read a couple of fixing-up-Malfoy-Manor homey fics that surprisingly got into the whole backstory and lineage of the Blacks and the Malfoys! I still keep an eye out for fics that do something similar, but feel like most I find include Lord Potter stuff.

** I'm interested in the Malfoy family and particularly in Lucius as the opportunist trying to increase his status in Wizarding society. I've been thinking lately about what would be next for him after Deathly Hallows and like the idea of a Lucius who would claw his way back to the top in this new world.

** I like reading fics that explore aspects of pureblood high society and aren't just "wizards good muggles bad." Interesting stories tend to have different customs and traditions introduced that are pagan-based/from a different era or just stuff the author made up.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1614796/Ellory][Ellory]] writes a lot of "pureblood culture" centered around dating/courting traditions.

linkffn(Growing up Black) has a lot going on with the Black family and traditions.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is the first in a series in which pureblood have more rights over muggleborns.

Another one is linkffn(Strange Attractors), which is set in the 1940s. There's a lot about what all the houses are like, and fully explores the implications of Grindelwald's power and the world war going on at the same time.

This is a hilarious Lucius-focused fic covering all the books. linkao3(16801360)

The closest to my head canon is linkffn(Bullseye). This is from Astoria's POV and is kind of a slice of life since it hits stages of canon. However, the actual plot of this story has to do with Slytherins, politics and drama in high society. It's Draco/Astoria and all the scenes with Lucius are very entertaining to read.

The wide array of characters in the HP world means that there is so much to explore about the Wizarding World! We only know Harry's Gryffindor perspective and how the Weasleys live in the Wizarding World, but they don't seem to be the norm! So I like to look up fics with random characters and see what I get!

  The trials and tribulations of Lucius Malfoy: his life as a Death Eater, father, husband, slimy bribe-r of politicians, and wannabe evil genius. His son is whiny and indiscreet. His wife is clueless as to how genuinely insane her sister is. The politicians he keeps in his pocket are inept. The Dark Lord is back and has clearly gone off the deep end, and oh yeah, there's this little matter of one scar-faced brat who keeps messing up his evil plans.
