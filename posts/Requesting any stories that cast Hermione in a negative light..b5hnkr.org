I've recently read one too many fics that feature the oft used Saint Hermione characterization, and I need some palate cleansing. I will take anything from Hermione being rivals of the MC, to metaphorical character assassination; anything to remind myself that she has flaws, and that they can sometimes be quite grating.


** linkffn(Rise of the Wizards)

Ron and Hermione are both portrayed pretty negatively, but especially Hermione.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): her name appears only 7 times, but she's totally trashed. Despite her being my favorite character, I do gloat over Hermione bashing from time to time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]], linkffn(4889913): It's not necessarily her fault, but she gets really bad in this one, and she gets off too lightly in the end.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): It's a H/Hr fic, so definitely no bashing here, but her insistence on "good guys don't kill" is quite annoying.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106):

#+begin_quote
  Hermione pouted. "So, that means we don't need to brew an illegal potion with stolen ingredients, knock out three of our classmates, tie them up in a closet, sneak into the Slytherin Common Room, and interrogate Malfoy?"

  I gaped at her. "Was that your plan?"

  I fear that Hermione may be the most evil of us all. That is concerning since I am a retired Dark Lord.
