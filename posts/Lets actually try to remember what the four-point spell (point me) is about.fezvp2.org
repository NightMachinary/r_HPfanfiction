Like I'm getting pretty used to reading this "Point me Trevor the toad" -> *Facepalm*

Which is sad, I get reinterpreting parts of canon, expanding on it, or just creating your own branch of magic out of other media or your imagination, but using a part of canon wrongly because you didn't know what it actually was is just lazy


** Point me works like a compass, like it points north or whatever so you can work out which way you are going. Harry uses it in the maze so he can work out where the centre of the maze is

** Seeing that Hermione was the one to /find/ the spell, and Harry being practically (if not) the only person to use it- she could have invented it. Edit: She could have said she found it, because seriously, would /you/ use a spell a fourth year invented. Even if it was Hermione?

Also, they could be confusing it with the videogame DHp1, where the spell tells you where your next objective is.

*** Harry used a spell that he only had the information "For Enemies." Yes, I can see him trying a random spell Hermione came up with.

**** I was more talking about Hermione hiding the fact that she invented it. Because of confidence issues and whatnot.

***** Doubtful bc even in 6th year Hermione refuses to abandon proper instructions or vetted spells. She cannot stand the HBP even tho the instructions are better than her book. I can't see Hermione making up a spell and having harry use it in the final event.

****** There's a world of difference between she doesn't trust other people to follow them, but she trusts herself to. And some of that was jealousy on her end.

​

Look at her beaded bag in book 7.

*** that's kind of my point, any quest or mystery is pretty much spoiled by this, can you imagine? "point me to the chamber of secrets" "point me to Horcrux" "point me to the mysterious object I can't seem to find but absolutely need" yes, I know "They surely have protection if the owner doesn't want others to find it" IT IS STILL LAZY WRITING!

goddammit just read another recently, I'm becoming more and more triggered by each new one
