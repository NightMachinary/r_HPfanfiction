Anyone ever read a fic about Tom's time at Hogwarts, from his point of the view? The only one I have ever read is from the POV of a time traveling Harry.

The first three years are out and the fourth is forthcoming (no pun intended). I have some minor quibbles (Riddle's contemporaries are as advanced as third years as Harry's were as sixth years), but overall, I quite enjoy the series.
