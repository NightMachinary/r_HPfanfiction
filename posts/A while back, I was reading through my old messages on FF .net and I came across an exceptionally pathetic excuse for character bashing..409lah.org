***** I don't mind it either. Adds a bit of diversity. If I don't want to read it, I can always not open the topic. There are so many request topics that I sometimes don't feel like looking at the subreddit. Especially since you know the same Fics are going to get get recommended. I know that the search function isn't great, but it seems like some don't even try.

*** This past week has been pretty ranty.

I'd avoid it though. A rant flair would encourage rant posts, and many discussions and requests already include rants in them, or in their replies. Plus, a discussion rant tends to have more purpose than a rant for rants sake

If you include the rant flair, it may start to take over the sub and I feel like we could become a group of complaining fanfic bashers instead of a group focused on finding and spreading the needles in the haystack

** You're right that someone should have a better reason for their opinion regarding a character's personality than 'reader interpretation.' OTOH, I do think that the morality of a character's choices can be endlessly debated. For example, Draco's actions in canon don't morally balance for me but they do for countless other people.

I checked to see if anyone has written a transgendered Aragog/Giant Squid story with elements of food fetishism for you, but I didn't see anything. Maybe someone knows of one on a site other than ff.net?

** I agree completely with what you say about reader interpretation. There's interpretation and there's exploration. And then there's unreasonable nonsense, which to me is when the canon character is no longer recognizable.

You know, given the breadth and depth of this fandom, I wouldn't even be surprised if it already existed. You're probably going to have to hit some of the wilder sites than FF.net for it though.

** To be honest, the usual worth (or lack of it) of bashing aside, justifying bashing with “reader interpretation” is a bit like proudly proclaiming “professional expertise” and then proceeding to use a balloon to hammer nails in.

Meaning, even if you succeed, others are well within their right to laugh at you and think you are a lost case.

Well.... in the films Aragog has a very deep voice, as the other characters treat (the character) as a male. Hagrid refers to Aragog as 'he'. However, also in the films Aragog is the only large Acromantula, and there is no mention of his 'wife'. SO, it's possible in movie verse that Aragog is in fact biologically female, in order to give birth, and command to the rest of the Acromantula. Hence, movie Aragog may indeed be transgender. As for carrot cake: he is very interested in eating the bright orange haired Ron, a hair colour sometimes referred to as 'carrot-top'.
