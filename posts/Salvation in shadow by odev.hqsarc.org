So I recently read linkffn(salvation in shadow by odev) and really liked it (for the most part). It started off fairly cliched and the chapter with Ginny nearly made me drop it but it got SO much better after that.

This story has kind of a mixed reception and a negative one on DLP (eventhough most of them haven't even read it). You know, that edgy, dark website where Darth Anakin is trying to end you with his basilisk stare.

It features a darker, far more cunning and selfish Harry Potter who is dealing with a constant inner struggle to keep hold of his identity with the threat of the most powerful and malicious dark lord gunning for him.

The author had me hooked and I simply couldn't stop reading to find out what happened to Harry as a kid, how he got to be so powerful/driven, why he's nearly possessed by Voldemort (and boy what a great and disturbing reveal that was), ...

The open ending was kind of a bummer though (I REALLY don't like open endings) and I was wondering what your guys take is on the ending and how you think it turned out?

Spoiler alert: the main question we're left with is, if 'Tom' really is Regulus Black (doubtful) or 'Tom' is Harry's Voldemort personality he can apparently now let out 'safely' ever since he merged the last horcrux into him.

Obviously I believe it's the second but the author ends the fic with Harry fighting Voldemort and losing. Harry decides he needs 'Tom's' help. And the closing remark being that what Harry was about to do would land him in Azkaban for life and not even all his influence and money would be able to keep him out.

So the questions I'm left with are: what is he about to do? How come 'Tom' was able to help Harry during his invasion of Malfoy manor (time turner)? And what on earth is he about to do that is deemed illegal by the ICW?

I would reckon that whatever he's about to do isn't time travel since we know that Hermione used a time turner in her third year to be able to follow different classes simultaneously.

So anyone got any theories willing to share?
