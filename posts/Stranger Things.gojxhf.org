Are there any good Stranger Things and Harry Potter crossovers?

I would prefer if Harry went to Hawkins but at this point I'll take anything.

** I haven't read any of them so I'm afraid I cannot offer any specific recommendations, but here's a list of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Stranger-Things-2016-Crossovers/224/13088/?&srt=4&r=10][crossovers between /Harry Potter/ and /Stranger Things/]]

There's only 10 of that specific crossover on FFN, though.
