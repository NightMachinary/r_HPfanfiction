  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

  In the magical justice system, the justice is represented by two separate yet equally important groups. DMLE who investigates crime and Wizengamot who decides about the guilt. These are their stories

Something like that?

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

After the war, Harry and Ron join the aurors but are disappointed that they can't go after the rich purebloods like Malfoy because they effectively control the Ministry.

Meanwhile Hermione and Sirius try to politically dismantle the status quo and secretly reduce the wealth of the bribing families by robbing them.

Obviously Harry isn't happy about thieves going around but eventually he agrees that it's the only way the power monopoly of the rich old families can be broken.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
