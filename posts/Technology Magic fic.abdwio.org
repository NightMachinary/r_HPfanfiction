Hey, I was wondering if there really any decent fics that have Harry mixing technology and magic? I realize that this will likely lead into the OP Harry domain but I'm okay with that right now.

I know there are some fics where he fixes stuff to work in Hogwarts but I mean where he has like Nanobots injecting people with potions or stuff like that.

Don't really care what genre or time frame. If it has lots romance I would prefer no slash.

Thanks!


** If you're okay with crossovers I'd recommend linkffn(Harry Potter and the Invincible Technomage) it's OP to an extreme

** If you're after lots of cool special effects, then this one's no good, but if you're interested in digging into the fundamentals of how magic fits into our existing understanding of physics, then you might find linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) interesting. It's very long, though, and that's only one of several themes.

**** Actually, if you want to see a mix of magic and technology, you might be better served in another setting; canon Harry doesn't have much to do with technology. Mother of Learning, for example, has some great world building that blends the two.

***** I'll take a look a Mother of Learning, thanks for the rec. I do think I am reaching the point where I need to move on to other domains.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
