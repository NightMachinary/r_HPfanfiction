Any suggestions? The more AU, the better. I've read Wastelands of Time.


** There's a fem!Harry one that gets recc'd quite a bit wherein he time-travels, gets HP-lucked into becoming female shortly before her 11th birthday, and then has Voldemort killed all before September first. Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool or something like that? Not sure of the name, but it's on ffn somewhere/somehow.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** There was a massive one where Harry and Draco end up back in time (or dimension, my memory is a bit fuzzy) after Voldemort practically destroyed the world, standard far-off-future fanfic fare. Harry gets adopted by the Flamels and Draco reveals he's a traveller as well.

I'll try and see if I can find it.

I think its this one you mean. Have to say that I find the pace of the story to be extremely frustrating.

Seriously, the author of that thing seems to think that people are actually interested in reading about Harry figuring out why the Marauders Map doesn't work in the other dimension. Some of the chapters are really long, but could be easily be cut to two third or even half of their length without loosing valuable information for the reader.

Ist like the author doesn't want to move along.

**** That's the one!

I admit to being one of those that /does/ want to read about why the Marauder's map doesn't work in other dimensions, since it helps me develop limitations to the thing's wider implementation (Map of the Ministry? of Diagon Alley? :D), but I agree that the pace of the piece is very slow.

And yes, for the vast majority of readers, two-thirds can easily be cut without losing value.

  Are Murderers born? Or are they made? When Hermione is sent to the past she is forced to become acquainted with someone she knew she'd hate for the rest of her life. Rated M for later chapters.

******** I enjoyed the overall fic as well. To be honest, I find that a young Bellatrix as portrayed in this one and Harry are one of the most interesting couples to read about. Also, the whole story felt very promising.

But them going into the future kind of marked the point where the fic went downhill, slowly but steady. Unfortunatly.
