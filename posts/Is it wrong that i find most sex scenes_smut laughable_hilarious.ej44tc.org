Like a story can be really good, but the sex scenes in it just make me laugh, not maliciously but just laugh at some of the dialogue and descriptions?

Sayings like "Her plush walls" or having the characters talk through the entire thing just make me crack up and i honestly don't know why

** That's the reaction I'm going for when I'm writing sex scenes, honestly. Wait, you're saying some of these scenes other writers write aren't meant to be funny?

Here's an excerpt from one of my sex scenes, just for you:

“She felt a tension building in his body as he assailed her, claiming her as his own, much like William the Conqueror had done to England in 1066. “

**** Well, William the Conqueror ruled England until his death in 1087... Oh, but if you want the story, it's here. I should probably get off Reddit and finish the last chapter. It's almost there.

  Here's my contribution to the ridiculously contrived, trashy, marriage law genre. This one involves Lucius Malfoy and a muggle stripper, with snarky commentary by Percy Weasley. Rated M for some sex scenes.

*** You'll love the [[https://literaryreview.co.uk/bad-sex-in-fiction-award][bad sex in fiction]] review they put out every year.

In my experience, sex itself is a pretty silly thing. You're drunk off your own desire, trying to maneuver each other into positions of maximum comfort while maintaining all the correct levels of friction, so inevitably things get a bit awkward, someone says something dumb because their brain don't work tur good with all them hormones, and yeah, it's goofy.

** The author is a good company ... John Grisham admitted he never writes them himself, because when he tried the first and let his wife read them, she started to laugh uncontrollably. He was discouraged that he swore never to try again. (From the NPR's show Wait Wait Don't Tell me when he was once interviewed)

** To me, most sex scenes are about as interesting as two people shaving each others' armpits, but I only laugh if the author makes the characters spout ridiculous one-liners during sex. I always assume the author must have taken inspiration from some high-budget porn film with pretensions of plot.

** Yup. There are some good ones (not...often...nor usually in this fandom) that I can read through but I just find most of them weird. Nobody's genitalia tastes sweet and is a favourite flavour. Sorry not happening. And spontaneous sex while not having showered in days or longer isn't that awesome -especially if it involves oral sex. And gushing amazing orgasm every time - nope. And then for the ladies not getting up to clean up after!? Uti waiting to happen.

I prefer that description over something wildly out of place for the tone or characters... it all depends on context. I don't read a ton of smut, though, so it's not like I'm really the target audience.
