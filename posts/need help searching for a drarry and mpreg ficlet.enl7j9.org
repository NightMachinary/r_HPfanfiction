:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
i need help finding a fic and i don't recall anything in the beginning honestly. but it's basically harry becoming a single dad with draco's child (i guess they had a relationship during the war) and he becomes pregnant after it. harry and draco i assume broke things off and harry went into hiding as a muggle who wears glamours and goes by the name of james evans i think (after the war he gives birth to a baby boy named something like 'orion james') alright, skip 11 years into the future and orion or whatever he is named gets his hogwarts letter. harry knows that orion might be a wizard because draco and himself are but i don't think he has told his kid that. shortly after orion begins hogwarts for his first year he gets sorted into slytherin. and literally every kid hates him because they think he's a muggle-born by the name of orion james evans and slytherin apparently has never had a muggle-born student before. so after orion gets teased harry is contacted by the headmistress, minerva, and has a meeting with her and orion's head of house, draco. so after meeting and having a cryptic chat with draco about stuff, harry talks with minnie and draco in private about the whole bullying situation. then, he takes off his glamours and reveals that he is harry potter shocking both minnie and draco. he then tells draco that orion is his son and whatnot.

and that's it... but there's also a sequel where harry invites draco over for christmas so he can get to know his son. although i didn't read that.
