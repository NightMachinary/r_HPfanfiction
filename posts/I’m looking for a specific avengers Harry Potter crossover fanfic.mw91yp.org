:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember it being where Harry Was either Loki's son or grandson and Harry found out when he was around 5-8 but he did not go and live with Loki but Loki did start taking an active roll in parenting despite the Dursley's I don't remember all the details but James Potter was not his biological father and I remember Harry telling Remus and Sirius about that near the end there was also a scene where Dumbledore let Pettigrew escape and Harry yelled at him in front of the school it's was a fairly long fic

If anyone has any idea what this fic is plz let me know
