Hello everyone, I'm Amity333. I've recently written a Ron Weasley-centric one shot called "Masks".

Summary: /Ten-year-old Ron has been having the worst nightmares. He wouldn't leave Fred's side for weeks after the first. Perhaps that was better, when he'd thought them just dreams. After all, who would believe he'd fought this war twice?/

I hope you guys enjoy! Here are the links: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13695419/1/Masks][FFN]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26415094][AO3]]
