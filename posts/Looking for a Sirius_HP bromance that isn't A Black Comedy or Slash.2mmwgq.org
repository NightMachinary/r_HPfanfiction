** But, but.. A Black Comedy! D: It's so good you can just re-read it over and over, and you'll never need anything else!

** Hmmm there's some time travel one where Harry and Sirius are the only ones to go back in town. It's very loose and fun.

So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

**** Even though they're not strictly bromance, include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4929285/2/Fortune-Favours-the-Damned][Fortune Favors the Damned]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9080018/1/Disbelief][Disbelief]] though it's more Harry-centric, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]].

This [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Black/93203/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/][C2]] has some good "Sirius raises Harry fics."

You might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3639659/1/A-Bad-Week-at-the-Wizengamot][A Bad Week at the Wizengamot]] as well. Someone else recommended "Oh God Not Again," and that would fit your request as well.
