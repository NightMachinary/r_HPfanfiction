I'm trying to find a fix I read a long while back, but don't remember the title of. At some point Bill becomes Harry's guardian, and then I think he dies and is replaced by Mad-eye, who maybe all dies. Thanks for the help


** Is it a really REALLY long H/Hr fic? Because I am almost positive you are talking about Harry Potter and the Fifth Element.

*** Bill didn't become Harry's guardian in bungle in the jungle. Harry's just tagging along for the summer, after the obligatory mass betrayal. It was a fun fic, I liked the 2nd person narration quite a lot. Does anyone know if there's something else good written in this style in the Fandom?
