Any fic where Harry and Draco both go to Durmstrang and get along. I'd prefer one pretty plot focused that also explores Durmstrang school life. There can others who are in Hogwarts in canon that also go to Durmstrang or it can be just Harry and Draco. I like longer fic. Incomplete is ok as long as its not like on a huge cliffhanger

Idk if this exists but I'd love if it did.
