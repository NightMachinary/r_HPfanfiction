So, if im looking at archieveofyourown.org, then there are mostly one-shots and on ff.net barely any James/Lily stories and even then still one-shots or few chapters. I want to know if there are Fics that are longer (more than 3 chapter atleast). I like to read about the (sexual) tension between those two and how they deal with it. One-shots arent bad in any way, but they are (despite the tension) to short. I would accept a BIG One-shot, but preferably a multichapter fic for better reading.


** The pairing is actually a spoiler for this story, but I've no idea how else to do this - linkao3(287109). Dark, horror. A sort-of recreation of the Stanford prison experiment.

  It was all in the name of tolerance. It was all in the name of understanding. It was not supposed to happen this way.

** There's one where its Harry/Waifu (don't remember the name) and sometimes Harry/Waifu/Daphne, but its also his two oldest kids M/F (don't remember if its James and Lily tho.) It might be somewhat similar to what you want even if its different names for the kids... its called "HP and the Family Vacations" . Quite smutty tho.
