Really curious if there are any. I read a Black lagoon cross over, I'm not sure if that counts as ''ghetto''


** Now when you say ghetto, do you mean poor Harry?

Or do you mean straight up crips VS bloods ghetto Harry who brings a gun to Hogwarts, gets into turf wars with the other houses, and does drive by shootings via broom?

*** Either really.

Now that you mentioned the second option... that would be a really awesome crackfic.

** I read a muggle!AU once where Harry lived with Vernon, but he was constantly out on the streets. The Weasleys ran a bakery and Voldemort was head of some organized crime group. Harry used to run drugs for him but then he got accepted into this fancy private school. I can't remember if it was slash or not, but I'll link it if I can find it.
