:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
for the life of me i cannot recall the title of the story or name of the author. contains some spoilers for the story by necessity.

​

from what i recall, it reveals that in terms of muggleborn rights, Britain is actually rather liberal. that the muggleborns who get it into their heads to flee to the americas for a better life either wind up dead or enslaved.

​

the old colonial powers still rule in the wizarding world, with the Spanish and French Empires being the most powerful (and most mentioned) powers outside of Britain.

​

it also involves an invasion of europe by a south american revolutionary and his followers who wind up largely running around and slaughtering anyone and everyone they encounter. and a Roman Catholic Church who has a presence in the wizarding world.

​

from what i recall of the church, Snape made a deal with them to protect Narcissa, who's killed anyway, and the Cardinal in charge of all things magical makes him a priest as an apology. and by the end of the story, Snape is said Cardinal's successor.

​

i also have the vague idea of Andromeda Tonks/Black being Harry's lover in this story, though i might be confusing that with another story by the same author.


** It's the same story: linkffn(A True Daughter of the Black By Ynyr)
