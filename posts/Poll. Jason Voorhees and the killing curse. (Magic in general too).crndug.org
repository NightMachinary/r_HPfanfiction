So me and a coworker were discussing mostly as a joke at first if whether or not Jason Voorhees could die by a killing curse. Then it grew into what magic could affect him at all. Maybe the killing curse wouldn't work because of his deadite ressurection? Then I made the joke that he was a horcrux created by his unknowingly squib mom who had enough magic from the Necronomicon and ressurected her son even possibly her decapted head as said horcrux as its never actually destroyed in the films.

It's a silly idea that I've turned into a fic that I'm writing and he's beta reading. I thought I'd get the community's opinion though.

So for those TDLR:

Would the following happen if Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th came to the wizarding world:

Would a killing curse kill him?

Would a killing curse not kill him but other magic still affect him? Portkeys, immoblie spells, boggarts, dementors?

Or would no magic affect him and they'd have to find an alternate route to killing him?

I'd love to hear your Guy's opinions and I apologize for the length.


** Jason isn't a Deadite. The Deadites are from Evil Dead

He's affected by Freddy's powers in Freddy Vs Jason and Tinas in part 7 so a Boggart and a Dementor would both probably remind him of his bullying and drowning. And possibly(depending on continuity) witnessing Alice kill Pamela

*** I didn't even think of the Freddy affecting him part. So yeah that's a good point. It's a theory he's a deadite because the book from evil dead is found in the voorhees house as a reference in part 9. But canonically he's not I get that.
