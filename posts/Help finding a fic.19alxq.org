I remember when I first starting branching out in my reading from Harry/Ginny, I ran across one called "The Machine" where Harry is betrayed by everyone, ends up learning a lot, the usual betrayal kind of fic. It was fairly cliche, but I do remember enjoying it and since then I haven't been able to find it. If anyone could help me find it I'd appreciate it.
