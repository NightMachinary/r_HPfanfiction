I just finished this, and it definitely makes in into my top five favorite fics ever. Flawless characterization, complex arcs, and an abundance of Slytherin pride all combine to make this a really awesome thing. Also, the writing quality is well above average, which is an important plus.

Just a really cool, really well-written fic that I think deserves a spot on the most-recced list.

linkffn(The Changeling)


** Seconded, especially on the writing quality front. She makes third-person present narration seem effortless, and it all flows oh so smoothly. This Ginny was much more complex than her canon self, yet still true to the latter despite the AU.

  The thing about war is that it never ends. Not really. The battlefields just change locations. Harry and Ginny after the war. Sequel to The Changeling. First story in the Armistice Series. Harry/Ginny.

** This is why I love this sub, I wouldn't have read it otherwise, and now I couldn't sleep until 6 AM reading this story. Somehow, Harry/Ginny pairing is very appealing, although normally I am not into it, and even Ginny's OC friends are amazingly written. I've got to the beginning of 7th year in one go, it's truly a great fic, thank you!

*** Well, they're all pretty different from each other, and not necessarily in order, but here goes:

1. HPMOR. I know it gets a lot of hate, but it was well-written, complex, and interesting.

2. linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts) is one of the few often-recommended fics that I actually believe deserves the attention. Such amazing characterization, and it was beautifully dark.

3. A gem I stumbled on was linkffn(An Interview With Justin FinchFletchley) that gave a really cool insight on the war effort and was a surprisingly captivating read.

4. linkao3(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know; Yet I Live and I Love) was an exploration of the relationship between Luna and Snape, and it managed to make Snape sympathetic without excusing his actions. Also, this is one of the few characterizations of Luna I've read that are even a little bit correct.

...and the rest are mostly ship fics.

This author has written a bunch of other stuff, so I'd suggest checking that out too.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

**** Thank you!! I also enjoy HPMOR....it's one of the few fics I get something different out of every reread. I haven't read any of the others, I can't wait! Have you read the Anguis series by Slide? It reminds me of Changeling in some ways.

EDIT: The first one is Latet Anguis in Herba, the second one is Shade to Shade, which is where the author really hits their stride. First one can be hard to get into initially because it's all OCs. linkffn(2233473) and linkffn(3353818)

** Thank you so much for this recommendation. I was looking for something like this for a long time, so beautifully written and how every time something happens to Ginny she grows more compassionate and understanding with the people around her. That takes a strength that I think is often overlooked in the real world. I love it.
