Most likely sounds stupid, but after coming upon so many Fics where Harry or other characters are twirling their wand before or during a fight. I'd like to see it taken to a ridiculous extent where Harry becomes obsessed with Wand tricks during the long summer months, and stumbles upon some drum stick tricks.

To the point where people in the Great Hall, or fighting him in a duel, look at him and wonder if he's gone insane.


** That actually sounds like a potentially fun concept. Plus, bonus points if it turns out that the wand tricks genuinely help in dueling/combat.

*** Wand-spinning to fight with style. Plus, you know can throw spell behind you without actually turning around.

**** Right? Im imagine him twirling a wand like that pen spinning video, stunning spells flying every which way with perfect aim.

*** Yeah, like Tommy Lee has this one move he's well known for where he twirls his drumstick in circles between his fingers really quickly, and he was big during the late 80s early 90s. I'd like to see that adapted to fire off spells in every direction very quickly. Just an example.

** I mean it would definitely throw people off their game plus cause doubt on where the spell would end up.

** I read a fic a minute ago where spinning your wand was a way to build up magic for powerful spells it was pretty weird

*** How does that make sense?

The magic itself doesn't come from the wand in *any* world (otherwise, there are no muggles), and spinning it would take extra concentration whilst providing the least amount of skin contact.

** I remember seeing one a while back where Harry spun his wand in his fingers when he needed to be ready to throw spells in an instant because of he's spinning it around /its already in his hand/. Sort of makes sense actually.
