  Harry never had friends, so he imagined one: a red haired girl he kept forgetting to name. Ginny imagined a shy boy with untidy hair and bright eyes, who knew nothing of magic so she told him. He dreamt of a world of magic and of a girl who wanted to be his friend. She dreamt of a boy who loved to hear her voice, no matter what. Then dreams become reality as Harry met Ginny.

*** They meet when Harry goes to visit his grandmother with Petunia and Dudley. I only read the first 2 or 3 chapters and that is when they went to his grandmother. I think they moved there to his grandmother if i remember it correctly.
