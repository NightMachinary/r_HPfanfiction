There are some stories where Harry has a brother, who is the boy who lived, where his parents end up leaving him in the Dursleys or Lily and James are negligent and abusive. His brother is a prat. And Harry end in Slytherin or never go to Hogwarts.

But I need to see something different.

There are stories where Lily and James are negligent but with Harry's brother always helping him? Or where one of the parents is not evil and his brother help Harry or rescue him? Something like that.

I need something different from the typical story wbwl or dark Harry. If you have read something please say it in the comments.
