******* I wonder why, though. Why don't you like it? Is it because it's an overused trope? Is it too cliche? Is it too unrealistic? I mean, sure, Harry becoming both Lords at once can be a little unrealistic depending on how you do it. I think it would be interesting if Sirius emancipated Harry in his will, making him Lord Potter immediately and the Black heir apparent second. Harry's Lord Potter ring will be on his forefinger while his Black signet ring sits on his pinky finger or middle finger if he has more family rings to wear. However, as the Blacks are more wildly known and I believe higher in status than the Potters, it would make sense for Harry to immediately inherit the title to use to his advantage. However, as heir apparent, Harry could place someone as a regent, probably either Andromeda (since she's not in Dumbledore's clutches) or Remus. This could be a plot point for Harry to get to know his family and for Harry to break away from Dumbledore's influence (if you're going to point out the man's misdeeds towards Harry, that is).

******** I personally dislike it both because it is an overused trope and because it is a very good indicator of the quality of the story. I have read maybe half a dozen good stories that had Lord Potter-Black (though I can't remember any other than crack that had more titles than that) but they are very very few compared to all the stories that have used it and been crap.

The importance of Lordships is also an okay indicator of story quality generally. I find, if the kids are introducing themselves/are introduced as 'Heir Malfoy/Black/Potter/Longbottom' then I am already nearly certain that it's going to be unoriginal and averagely written at best. On a personal note I also prefer worldbuilding that moves away from the whole concept of Lordships.

House Rings are afaik fanon that I personally don't really like for a similar reason that I don't like fics that go into any detail about house elves, they never take it far enough. In the case of rings, either it's just a gaudy ring that isn't really relevant because if the lordship was actually important anyone who mattered would already know who you are or it's a magical ring that appears on your finger and sometimes has a bunch of features in which case I would love to see the magic in the worldbuilding reflect that you can just make things appear on someone's person somehow.

I also don't really recall any fics where Harry is emancipated going anywhere interesting (setting aside whether Sirius even has the legal standing or ability to emancipate Harry) but I have a feeling I have read one or two that actually did use emancipation to good effect.

********* I do agree that most of the Lord Potter-Black fics are poor and that they're basically word-vomited versions of other fics. Realistically, in the day to day, being a lord isn't going to be all too important because only sixty or so individuals are lords or ladies out of like 10,000 witches and wizards. However, it's just extra political clout and influence that a person has. No one is going to bow down to anyone or anything but the bowing of respect is only going to be used in a political arena.

As for the rings, I merely like the idea of people having them as a support of their family. Obviously, the Head of House ring will show who is the Head of House and therefore has the most power, but the only extra bits I'm going to add is that it has an extra protection function (a strong shield that'll protect the Head of House from most spells, except for Unforgivables, for a few hits), disappears into the family's vault if the person in question dies, and has the ability to become invisible so they're not easily stolen. Also, you bet the Black ring is going to have a curse on it for non-Black members who tries to steal Lordship as the ring has to accept the family magicks in the person and identifies who is the Head of House. There are some also little tidbits that I haven't thought up yet, but the rings are important in both the political aspects and for the ancient magicks.

There are also the signet rings, as well. The family is going to wear them, as well as allies. Harry will wear the Longbottom signet ring because his House is allied with the Longbottoms, and Neville will do the same. Harry, if he's not Lord Black but the heir apparent, will also wear the Black signet ring. I'll have Andromeda, Tonks Sr, and Tonks wear the signet rings as they're Harry's family and are related to the Blacks, and I'll have Remus wear them as the Black Regent. They also happen to have a protection shield in them.

There's also the fact that all of the rings can be used to seal letters, therefore making them more official than simply signing your name, and the fact that I'm going to have some magic shit happen with it that'll make whatever written super important and can bypass wards and whatever.

I'm simply going to have Sirius do a blood/magic adoption on Harry (either as a baby or some time after his jail break) so he can name Harry as his heir and there will be no chance for someone to undermine his authority, and I'll also have Sirius have Harry emancipation upon his death or the reading of the will. Harry will basically use the emancipation to not only get rid of the Dursleys, but to also become the Head of House of his families. As Sirius never had a trial, he's not a convict to the goblins and the goblins can't close or seize his assets or whatever it's called. Harry will be able to come and go to the castle as he sees fit since he's an adult, and he'll also be able to participate in the Wizengamot and other things. I've read a bunch of good fics where Harry's emancipated but I can't really recall any of them other than linkffn(Taking Control) if I think it was called.

I also like how linkffn(Can't Have It Both Ways) does the emancipation.

********** The fact that it can be done really well doesn't really matter.

I'll explain it like this: I once had the /brilliant/ idea of putting a song I really liked as an alarm clock. A year later and I changed it for the default sound.

The damage was done, I could no longer enjoy that song. Every single time I heard it /for two-three years/ after I stopped using it for the alarm, I would feel a /jolt/. And a burst of annoyance.

It was completely unconscious.

The same thing happens with overused tropes. No matter how much I like a trope. The fact that I've seen it done so many times, usually badly... it just /jolts/ me every time I see it. I can still push on and read the story, but I am way less forgiving than usual and I probably won't enjoy it all that much. Unless it's done /really/ well.

******** I personally dislike it because of how convoluted and unreasonable it is. First of all, no matter the blood relations, no serious politician, not even blood purists like Lucius would actually consider a teenager's opinion in matters of state.

Second, private citizens don't have the power to emancipate minors (in any part of the world) even if they are their legal guardians, it is a long process judged by a bunch of people to see if it fits into very specific situations -and the earliest it could happen in most countries is around 16/15.

Third, lordship is a medieval concept that was used to denominate people with control of vast amounts of land and that had almost complete autonomy over it, up-to and including being able to create new laws, define their own coinage/metric units and setting taxes for the people who lived under the Lord's authority and protection. The lords by the way were only beholden to their liege who was the one to give them authority over the land and the king. When the states were formed and land was unified under a government and then latter with the Glorious Revolution the position of Lord had its powers passed to the government and became more or less just a club of rich people (don't live at UK, so if someone does and I got it wrong, please say so). I have yet to see the system being well translated into the fandom, either at the earliest stages where it had some real power or at the latest where it didn't, and it quite frankly annoys the hell out of me.

And then fourth, the fact that the title thing is played mostly for a good power-wank while having little to no disadvantages, which is against petty much every real politic mechanics ever.

********* I could argue the emancipation by the fact that they tried Harry as an adult for performing magic in front of a Muggle (in front of the whole Wizengamot which is only used for trials against adults), and he was also kind of recognized as an adult when his name came out of the Goblet of Fire (in which only those of age could participate in), by both Ludo Bagman (a Ministry worker), as well as Albus Dumbledore (Grand Sorcerer, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, and Supreme Mugwump, head of the International Confederation of Wizards). I'm not saying any of this is accurate or anything, but that's just my view on it. The Wizarding world works differently than the Muggle world. Lordships turned from what you mentioned to simply a fancy title.

** Seventh year. Harry turns 17 in the summer before seventh year, making him an adult in the wizarding world, and therefore it would make sense for him to be able to inherit things at that point in time. And a young adult conducting politics is much more palatable than a kid.

Obviously it would have to take place in a substantial AU.

I personally think third year is an under-utilised starting point for an Indy!harry style story. In canon this is when he learns his first piece of truly impressive magic, and the year before he faced the basilisk. Expand on that, have him take the Sirius threat more seriously in a productive way. This is early enough in the series that you can take some liberties with the story without having to sidestep a bunch of already established canon.

First of all, what exactly do you consider an "Independent!Harry" to be? Why do you want to use that trope?

The trope itself doesn't make much sense from the canon's perspective. What exactly is Harry being independent from? The Dursleys? I guess, but who else? The way this trope usually works is by bashing the characters and creating situations (using bashing) that make Harry "Independent".

Who exactly is he seeking independence from?

The Weasleys, well Mrs Weasley can be very pushy and victim blaming Sirius would be an instant "get out of this house" moment if we are being honest.

Also, the Order seems rather ineffective all things considered, and after their dementor guard failed, Harry could distrust them by default. And anyone defending their questionable tactics would look bad to Harry if you want to go down that route.

For example, Harry Potter loves Mrs Weasley. He never had any sort of familiar affection is his life, and then here comes Mrs Weasley with her infinite heart. It's impossible not to care about her.

If Mrs Weasley were to /somehow/ bad mouth Sirius (which I also find /extremely/ unlikely, I don't think she lacks that much empathy, what with having so many children), Harry would never kick her out. Rather, he would be the one to leave.

And even if the Order is ineffectual, it's all he has. Where else would he go? And since this is after 5th year, Voldemort is a constant threat to Harry's continued survival. He has a much better chance of trying to reform the faulty methods of The Order, than trying to live outside of it.

Yes, but there's an easy way to resolve that while staying true to canon events. Remember how in CoS, after he's rescued, Molly threatens her twins with bars before their windows? An abused child, which Harry is in canon, would not take kindly to his rescuers being threatened with some of the abuse he went through himself. Molly also alludes that she was about to pick Harry up herself (they had not met before, Molly had no rights or anything to him) because she was worried about him. And yet, afterwards all she does is send some cake, despite him pleading for food. The correct option for any adult would have been to get the authorities involved, a good prosecutor would make a case that Mrs Weasley was assisting the Dursleys with their abuse (a starved kid should not have the same diet as a clinically obese one).

Giving an abused child that kind of false hope is unforgivable IMO. Had she not said those lines before, perfectly fine. Just some friend's mum who isn't involved much. But she claims responsibility, she claims that there's reason to be worried, and yet does nothing.

Because Rowling wrote the typical "abused orphan" trope common to older British books but did not write the consequences of abuse. Hell, Rowling wrote a lot of stuff without considering the consequences, such as the Weasley twins selling rape drugs in their joke shop. Or Romilda Vane attempting to rape Harry with those love potions and facing exactly 0 consequences for it. Or that what she wrote as Malfoy's clumsy attempts at assassination is a long list of war crimes.

******** Yeah, JKR wrote a bunch of non-sensical facts.

But taking them and trying to /make/ them make sense? Well it just results in OOC characters.

Did she miss-wrote how abuse would affect Harry? Maybe. Or maybe the abuse was not as bad as most people think, or his magic protected him, or whatever. There are a lot of ways to rationalise it.

Fact is, his past is not important to the main story. His character is what it is. If you want to make his past matter, then you have to write the story from the very beginning. But most of these Independent!Harry stories don't start at the beginning, they start in 4th or 5th year.

That means that, unless you are willing to write an extensive AU background for Harry, you /have/ to use canon Harry as a base, regardless if canon Harry himself made sense. You have to use his non-sensical self if you don't want to run into blatant continuity and logic errors that can completely take out a reader from the story.

You /can't/ have Harry just start cursing Mrs Weasley out of nowhere in book 5/6. Why? Because in book 5/6 Harry /didn't/ start cursing Mrs Weasley. You can change small things; give him /a bit/ more resolve. Make him chose something different when he was presented with two choices and then show the butterfly fly effect it has. You can change the actions of characters that aren't well developed.

But changing the actions of /developed/ character /so much/ is just bad writing and it breaks suspension of disbelief.

Now, if you /want/ to change the established characters majorly, then what you need is an AU. And an AU story starting from the middle requires an AU back-story. A more abused/affected Harry wouldn't have made the choices that canon Harry made. The events would play out differently and they would probably have a major butterfly effect on the way the characters interact.

Cursing her, no. But Harry siding with Sirius and not batting an eye when Sirius throws her out for being victim blamed for his 12 years in Azkaban requires maybe a page worth of changes (basically a "you dare" dialogue from Sirius which convinces Harry). That is the kind of small change you asked about, but its consequences are big. Or simply have someone adopt Harry and therefore show him that action was possible and Mrs Weasley was full of empty words in CoS.

Honestly, there is not much which would change. The Pettigrew arc would play out as it did since Harry wanted Pettigrew to be kissed (he was only concerned about blood on Sirius' hands, not about Pettigrew's fate). Maybe some more resentment towards Lupin and Snape for enabling that mess. Same for year 4, there's not a whole lot he can do since he did not realise the plot underfoot.

Honestly, the biggest change a more realistic abuse approach would result in would be a Harry who is more wary of others and who cannot forgive as much as canon Harry. So Malfoy does not get rescued if a similar scenario arose, Ron isn't accepted back as quickly if at all, Harry's position to Marietta might be a tad less polite, but the overall sentiment would still be the same. He would never trust McG after her failures in year 1 (not believing them) and 2 (not sorting out the Chamber), same goes for most other adults. The bit about Lupin using the Potter's death in PoA would make him look very bad once Harry learns that Lupin knew about the animagus form and the willow yet said nothing.

If you have to, I'd go with fifth year. Harry is old enough to actually act somewhat smart without it being /too/ unrealistic. Maybe after the trial like Junior Inquisitor did - there are /way/ too many fics involving goblins, renegade death eaters or House Greengrass, having Harry allied with the Ministry would honestly be a breath of fresh air for the most stagnant, cliched trope in the HP fandom.

If heavy canon divergence wasn't so weirdly frowned upon, I'd suggest a seventh year where Dumbledore lives. 17-18 is where the majority of people start looking around more and forming proper political opinions, and it would present a decent way to make him independant without using extremely overused crutches like betrayal, goblins and Daphne Greengrass.

That being said, as you've probably noticed, I absolutely loathe the trope, so my advice might not be accurate for your target audience.

** I intend to write a fic where Harry meets Sirius instead of getting on the Knight Bus before the third year. Harry will get to know his heritage and his responsibilities in the wizarding world after he becomes of age. Other than that, most people write fics after Sirius is dead and Harry gets a letter from Gringotts about the will. I also intend to write a fic like that. Most people hate fics like that because they're cliche, but personally, if it's written well, I don't mind.

** I think end of 5th year is the most logical breaking-away-from-Dumbledore point in the books.

He's just finished a full year of alienation courtesy of Dumbledore:

- At the end of the 4th book is the first time it's categorically stated that Dumbledore insists he goes back to his relatives. His friends don't tell him anything over the summer, at what he learns is Dumbledore's orders. Meanwhile, they are spending time with Harry's godfather, whom Dumbledore is keeping him away from.
- Dumbledore is avoiding him, not even looking at him. He does nothing about the rampant libel against Harry (not that he really could, as he is being libelled as well, but to Harry he's left out to dry with nobody in his corner).
- Dumbledore insists Harry be trained in Occlumency by the teacher who hates him most. When he objects, Dumbledore puts the onus on Harry to modify his behavior to put up with an adult who treats him like shit.
- Neither Dumbledore nor McGonagall does anything to protect him from Umbridge. Again, he's left out to dry, told merely to "keep his head down." He even gets "banned for life" from Quidditch. (Can a school administrator even do that?)

Then, the ministry fiasco, in which his godfather --- his last chance at a home/family away from the Dursleys --- is killed in front of him. What does Dumbledore do?

- Send him to the headmaster's office to wait for him (promised to be "in half an hour"), and not to the hospital wing to have his injuries seen to.
- He gets a guilt-trip from the portraits while waiting
- LOCKED IN by Dumbledore until he has "had his say," which includes more guilt-tripping, weak justifications for "an old man's mistakes" that include his shitty upbringing with the Dursleys (which, by the way, will be CONTINUING), absolute bullshit that he's lied to and mislead him because "he loved him too much," and the weak excuse that he made the worst possible 5th-year boy into a prefect because Harry already had too much responsibility (that he never knew about and so couldn't take into account when considering that slap in the face).

God, I'm not even Harry and I'm getting all pissed off just typing this. So yeah, my Harry would walk away from that a Dumbledore-hater.

** Another good breaking-away point, although it doesn't allow for full independence, is at the end of third year. What a lot of people gloss over is that Harry has already run away from the Dursleys two years in a row: first when the twins and Ron came to get him, and then after blowing up Marge. He knows for a fact that the Dursleys are not going to be happy to see him again, and this time it's going to be even worse because of the Marge incident.

There's nothing for him at the Dursleys except escalation of their abuse.

He's just had somebody offer him a loving home.

And he has the loyalty of a house elf who can take, if not him, at least letters to Sirius. If he can convince Sirius --- who, let's face it, does not have his full mental faculties right now and might be easily swayed --- they can BOTH go to that tropical island or whatever.

** Another reason that end of 5th year is the perfect breaking-away point, is that now that he's taken his OWLs he can drop out of Hogwarts while retaining his wand rights.
