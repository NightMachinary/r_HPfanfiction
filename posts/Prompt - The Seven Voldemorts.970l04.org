Has anyone done a mashup of all the horcrux possessed in one story?

Like a Harrymort ala 7th Horcrux + Ginnymort and others? The whole gang ends up possessed. Each ends up a blend of the characteristics of the object, voldie at the time the crux was created, and their original character traits. Ginny ends up basically a red headed Bellatrix (violent and crushing on Harry). Luna gets the ring: "I see dead people" and some other twisted odd predisposition (violence towards magical creatures both real and imagined perhaps). Ron with the locket - constantly jealous of the other morts... can't think up a name and then decides to call himself Lord Roonil Wazlib. Harrymort tricks an innocent Hermione into wearing the diadem and later regrets it because she ends up too damn smart and constantly snarky. Likewise they acquire Hufflepuff's cup and trick Neville into drinking from it regularly. He joins their coven but ends up staying a pushover. Then they all stage an intervention with the resurrected Voldemort given his obvious self sabotaging behavior and force him into changing his appearance and take the role of DADA professor, whence they all live happily ever after (and take over the world).

** I think it would be cool to see a full exploration of seven separate Voldemorts running around due to Horcrux possession. There are at least a couple fics where Sirius is possessed, or fics where a horcrux works against Voldemort (i.e. many Harry-centric fics, but also fics that use Neville a la Black Comedy). DP&SW also has something similar, where the Diary!Voldemort is alive separately from real!Voldemort, and other characters are convinced that Harry+Lord Slytherin are more Voldemort clones, and I could see it being interesting if it was dialed up to 11 (or rather 7).

I think forcing it to be just the main characters above is kinda limited

Also if there were seven Voldemorts, they'd all know to distrust each other and would likely be working to backstab each other to achieve their own goals/dominance

** linkffn(Lily and the Art of being Sisyphus) has Ginnymort vs Harrymort as the plot for the CoS equivelant.

linkffn(Horror of our Love) has 3 voldemorts running around (locket, diary, and the original). Warning though, it's slash with a pretty lack-luster harry.

I've read a bunch of tomarrys with two voldemorts going against each other. One being the sane younger version and one being the older version. Although linkffn(Butterfly Heart by the Fictionist) has two insane Voldemorts running around.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  AU. Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal inspired. After recent events in his life, Hermione refers Harry to the renowned psychiatrist, Doctor T. Riddle. He is unlike anything Harry ever expected or imagined, and soon proves to be a great help against the very shadows and name that haunts his waking hours. If only it remained that simple.

This one has Voldemort possess some adults with various Horcruxes and have them take on the characteristics of the respective founders the objects belonged to (if I remember correctly, Neville's parents and Gilderoy Lockhart are three of the people possessed).

** linkffn(Souls Abound by robst) is a rather bad take on this idea. White Squirrel of /Arithmancer/ fame tried his hand at rewriting it but gave up at Chapter 4 --- the drafts are being released as part of Squirrel's linkffn(Scribble Pad by White Squirrel).

In my story linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor), we're definitely /headed/ there... sort of. [[/spoiler][The Ring and the Locket Horcruxes have become incarnated into statues, and the Goblet has merged with the Sorting Hat. The Diary and the main Voldie are currently imprisoned and dormant.]]

  This story came from an idea of there being more than one version of Voldemort running around, due to his horcruxes being activated. Story begins with the Tom - Harry confrontation in the Chamber of Secrets. H/Hr

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.
