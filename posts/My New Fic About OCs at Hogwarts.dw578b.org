Hi there,

I'm working on a new fic about mostly original characters and their lives as students at Hogwarts. This story takes place after the Second Wizarding War. What I want mainly out of this story is to allow readers to further explore Hogwarts, that comfy student life we all love, and Quidditch. This is one of my first endeavors so I'd appreciate any feedback, desires, or suggestions!

I'd also love your input on how often you think a fic should be updated. My current intent is at least 1 chapter a month but will more likely be 2 or 3.

​

Thank you!

** It's not bad, the writing flows pretty well and it seems mildly interesting. I'd update kinda frequently at least initially to get the viewer count up. Good luck!
