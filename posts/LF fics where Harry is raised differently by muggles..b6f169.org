The title says it all. I'm looking for fics where Harry is raised different by muggles. He isn't abused, verbally or emotionally or physically, but instead grows up as a healthy young boy full of questions, as 11 years old are supposed to be. One good example of such a fic is 'the dogfather au' series on ao3. I would prefer if his muggle upbringing lets him have a different outlook/perspective on the magical world, like using logic against some of the nonsensical wizarding traditions/rules. And also if he doesn't hide or suppress his intelligence like in canon. Again these are all preferences. The main thing that I want is, he is raised by muggles and isn't abused.

One more thing, please don't suggest Methods of Rationality. I tried it out. Didn't like it. So anything other than that, feel free to comment below.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Keith Brackwood was disillusioned with the wizarding world. So he, like many other muggleborns, returned to the muggle world and after taking his A-levels and finishing university he took a position at a small primary school in Little Whinging. He couldn't have foreseen how this decision would influence the fate of the savior of Wizarding Britain. Child Harry fic.
