Hello everyone! Hope everyone is staying safe and doing well!

I'm looking for this one Severus/Hermione fanfic, and damn it, I can't find it and it's driving me nuts! Now I have to find it out of principle!

I can't remember the title or author, but it was one of my favorites, only a few chapters long but really beautifully written. If anyone knows this one, that would be great, because I'm freaking hunting it now. No laughing at my ship, you hear?! I sail this ship!!!!

Brief summary of the content:

It's AU and post Hogwarts, and Hermione/Severus are dating (if not engaged, don't remember). Harry is a bit unstable and believes that Snape is still guilty even after being exonerated, so he asks Hermione take an unbreakable vow, and she does so without knowing what she's going to do as a favor to Harry because she trusts him. With the vow, he forces her to find evidence that Snape is doing some criminal activity of some sort and the details of vow forces her to not allow her to let anyone know about the vow, and so she has to investigate Snape and find some evidence of guilt or she'll die. She searches through his diary/journal and finds "evidence" that he's brewing potions to (if I remember right) glamour or dissolve the dark mark for exonerate death eaters so they can live normal lives. She's forced to present the evidence to Harry, which lands Snape in prison. She has to appear before the Wizengamot to tell the evidence to make him guilty, but once the vow releases her, she's able to turn the tables around and free Severus, while also telling everyone what Harry forced her to do.

There it is! Does anyone know this story? It was a clever plot line, short and gripping! Anyone recognize it?
