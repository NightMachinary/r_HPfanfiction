One the fics that I'm following is a time travel fic, with an unconventional setup. Sirius after falling through the veil, meets up with someone with the inixplicable ability to teleport, and he proposes warping back, ending up at the lake at the end of PoA, with the teleportee joining him. Is there any fics where the time traveler has a limited scope of Knowledge in which to capitalize on? Or if the time traveler is shot back to a point where they have to work fairly hard to salvage their situation, given future knowledge?
