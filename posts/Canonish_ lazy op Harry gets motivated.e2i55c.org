I am searching fics with lazy potentially op! Harry or canon too many insecurities to be op Harry, that receives some motivation to be better at start of story.

From little Luna:

" Luna ran away in tears when she saw the article, too fast for him to catch her.

Right then, Harry resolved that he would become more powerful. Magically, monetarily, politically, socially, he was going to get stronger. Because he needed to protect Luna.

And Skeeter? That insect was going to pay for what she'd done to his little Luna. He was going to enjoy destroying her when the time came.

"


** linkffn(Forging the Sword) is based on the premise of Harry (and Ron and Hermione) getingt serious starting the end of second year after Ginny dies in the chamber
