I've been working on a new fanfiction these last few weeks since i've had a break from work. Now i've only been pre- planning the plot line but i would like some suggestions as to what you guys would like to read, (or something that hasn't been done in other fanfics that you'd like to see.) and also i want your opinion on if i should in later chapters i should write them to have one or two kids, i have names picked out for both but i'm not sure if they should have two or one. Please if you have any help wih these or anything you'd like to see feel free to send me a message or even comment. I can work anything into this particular story line i've been working on! Like i said my plot line can fit just about anything in it, i feel like all the bellamione fanfics out there are too similar in one way or another and i just want to know what the readers would like to see.


** Definitely two kids. Otherwise, I'd like to see a "good" Bella with a plausible explanation for her past actions and subsequent reformation (for example, forced to participate by Rodolphus, then driven insane by Azkaban. As for the reformation, I dunno... Narcissa manages to find her a cure somehow?)

EDIT: And please, no time travel
