Looking for any good stories with a good amount of Harry and Luna. I do not care what the story is about or has in it, send it over if Luna is a major or big character in it.


** Protection from Nargles ( linkffn(7352166) ) is probably my favourite straight Harry/Luna romance fic, it's adorable and features one of the best takes on Luna Lovegood I've ever seen in fanfiction. It's a shame the sequel is abandoned, but what's there is really good.

Accidental Animagus ( linkao3(14078862) ) isn't a romance-fic as such, but it is a very well-written AU fic - Harry turns into a cat-animagus via accidental magic in a bid to run away from the Dursleys, ends up getting adopted by the Grangers. The Harry/Luna aspect shows up during and after Year 4.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.
