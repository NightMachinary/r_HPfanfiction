Hey guys, I'm looking for a story I read a long time ago (pretty sure on fanfiction.net) where Lily's father was really sick and she was exhausted dealing with all the people that had come over; she was trying to wash dishes and take out the garbage and stuff when suddenly James pops by with groceries.

I think this might just be too vague, so I would be truly amazed if someone knows what I'm talking about! I just really wanted to re-read this, because I remember it being so sweet.

Thank you.
