I am looking for relatively self contained adventure stories similar to the first HP books. In terms of fanfics i liked the plot with Nevilles parents in linkffn(Becoming Neville), linkffn(the strange disappearing of Sally-Anne perks) or the pet murder case in linkffn(They didn‘t know we were seeds), but couldnt get into linkffn(Forest of valbone). Thanks in advance

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** I can offer you my mystery adventure "Dawn of Darkness". It's a sixth year divergence which has one station of canon (Slughorn's Christmas party) before abandoning the canon plot altogether.

The first few chapters are romantic fluff while things happen in the background (presented via newspapers or a few paragraphs in another scene). The story progresses and soon Harry is stuck in the middle of something he doesn't understand and therefore tries to figure out what is going on. It takes place all over Europe, so there are plenty of OCs and non canon (but real) places to fill the gap.

  When Harry invited Tonks to Slughorn's Christmas Party, he never expected to stumble into a relationship with his friend. Nor did he expect to be engulfed by a web of deceit and intrigues woven across Europe.
