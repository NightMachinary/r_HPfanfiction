*** Thanks! Didn't take me that long to make it, just browsed through some old threads and added my own comments. I'm mainly looking for things I missed / how other people read or download.

** Maybe add in [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spicymango.fanfictionreader&hl=en][Fanfiction Reader]] app for Android possibly? This is what I've used for the past year and a half and never had an issue with it. I don't think it has as many functions compared to the official app, but it's quick and easy to download fics with the fic id and read on the go.\\
Everything else looks fine to me. Short, organized, and to the point.

** For Kindle users, [[http://fanfictiondownloader.net/webversion_kindle.php][FanfictionDownloader.net]] has a convert and email to Kindle feature on its page.

And the downloadable program (Windows, Mac, Linux) works on [[http://fanfictiondownloader.net/archives.php][multiple archives]] and converts to many formats.

There's also a browser extension/app that I've been able to use for password-protected sites, GrabMyBooks.com.
