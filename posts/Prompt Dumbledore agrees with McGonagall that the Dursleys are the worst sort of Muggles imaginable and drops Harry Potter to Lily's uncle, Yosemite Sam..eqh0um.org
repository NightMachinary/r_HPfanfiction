There are virtually no Harry Potter/ Looney Toons crossover.


** There's an unfortunately-dead story where infant fem!Harry crawled into a TV (via Accidental Magic) and was subsequently adopted by Roger and Jessica Rabbit.

When she attended Hogwarts, there were Looney-Toons-style shenanigans including Toon!Fem!Harry getting lost inside the Sorting Hat and Hermione having to pull her out (along with several other things, including a grenade which ash-faced half the Slytherins after Hermione panicked and threw it).

Sadly, I can't remember the name of the story, but IIRC, it was about seven chapters long.
