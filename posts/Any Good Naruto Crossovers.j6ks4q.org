Besides Harry Potter, Naruto is the fandom that I read the most fics of so I'm wondering if anyone knows some good HP x Naruto crossovers. I don't care if it's the HP characters going into the Naruto universe or vice versa. No SI/OC as the main character, please. Slash, gen and het are all fine.

For reference, I really liked linkffn(2573257); it's great even though it's just a collection of cracky scenes.


** In progress crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12584637/1/A-Ninja-Summoned][/A Ninja Summoned/]]

Harry, through a powerful case of accidental magic fleeing the Dursleys, transports himself to the the elemental nations, and is summoned when his name is placed in the Goblet of Fire. Features Harry in a relationship with a gender-swapped Naruto. It's still being written, but hasn't been updated since January

Mind you, this fanfic features a particular flavor of Manipulative Idiot Dumbledore. He wants to control Harry, and despite him very obviously being much older than he expected(due to a time differential between the two dimensions), he keeps trying to treat Harry like the 14-year-old child he expects to see, rather than the 21+ year old man that he is. In fact, it seems like a LOT of characters act like this.

EDIT

What the hell? Who's downvoting me?

*** Thank you! I'm not a fan of manipulative Dumbledore. Does he play a big role?

**** I guess so? He does have a fairly prominent role, but not nearly as prominent as most of the other characters.

** Try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus.]]

That is just HP, but you need to read a little bit of that first to be able to understand the absurdity and characterization of Lily/Harry/Eleanor in the other fic in that universe, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15685944/chapters/36445827][Minato Namikaze and the Destroyer of Worlds]]

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1358167/chapters/2836114][Wild Child]] is a very interesting read. Jiraiya comes across a young Harry living in the forest. Technically abandoned and unfinished, but it works as a one-shot if you go into the work with that mindset. Hope you enjoy!

  In which the Master of Death finds himself reborn and Jiraiya get's confirmation of what he's always known; he has no idea what to do with a kid. Good thing this one came self-sufficient. (MoD and reborn Harry) DISCONTINUED
