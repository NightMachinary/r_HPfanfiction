So, House elves are freed when they accept clothes from their owners, and when Hermione started SPEW, the elves that look after Gryffindor wouldn't tidy up in case they accidentally picked up her knitting. It didn't say that she was putting little tags on them saying "for you, house elves!" so it's implied that just picking up the hat or socks is enough to free them.

Given that, who washes the students clothes? Of anything you would want magical houseworkers to do, surely getting the clothes clean is one of the bigger jobs?

Who do /you/ think does the laundry at Hogwarts? And if you think it's the house elves, how tdo they get around this prohibition against clothes?

The clothes aren't theirs and Dumbledore isn't tossing them clothes.

They didn't clean it because they found the hidden clothes to be insulting as they didn't like clothes.

Canon suggests - or maybe Dobby tells us - Hermione couldn't have freed them anyway given that she wasn't their master.

** I like the interpretation that Dobby tricked Lucius into releasing him. Releasing an elf simply requires the symbolic act and intent. When Dobby grabbed the sock, he pretended he was free, which caused Lucius to believe he accidentally freed Dobby. Dobby, being fae, took this belief and used it to slip his bounds.

** Dobby explains to Harry that the Hogwarts elves felt "insulted" by the Hats. Not threatened. Given that Hermione should have no authority over Hogwarts elves anyway, it seems like nobody except Hermione thought that any elf would be freed by them. The elves probably saw it either as an attempt to fire them from a prestigious home, or as a statement of "I would fire you if I could".

It seems most likely to me that the normal elf must be explicitly given clothes /for themselves/. Given how Kreacher hangs up Harry's cloak, they can handle clothing as lon/ as it's clear that the clothing is still their master's.

Dobby was an extreme case who was desperate for any excuse to leave the Malfoys.

** HP magic is very much based on intent and symbology. As such, each of those little hats or socks is infused with Hermione's intent to free the elves. This is different to the dirty clothes that everyone else leaves out, which are not intended to change ownership.

What happened with with Dobby is that Lucius threw away a sock that Harry had intended to free Dobby. As Dobby also wanted to be free, and caught the sock, the intent made it so.

It's the difference between saying "I want you to wash and clean all the laundry before putting it away." and handing them clothes before saying "Take these, and get them cleaned." In one you could possibly see a temporary change in ownership, and in the other it's clear that at no point do the clothes change ownership.

** My interpretation is that Hermione's scheme wouldn't have worked. It was just the principle of the matter that offended the House Elves, hence they stopped cleaning the tower:

#+begin_quote
  “Winky is still drinking lots, sir,” he said sadly, his enormous round green eyes, large as tennis balls, downcast. “She still does not care for clothes, Harry Potter. Nor do the other house-elves. None of them will clean Gryffindor Tower any more, not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere, they finds them insulting, sir. [...]”
#+end_quote

Hence, I think the House Elves do the laundry, and they also tidy up clothes, whenever they /aren't/ left lying around with the intention to free them.

** It's the elves. Unfortunately, Hermione's SPEW efforts with the hats are an example of Rowling's poor worldbuilding. If an elf simply picking up an item of clothing is enough to free them, anyone could free anybody's elf. We know that the elves are aware of what goes on in the school, so they know Hermione is trying to free them. According to the Harry Potter Fandom wiki, the reason they stop cleaning Gryffindor tower is because the elves felt insulted by Hermione's efforts, not out of fear of becoming free.

If the article of clothing has to be given to an elf by their master/mistress /without/ orders to clean it/iron it/ mend it/ whatever, to count as freeing them, this raises a question - for the school elves, who exactly is their master? Is it the Headmaster or Headmistress of the day, or the school as an institution?
