I'm looking for this fic.these are the things I remember.this is going To be big

1.Harry runs away from the Dursleys and lives on a streets with two other kids a girl and a boy who is little older than harry 2. Harry knows he can do magic and uses that to perform street magic to earn a living and support his friends 3. It turns out the girl is a witch and Harry disguises himself as an elder brother of the girl to send her to Hogwarts 4. Turns out the girl is related to Snape and is also the heir to ravenclaw 5. Harry also goes back to Dursley and kills Vernon 6. Harry also keeps an eye out for his friend in Hogwarts and during the end of 2nd year he saves the girl and Ginny from the basilisk and kills it and doesn't Take credit for it. So everyone assumes Harry's friend killed the basilisk 7. There is also a part towards the end where the twins and lee spray everyone with hippogriff pheromone and Harry saves his friend and others from rampaging hippogriffs

So does any of this ring any bells?
