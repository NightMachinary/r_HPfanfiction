Hey guys i'm lookin for some fics where Harry is paired with the obviously OC daughter of Bellatrix Lestrange.\\
The child can be either from Rodolphus or Voldemort, i don't care.\\
I don't care also about the personality of the girl (She can be dark, she can be evil, or good or depressed, anything is fine.\\
I would like the fic to be somewhat long (If you have something completed it would be awesome)\\
But i want something well written (I tried to read two, that were awful, one of them the girl was fine, but the relationship with Harry was bad developed, and thre was also a very bad plot of marrying Harry to her, to unite the light side with the dark to face Grindelwald and their Nazi Wizards.\\
So i want something good.)\\
-No FemHarry.\\
-I usually don't like bashing, but i think that would be hard to find something like this without bashing, so i'm ok with it.

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING: All in the other ones that i've read, Harry is just dumb and useless and the girl solves everything alone, basically a Mary-Sue, so i don't want anything like this.

That's it !
