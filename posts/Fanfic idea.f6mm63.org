Okay so i have been reading fanfiction for a bit now but i don't write it myself. I saw this instagram post today with an AU idea and i would love it if some of you talented fanfic writers would make this in an actual story. Here is the idea: Hermione is hunted by death eaters. She doesn't want to put Harry in danger because of her. So she made the decision to obliviate Harry and remove his memories of her and their relationship and go far away to keep him save. But such powerful love can't let the spell destroy all the memories. Harry feels awful, like someone took a piece of his soul from him, but he can't understand what's wrong. Wait.... But who is that girl he sees in his dreams? So that's the idea, but i think the story could also be told the other way around, so like Harry obliviates Hermione instead. Either way would be good. I really hope some fanfic writers see this and want to try and write a story about it!
