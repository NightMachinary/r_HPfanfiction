I'm looking for a story where harry potter has several powers. One is that he can create cat girls. The first cat girl is made from a kitten maybe a kneazle. Another power is that he can trade knowledge for aging someone. For example one kitten girl gets memory's of going to school for 5 years and she ages 5 years.


** I think that's not a story, but [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/devils-bargain-a-harry-potter-worm-cross.3507/][a NSFW Quest on QQ]]
