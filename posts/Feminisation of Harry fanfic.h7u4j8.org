** Feminisation? I assume you mean a Fem!Harry fic. I don't remember too many, but I've heard a lot of praise for linkffn(Victoria Potter), though I haven't read it myself.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/][*/Victoria Potter/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/883762/Taure][/Taure/]]

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

*** Thanks, I'll probably give this a shot but Fem!Harry isn't what I mean. I mean where Harry as a guy starts become more feminine, whether it's just how he dresses or his body or if it's forced or not idm.

**** Oh. Well, I remember reading one where Harry finds out that his name was entered into the Goblet as a student of the Salem Witches' Academy and he and the twins make a potion or something that changes his body into a girl's. If you haven't read it, I'll see if I can find it.
