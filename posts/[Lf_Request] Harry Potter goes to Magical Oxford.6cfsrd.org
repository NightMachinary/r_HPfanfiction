Based on the recent discussion post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6bd9jy/discussion_hogwarts_and_oxford/][here]] I thought this would be a great read

*Example:*

#+begin_quote
  The University of Oxford has had a long association with Hogwarts, occasionally offering higher-level magical education, but primarily as a means of furthering one's mundane education after graduating Hogwarts as well as for seeking magical apprenticeships. Though it operates separately since the SoS and offers no classes these days, the Oxford College of Magic remains the premier British academic association for higher-level magical scholars, provides help for recent Hogwarts graduates searching for apprenticeships, and aides in publication of mastery research.

** Ooh! That's my post! I've been quoted!

If anyone wants to use that idea in their fic feel free to do so. I'd be eager to read it as well. If I ever get around to writing my own fic (I've got ideas and notes aplenty but keep putting it off) I'll be sure to include this at least as a bit of world building if not a centerpiece.
