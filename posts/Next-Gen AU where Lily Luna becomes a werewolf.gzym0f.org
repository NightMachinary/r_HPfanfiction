I read this /ages/ ago on Fictionhunt (...I think? It was a site with a black dog's paw as its logo). All I remember about it was that the story where Lily Luna becomes a werewolf was either the second or third story in a series that followed the Potter children. I think Albus Severus was a Gryffindor in it as well (this was written in, like, 2013-2014, so years before The Cursed Child), and Teddy Lupin may have been an auror...I don't know about that last part for sure, though.

Any help with finding this story is much appreciated! And thank you in advance!


** I only made it through the first book, but is it gryffin_duck's Albus Potter series? I think it starts with Albus Potter and the Secrets Within.
