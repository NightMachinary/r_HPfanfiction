lol. I kinda headcanon the Goblins having their claws in all sorts of stuff like that. And anyone that seriously calls them out on it, especially publicly, just has an accident.

***** Maybe:

1. (This invokes a Warp-inspired source for magic). Most magical particles are unstable in our dimension. Spellbeams are visible because the spell itself sheds particles that decay as it travels (the beam is more like a trail of smoke from a fireball than the spell itself). Large concentrations of ambient magic (which is relatively low-energy, its EM-spectrum decay products are below the visible range) result in relatively loud background radiation in the radio spectrum. Mundane radios (which would have been the first electronics brought to Hogwarts for decades) don't work because they're effectively sitting in the middle of a powerful random-noise generator. Particularly sensitive electronics will not work, or even short out. Sufficiently robust electronics work fine though (definitely anything that modern militaries use will be fine, they're generally aimed at surviving EMPS, probably a lot of modern civilian tech will be fine too, especially if it's in a Faraday cage or something)
2. Some combination of wards screws with radios specifically (for example, some forgotten ward to stop EM-radiation-based offensive spells also happens to stop radio (for example, perhaps some wizards figured out a spell that generates a microwave beam at the frequency that heats water, effectively cooking the targets alive, and the spell stops all below-visible-frequency radiation from entering the grounds (which would also make them a bit colder, you lose out on infrared coming in)).
3. Some combination of wards screws with abiological electricity in general (perhaps created to defend against an army of lightning elementals or something).

** That actually can sense, for a mildly dystopian reason:

1. The SoS allows heads of governments and required officers thereof to be informed of the magical world.
2. When the SoS was created, there were tons of political entities that were poorer, less populated, and less temporally powerful than today's megacorps (the many pieces that would be united into Germany a couple of centuries later, for example).
3. As an unintended result, the SoS treats mega corps as both countries and the personal property (because of how archaic wordings, laws, and assumptions are applied) of the largest stakeholders , board, officers, CEO, etc, and requires them to be informed of magic.
4. Megacorps, being megacorps, immediately head straight for the untapped markets.
5. Because many of the people from point 3 are on the boards of many companies, this trickles into many other companies, too, which by the archaic assumptions of the SoS, are treated like extensions of the mega corp and are included.
6. As a result, muggle megacorps slowly and then very suddenly flooded into magical markets over the last few decades of the 20th century.
7. Point 6 is being used as the conspiracy-theory excuse by the 'pureblood cause' for their actions.
8. Millenial and later Muggleborns end up fighting on two fronts - "evil megacorps" and "magical neonazis" at once.

** Reminds me of a story whose name I forget where Rupert Murdoch owns The Daily Prophet (and, IIRC, most of Australia's magical establishment). I don't remember if Murdoch was muggleborn in the story, though.

  When a Magical game of Truth & Dare goes wrong, the Gryffindor Quidditch team must 'bare' up and face the consequences. And as the news spreads like wildfire in mmail things get quite out of control.
