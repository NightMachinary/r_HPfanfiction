:END:
So the basic premise is that a character, IIRC hermione, accidentally has her consciousness sent back in time. She is a passive observer. And her awareness is fleeting. I think it's a mystery.

Sorry. I know it's not much information to go on.

Edit: to add to this. So I definitely remember that it began with Hermione (I think it was hermione) after the war as an auror or maybe unspeakable getting caught up in an accident involving tracy Davis or maybe daphne performing an illegal ritual.


** I think linkffn(9950232) "Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation" by Robin.Drew is what you mean. HG's consciousness is thrown back in time by a failed ritual but apart from a few occasions her younger self is in control of her body. She investigates the murder of Madam Pomfrey. It was Peter Pettigrew

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr
