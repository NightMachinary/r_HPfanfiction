#+TITLE: It was a stupid mistake. He shouldn't of made it but that stupid Potter brat had gotten on his last nerve and in his blind anger Severus made a mistake, adding the wrong ingredient to his Impairment Elixir. It blew up in his face and now, he couldn't tell the difference between faces nor voices.

He was going to throttle Potter for causing this. He soon found him, he could hear the arrogant brat now. He may not have recognized his voice but he could recognize that arrogance, that insufferableness, Potter's voice could be recognized no matter what for it as he plotted some stupid scheme, probably to get his Snakes in trouble as always.

​

"Detention Mister Potter! and fifty points from Gryffindor for being a brat!"

​

He stalked off, completely unaware he'd just left a thoroughly bewildered Draco Malfoy in his wake. Perhaps he'd go award random points to Lucius's son for something, that might cheer him up. Ah, and he could hear the boy coming down the stairs now... He had no idea of the worldview destroying shock he'd get when his senses returned to him,

​

TL;DR: Snape screws up a potion making it impossible for him to tell the difference between faces and voices, so he can only identify students by unique clothing, colour and importantly, tone of voice. Due to this and his prejudiced way of thinking against Harry, he keeps getting Harry and Draco mixed up.


** Interesting prompt, although I'm pretty sure Snape definitely knows Draco's an arrogant twat.

**** They don't have to be mutually exclusive. He could think both are arrogant.

Most of the school thinks Harry is arrogant in GOF & I can't exactly blame them for thinking that.

He defeats Voldemort (with help) & a basilisk (with help), then he's the /4th/ champion in the /Triwizard/ Tournament?

From their perspective he must seem like a glory hound with no respect for the rules.

*** True, but Snape doesn't give a damn.

Snape gives Draco unending favoritism--the narration notes that Malfoy is the only student Snape seems to like as early as /Sorcerer's Stone./

Granted, Malfoy made it into N.E.W.T. level Potions, which means he would have gotten an O, so there's at least a little justification in the classroom.

But we also see Snape repeatedly go out of his way not to punish Malfoy, even when it would be deserved--the incident in GoF where Malfoy jinxes Hermione when the spell ricochets and he gets off scot-free comes to mind.

**** I'm willing to give Snape's treatment of Malfoy, and to a lesser extent Harry, a pass due to Snape's extracurricular activities. Doesn't excuse his treatment of Gryffindors otherwise, obviously, but yeah.

** Ernie Macmillan let out a huff of relief as the bell went, he truly hated potions. No, hated the teacher for potions.

Gathering the last of his things into his bag he swept a few low hanging tufts of blond hair from his face before leaving, casting a pitiful look at the Gryffindor's who were begging to line up outside the room, look as miserable as he had upon arriving.

Well, he would be, Snape and slytherin? Ouch...

/not my problem anymore/ he reasoned as he hoisted his bag further up his shoulder.

Or would have, had he had a bag.

A brief confused blink later and he realised he'd packed up then just walked away-/leaving his bag/

/good one Ernie/ he thought through gritted teeth before turning on a heel and pelting back into the classroom, easily identifying his bag as the sole one left-

“Malfoy!”

Ernie jumped and nearly crashed into the table at the sudden bark. He whirled round to find Professor Snape stalking towards him.

“E-Er sir-”

“How many times do I have to remind you Mr Malfoy-it seems despite having the second best grades in your year you still fail to remember to cast a simple silencing charm when...self-pleasuring.”

/what/

“For Merlins sake don't /sulk/ Draco-it's bad enough you came to me about your ridiculous crush on the potter boy, hearing your dorm mates repeating ‘/oh Harry, Yes Harry, faster Harry/' isn't exactly a holiday for me either! I would rather be /Obliviated/ then remember Mr Nott's detailed explanation of your nightly /vocal operas/ involving Harry Potter /drilling you in the arse/ with his /ten inch dick/ Yes Draco-I hope you are uncomfortable!-because I do NOT want to have to say this again! /USE SILENCING CHARMS!/ Now, got to your seat. Oh, and try /not/ to ogle Potter when he goes for supplies.”

At some point Snape strode off muttering about hormonal teenagers but Ernie could do nothing but stand there, gaping.

Was this a joke?

The bell ringing snapped him out of his trance and he staggered from the shrill noise, turning to find both men previously mentioned making their way into the room along throngs of other students. Potter, flanked by Granger and Weasley moved with subdued dread while Malfoy came strutting in and , oh-Yes /yes/ his eyes flicked to Potter's arse-oh Merlin it was real-

“Ernie?” Weasley's voice called and he turned to find the man staring at him.

“Your bags in my desk mate, do you mind-”

Grabbing his bag Ernie hightailed it out of the potions classroom and down the hall.

He was going to need a visit to the kitchens and a /lot/ of chocolate to deal with this...

And maybe a good cry...

** So a *prosopagnosic* /(unable to recognize the faces of familiar people)/ and *phonagnosic* /(unable to recognize the voices of familiar people)/ Snape? That's a very interesting and unique concept, I haven't really heard of this one. I'd love to see a fic written for this, prosopagnosia isn't very common in literature (in fact, I've only ever read one book that had a character, specifically one of the main ones, with this condition), and phonagnosia is a fairly new condition that has only been recently identified and researched.
