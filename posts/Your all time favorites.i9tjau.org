Hello everyone! So in this type of request there are absolutely no restrictions!

It can be on any site, it can be old or new, completed or not, anyone can be the main character, can be any length, it can be dark, light, in between, or something else.

It can be popular, not as popular, or anything else. There can be character bashing, non character bashing, creature inheritance, not, or anything at all.

It can focus on world building, it can be character driven, the pairings can be a main thing or a minor thing, or not there, it can be absolutely anything, as long as they are your all time favorites.

Feel free to list as many as you'd like!

** Honestly, this is too broad; everyone has their own subjective preferences. Inviting as many fics as people want only compounds the issue. You're basically asking for links to the entirety of FFN and AO3.

That said, I'll offer just one, based on having reread it more times than any other: Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. I really enjoy how Harry's focus, on his second time around, is to build up his friendships and prepare his precious people to survive what's coming; supporting Hermione in her desire to excel, showing Neville that he's valued and trusted, including Ginny and Luna from day one. No matter how weak or strong the protagonist is, people are always interesting.

The main weaknesses of the story are that it's a bit old and so uses tropes that have since become more cliched (but they were fresher at the time), and that its characterisation of Draco and Severus can be a bit one-dimensional. Part of that may stem from having started before Deathly Hallows came along to (at least partially) redeem Severus. And it's incomplete. Although the author continues to assure readers that it's not abandoned, and indeed he did publish chapter 43 last year after a long hiatus, so I continue to hope.
