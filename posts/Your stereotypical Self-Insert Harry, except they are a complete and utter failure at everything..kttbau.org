So your stereotypical Self-Insert becomes Harry except it all falls apart - they aren't good at magic; cannot remember spells or wand movements; are really bad at flirting and scare of any girl they are interested in; are a terrible friend and so ruin any friendships they develop; and do badly in life-or-death situations (possibly to the point where they accidentally get themselves killed).

Maybe it could also be that they assume some of the fanon tropes like Lordships, being rich, Weasley Bashing etc are canon for this world except they aren't and they end up looking like a nutjob and a bully.

** "Twenty points from Gryffindor for you atrocious headwear, Mr. Potter," Snape drawled, gazing with a mixture of bemused contempt at the Potter whelp's new headwear.

"Yes Sir," said Harry, running his fingers nervously along the brim of his tall pointed hat. Presently, on of the paper stars that had been glued to it fell off, and gently drifted to the floor.

Snape raised an eyebrow, "What in the devil is it, anyway, Potter?"

"It's my wizard's hat, sir."

It did make a sort of sense, Snape mused. The Potter child was almost comedically inept. Every potion he'd made since the first year had exploded in some tremendous way, or sometimes more worryingly, done nothing at all. The previous year's attempt at brewing Infelix Felicis, the bad luck potion, had resulted in a substance that seemed by every metric and test to be common tap water, if one excepted for it's alarming green colour. That had actually been rather a lucky break for the brat, as Snape had made the boy drink his failure. Potter had actually, now that Snape considered it, failed not just completely, but /spectacularly/ at every test he'd been put to. From what Snape understood, when Potter had been confronted with a troll in his first year he'd attempted the old "look over there!" routine, and then knocked himself out running into a wall trying to escape. It's was only the troll's ear-bursting laughter that had summoned the faculty in time to rescue the boy. His now infamous attempt to stop Quirrell from attaining the Philosopher's stone had resulted in third degree burns after Potter had /failed to notice a wall of flames/ and walked directly through it. He'd only been successful in that venture because he'd inadvertently stumbled into Quirrell and set the man alight as well. Second year had yielded food poisoning after a failed attempt at using Polyjuice potion, and a Basilisk who had died after choking on poor professor Lockhart, while Potter lay stunned in the ladies restroom. Potter had even failed to capture Sirius Black after the dog had literally dragged Potter's cohort away. Snape was especially displeased by that development, as Black had gone on to somehow prove himself innocent of a crime the entire world /knew/ he'd committed. And now here the boy was, a fourth year student, wearing /that./

Snape sighed, "Why have you written wizard on it, Potter?"

The boy blushed a deep red, "I'm rather afraid people will forget, sir."

Snape considered this for a moment. It would be so easy to say nothing. So. Easy. But it would be too cruel, even for him. "You've misspelled 'wizard,' Potter. There is a single 'Z' in 'wizard.' Your hat, in fact, proclaims you to be a 'wizzard.'"

It could be worse, he could've put an 'h' after the 'w' too.

** I vaguely remember a story written as part of a compilation on ff.net. I think he only rarely interacted with the main cast and was only friend by name with one person, Hermione. He ended up going along for the battle at the DoM and lost his wand arm or something. He faded out completely from the story after that.

** Mine would go something like this:

Okay so...

I had plans. Big plans. I knew that Voldemort would rise again, that the Wizarding World would be dragged into a conflict that would kill a huge number of people and that I had knowledge that could potentially alter the outcome of the war.

If anybody believed me. Or listened to me. Or did something other than call me a 'mudblood' every other fucking sentence when I wasn't in school.

I had it all planned out. The Orphanage I was in had a typewriter that hadn't been seriously used in 20 years. I'd typed out what I remembered, had a game plan ready to go for year one... And promptly forgot all about it the second I entered Hogwarts.

I blame magic. It's hard, nonsensical, convoluted... And the most amazing thing I ever studied. Like, take computer programming, that feeling you get when that shitty little browser script you started on GitHub is finally developed into a full blown program? Take that and times it by a thousand.

I no longer had to wonder why I got put in Ravenclaw. I lived that stuff. After class, I was in study group. After study group, supervised practicals. After practicals, safety lectures. And after that, we hit the library to relax. I would wake up and go for a run before hitting the Great Hall for breakfast, run back up, shower, change into the uniform and start classes, all day, every day. I had never been in such good shape. I had never studied as hard as I did then.

Time passed. Year one was over before I could blink. How Potter and the wonder kids managed to sink more than five minutes a week into the Flamel bollocks is a topic of intense debate for me and some of my friends.

I spent year two in the library. I would feel bad for the petrified people, but my grades were more important to me than some giant snake.

Hermione caught up pretty quickly in year three, but I couldn't resist humming Doctor Who under my breath when she brought it up outside the library.

Year four was uneventful. I finally got to talk to people in French and German again, but apart from that I was too busy pre-prepping for the OWLs.

Year five was fun. I mean yeah, Harry's DA classes were nice, but it wasn't anything I hadn't seen before. I was too busy getting into tetragrammatics and industrial potions making to care much about Umbridge and her goons. It wasn't like she even knew where our dorm was anyway, the idiot.

And then exam time! I didn't do quite as well as I wanted, but I crushed my favourite subjects, so I was happy overall.

Year six was exciting. NEWTS prep began as soon as we got back and I got into numerology computing by accident. Did you know divination and statistics can predict each other's outcomes? I sure didn't until me and a couple of others tried it.

Bummer about Dumbledore, but I was sure he was enjoying his own SI adventure somewhere.

I spent year seven and a considerable amount of study time hopping around Wizarding enclaves across Europe with the other muggleborn the Order of the Phoenix smuggled out before the Ministry fell. I met Dudley and a number of other relatives I didn't know existed. Socialised. Made some money selling potions. Fun times.

Then I was back in time for year 8. Hogwarts was kind of destroyed, but the Library was still there. Aced my NEWTS. Took a contract mass-producing potions for the Weasley twin-who-lived and used that to start a workshop specialising in magical manufacturing.

Overall, did I actually do anything? No. Intervention had no guarantee of success and what little I remembered wouldn't have really made a difference to the outcome. Maybe a few less dead people, but most likely a lot more. I mean, my go-to solution for a disturbingly large number of problems was to throw artillery at it until it ceased being a problem. Great for dealing with Death Eaters, not so great when you want to keep property values appreciating.

Besides, magic is janky as hell. It doesn't get any better with experience either. I had to work non stop for seven years to get the basics down, which is all that's covered at Hogwarts. I am now back on my first deathday and I'm still spending hours a day researching and studying stuff Riddle mastered in year four. I shudder to think how far behind I would be if I'd gone haring off after the Golden Trio.

All in all, everything worked out and I didn't die. I count that as a win.

*** It would probably be a fun one shot, but there is a limit of how incompetent a main character can be before I rage quit. Like, reading about an SI that isn't good at magic while knowing all the things that are going to happen, so having to become creative to somehow survive I could see being fun. Seeing a SI being incompetent at everything he does to the point of dying is just sad.
