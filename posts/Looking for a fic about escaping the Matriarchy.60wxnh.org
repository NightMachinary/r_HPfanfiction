If I remember right, Riddle had a girlfriend and the girlfriend was supposed to get him under control of the matriarchy and he found out and killed her. He tell this story to Harry at some point. It might be a trilogy or something similar. Thanks!!

Think the bot is slow atm, so I'm just giving the link. But yeah it has a matriarchal society, riddle tells him the story during Harry's second year. Personally not to my taste, but each to their own.
