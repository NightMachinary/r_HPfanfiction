Maybe Ron and Harry didn't realize that they had locked the troll in the same bathroom as Hermione, in time. Maybe they hadn't gotten to her in time, maybe they were seriously hurt by the troll and couldn't do anything to save her.

What would have happened? Would Dumbledore be forced to step down as Headmaster? Would Quirrell had been able to get the Stone? Would the Ministry have stepped in, sooner?

Go crazy with the idea.

Just please, if you decide to write a fanfic, on fanfiction.net or another site, please post your chapter so we can read it!


** Now, this is in no way shape or form a recommendation for the abomination that is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/2/For-Love-of-Magic]] , but it does indeed have Hermione dying from the troll. I've seen a few other fics who did this, but I'm afraid I don't remember them and "Hermione gets crushed by a troll club" is probably not a proper category of fanfiction (although I'm sure it's a tag on Ao3 where tags are at least 5 words long...).

*** So, I actually searched ao3 for that and the first hit was Hermione/troll.

I stopped looking after that.

  When Hagrid arrives at the Potter cottage in Godric's Hollow, he finds no sign of Harry Potter. It takes five long years for Harry to be found, in the care of a distant cousin, having been dropped off by his Great Grand Mother.

** There's linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) where she is grievously injured and the damage suffered by her brain leaves her with a speech impediment. She survives though and leaves Hogwarts, studying magic through private tutors.

In this story, Harry never attended Hogwarts. It was Ron and Neville who went looking for her but arrived too late. Dumbledore wasn't fired for this incident but the events in the next few years force him to resign.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** My bigger question is why didn't she get in more trouble “for releasing the troll”. It could have seriously hurt someone. The Halloween feast was ruined. Like Hagrid got expelled for releasing the “monster”. (Even though it was actually riddle and a basilisk).
