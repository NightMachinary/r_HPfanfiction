So, I wrote the first chapter to an ongoing HP story and posted it. However, looking back, I think I was way too hasty and didn't think it through. My original version of the story would've been much easier to write and less AU and muddled.

Is it completely ridiculous for me as the author to delete the story (even though it already has reviews) and repost it after changing the plot back to the original version? Should I just say that I scrapped this story and went somewhere else with it???

I'm really face palming about rushing it so much..

** You're the author do what you want in the end you write fanfiction because you want to. Nobody else should have a say unless you want them to.

** I would keep it up and when you start posting the corrected story, post a chapter 2 to the old story directing folks to the new story. And then delete the old story after a week or two so everyone who keeps up with their email and who followed the original story gets the notification. you don't want to lose interested readers in the maelstrom of FFNet.

** in this case deleting it and posting some sort of disclaimer in your profile would be more than enough to be "polite" to the people who read it before but don´t fret about it, it´s your fanfic you shouldn´t feel forced to continue something you´re not entirely happy.

** I did the same, rewrote an entire story 7 chapters in (each chapter was 12,000 words). Many didn't mind that the story suddenly changed, in fact, they seemed to enjoy re-reading the story again and commented on how my writing had improved.

I didn't delete chapters, just rewrote over them. Some comments are deprecated, though. I had a reader comment asking when that happened and we had a jolly good time talking about it.

** I think it's more acceptable to rewrite the story, than to delete it. Some authors keep the old story for historical reasons, and then publish the new story next to it.

Deletions are easier to accept before it becomes popular, before too many people reads it.

** I say delete it if you want. If someone asks you why you did it, tell them why. It's your prerogative.

** You can leave the old one up, but edit the description to say that it's outdated and you're writing/rewriting a new version. Once you've posted a few chapters of the new version, you can check through the list of people who'd followed the old one and message them that the story has updated, but under a different name and is slightly different.
