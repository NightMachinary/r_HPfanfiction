Mine is Lord!Harry/Neglected WBWL Harry and Haphne (Harry Potter/Daphne Greengrass).


** 6th year Harry gets his shit together and starts taking the war seriously. Usually I like it even more if he starts distancing himself from Ron and Hermione when they ignore his warnings about Malfoy.

For pairing it's usually an older girl that assists him. Tonks, Fleur, even the rare Katie Bell.

*** That's one of the biggest problems I have with HBP. Harry's godfather just died. He learned that he's prophesized to kill a man with almost 60 years of experience on him. A man who has delved into the darkest of arts, the most arcane magic. And he spends the year worrying about Ginny.

**** What would you do though? As a sixteen-year-old who never had a much of a life? As a sixteen-year-old who just saw your godfather die, right about a year after you saw a respected friend die when both of whom were much better wizards than you? When you are told it is a game of tag between you and the scariest mf out there and he has five more lives while you are on your last?

I probably would just decide to have fun for once while I try to get better. Especially if Dumbledore gives me his approval by not doing anything change my magical education, focusing on history instead.

** My favourite pairing would be Harry/ Daphne, and Slytherin Harry for the trope, just to have another view of this house where being sorted there is not an offense grave enough to deserve death.

â€‹

PS: now that I think about it, I just prefer to see Harry with a Slytherin (just to offer another point of view than the Weasley's one), and this character happen to be recognisable enough that people know what to expect (girl, Harry's age, Slytherin and Pureblood), while being a quasi blank slate that can be used to pretty much any character (from the beautiful but bigoted girl, to the forgetable one that somehow get the MC's attention).

*** Slytherin Harry would be pretty high up on my list if it weren't for the fact that I prefer third year onwards fics to first and second simply because you can't have romance in the first two years. If I'd ever seen a fic which starts off later but has him in Slytherin, I think I'd enjoy that.

I've actually gotten quite used to the common representation of Daphne as the "Slytherin Ice Queen". I keep forgetting that's not actually canon.

** My favourite trope is Mad Scientist!Lily or Powerhouse!Lily. There's so much potential to do stuff with her character if one takes the interpretation that she invented a ritual powered by her sacrifice. Canon tells us that she was intelligent, so it's easy to take that to a whole new level.

My favourite pairing is HP/f!TR, though I've enjoyed f!HP/TR on occasion, as well.

**** Two fics that come to mind for Lily are !linkffn(Mary Potter) and !linkffn(To Reach Without). The latter fic has her going toe to toe with an entire Death Eater raiding party at one point.

There are unfortunately few HP/f!TR fics, though !linkffn(Power is Control) and !linkffn(The Advantages of Being Sane) are both good, and I'm writing a fic of my own, !linkffn(Departure from the Diary). Good f!HP/TR is extremely rare, though !linkao3(The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles) is very good

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

**** Sadly JacobApples is the only one who hit that mark that I've found.

Also sadly (or maybe not depending) with Harry/Andy you'll mostly find smut. The most fleshed out, complete, and lengthy of these stories is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1108914][Inheritance]] . It's a crazy harem with a harry/lily incest focus so it surely won't be for everyone.

There is a decent fix where they are close friends. linkffn(3717364)

Then I do remember one where they enter into a relationship but it's a massive harem (non-smut). There are so many ladies who enter into this harem that it does have some time between Harry/Andromeda but not much outside of the Marquee women. linkffn(12842617)

I am just really holding out hope JacobApples decides to finish up Found in the Ashes. He's been slow on the updates of it that it may just fall by the wayside.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

** Favorite trope/plot overall is kid-raising fics. Favorite pairing is Sev/Lily.

Those are generally mutually incompatible -- while I have seen fics portraying both (in AUs starting with Lily surviving the Voldemort attack), I generally don't find them that good. IMO, the best kid-raising fics does not make a good LESS even if possibly applicable, and vice versa. Possibly related to my opinions on the best eras for the trope and ship respectively -- the era I've liked the most for kid-raising is postwar (first if Harry, second otherwise), while the era I've liked the most with LESS is Marauder-era.
