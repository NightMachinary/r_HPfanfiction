People keep complaining about Hermione being a Mary Sue in fic, but I've personally never read one - which is odd because I almost exclusively read Hermione-centric fics. Where are you guys finding all of these stories? How is everyone running into them by accident when I can't seem to find any despite actively looking?

Edit: Also, how do you define Mary Sue Hermione? People just say "perfect" but that seems really vague.


** I'm not one of those people on here since I don't read Hermione ships, but I do notice that Ron bashing fics tend to treat her like the perfect friend to Harry in slash. She's so happy to find out Harry is gay/bi, but not that big ol homophobe, Ron, who who has to share the same dormitory as Harry.

*** Ironically, bashing fics and slash fics aren't fics that I have too much experience with either. I'm a fan of character studies, so bashing feels like a waste of time. And I veer towards femslash, so I haven't been in the slash circles either.

It's getting really obvious why I don't know any Mary Sue Hermione fics lol. They seem to have everything else I try to avoid.

No wonder you haven't found mary sue fics. You aren't actually reading any fics at all!

Everyone knows that femslash is a myth.

  Hermione has just been brutally tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange. Luna has just spent months in the cellar at Malfoy Manor. Now, they are about to spend several weeks sharing the smallest bedroom at Shell Cottage. Will they be able to come to terms with the trauma they've experienced, and will they be able to resolve the enormous differences in their personalities?

  “I don't have to justify my place here to you.” Millicent's voice is like ice, and Hermione can't help herself from flinching, pulling back in her seat to put more distance between them. She's faced down dark wizards, but this feels different. Hermione feels her cheeks warm and thinks about trying to apologise, to take back her words or say something to take away the sting of them, but before she can say anything Millicent snaps, “Why are you here?” After the war Hermione tries to make up for her wartime by working in the Department of Magical Accidents. She's not expecting to end up working at a desk opposite one Millicent Bulstrode, but she'll put up with whatever she has to, if it gives her a chance at getting her parents' memories back.

  At this very moment, Hermione Granger is a tiny muggleborn child who's tried half a dozen spells. No one is scared of her. No one knows to expect her."We're really doing this," Pansy eventually says, breaking the silence. "We must be insane.""We're saving the country." Hermione tears her gaze from the sunrise across the treetops of the Forbidden Forest to find that Pansy is already looking her way, something resolute in her gaze.

  Hermione has a pregnant adopted sister, parents who don't believe she's bisexual, and a crush the size of the Great Lake on Pansy Parkinson. Taking Pansy up on her offer to be Hermione's fake date to her parents' Christmas dinner could solve at least one of those problems...but it could also make everything worse.

** I would describe a Mary-Sue as a character who succeeds in places that logically other character should succeed in. It's alright to have a competent main character, great even, but they have to show their work. That's hard to do. Most dumb down the competing characters, who are often professional adults who are supposed to be skilled in their fields. Suddenly, instead of having a gifted and talented child, you have this illogically competent child able to out perform adults who have dedicated their entire life to the same field. Experts exist, so do child prodigies, but they are not magically exempt from trials by being smart. Hermione as a character was bossy and had difficulty connecting to her peers. She also fixated on grades and rules to the point of obsession. Her book smarts came at a social cost, you could say.

In Mary-Stue stories Hermione's never in the wrong and her successes rarely have a cost. If a conflict comes up, it's always the opposing party who is completely in the wrong. As a lot of conflicts are complicated with a lot of grey area, authors will often exaggerate the flaws and arguments of the people opposing Hermione in order to make her more 'correct'. Here you get a lot of Ron and Dumbledore bashing.

The best example of this recently is Harry Potter and the Bucket-List by darkpetal16. This is a fun fic, but it's a guilty pleasure for me. Early in the story the main character steals some famous jewels to fund her master plan of creating a safe haven for werewolfs in order to have an army to fight for her in the future or something. This is interesting, even cool, but she just succeeds at it. No one bats an eye as she just does this. No one in the group she's trying to utilize contest her, no one politically fights this, and everyone involved just sort of nods and smiles as if it's perfectly reasonable for a child to be doing this. She isn't a child, but people for some reason don't view her as one.

The main character, Rosie, exists in the world as though the world was built for her. She gets multiple rare abilities, gets to hang out with all the cool characters I assume the author likes, gets to just be better in general. It's a SI, though, and doesn't shy away from the fact that the author just wants to play in the HP space. It makes me less angry and more envious, to be honest. I would love to write something similar for myself regardless of the 'realism' of the story.

I can't think of any stories that do this with Hermione without also doing something that redeems the story. I can think of stories where Hermione is almost unrealistically competent, like The Arithmancer, but I think that story does it with a wonderful amount of development and care. It's Mary-Sue ish, but forgivably so.

Someone else mentioned New Blood, and I think that's a good example. I like that story very much, but remember getting frustrated when Hermione somehow manages to blow the minds of all Goblins that banks can loan money. There's more to it than that, and I still recommend the story, but that was a pretty big stumbling block for me.

​

TL:DR When your character is given special treatment to do whatever they want without consequence and still tries to present itself as though it's feasible it frustrates the reader. When the author dumbs down other characters in order to justify their characters excellence it frustrates the reader. Hermione, being smart and a favorite of a lot of authors, gets this treatment fairly often.

*** It's funny that you bring up The Arithmancer because another commenter brought it up too. Their assessment was that it was indeed a very Mary Sue-ish Hermione and outlined their reasons why. It's nice to see another perspective on the same story. (Although everyone seems to agree that Hermione is a Sue in New Blood.)

Anyway, my biggest take away in this thread is that Mary Sue is very subjective and often used incorrectly. There are also quite a lot of fics of it, and I might find it within me to explore those one day!

**** There is a YouTube video from Overly Sarcastic Productions that does a very good job describing what I feel is the best description of what a Mary Sue is. Its part of their Trope Talk series. Definitely worth watching.

As a very bad summary of what their video says (seriously, watch it, it's much better than my shitty paraphrasing) if the attributes given to a character make it so that their mere presences forces the plot to change to account for them, they are a Mary Sue.

It's been a while but if I'm remembering correctly the video even goes into how being a Mary sue isn't necessarily even a bad thing. Some of the most beloved characters in fiction are Mary/Gary Sue/Stus. The obvious ones being Superman and the Hulk. They MUST have a plot designed around their existence otherwise they can solve everything far too easily.

***** Hulk and Superman are Sue-ish, I'd argue. The ORIGINAL Mary Sue was a Star Trek fanfiction character named Mary Sue who was the youngest, smartest, most talented ship captain ever and not only could she solve every problem that ever came up, even when Sulu and Spock couldn't, but she was loved by EVERYONE, including characters who, in Star Trek canon, only care for others die to professional obligation and are otherwise completely disinterested in others.

A true Mary Sue on the same level as the original would get Voldemort to apologize to Harry for killing his parents, and then start a prep school for muggleborn so they aren't just abruptly thrust into the magical world, but instead are fully prepared, all while Dumbledore proudly sings Tom's praises because he was a good boy all along, and even Aberforth forgives Dumbledore for what happened to their sister, because Mary admonished him for letting such a silly fridge fester for so long.

Hell, I would even go for a Harry Ron Draco friendship, Harry, Ron, Draco, Neville friendship, or if we really need a female character I would go for Harry, Ron and any other girl than Hermione(be it Hannah, Susan, Parvati, Padma, Lavender, Pansy, you name it, if that's even able to do with Draco and Pansy, since they are supremacist idiots). Just writing it to show how much I am tired of seeing fandom wanting Ron out of the picture, the trio wouldn't be the same without Ron, as it wouldn't be without Hermione, but I adore creative freedom and want to see it anyway.

Too many years of Ron/Ginny/Weasley bashing, and overglorifying Hermione has done its work(thank you Kloves ^_^). I get that people like Hermione, and I get the reasons why(some are downright stupid), and I get that people need to justify their own ship, but some of the Harmonyans/Hermione fans are such a toxic bunch, and that community made me like her and the Potterhead fandom (the sole reason I say that I am a Harry Potter fan, but not a Potterhead) even less than I already did.

  Also, how do you define Mary Sue Hermione? People just say "perfect" but that seems really vague.
#+end_quote

Honestly, I think this is the root of the problem. People who don't like Hermione look at those stories where she's little more than arm candy that only exists to fawn over her boyfriend and think she's a Mary Sue. And to be fair, she is basically flawless in all of those stories, but in my experience, a lot of Hermione fans tend to think that those stories actually degrade Hermione and strip away her character.

There's also a sizeable portion of people who believe that any story that portrays Hermione as extremely competent makes her a Mary Sue, especially if she's portrayed as more competent than Harry or her love interest. Heck, a lot of people even think that canon Hermione is a Mary Sue since she's much more intelligent, skilled, and proactive than Harry. Although the term Mary Sue is supposed to be reserved for idealized characters, it is frequently used to label any female character readers deem "too capable".

If you want some fanfics that I'd say include MarySue!Hermione, here's a couple:

- A lot of Colubrina fics
- A very large portion of Tom Riddle/Hermione time travel fanfics, especially those ones where she's a war-hardened veteran when she goes back in time

** That's a trick question. Calling out any fics here for having a Mary Sue protag is just an invitation for Hermione stans to loudly declare why their favourite fics don't have the "Perfect Princess" syndrome. Nevertheless...

Almost all Hermione-centric fics, to some extent, are inherently Mary Sue-ish in nature. They're based on the "Hermione does it better" premise, where she has all of her canon strengths, along with all the positive characteristics of Harry as well. Rarely, if ever, are her flaws are existent. But even in those fics, they're written off as "good" traits and have no meaningful consequences.

And then there are the pairing fics...

For example, The Last Casualties - Harry's parents are supposedly alive and return on Halloween 1994. Fourth Year divergence, H/Hr.

First chapter - Ron, that traitorous bastard, doesn't believe Harry and is thoroughly trashed on for that by Hermione. She also believes Harry without a doubt, has the perfect emotional awareness to move things along smoothly and declares her love for him.

Every "good guy" (James, Lily, Sirius, Remus, Neville the best friend™, his bae Susan) in the fic is, of course, Harmony-sexual. All they talk about is how Harry and Hermione are perfect together. Abused Harry can only ever seek comfort from her, she's the perfect intellectual equal of all the adults, more beautiful than Helen of Troy and Aphrodite put together... And then, the pinnacle of stupidity, Hermione defeats Dumbledore in a duel during their "training".

Yeah, that's definitely Mary Sue nonsense. And it's not particularly unique. Almost every Harry, Draco or Snape/Hermione fic has the same shit. The few Krum/Hermione fics are full of the same nonsense, with ridiculous Ron, and sometimes, Harry bashing.

Ultimately, If you're the kind of reader who "exclusively reads Hermione-centric fics", the worst of Hermione-wank in fanfiction won't really look like Mary Sue stuff to you.

*** My fic-reading experience has been different from the one you outlined. I've read fics where her own stubbornness gets her and others hurt. I've read fics where her lack of concern for other people's agency have had terrible results. I've read fics where her treatment of her parents or Marietta were given significant consequences. The ones I've read often characterized her as insecure and workaholic at best. Control-freak at worst. These are all meaningful flaws that fuck up the narrative and her relationships to the high-heavens.

Conversely, I've never actually read a fic where Hermione was Dumbledore's intellectual equal (although I would love to read those). Nor have I ever read ones where she was noted to be particularly beautiful or have perfect emotional awareness. If anything, she is tactless and often says the wrong thing at the wrong time.

Now, I'm not saying you're wrong or that those stories don't exist and that they aren't prevalent. You might even be right, and my tolerance for Hermione things have skewed my perception. Given that you're citing things like Harmony, Dramione, Snamione and the like though, I'm kinda confident that I just don't run in the same circles as the Mary Sue Hermione fics. And since I don't veer in the direction of plotty stories, I guess that could be a reason too.

Thank you for answering though.

Edit: It might also be that I don't notice that the flaws I'm tracking do not have effects on the plot. Plot doesn't matter to me that much. So maybe.

** It heavily depends on your view of 'Mary Sue' (a term I personally don't like, but... what can you do ;) ).

Some people on here have a very low threshold for what's considered a "perfect" Hermione, which will expand the realm of fics widely. Where she might always be right, smarter than the others, etc - much of that is also applicable in canon.

Others will have a more strict definition.

For particular stories, you're likeliest to come across it in Harmony stories where Ron is heavily bashed, or in badly written stories in general. However, the threshold does matter a /lot/ - something like the Arithmancer series could be viewed as perfect Hermione or reasonable, depending on who reads it.

Honestly, I'm not sure why people talk as though it's insanely prevalent or it made them hate Hermione - it's not something I typically come across myself, and it's certainly much less of a departure from canon than making Harry a genius or supplanting her academically, which many people don't seem to have an issue with (outside, obviously, of the extreme power fantasies). It might be a bit of a backlash - this subreddit's demographics, being on reddit and judging by the old polls, leans much more male than the general fanfiction fandom, which might explain all the "Ron is overly bashed" and "Hermione is overly perfect" venting that happens (not that I disagree with the former by any means, but I think that they go hand in hand too much on here). So it's a safe space to display that opinion, and sometimes people need to vent - that'd be my guess, at least.

It sounds like the complaints are from people who were already predisposed to disliking her. The low threshold for perfect!Hermione that you mentioned sounds about right. When reading those discussions, I agree that if these complainers read a perfectly in-character Hermione in fic, they would probably call her a Mary Sue too.

** I have the same problem. Lots of complaining, few actual examples. My best explanations so far:

1. A big chunk of the fandom declares Hermione a "Mary Sue" any time she has any agency, does anything exceptional, or is shown to be right about something; doubly so when the story plays to her canon strengths or when she sidelines or surpasses Harry in some way. It doesn't help that many consider /canon/ Hermione a Sue. Without getting into /why/ people do it, there are all too many Boys Who Cry "Wolf" on this topic (and a fair number of girls as well).
2. You and I have at least some taste. Actual Mary Sue fics almost invariably have many other, generally worse, problems, and avoiding some forms of fanfic badness also protects you from being exposed to other forms of fanfic badness.

As for the actual "recommendations",

- I think someone in the thread already recommended /New Blood/. I think that's the Sue-est fic I am reading at the moment.
- /Green Girl/ by Colubrina is definitely a Mary Sue fic, and it gets recommended very often around here. I've ranted about it all too many times.
- I feel dirty just mentioning the names, but check out pstibbons and chem_prof on FFnet.

I think that's in general the problem.

For example, most fics with a mary-sue-ist Harmione will most likely have Ron/Weasly bashing. Which I despise on principle.

Actually, most mary-sue/gary-stu fics tend to have some sort of bashing in them. Because apparently you can't elevate your main character without lowering the level of the others :facepalm:

**** Those are very good examples. I don't tolerate Ron-bashing, so I probably "miss out" on some Hermione-sue Harmony fics. Though, in my limited experience, calling those Sue fics is often a stretch, because Hermione is little more than Harry's helpmate: she's beautiful so that Harry could have a beautiful girlfriend; she is well liked but Harry is the leader; her supposed intelligence has little actual plot impact except to maybe find a power-up for Harry, etc..

Similarly, Hermione gets a lot of this type of bashing in Smart!Harry and Smart!Draco fics. It's basically [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect][the Worf Effect]]: if the fic author wants to show you how smart their protagonist is, there is no easier way than to show that they are smarter than the "smart girl".

***** To add on to that, the 'powering up' of Hermione in such Harmony fics often is just matching Harry's own improvements - like, if she becomes more beautiful, well liked, and smarter than in the books, Harry is getting exactly the same treatment generally so they make the perfect pair. So it's certainly not one sided - and like you say, it can also be seen as a complement/bonus to Harry in those situations, depending on how the wish fulfillment is going.

*** Strap in kids, I'm taking you for a ride back to the olden tymes.

Long ago, when the Earth was young, before this world wide web nonsense you kids take for granted these days, a terrible author wrote a terrible Star Trek fanfic. Then lots of other people wrote similar terrible Star Trek fanfics, because even in the 70s, recycling the same plots over and over was just how fanfiction worked.

Eventually, one author took note of all the stupid plot points that kept getting reused and wrote a parody fic trying to cram in as many as possible.

This resulted in the creation of Lt. Mary Sue, the half-Vulcan youngest officer in Starfleet at 15 (and a half), known for your beautiful youth and youthful beauty (fending off advances from Kirk because obviously the heroic starship captain is totally into her), who singlehandedly saved the Enterprise from total destruction after the entire command staff except for her was taken out of commission, eventually sacrificing herself in the process (she got better later).

That's pretty much the short of it, and the long's not much longer. [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/A_Trekkie%27s_Tale][The story was only a couple pages long.]]

**** No, The Arithmancerre being a Mary Sue story stems from the point that not only does Hermione routinely break lore established in the fanfiction itself, but also Laura established in the books, has the go-to solution for every single problem simply by creating a brand new spell off top of her head in an instant, and even when she is completely in the wrong and is an asshat to other characters they still all come around and beg for her forgiveness about how they should have been more considerate towards her.

And to your points, did her happen to be talking to asking for help multiple times results in any character development where she learned as a character? Or did the same lesson have to be repeated multiple times? Was the final solution to the problem she had to ask help for delivered by another person, or by the result of her own actions after she had a miraculous moment of clarity when another character gave their friend Hermione a brilliant idea.

The whole breakdown about the confirmation of souls is straight up self insert author bias that literally had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever except to add drama about the fact that Hermione's beliefs were right in the first place.

Overall the portrayal of her was more akin to I am an autistic numbers genius that can do no wrong, everyone will forgive me if I am overbearing, I am such a genius, even the fact that I treat my friends terribly and self-isolate for weeks is part of my charm because I am the smartest witch of my age.

If a Mary Sue has a character flaw that makes them seem cooler, more important, more focused, smarter, driven, or any other benefit then it's not really a character flaw. A good example would be if there is a Harry Potter ooc where he takes on the role of avenger of his parents, not afraid to dip into dark magic, which causes him to be spiteful and angry towards his friends, but every single thing he does has a reason that is justified and accepted by everyone with little to no question.

Or Sasuke Uchiha in general. Total asshole, doesn't care about his friends, literally tried to kill multiple of them multiple different times, yet at the end everyone forgives and loves him.

So yes. the Arithmancers series does feature a Mary Sue Hermione because all character flaws work to flush her out as a eccentric badass genius who can literally bend the laws of the universe to her whim.

***** I have mixed feelings about this argument.

On the one hand, Hermione being an eccentric badass genius /is/ the premise of the fanfic. In fact, I sense that White Squirrel went out of their way to /prevent/ Hermione from advancing in magic too quickly or fixing too many problems.

The example with Dark!Harry's relationships not suffering is an interesting one, but it doesn't quite apply here: Hermione isn't that much worse than she is in canon in this respect, and friends put up with friends' quirks, particularly when those friends are genuinely trying to help and are helping. And, Sasuke is a completely different beast.

There were also some instances where she lost badly, such as with Umbridge.

And, in the grand scheme of things, Hermione is the closest thing Dumbledore has to a successor, one who hasn't yet learned to tread lightly as Dumbledore had.

--------------

On the other hand, perhaps the fic fell victim to the problem that Hermione was powered-up, but the central conflict of the story was still Harry vs. Voldemort. This freed Hermione to show up and walk all over everyone else's stories, with little consequence or responsibility to herself. White Squirrel would have done well to create some conflicts and challenges specifically aimed at Hermione. (One example: Hermione invents and publishes a spell that simply breaks house-elf bonds. Now there are lots of people who are out to get her personally. Another example: as her reputation grows, a whole lot of purebloods who sympathised with Voldemort but thought that his methods were uncouth, and had been biding their time until Dumbledore died of old age, find out that the next Dumbledore is here, and she is an opinionated Muggleborn; and suddenly, Voldemort has significantly more supporters.)

I agree that lampshading some of the Fridge Horrors of the Potterverse setting was a bit overdone. I can imagine canon Hermione having a similar breakdown off-screen (in Year 3?) but Harry not noticing, but the whole Supreme Judge thing showing up randomly was weird. My headcanon is that Hermione being rather hypocritical about the matter was a character flaw; but it was a fairly inconsequential one (i.e., Sueish), and I don't think White Squirrel saw it that way.

There were also genuinely Sueish elements in that fic, starting with Hermione freeing Dobby by the exact same mechanism as Harry had in canon. More generally, there were far too many scenes of people praising Hermione as well; since, again, she /is/ an eccentric badass genius, it makes sense for those scenes to take place; but it would have been better if the author had just elided them and moved on.

** I'm reading one right now. While I absolutely love the story (it's very well written and the plot & pairing is unique), I can't deny that Hermione is definitely a Mary Sue on this. She doesn't quite start out that way, but it sort of builds up over time. It does contain a brief Dumbledore bashing, though.
