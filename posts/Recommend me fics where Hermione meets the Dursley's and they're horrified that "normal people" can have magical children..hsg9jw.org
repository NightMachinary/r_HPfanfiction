Not sure if any exist, but title. Preferably a redemption for the dudleys, but don't mind either way, more curiosity than anything.


** I don't have any recommendations, but you know that Lily was Muggle-Born, right? The Dursley's already know magical children can be born into any family, including a â€˜normal' one.

*** I know that, but imagine Vernon and Dursley's reaction upon learning that /gosh, Petunia could have been magical too, and normal people can have freak children too/ or something. Again, not sure if scenarios like it exist or not.

**** Well, there's a lot of stories about Dudley's children being magical (it was almost canon, JKR considered it herself). But again, they already know it can happen to anyone. The Evans were a normal family yet Lily was a freak.
