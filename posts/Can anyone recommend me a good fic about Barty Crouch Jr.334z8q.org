His story seems really interesting to me, so I'm really surprised that I can't find anything.


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/21003][The Well Groomed Mind]] On Halloween 1994, Harry learns his mind isn't his own. On Samhain morn, he vows to question everything. Armed with logic and an unlikely ally, Harry makes a last ditch bid to reclaim his life. The goal: survive at all costs.

The only fic that I feel pulls off a manipulative Dumbledore well. Crouch mentors Harry during the Tri-Wizard Tournament and it later goes into his past and motivations.

*** Goddammit I stayed up til 4:40 in the morning for this and its sequel and it hasn't updated since 2013 T__T my eyes literally closed themselves. I didn't know whether to laugh or be freaked out cos they were acting completely autonomously of me.

Thank you for posting this <3
