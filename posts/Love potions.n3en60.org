Why aren't love potions and their victims more talked about in fanfics?! I mean if in fanfic there is love potions its one of two. First being Harry/Hermione finding out they were on love potion and its always like "oh i was on love potion... Well off to the charms i go" or harry taunting tom by talking about his mother who raped like RAPED his father. And im always there reading it and like why are the love potions not illegal and if they are then why are they still so easy to get(you could buy them from weasleys prank shop or you could just steal it from slughorn after giving him some alcohol or something.

Well, there's basically a weekly thread on them on this sub if that helps

** I have seen a couple where they got love potions banned I think. I remember one where they basically made the argument: "imagine if you were slipped a potion and woke up the next morning in bed with Umbridge" and everyone agreed to ban them. One theory I like is that while everyone sort of agrees that they are morally dubious, a) enough powerful people find them useful to keep them legal and b) they are easy enough to make and the wizarding world decentralised enough that they can't be banned, so at least this way there can be some quality control for the major suppliers.

** “An Hour of Wolves” by thebiwholived linkao3(14164617) is not enough for you? Beware, it is a really brutal story, take heed of all warnings seriously. If you have any triggers, this is not for you.

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

** I've seen quite a few with them in it. Obviously there's a bunch in Weasley bashing fics mostly, but there are others as well. I just woke up though, and I can already tell I'm having a bad memory day

** If it helps, the fic I'm writing at the moment has Hermione working on a policy to regulate them. It's only sideline thing, but agree that they are super creepy so I wanted to make a point of that.

** Probably because SA, allegorically told through love potions or otherwise, is a really really complex issue. To properly address exactly how awful Amortentia or the Imperius is, the author would need to be conscious amd delicate with thr subject matter. Too heavy handed and the message is lost amidst all the over-the-top angst. Too much of a feather touch and you're making light of the issue.

It takes a really skilled writer to address certain things well, and a lot of authors probably dont feel as though theyre up to the task of addressing the issue and ramifications directly.
