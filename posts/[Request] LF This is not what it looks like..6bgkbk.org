Advise fanfics with the idea of "This is not what it looks like" It is desirable with a similar plot:

1. From the side: Durskaban: Hunting for Harry, Bullying, hunger and beating. in fact: Only training: running and stealth, fighting and acting (especially acting).

2. From the side: Friends betrayed Harry and sent to Azkaban. in fact: Harry is in Azkaban at will. So is training or something like that.

A perfect example is The Real Us - Seel'vor


** What?
