And that's why Voldemort looks snakelike after the ritual in GoF. Everyone is baffled except Harry, who assumes Voldemort was born a snake man, and then ridicules Harry for thinking something so ridiculous.


** When I read the books for the first time I thought that the revived Voldemort's snakelike appearance was because his provisional body was sustained by drinking snake venom.

**** Yea, I thought it was because he only had 0.78125% of a soul, and either 1.5625% or 0.0078125% was in a snake.

Edit: Also, did we ever learn weather the Snake was made a Crux before or after Harry?

****** Thankyou. 0.78125%, then.

It's amazing how small something gets if you half it seven times.

******* Did the books ever say the soul was halved? I remember saying 'split one's soul,' which could mean a shard or a large chunk.

******** Oh, I don't know. Maybe not. But then still having most of a soul doesn't make Voldie as monstrous as having only 1/128.

*** I always assumed it was just JK Rowling using 'magic ritual' to justify matching Voldemort's appearance to his narrative theme and personality (Voldemort's a snake, in the sense that he's extremely dangerous, he's a serial backstabber, and he's generally evil).

What really bugs me, though, is that he was supposed to be very handsome and charming, and the charm apparently disappeared with the handsomeness.

**** Because you said this

  except Harry, who assumes Voldemort was born a snake man,
#+end_quote

This means Harry has met a younger version of Voldemort before, so either Diary Tom looks normal and\\
it contradicts Harry's assumption that Voldemort was like this from birth, or Diary Tom looks like a snake man which would mean that him being one later isn't Harry's fault.

***** Good point. But no, part of this is Harry being dumb, so he's met diary Tom and just didn't think about the fact he has seen Voldemort not look like a snake very hard.

******* I think he was snake faced in the first book, I'm not sure though.

Although, Voldemort being sorted into Slytherin could have been enough - teenagers aren't known for their logical thought processes

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
