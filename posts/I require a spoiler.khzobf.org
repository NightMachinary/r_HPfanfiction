So, I've been looking around and have seen the being known as "That fucker" being mentioned in posts about A Black Comedy.

Now since I don't really like the story and am not planning on reading it.

What is the identity of "That Fucker?"


** You could simply read the last chapter to find out 😁

However while Harry and Sirius have mentioned "that fucker" (lower case) and mean Lucius Malfoy the one you are looking for is "That Fucker" who Voldemort is Hunting.

And the answer is Tom Riddle

It seems Tom was trying a mind healing technique to eliminate/remove negative emotions like rage, jealousy, etc. Problem is he f'd up and those emotions latched onto part of his soul and formed his evil twin Voldemort. So good Tom created an alternate identity and did his best to stop Voldemort. He interfered enough that Voldemort started referring to him as "That Fucker".

Note: tried to hide some of the text but it didn't work. Figured that since the main post mentioned spoilers folks were warned.

*** It's been a while but wasn't That Fucker the revived Diary!Horcrux which ending up taking over Neville and not liking what his older self turned into? Not exactly good Tom per ee, just not-a-complete-monster Tom.

**** It's been a while for me as well and I honestly don't remember. How did you make the text be "blacked out". I tried what I had found but it didn't work.

Spoiler text goes here.

Note that there can't be any spaces between the tags and the text. Spaces in the text itself are fine, though.

*** The "removing negative emotions" thing was his planned cover story if it ever came out he was actually an offshoot of Voldie. He was indeed the diary horcrux.

*** Woah .. where did you get this? others answered who/what exactly 'the fucker' is in the fic but only thing I recall about mind healing in this specific fic is that Riddlebottom poses as a mind healer who is taking care of Neville's father .. where did your part about technique to remove emotions come from? is this from some other fic you read? if so, I am interested to know what that is.

**** It's straight from the text of A Black Comedy. Chapter 31.

The explanation starts with the line "Tom put on a mask of a deadly serious Scholar.......I attempted to remove negative emotions like rage and jealousy.......I actually separated those pieces of wrong and evil, but in an attempt to remove them they attached to a piece of my soul, wrenched it free, and formed a separate entity from myself......This evil twin spiraled way beyond my control.

****** Right after this "explanation" harry responds with "Enter That Fucker"

It's roughly a little less than halfway into the chapter (as a pdf the chapter is 18 pages long this text is on page 8).
