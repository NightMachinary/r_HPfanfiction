What happened to the weasley's car. In the second book, Harry and Ron steal the car to get to Hogwarts? The whomping willow then proceeded to destroy a car and it runs away into the Forbidden Forest. Ron and Harry then encountered a car again when it saves them from the spiders. What happened to the car there after? Did the dragon handlers in the fourth book encountered the car? Did the centaurs have territorial disputes with the car? Did Voldemort and his forces have to fight the car off in seventh book? Did it become civilized, meet a nice lady car like Herbie did and have a family of cars? I wish to know the answer to this important question.


** When I read Deathly Hallows the first time I legitimately expected the car to show up in the final battle and start running down the enemy once Grawp and the Centaurs showed up.

*** I completely agree. I expected that too and think Rowling majorly missed a good opportunity here for a nice call back. It would have been awesome!

** It's kind of counter to your topic (the car spends most of the the fic broken), but the topic made me think of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone) and I just binge read the entire thing yet again. Such a great fic, even if it went off the rails in the third act.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

*** I actually enjoyed the whole over the top kind of thing. It's well written and clearly not meant to be taken too seriously. It updated recently and I'm rather curious about where the sequel will go

****** Well, I'm actually disappointed. :D They were all extremely short and NONE OF THEM were actually...you know, DESCRIPTIVE. Guess nobody actually wanted to figure out the logistics of that shit. Guess I can't blame em though.
