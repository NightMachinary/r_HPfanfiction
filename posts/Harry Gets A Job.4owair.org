  “A complete revamp of the course from top to bottom. It'll be called ‘Self-Protection' class. I also found a classroom within Hogwarts that perfectly caters to my needs, and is impervious to the jinx placed on the Defense Against the Dark Arts. It'll be a completely different course, and for the better. You'll see.”

Harry Potter magic isn't semantic. It is symbolic. Surface level changes like this would not affect such a curse. Self-protection is synonymous with Defense. The curse is on the job, not on the room in which it is being taught. And so on, and so forth.

*** Its all fan speculation, but I tend to agree. Not that I'd let this get in the way of an otherwise good story.

*** Agreed. I've seen this "just rename the position" trope several times (usually though it's Hermione-Sue wow'ing Dumbledore with her brilliance) and it's always smacked a bit of cocky FF author outwitting 'genius' Dumbledore to me.

No offense to OP, and I also completely agree with [[/u/howtopleaseme]]. I'd definitely keep reading this story.

*** Ah, but this is clearly a crossover, and in the Dresden universe curses could be on a concept, but also names are very important. It's very much possible that changing the name would work in the Dresdenverse.
