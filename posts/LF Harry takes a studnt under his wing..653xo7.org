Any fics where Harry either takes an apprentice or just tutors a younger student? Thanks.


** That happens frequently in many fics. It's mostly Neville like in linkffn(A Cadmean Victory)

**** It was kinda cringey but the fact that it was well written made me read it anyway. My main problem with the fic was Harry completely flipping out on Hermione when she accidentally broke his wand

***** And Katie was really, really, really stupid the way she handled her Yule Ball partner choice. And that only served the purpose to drive the plot forward because the author could not figure out how to do so without giving her an IQ of 5.

****** The only character I liked was Salazar, he was pretty well rounded IMO

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
