I've always disliked the idea of stories emphasising or exagerating the "Harry was horribly abused as a child and is still deeply affected" idea. I didn't believe that it could ever be the premise of a good story that wouldn't be massive cringe-worthy.

However I discovered *Mixed Feelings*, a fanfic for the web serial Worm that has totally changed my mind about all this. Does anyone have any recs for a good "Harry Potter is a traumatised abuse victim" story?

I don't care if it's dark, full of feels, or a hugbox about recovery. I just need proof of its existence to keep me going until the next chapter of Mixed Feelings comes out in a few weeks.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

** linkffn(Eight by Lily Elizabeth Snape)

linkffn(Nobody Cared by etherian)

linkffn(Second Chances by Mara Rome)

linkffn(Those Who Grieve by The Lonely God With a Box)

All of these are mentor!Snape or Guardian!Snape raising and/or guiding Harry through not only life but through his abuse at the hands of his relatives. Some are more graphic and intense than others (ie, Those Who Grieve is particularly graphic as it deals with rape so read at your own risk with that one) but the others deal with more realistic depictions of abuse at the hands of the Dursleys. I haven't read any of these in a while, but I do remember them fondly and I hope they are what you're looking for.

** There's one, I can't remember the name, but Harry and Ron are Aurors, and Hermione is in a different branch of the Department of Law Enforcement.

Long story short, Harry lets a witch who claims to have killed her abusive, controlling, Muggle husband in self-defense off after hearing her story. Hermione is outraged, believing that it's impossible for a Muggle to physically overpower a witch one-on-one.

Meanwhile Ron tells Harry that it's impossible for wizarding children to get seriously abused because their accidental magic acts as a shield.

Needless to say, this complicates matters within the Trio's friendship.

It's not that angsty, as far as HP fan fiction goes, but it does shed some light on Harry's childhood. And Hermione and Ron are put firmly, but not unkindly, in their place.

I read the first thirteen-odd chapters and then stopped because I wasn't fond of Dumbledore's characterization, but if that's not gonna bother you, the Harry-is-abused aspect is tackled in detail.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
