the title. it's a snape and hermione fic and HEAR ME OUT!! i was grossed out, nauseated, wanted to vomit when i heard that but just give it a try even if you absolutely hate the ship. it's sooo much more than a romance fic. the fic is like 60% 90s and 40% snape/marauder era and it focuses on hermiones relationship w snape and the marauders as well as her having to go to school w her daughter and how it changes the course of the hp series. it's sooo long, slow burn, and it is so intricate it covers all 7 years of Harry Potter. Hands down the best fic I've ever read.


** I knew that author sounded familiar!! They write for almost all my fandoms!

Ah you've given me so much to read~
