  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** Very short, but if you liked Botnik's /Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash/, you might get a chuckle out of the sequel, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rest of the Sentence).

  Brought to you by the questionable genius of machine learning, it's the exciting sequel to "Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash"! Botnik Studios is not responsible for any faces eaten by Harry Potter with hot sauce, headmaster hair scooting next to you at breakfast, or ribs fractured in hysterical laughter. Weekly updates.

** Yo, i have a fanfic Harry Potter and the Broom of Death. It's a 24 (notebook) page fic and is fully done. But only thing is, it needs translation from Russian to English, which i'm working on right now. I just translated the first chapter and it's avialable in PDF format. Is there a way i can send it to you since Reddit doesn't support PDF?
