A Google search I just did indicates that pencils were invented earlier with pencils invented in 1795 and matchsticks in 1805. Both were invented well after the statute of secrecy. The first transfiguration they learn is a matchstick to a needle so they are presumably familiar with them. If they can erase ink with magic a pencil isn't quite as needed as it is in the real world, but they can light a fire with an incendio so a matchstick seems even less useful.


** I always figured it as by the time you got to Hogwarts age you're expected to know how to write with a quill so they just never came up. I definitely wasn't using a pencil to write with by 11 and the upper age for children to start using pens is 9 when I googled it.

In the books Harry doesn't do any art/drawing* which is where I would expect pencils to be used.

As for the matchstick, children can't light fires/lamps with incendio so it would make sense to me that the wizarding world had matches of some description. It may have been that initially it was just needle to wood splinter but evolved into the needle to matchstick as the latter became more common.

*To my memory, may be wrong.

Nowadays I only use ad-hoc cursive when signing my name, by which I mean the first three letters are cursive, and the last three are cursive, but the middle part isn't because it looks ugly as hell even if worn correctly in cursive. My 3rd grade teacher would quite everyone's name in cursive as a way to show that "everyone has such beautiful names" or whatever, but she ended up just writing mine normally and claiming that mine was "more beautiful for its uniqueness." At the time it was appalling, but once I started signing stuff, I can only look back on that and laugh.

** I can't for the life of me remember the name of the fic, but there was one that gave a decent enough reason as to why quills are used in the magical world, as opposed to pens or pencils

 

Basically, there are magical spells that can be used on writing to make sure the authenticity of the writing. Obvious applications in a school environment to prevent cheating but this becomes /much more important/ when talking about signatures on official documents and contracts.

 

In a world where it is perfectly possible to manipulate someone to sign their name to a document (imperius obviously, but more subtle manipulations with various charms are definitely possible. But delving deeper into that just going to lead into an anti-Flitwick rant that isn't directly relevant here) and then /make them forget you ever did so/, making sure something was written by someone by their own will and by their own hand is very much a priority.

 

IIRC in the fic there was something about the ink used in the magical world (or something about how it's treated before use) that makes it possible to use verification magic on it. Thus ruling out pencils. But in theory, you could fill a ballpoint pen with magical ink.

 

Except, the way a ballpoint pen works is that as you move a pen around there is a ball bearing inside of it, drawing ink from the reservoir and applying it to the page as it turns. Thus, for there purposes of the verification magic, a signature was not made "by John's hand" but by a ball bearing.

 

Thus the only way to have a verified signature for official documentation (and to have schoolwork that's verified as not being copied and such), it has to be written by hand with a quill. Given how much of life that takes up, there's little social pressure to adopt to ballpoint pens for the other bits of writing in their lives that don't fall into those categories

*** I don't remember the fic name but I know what you're talking about.

Modern pens and pencils are made from inorganic materials, making them harder to manipulate with magic.

Old fashioned ink are made with oak galls as a base, so it makes quills and ink a reverse wand. The outside is made from an animal with the inside (the ink) made from a tree. This makes it able to be infused with magic and allows for magical signatures to be done with the quill.

*** That's an interesting way to think about it, but I do think that, in that case, it would just be better to write with your fingers if the concept of the ball point pen replacing you applies. If the ball is writing, then the sharp tip of a quill would be doing the same. The difference here is that the ball of the pen is a separate piece, which might be why that's the case. But the same can be said for using non-human instruments in general, since they're not actually parts of the person doing the writing. And it's completely different from wands since wands are made to be conduits. It would be interesting if quills in the magical world were stuffed with a core that allows anyone to use it and unconsciously channel their magic into it while writing. The ink would be a catalyst between your magic and the paper, thus fueling the charm that would verify your identity. Makes you wonder what makes a blood quill and a quick quotes quill. Bird feathers are hollow and flimsy, so they need something to strengthen them for writing. So I guess it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to say that they're manufactured with more than just a clip on the feather's end.

** Quills and parchments are just completely nonsensical. Quills perhaps (although, when wizards followed the industrialization with the steam engine, why they didn't the invention of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dip_pen][a nib pen]], at least, if the fountain pen is too Muggle for them), but parchment? Paper was well established standard and cheap writing material in the sixteenth century well before the Statute of Secrecy. My deep suspicion is that JKR was still thinking about Gandalf and [[https://images.app.goo.gl/4fjBugVxUj7ehEbo8][this image]], which however is completely wrong ...

*** Quills and parchment is just the aesthetic she was going for. It seems like almost every household has at least one bird of prey in it, which means people have a ready source of large quill feathers. If they've been doing it that way for centuries there really isn't much incentive for a stuck-in-the-mud culture to change writing implements just for the sake of changing. Especially if it means they have to source those goods from outside of their xenophobic community.

It's also possible that wizards have some sort of plant based paper they refer to as parchment, just like muggles do. It would make sense for the terminology to carry over to a newer product given how tightly they cling to traditions.

Did they, though? The only time we see trains used for wizarding transportation is the somewhat-ceremonial Hogwarts Express. Everyday transportation seems to be apparition/Floo, or Portkey for longer (intercontinental) distances.

No wizard ever thinks "I need to get to London, I'll take the train". They just use magical transport to get there.

As for quills, given that we see self-inking quills with spell-checking built in, and even "AI quills" that can write entire articles for you, I see it more as wizards advancing along a parallel path to Muggles rather than wizards being stuck in the past.

It's almost like Floo travel was retroactively invented 2nd year, with Portkeys being invented 4th year and Apparation 5th.

****** Did he apparate, though?

His appearance:

*/A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed./*

Was this silent apparation or did he simply drop his 'notice me not'?

and his exit:

*/“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone./*

This sounds more like apparation with the whole 'turned on his heel' thing but the swish of his cloak thing sort of spoils that.

Either way, if this was apparation, it was neither used nor even mentioned again until the 5th book when he side-alonged Harry with no warning.

Okay, the books are almost entirely from Harry's POV, but consider this; In cultures where car ownership by young adults is common, young boys have long involved discussions of what their dream car will be, and where they will go in them. I flat out refuse to believe that a culture where some variation of teleportation is not only possible but common enough that the government offers a 'Driver's Ed' type course and licensing, that the upper forms wouldn't have been having discussions about where they will go once they can apparate. Discussions that Harry would not have been able to avoid.

** I mean, any answer is pure speculation. But if you want speculation, here is mine:

(1) We know wizards know /some/ things about "recent" Muggle inventions. See, for example, the Hogwarts Express. So they could know about matches. (Or McG could, anyway -- perhaps she simply thought it might make Transfigurations easier for Muggleborns?)

(2) And they also know about pencils. However, the reason quills and parchment are used has got to do with magic taking better to ink and parchment, and in the usual spirit of teaching best practices right away, rather than starting with a crutch and forcing people to un-learn bad habits later, students are set to write in ink with quills, so that when they need it later in life, say, for magical runes, they are well-equipped to handle them.
