  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11483808/1/Blood-Stained][Blood Stained]] -- HP/Avengers Crossover. I started this story because Harry/Natasha was intriguing to me. I stayed for a decent plot and action. Recently completed as well. linkffn(11483808)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11301154/1/Wake-the-Black-Wolf][Wake the Black Wolf]] -- Started a new slowly-developing trend of Harry/Witcher crossovers. Updates are slow, but I'd say it's worth the read. He doesn't 'wreck all the shit' but he might, eventually. He certainly has the power to do so. linkffn(11301154)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]] -- HP/LotR crossover. Harry is real powerful, or becomes so anyways. It's great, but it doesn't hold a candle to Steelbadger's most recent unfinished work [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][The Shadow of Angmar]]. linkffn(11027086) linkffn(11115934)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10784770/1/Harry-Potter-Geth][Harry Potter: Geth]] -- Read this around 2 years ago, but as I recall it was well-written and the Tali/Harry romance was entertaining.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11304904/1/Madness-Effect][Madness Effect]] -- HP/Mass Effect. Harry is a mad scientist recruited to female Shepard's collector-assault team. Very entertaining. The author also has prequels/sequels/AUs (Stargate, HP-only, etc) based around this Harry which are equivalently great.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4388682/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-World-that-Waits][Harry Potter and the World that Waits]] -- HP/X-men. While reading this I would get 'Wand and Shield' vibes, but for X-men. Enough said, really.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][Harry Potter: The Last Avatar]] -- HP/Avatar TLA. The author merged both worlds fantastically. Hogwarts is a school for all types of bending, which is as far as I will go for explanations. If I remember correctly DLP rated this one quite high in their library.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] -- HP/Dresden Files. Slight Xover. As in most elements are actually Harry Potter. This fic is great though, and definitely worth the read. It's the first installment of a long series by the great Shezza. DLP-approved, I believe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132113/10/The-Difference-One-Man-Can-Make][The Difference One Man Can Make]] -- HP/ASOIAF crossover. The writing quality varies a lot from chapter to chapter, but boy does Harry really turn that world on its head. Lots of civ/city building and warfare.

Edit: Just got home and went through my favorites. Added a few more. Quick tip, there's a ton of good H/ASOIAF or H/GoT crossovers if you do a simple sort by favorites search on ffn.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

The summary is garbage and the first few chapters are mildly entertaining at best. It gets going once a certain person dies, and by that point a lot of readers will have dropped the fic. Otherwise, I thought the writing was decent. The plot was alright and the characters passably believable. My only major gripe with this fanfic is that Harry is just way too confrontational about literally /everything/. It also touches on a lot of the cliches of the HP fandom, won't spoil which ones. I'd sort this one in the guilty pleasure section for the Harry/Natasha pairing. It's not for everybody.

Harry Potter x Dresden Files

He wrecks a lot of shit. Also is kinda insane. Awesome fic.

Nuhuh also has written a HP x Anita Blake crossover over on the DLP work by author forums called [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/the-stalking-blood-sack.15818/][The Stalking Blood Sack]]. It's also fucking awesome - no one writes powerful, sort-of-crazy Harry like nuhuh. He tears Anita and all her bitches a new one.

You need to make 5 posts on DLP to view the work by author forums.

  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.

** Oh, I got a good one. You know the make a wish series? Well, turns out there's sequels by other authors, like the contract linkffn(9754636) where Harry and gang wreck Naruto's villains shit, or the one before that where Harry wrecks the Justice League villain's shit in Terminal Justice linkffn(11965672). (And it of course starts with Make a Wish linkffn(2318355), and there's a squeal and an omakes/bonus scenes as well by the same author, where he wrecks the Harry Potter universe's shit.

And just reverse the order and read away.

  Naruto, in an attempt to use a flashy jutsu his sensei used, opens the way to a whole group of people who will change the shape of the shinobi world. Crossover with Rorchac's Blot's "Make a Wish" and other related stories.
