My big one is that Sirius didn't actually do anything wrong with the Prank. Or at least what he did to Snape wasn't wrong, he definitely hurt Remus and could have easily ruined his life for ever.

But all that Sirius did was tell Snape how to get access to someone that Snape strongly suspected was a werewolf, on a full moon. Like if Snape wasn't a vindictive and cruel asshole he wouldn't have risked his life trying to reach Remus.

I mention this cause I read a lot of Maurder era stuff and frequently the Prank is one of the biggest sources of drama and conflict amongst the maurders. Also people like to use it as evidence that Sirius is some kind of monster but tbh all he did was enable Snape to make his own awful choices.

So what's your fave hot take?


** Hermione's roommates (Parvati Patil, Lavender Brown) are not terrible for liking clothes and makeup and not really hanging out with her. Sorcerer's Stone Hermione was rude and unforgiving, and after the Troll incident she spent most of her free time with Harry and Ron or studying. People can have different interests and not get along without one side being bad. Lavender didn't know Hermione liked Ron before they started dating because even Hermione didn't know she liked Ron until he was unavailable. No one is in the wrong or bad here.

*** I think that's a problem with how JK Rowling portrayed the Harry Potter world in general. For all its strong female characters, the books actually had a pretty regressive view of femininity. JKR said “Let my girls be Hermiones, rather than Pansy Parkinsons. Let them never be Stupid Girls”, but the only evidence we have of Pansy being stupid is her love of Draco which she expresses in stereotypically feminine ways. Pansy became prefect after all, so it implies she's academically competent in some way. JKR made Draco marry Astoria Greengrass in the end, because she believed Pansy didn't deserve a happy ending (as opposed to Malfoy who put Rosmerta under the Imperius, allowed Death Eaters to storm the school, and was generally a toxic asshole for the 6 books).

Girls who are more overtly feminine (Pansy, Lavender, Fleur) get short shrift in JK's world. It's only girls who are tomboyish e.g Ginny (who Harry likes for not being weepy) or Hermione who's far above traditional femininity, that are worthy of plaudits throughout. If we view Hermione as an author stand in, then her dismissal of Fleur in HBP is more problematic.

Let's not forget how a lot of people in the fandom treat Ginny as some sort of s##t for having the temerity to have three boyfriends.

**** I unfortunately have only one upvote to give,but it's nice to know I'm not the only one bothered by this. I distinctly remember wanting to throw my copy of HBP across the room after reading that the best thing about Ginny was that she rarely cried. It does feel like in HP there's only one 'correct' type of women. And the way Lavander is portrayed of course doesn't leave any room for doubts as to who is right for Ron. It feels a bit like she deliberately overdid Lavander's character to show how cool Hermione is. And it does't matter that she isn't an easy person to get along with. And of course poor Cho Chang is a human hossepipe.

*** On that note, Lavender's reputation in the fandom is way worse than she deserves. She most likely died for Harry and the DA, yet most people remember her for being a clingy girlfriend when Ron strung her along for two months. She came up with a horrible nickname, and that's apparently worse than a bunch of war crimes (Draco Malfoy) or willingly joining the magical Nazis (Snape).

Hermione has too much of her own stuff going on and I feel may have had to dim her own star in order to appease Ron leading to resentment... or if she didnt, Ron being jealous of her not being home enough or not being the kind of wife and mother Molly is.

***** Within the context of Hogwarts, it absolutely makes sense why people think Hagrid did nothing wrong. This is a school where sending 11 year olds into a /known acromantula habitat/ is an appropriate detention activity. Roping illegal crossbreeds into your lesson plans is pretty mild in comparison.

The way this all makes sense to me is if the X-ratings for dangerous creatures are thought of as just Ministry overlitigation and the average wizard doesn't really give a hoot about it. Like your average dad goes, "Dragons? XXXXX-forbidden? Posh, I had my fingers nipped by a baby fireball when I was your age and I turned out just fine!"

Alright, I'm gunna need context for this one. Either:

1) Harry led the troll to the girl's bathroom. The troll was wondering the coridor and they hid in the bathroom. The troll didn't see them, it just so happened to break into the bathroom. Even if it did go in because it noticed them (I'll check my book when I get home) it was already in that corridor, and would have probably heard Hermione crying. So without them she'd be dead anyway.

2) You're saying Quirrell let the troll in because of Harry, which isn't true, it was let in to make a distraction so Quirrell could attempt getting past Fluffy. The Philosopher's Stone he was after was going to be in Hogwarts whether Harry was at school or not.

3) Quirrell only let the troll in because he was being possessed by Voldemort, which only happened because he turned into a wraith when the Killing Curse rebounded off of Harry in '81. Which, no.

I'm guessing 1 is most likely and 3 is least, but I figured I'd cover all bases since that comment confused the hell out of me.

If a premise is onesided, it is better to execute the one-sidedness rather than trying to pull some roadblocks out of your ass. Hermione in Westeros would be transfiguring 20th-century technology left, right and centre, so if she joins the Stark cause you'll see tanks roll down the Kingsroad while she apparates to King's Landing, grabs Eddard and leaves. If Harry comes back from a future where the war lasted two decades, there will be heads rolling for two days and the main plot of the books is resolved.

If you want tension, pick a premise which is not one-sided. If you do, write it as it would play out unless you can come up with a good reason why it wouldn't be a stomp.

Lucius had a litany of crimes before and during the war. I think Draco is a bit more iffy. He aided and abetted some Death Eaters to get into the castle but one could argue it was committed under duress. He fought Potter and co for the Diadem but it didn't really belong to either of them so it wasn't really stealing. Narcissa didn't really do anything besides keeping prisoners and opposing Potter and Co inside her own home which I assume wasn't illegal at the time since the Death Eaters took over and probably rewrote some laws. I guess she did consort with her sister and such but then her guilt depends on whether people in Magical Britain have a legal duty to report a crime.

Another one would be that Hermione (much as I love her) /is/ extremely presumptive that she knows best based on not a lot of checking in advance. You would think that a smart and motivated girl finding herself in a new culture for the first time might ask everyone she knows about the differences and how things are done, but if its not in Hogwarts: A History, she doesn't seem to be interested - and so continues to be blindsided by certain things all the wizard-raised around her know quite late into the chronology.

#+begin_quote
  Divination: Sybill Trelawney was a Seer, meaning she could receive genuine visions of the future with her Inner Eye. Despite this, Trelawney was generally dismissed as a fraud, but there is evidence that this is not true. Almost every prediction she made, including the ones not made under the influence of Second Sight, came to pass. The only possible exceptions to this were the ones where she foreshadowed Harry's death (though he did technically die in 1998) and the ones she blatantly fabricated for the Quibbler interview simply to annoy Umbridge. While Trelawney had the gift of sight, she lacked the gift of interpretation which is why when she saw a grim (a large black dog) in the cup, she interpreted it as an omen of death rather than the return of a wizard in animagus form. Her most notable non-second sight prediction was probably the foretelling of the death of Albus Dumbledore and the Battle of the Astronomy Tower via Tarot cards. As noted prior, she did also possess the Second Sight like her ancestor, Cassandra. This caused her to go into trances, where she would speak true prophecies before returning to normal. She would have no memory of making the prediction. All things considered, Professor Trelawney could be said to be a rather accurate Seer in spite of her reputation.
#+end_quote

To say nothing of the predictions dismissed by other characters e.g. 13 at table, furst to rise = first to die, which comes true at least twice, her perception of Harry's birthday when her Sight was being confused by the horcrux, or her predictions of frequent student deaths just before a great war took place.

Well, we only hear about this incident second-hand from McGonagall who dislikes Trelawney, so we can't really judge whether or not Trelawney was trying to show off. Minerva thinks so (its implied, iirc), but she's not exactly a neutral party.

Iirc she doesn't predict that the student is /about to die/ anyway. McGonagall tells us that Trelawney predicted deaths, not deaths that were about to happen. Frankly death is one of the most reliable things to predict anyway, no? Given its a world where everybody dies unless they have a philosopher's stone handy.

******* When she's predicting students' deaths, she either she literally means, "hey, man, you're mortal; just thought you should know," or she means that they're going to die relatively soon. There's no real middle ground there. She's done it every year since she started teaching, which she started doing after she made the prophecy, which Voldemort acted on in October of 1991, so the /absolute/ latest she could've started was September 1982, and she's kept this up at least until 1993, by which point none of the deaths she's prophecised have come to pass. I see three possibilities here:

1. She truly does mean either that, "someday, somehow, you, yes /you/ personally and specifically, thirteen-year-old that I'm singling out for some reason or another, will die; I don't know when or how, but I'll imply that it'll be soon," or "I've seen, at least roughly, when or how you'll die, but I won't share with you any details of when or how you'll die; instead, I'll heavily imply that it's gonna happen soon (even though it's at least 12 years off)." Either is followed by an implicit, "now I'm gonna leave you to deal with your newfound existential dread and move on with my day." Out of context, that's a shitty thing to do, and potentially downright traumatic, but it's /much/ worse when you consider the fact that Trelawney is in a position of authority in both knowledge and power.

Harry's pretty emotionally tough for a kid his age (then again, he has more reason than most to take her at her word, so maybe it evens out), but even he freaks the fuck out when Trelawney hits him with this, at least until McGonagall reassures him. It's almost like she's a mature adult who is conscious of that fact that she's responsible for the safety and well-being of children.

1. She's making predictions, which she genuinely believes, of (relatively) imminent deaths that never pan out. Fair enough, I guess but a) she could maybe be a bit more delicate about it than not at all, b) not tell the entire fucking class, and /never/ do that at the same time that she tells the subject of the prophecy about said prophecy, and c) after the first 11 years of her being wrong about this, eventually get the memo not to jump the gun on the 12th.

2. She's lying to make an impression, emotional health and safety of her charges be damned.

At /best/ Trelawney is well meaning but incompetent to the point be a legitimate danger to her students. At worst, she's an abusive monster on a power trip, wowing a handful of children each year at the expense of the health and happiness of whichever kid she's chosen to single out and sacrifice. Either way, not a great look for a teacher.

******** Well, as I said before, the war comes later and a lot of students are killed, so... that adds up.

The fact that Rowling portrays Trelawney as kooky and unpopular but also takes care to have her predict true things, as well as connecting her with the legend of Cassandra, the seer who was accurate but cursed to not be believed, does suggest deliberation to me. It comes across like you're very invested in your alternate reading though, so I'm not sure continuing this conversation further will go anywhere productive for either of us. I'm not sure my points are being taken on by you.

As said, the facts are this: (as told by McGonagall), each year Trelawney predicts a death of one student. We don't know that she does this in front of the class. We don't know that she does it dramatically. We don't see or come across any older or younger students tramatized by having their death predicted. So my take on that is that they aren't - or at the very least that your read on the situation is a reach.

********* We see one instance of Trelawney predicting a student's death. We are told that she's done this with each of her previous classes, of which she's had at least 11. Between "she probably handled the other predictions as she did the one we the audience got to see" and "she probably handled all the other predictions differently than the one we the audience got to see," which do you think is a more reasonable extrapolation?

Trelawney connects herself to a seer named Cassandra, one who is highly respected despite the general attitude towards divination being one of dismissal, in order to increase her clout.

Trelawney is wrong about stuff all the time: she guesses that Harry was born in midwinter. He was born in summer. Fanon holds that this refers to the scarcrux, but a) why would she be able to detect information from it without realising that's what she's doing, b) Voldemort also wasn't born in midwinter. She predicts that either Harry or Ron will be the first to die out a group of thirteen which includes Dumbledore, who dies before either. She warns Neville about his grandmother's health, and she's healthy enough to kick an auror's ass without complication four years later.

She also bullshits her way through conversations, refuses to engage with anyone who challenges her any more than sure has to, makes vague, self-fulfilling prophecies, states common knowledge and acts as if she's giving a prediction, and claims to be outright omniscient, but too polite to act on said omniscience.

'Well, not necessarily by a /fox,/' said Lavender, looking up at Hermione with streaming eyes, but I was /obviously/ dreading him dying, wasn't I?'

. . .

'Well, look at it logically, said Hermione, turning to the rest of the group. 'I mean, Binky didn't even die today, did he? Lavender just got the news today -' Lavender wailed loudly. 'and she /can't/ have been dreading it, because it's come as a real shock-'"

"Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter.

'Let me see that, my dear, she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over and snatching Harry's cup from him. Everyone went quiet to watch.

Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it counterclockwise.

'The falcon . . . my dear, you have a deadly enemy.'

'But everyone knows /that,'/ said Hermione in a loud whisper. Professor Trelawney stared at her.

'Well, they do,' said Hermione. 'Everybody knows about Harry and You-Know-Who.'

Harry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration. They had never heard Hermione speak like that to a teacher before. Professor Trelawney chose not to reply. She lowered her huge eyes to Harry's cup again and continued to turn it."

"'But where is dear Professor Lupin?'

'I'm afraid the poor fellow is ill again,' said Dumbledore, indicating that everybody should start serving themselves. 'Most unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day.'

'But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?' said Professor McGonagall, her eyebrows raised.

Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look.

'Certainly, I knew, Minerva,' she said quietly. 'But one does parade the fact that one is All-Knowing. I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.'

'That explains a great deal,' said Professor McGonagall tartly.

Professor Trelawney's voice suddenly became a good deal less misty.

'If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him-'

'Imagine that,' said Professor McGonagall dryly."

"'So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?'

'That's right,' said Professor Trelawney shortly.

Professor Umbridge made another note.

'And you are the great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney?'

'Yes,' said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher.

'But I think - correct me if I am mistaken - that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?'

'These things often skip - er - three generations,' said Professor Trelawney."

But here's the kicker: none of that, and I mean /none of it/ is relevant. Your original claim was that "Trelawney did nothing wrong." I rebutted with, and I'm paraphrasing here, but bear with me "she's likely traumatised multiple children over there course of her career, which is generally agreed upon to be wrong. Also she's constantly both portrayed as and shown to be a fraud."

Then you responded with "yeah, but if you interpret all of these specific things in this one specific way, you can see that Trelawney, not Rowling but Trelawney, is actually a secret genius," like she's Steven fucking Moffat and you're trying to convince me of a secret good episode.

Besides which, you claim that I'm "very invested in your alternate reading," when my reading is of the literal text:

"Who'd have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I should offer her a pay raise."

Dumbledore, PoA, 426

"Hasn't your experience with the Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is very difficult business indeed. . . . Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof of that."

Dumbledore, PoA, 426 again

********** Just because Dumbledore believes something doesn't make it true. (Also a main theme of the books)

Anyway. You've kinda proved me right by going to this length. I have a view which the official wikia and the text supports. Unfortunately you've not brought me around to yours, and your insistence that you are Right and I am Wrong hasn't really helped on that front, if I'm honest. Everyone reading is free to take their own position, of course.

Fwiw, even from your own example, Lupin /does/ leave the school soon after, and is dead within five years of that point.

Furthermore..I'm not sure if this is an English language thing or not, but "X did nothing wrong" is not an exhaustive statement. I didn't mean that Trelawney never did anything sinful or unlawful or wrong in her life. Just like someone saying "leave Britney alone, she did nothing wrong!" isn't saying that Britney never in her life pushed her sister or talked back or stole a cookie. Etc.

*********** Dumbledore /is/ often wrong, yes, but not when he's outright stating each story's thesis, because that's just not how writing works. Harry believes he's being stalked by an omen of death throughout Prisoner of Azkaban, only to find out that he had misunderstood the whole thing, that it wasn't a literal omen of anything, and that it was a figurative herald of better things to come. Dumbledore then tells Harry that it's impossible to predict the future. If there's any way of getting across a theme more blunt than that, I can't think what it is.

If you're going to say "actually, Dumbledore was wrong, and Trelawney is really a genius," then you might as well add to it "we should be afraid of death," "our choices are meaningless," "stories aren't real and don't matter," and "our impact on the world ceases when we die." Divination doesn't work and Trelawney is a fraud because these are children's books, meant to impart lessons as much as they are to entertain, and the lesson "you can predict or even control the future if you just try hard enough (or are born with a natural talent for it)" is a dangerous one for impressionable kids.

As for the rest: my reply was the length that it was because I provided evidence for my claims. Most of what you've done is state your position and say that there /is/ evidence. On the wiki. Which is not an official source. There's been a new DADA professor every year for over a decade, and at least as long as Trelawney has been teaching at Hogwarts. This is common knowledge that she in particular has no excuse not to know. It's my own fault if I didn't make that clear, but come on: if you see a guy walk into the same restaurant and order the same meal six days in a row, you aren't psychic because you can guess what he'll have on the seventh.

I've never seen someone repeatedly apply the phrase "has never done anything wrong" to an average, everyday fuckup like the rest of us. In my experience, it's generally used for cinnamon rolls (ie Luna Lovegood), people who have done quite a lot wrong but are clearly trying (Dumbledore), or unrepentant monsters (Voldemort). I'm not saying you're using it incorrectly, but it didn't convey to me what you wanted it to. Honestly, I still don't know what that is.

***** Once again I feel like critizing him for not planning things out well just kinda misses the point of his character arc.

He grew up in a deeply racist and abusive household and managed to escape it by making a new family out of his friends. James Potter wasn't just a good friend. He was Sirius's brother in all but blood and quite frankly saved his soul by giving him a way to escape his parents. James Potter meant literally everything to Sirius. The same is true of the other Maurders though to a lesser extent.

So now there's a war on. And everything has gone to shit. James, Lilly and Harry need to go into hiding. Everyone knows there is a spy but no one knows who. All Sirius wants is for James and Lilly and Harry to get through this fucking war alive. So when it comes to decide on a secret keeper he volunteers because he knows he's never gonna break. But Sirius is also clever and realizes the best way to keep everyone safe is to make sure no one actually knows who the secret keeper is. It's an extra layer of protection. So turns to one of his best friends in the world. One of two people he would trust, not only with his life, but lives of the people he loves most (it's not super clear why he thought Remus was the spy but I'm pretty it's cannon that he did and that limits his choices even more.)

Then that person turns out to have been the spy. It turns out that his choice got the only family he had left killed. And what happens when he tries to get revenge? He takes the fucking fall. He is, without trial or chance to explain himself, thrown into prison with what are easily the most horrifying creatures in the entire HP universe. He is forced to relive his worst memories over and over and over again for 12 YEARS. Try to think about how long that is real quick. Imagine what you were doing 12 years ago today, think about how much you've changed, how much has happened in your life. Now imagine spending all that time surrounds by creatures that feed off every hint of happiness you experience because someone you loved like family was a traitor, got your best friend killed, and everyone in the world thought it was your fault. Also you're surrounded on all sides by people you just got done fighting a war against. Just for fun.

Then you see a newspaper. And it shows that the man who caused all of this is alive. No scratch that. He's not just alive, he's fine! He's living with a lovely family that you know. That you fought beside and risked everything with.

Now you are so angry that manage to do something that's supposed to be impossible. You escape.

No one is going to make good decisions after all that. The fact that Sirius managed to avoid capture, the fact that managed to get to Peter, is incredibly impressive.

Malfoy is a garbagetrashchild who does not deserve any sympathy, and shipping him with any of the protagonists, especially pre-character development, such as it is, is Bad and Gross™. He willingly joined a supremacist terrorist organisation and actively bragged about being able to do so. His realising after the fact that assassination is more emotionally complex than he'd given it credit for absolves him of nothing, and seeing him realise that the inherited power he's bandied about with impunity his entire life won't help him when someone outside of its scope and with no patience for his bullshit comes along isn't tragic so much as cathartic.

Also, Bellatrix's portrayal in the movies is so wildly inaccurate to her canon counterpart as to be unrecognisable as the same character, and! the! protections! around! Privet! Drive! are! Wards!!! A ward is a protective enchantment, a meaning which it has had in fantasy before the Harry Potter series had even been conceived and which it will continue to have long after Rowling has run the franchise into the ground (if she hasn't already; YMMV). The word "ward" not being used in canon doesn't mean that it isn't a word in the English fucking language, and kicking up a fuss about correctly applying it would be like complaining about fanon referring to the wands as such if canon only ever referred to them as "magic sticks," or some such.

******* To be fair no one really has that opinion of him during PoA. Maybe for the Monster Book of Monsters, but not for the Hippogriffs or his lessons afterwards, which were extremely tame due to him being overly cautious and depressed/doubting himself. That mainly comes from GoF, when the Blast-Ended Skrewts were introduced (completely justifiable, since they're a Manticore/Fire Crab illegal crossbreed) and Skeeter began writing critical and somewhat slanderous articles about him during that year.

So while your observations are mostly true, it's after the time we're discussing, and I don't think the bar for danger was reached during PoA.

Your response:

#+begin_quote
  sapient is not a scientific term or even a term with a concrete definition.
#+end_quote

Sapient being used to describe humans is relevant, because you brought up that it's "not a scientific term" whereas the scientific definition is that it's a relationship with humans. Just because it's not in every dictionary, since it's not the more common useage, doesn't mean the definition doesn't exist.

The second term is definitely concrete however. Something being or appearing to be wise/intelligent. That's not really up for interpretation and can be applied to animals if they're proven to be intelligent or appear to be. Buckbeak seemingly being able to understand what humans are saying around him, at least enough to know if they're being respectful or insulting, is a sign of intelligence.

Dogs can learn commands in different languages, not understanding the actual words but rather knowing what the sounds and tones mean in relation to what they're taught. Likewise, we don't know that Hippogriffs understand language, just that they understand the tone of respect and insulting. It's possible that, if Malfoy had insulted him in a respectful/friendly tone and did everything else properly (bowing, not looking him in the eye, etc) then Buckbeak would have never attacked.

This is all guesswork, since there's no more evidence for one over the other within the books, but it's quite possible his intelligence was around what a dog's was. I don't recall him being that particularly intelligent other than what was shown in the class, as when Harry and Hermione tried to free him they had to convince him to follow them. Though my memory of the movie scene is better than my memory of the book scene, and it's possible he is intelligent and just didn't realize he was about to be executed.

It's easy to bash him because it plays into people's self insert fantasies and he's one of the only characters to show negative traits that affect Harry (jealousy, mistrust, betrayal). Writing him poorly means making him a slob who never works or does homework, and is jealous of Harry's fame and a terrible friend. Writing him well means writing a flawed character who is growing and trying to do better, which means you need to be a good writer.

  Ron is a better character than Harry
#+end_quote

That sentence has no meaning. How exacly is Ron a "better character". Do you mean in cannon? Do you mean in how people write him? What does "better character" even mean. It's like saying "I'm a better human than you" with no context what so ever. It doesn't mean anything.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

I also relate to Ron more than the other two since I grew up poor and with a lot of siblings and I find him a more compelling character becuase of his obvious flaws. I just like Ron hes like my favorite character. I wouldnt however say I never enjoy Harry centric or Hermione fics becuase I have found some that are very good. I just tend to like Ron centric ones more.
