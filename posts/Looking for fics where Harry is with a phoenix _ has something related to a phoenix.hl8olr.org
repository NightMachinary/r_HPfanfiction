In general, I'm looking for fics where Harry does phoenix related stuff.

Having one as a familiar, as a friend, being a phoenix himself, anything. Be it with Fawkes or a random one.

As long as the story is well-written (good grammar/spelling) I would probably like it.


** I remember one in which he's sent into the past (ca. 1940s) becomes friends with Dumbledore and eventually becomes â€˜Fawkes'. I really don't know what the story was called.

  A strange bird appears in the dungeons. One that is hurt and might be a wizard with a depression. What will happen when he finds out that the bird is the abused son of the hated James Potter? Will he be able to help the boy? And what about Severus' friends the Malfoys. What will they say if they find out that Harry Potter is a Shadow Phoenix that is living with Severus Snape?

** In linkffn(Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad by nonjon), Harry has a relationship with several phoenixes.

Harry becomes part-phoenix in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accumulation of Power by Zyachta).

Girl Harry becomes part-phoenix in linkffn(Rekindled by Insanity-Red).

Hedwig is a phoenix in linkffn(Fate's Gambit by RobSt).

Harry is a phoenix animagus in linkffn(The Next Great Adventure by meteoricshipyards). I've read a few other stories in which Harry is a phoenix animagus, but don't remember the titles.

I've also read a couple of stories in which Fawkes transfers allegiance to Harry, and one in which Hedwig is brought back by the powers-that-be as a phoenix.

  COMPLETE. One-Shot. Hermione Granger has to locate Harry Potter or she'll lose her job. She's more than a little curious what he's been up to the last few years. Perhaps, she'd be better off figuring out where he's going rather than where he's been.

  When phoenix tears aren't enough down in the Chamber of Secrets, Fawkes is forced to take drastic measures. This results in a Fem!Harry with new powers and no control. In a new place, separated from all she knew, how will Harry cope - with her situation, and her new abilities? And what will happen back at home while she's away? At least the local fauna seems friendly.

**** I... hm. Hard to judge but if I remember correctly then no? Yeah. No, I'd say. Maybe google a basic understanding of Gimli, Legolas and Gandalf but no more than that and it's explained anyway I believe. Harry isn't really up to date with what is going on in the Lord of the Rings universe, or the characters, or anything, and sorta learns and figures things out along the way.

My AO3 is down atm but I'll link tomorrow so you can check it out if you want to! The fic is really Harry focused and the LotR ones more a backdrop to Harry's issues.
