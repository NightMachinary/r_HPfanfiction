Professor Lupin walked Lily up the marble staircase and just start to explain another interesting fact about Hogwarts when they nearly ran into something big and black. „Ah, Severus this is perfect.“ Lupin begann.“I just collected Lily Evans here, the new student Albus told us about the last weekend. Lily,“ he gestured between them as to introduce: „This is Severus Snape, he will be one of your teachers who‘ll give you private lessons as well. He teaches Potions.“ Lupin was in a really good mood but this Professor acted quite the contrary. His hooked nose, long and black greasy hair which fell messy out his ponytail, all-black clothing and dark eyes which contracted bitterly when Lily got introduced to him, did nothing to improve her wish to learn something from this man. Moreover even being alone with him made her mouth dry when she saw what look he gave her: disgust.

Lily tried to give him a friendly nod but Snape just threw another disgusted look at Lupin and walked away. Professor Lupin Must have seen Lily's doubts as they proceeded the hallway. „He always looks that grumpy. Severus already had that look on his face when we both went to Hogwarts together, don't mind him too much Lily.“ She tried her best to believe in his goodwill and focused back on following Lupin to the office of the Headmaster from this School. On their way they met students and Lily smiled at each of them but not everyone smiled back. Her insecurities rose with every step they took. She would always be oldest Student here and had extra Lessons with the teachers to shorten her stay at Hogwarts. Would there still be a way of making new friends?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I am no native speaker so my writing will always be the best I can. Anyway I started to write this FF when I was 16.. now I am 29 and the story contains over 120 pages now. But it is still in German as I just recently discovered the world of FanFiction on the internet. In my teen years, HPFanFiction were really rare and most of the time in English which I wasn't to good at, at the time. There were barely any German FFs also, as Harry Potter wasn't that popular yet. So I only wrote the story for me. Until this week when I entered this sub and was happy to find this great community of story tellers with the same interest as I have.

The story does not include the golden trio as main protagonists. The timeline of the story: The dark Lord is still throwing a dark shadow over the magical community. There is no prophecy and Lily and James died as Aurors, fighting with the order of Phoenix against the Deatheaters. They left Harry as a orphan and a wizard family took him in. He has not yet arrived at Hogwarts. Lily Evans, a muggle hr whole live, brought up in an abusive household and leaving this „home“ is a blessing she welcomed in an instant. She discovered her magic at the age of 19 and the ministry of magic want to try to allow older Witches and wizards to attend Hogwarts so there might be more able fighters to defend magical world from this evil. Lily is a model student and will discover that Lupin and Snape both have a dark secret they share.

I work on this piece of crap for over 15 years now. In my mind and in writing. Please, be kind.


** I'm confused about why there are two Lily Evanses. And why is this one nineteen? And I guess no one's told this one about the other one, which seems like it would result in lots of unnecessary awkwardness.

*** It does! A lot of awkwardness.. but well. There is of course a love story involved later but I couldn't handle the fact that children and teachers had something going on. But you gave me some really good impulse on rethinking one of the storylines. Thanks!

**** I enjoy awkwardness, but there has to be a reason for it. It seems like no one told this Lily, “By the way, you're a clone of a dead war hero” which seems like a pretty big thing not to tell someone. Dumbledore is in the habit of not telling people things, of course, but the things he doesn't tell are secrets. Not telling common knowledge is weird. She's bound to find out soon.

***** The piece I translated in the post is only one passage like a teaser. I wanted to know if this storyline could be of any interest. There's a big chapter about how she find out and what it does to her and her stay at Hogwarts. Thanks! In all those years editing this story I never had someone to discuss my thoughts. I am so glad I eventually can share this story with others and actually discuss it. Only by discussing I can improve this FF and make it better :) such a happy day!!
