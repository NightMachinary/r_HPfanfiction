The one I'm looking for is a fic where Harry is a metamorphmagus and disguises himself as a female to go to some party. Dumbledore hits him with a killing curse and he ends up in the past. He ends up living in the past as a female named Phoenix, helping out the Order and even helping to raise his own father. Anyone have any idea?


** I hope you find it. It sounds like a fun read
