I personally didn't enjoy it, but judging from the favorite count at least a couple people did. It's Tropey as all hell if that bothers you.

******** Yeah it went kind of fast into the Uber-cliche stuff but I found the idea of family magic interesting. It was also a different approach, which I appreciated. There's definitely a lot of “oh gods why” though

Black luminary

Pillars of power

Growing up black?

Not exactly what you are looking for but they are about the Blacks and a good read.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

  For the Ancient and Noble House of Black, the height of power marked the beginning of its decline. A game of politics, for personal gain, for the good of everyone... but using Voldemort's rise to prevent a war was a gamble.-- Winner of DLPs January Contest.

**** It's cool. I haven't updated in a good while because life has been very irritating lately and I wanted to do a few short stories and one-shots recently. Though, I'm 7k words into my next chapter (and a bit into the one that follows it), so I'm getting back into the swing of things.

Maybe check it out one day! I can definitely relate to reading finished stories more that incomplete ones.
