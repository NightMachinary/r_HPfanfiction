Maybe it's just me, but a bunch of my favorite fics have been abandoned recently because the authors (many of whom are queer) say they can't stand writing in the HPverse anymore because of JKR.

And idk, I feel like the HP fandom never sort of died out (not completely, though it has dropped off a bit lately) when it comes to fanfics, but it seems like that might change now.


** So I mostly read on AO3 because I find the format easier on my eyes.

The main way I search for stories on there is filtering the ones that are complete and then viewing by date completed and I have absolutely noticed a slow down in *completed* stories. I don't know if that's because stories are being abandoned or if authors are completing things more slowly but there have been days when there are only a handful of new stories.

The other cool thing about AO3 is you can also sort by specific time frames so it would be easy, if somewhat tedious to figure out how many stories were completed in a single month this year and comparing that to last year, 2 years ago or more.

OH and I have also seen authors notes disavowing JK's tweet and basically saying that they don't agree with her and *that* is why they are going to keep on with their stories.

*** personally i think it's taking longer for fics to be completed because the majority of stories i have read in the past year or so or am currently reading generally have the rate of 1 chapter a month or slower yet 95% of them have not been abandon with a lot of them being complete or are on their way to completion and probably will reach it,unless something bad happens to the authors.

I have also noted the trend of fics being planned out or the writers thinking where they want the story to go. As i see less and less of "i didn't like how this story is going, rewrite coming", This probably helps them reach completion.

What it does is basically take any text on a website and change into a uniform, easy to read format. It's the only thing I even use anymore to read fics on either platform.

** There are some ways of looking at this quantitatively. Ao3 gives you the ability to sort fics by date last updated. Of course, doing this doesn't help because a lot of fics last updated in 2020 are going to be updated at some point. However, you can also only include completed fics, which resolves this. This way, you can look at how many fics have been completed each year. The trend is actually the /opposite/ from what I expected.

- 2020: 44533 stories completed
- 2019: 29146
- 2018: 24900
- 2017: 24000
- 2016: 19781
- 2015: 14222
- 2014: 12642

Now, there could be some recency bias here (some authors may update 'completed' works maybe). The big surge in 2020 is probably due to the pandemic. Some of this growth is also probably due to Ao3 drawing people away from [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] (and is thus illusory growth for the fandom as a whole). This is also an incomplete picture in terms of kudos/bookmarks/engagement. I'm working on a more detailed statistical look at the state of HP fanfic over the years.

With all these caveats aside, it doesn't seem like HP fanfiction is going anywhere.

**** I'd love to, but there isn't really a way of doing that with Ao3's system. You can sort by date last updated, but not by publish date. Honestly though, if the story is abandoned or complete doesn't really matter for this analysis, as long as those 'completed abandoned' stories are truly abandoned and the writer doesn't come back and update them (which I'm sure does happen, though hopefully its rare enough to not be noticeable).

Part of my longer term project may touch touch on this though. I'm looking at the HP stories on Ao3 with the most Kudos (probably going to do the top 1000), cataloguing by update and publish date, word count, pairings, etc. I'm just getting started, but so far, most of these top fics were published earlier. Again, this method will have a ton of recency bias since obviously earlier fics will have more time to accumulate kudos. But this apparent discrepancy is interesting and there are a few possibilities that I'm looking at.

** No. I think it's been on a general downward trend since the books and movies wrapped up, but I don't think that has been exacerbated by JK Rowling's views. Not to say that there aren't some writers who were put off for that reason, but I think the majority still fall into the following groups:

- Don't know what she said.
- Don't care what she said.
- Agree with what she said.
- Disagree with what she said, but separate art from artist.

I will do my best to never put another penny of my money into her pocket, but since she doesn't profit off of fanfiction I don't feel morally conflicted by continuing to read or write it.

Honesty, I'm surprised that anyone cares about what Rowling says when it comes to their enjoyment of the series. I mean, if you were to judge a work by its creator, goodbye classics. Hell, goodbye anything written before 1900.

The author seems to be a bit of an old languages buff - the breakdown of the meanings of words in various languages is very involved. I also love all the plot twists. Some of them have enough clues dropped that I love the ‚ÄòAh ha!' moment when I find that I'm right and others really catch me out.

** Very occasionally, but in reality I think the fanfic fandom has been separate for a long time - it's got a whole life of its own that doesn't require JK Rowling to input anymore. I've seen quite a few authors notes commenting on it though, and separating their story from the views.

I think I have noticed a big impact of the pandemic. I originally thought I'd write more now I had lots of time at home, but actually the lethargy that pandemic life has left me with has meant I wrote nothing for a year, and I've felt like quite a few authors have been acting the same.

** I don't think there's been an impact among the fics I read. In fact, in some cases, I feel I've seen more fics.

I think the pandemic has had more of an impact on Harry Potter fanfiction than anything JKR said this past year. People stressed about unemployment or the virus may not be up to write while those who are furloughed and not too worried about money may be able to hunker down and write more. Only one author I follow said anything about JKR. I've stumbled upon a couple fics where the author said something about JKR, but as a whole, I've seen far more mention unemployment or the pandemic.

Personally, I'm glad most authors aren't throwing in a bunch of author's notes about whether they agree or disagree with JKR's tweets. Fanfiction for this series separated from her a long time ago.

*** I had just started trying my hand at writing a Lupin centric fic when I learned about her tweet. It was originally going to be rated G, easily. I heard about her tweet, verified it, and became extremely irritated. I'm an ally, pure and simple. Suddenly that sweet little rated G fic became... not.

Lupin became transgendered, and for a while the story was about his struggle with his identity, pulling from the struggles some m-f friends explained to me years ago. JKR also said there were no wizarding universities but I disregarded that as well and had a group of Oxford students on the wizarding side come together and create a ritual to help his outward appearance reflect who he really was. Human trial one created a hermaphrodite, but a homosexual couple were excited because they could have a biological child together thanks to the discovery.

Lupin's second trial was successful and I gave him an obsession with toys because toys can't contract lycanthropy and he didn't want to possibly transmit even the milder form of the disease that Bill received in canon. Later, Lupin found a nice fey man who couldn't contact lycanthropy because he wasn't human to begin with. That's when the fic turned decidedly adult, not that it wasn't with its other themes, but it went from just rated R to rated X.

I liked my emotional depiction of Lupin so well, it has become head canon for me. Even when he doesn't make an appearance at all, off camera somewhere, is a Lupin struggling with his identity. Now /I'm/ the one struggling because I'm trying to write a fic for the late '70s that would be unchanged from Harry's POV up until Halloween 1981. The struggle is because if Lupin becomes a more predominant character, which I don't see how I can keep him out of this story, is personifying him properly and getting into his mindset that would be compliant with him possibly falling in love with Tonks someday.

As far as trans!Lupin, he often shows up in muggle AUs, usually some kind of college kids situation. I also read one where Lupin isn't a werewolf, he was cursed with a physical sex change and it's a huge secret because weird inheritance reasons and weird wizarding law hangups, so he struggles with lots of dysphoria and his monthly transformations are replaced with him hiding his period.

**** Okay, in the interests of a fair and clear discussion, I will say what I think was valid, and you are free to disagree and correct me if necessary. I am always happy to learn if I am wrong.

I felt it was valid that she was concerned that if all a man has to do in order to gain access to a female bathroom is claim to be trans without any official recognition, it creates a danger for women, particularly in light of her own experience at being assaulted in a bathroom. I can also understand how this could be taken as her saying "all trans women are evil perverts who are a threat to women", but I truly believe that is not what she meant. I believe she meant that most trans people are perfectly safe, normal individuals, but it only takes one person abusing the system to create an issue.

I also think she has a point when discussing how young people who were depressed/low/confused/not in a good state of mind could be influenced by people they speak to online into thinking they are trans when they are not. As well all know, teenagers are both emotional and easily influenced. It would not be a good thing for somebody to be convinced that they are something they are not by an outside influence. If somebody is trans, and they come to that conclusion naturally and by themselves, I would wholeheartedly support them, but if they have been influenced by somebody who has taken advantage of their mental state, I would be concerned.

While we're on the subject, I have seen some people labelling her as "TERF". I don't agree with using this label, as I think labelling her as that is also harmful in its own way.

If I have taken the wrong conclusions from what she has written or have said anything offensive in my explanation, please please don't hesitate to correct me. I would like to be educated better on the subject.

And your feeling in this instance is wrong. It just is. Have you actually looked at the data for assaults in women's restrooms by men pretending to be woman? It turns out that doesn't happen. If a man wants to assault a woman in a restroom, he'll just ... do it.

I do not think that anti-racists are bad, in any way. Please don't put those sorts of words in my mouth. I just think that, in this case, when somebody says something like "ugh, shut up, TERF" instead of calmly explaining why she is wrong, it accomplishes nothing and creates more hate. It's not the same as calling somebody a racist, because racism is pretty much universally agreed to be a bad thing, so does not need explaining to anybody. TERF is such a new term that it can't really be thrown around without explanation in the same way.

And as long as someone merely claims a preferred gender and pronouns, there's likely no conflict.

The clash arises when gender dysphoria enters the picture - and as far as I can tell, it's pretty inextricably entwined with the whole transgender movement. If someone says that they /need/ to alter their appearance, that they can't truly live as themselves unless they change their secondary sexual characteristics, then they are rejecting the idea that those things make no real difference.

As soon as you introduce the idea that someone needs to have a particular body shape in order to fill a societal role - even if that need is imposed from within - you've stepped away from radical feminism. If you feel that you must be a woman because you like lipstick, or dresses, then have you not embraced last century's gender stereotypes? Changing your body because you're curious would be one thing, but changing your body because you feel it's /necessary/ is something else, and not particularly compatible with feminist principles.

Radical Feminism is a type of feminism developed in the 60's, radical comes from the word "root", they believe the root of women's oppression is patriarchal gender relations and they believe in revolution, not reform, to fix it.

Some people make transphobic readings of how radical feminists view gender, the term TERF was actually coined by a radical feminist that wanted to distance Radical Feminism from transphobia by making it clear that they did not represent Radical Feminism as a whole.

And for your other point regarding dysphoria, trans people /must/ exhibit dysphoria. That's kind of the definition of being trans, is being uncomfortable and unhappy in the body and role you were born into. That's a very very quick summation, but that's an intrinsic part of it. I have no idea what you mean by transgender people not being compatible with feminist principles. Which ones exactly, and are they actually followed in the broader form or are they more like ancient commonlaw that only bigots, pedants, and sovereign citizens care about?

Feminism, though, would say that the proper fix is to ensure that all bodies are respected and no one is locked into any particular role by virtue of their body. So, if trans people don't think that it's possible to be free of limitations while keeping the bodies they're in, then they don't really accept that feminism works.

Suppose you were working tirelessly to ensure racial equality, and then you encountered a group of people with dark skin who tell you that they believe they're the same on the inside as the white-skinned people around them - and so, to embrace that sameness, they're going to bleach their skin white. Would you say that their goals are compatible with yours? Or that they've missed the point and are inadvertently perpetuating harmful ideas about white superiority?

All of the data supports transitioning for transfolk. When the tenets of a philosophy - feminism - conflicts with that of science, we take facts over the theoretical.

The fact that you would compare trans people to others dyeing their skin shows an innate misunderstanding of what it is to be transgender, and is the long-winded equivalent of making a helicopter joke, or saying "What if someone identifies as a chair" or some other such nonsense.

Know what you're advocating for, by wishing people would be unconcerned about how they identify? Conversion therapy. You're making the argument, or equivalent, that trans people should just be happy to be who they are and not live their lives in the most fulfilling manner they can. Also, in a manner that does not hurt anyone or infringe on anyone else's rights.

What you've essentially just said, is, "Shouldn't gay people just learn to be happy to be born as they are, and date the opposite sex?"

You're placing the tenets of a philosophy, one that can be ever-shifting, over the absolute plurality of research that indicates that when transgender people take steps (whichever ones /they/ find comfortable and necessary whilst under medical supervision) to live their lives as they feel they best should, they are immensely more happy.

What you are saying is an indirect contributor to the 41% suicide rate statistic, because you're suggesting that - against all data and reason - transgender people stay unhappy in their current living situation for the sake of a philosophy that judging by your personal interpretation refuses to adjust to the modern era.

Again, all you are doing right now is suggesting the equivalent of conversion therapy, and I'm disappointed that you would make that reach.

Pretending like it's not going to happen doesn't mean it wont the fact that "it doesn't happen" also doesn't mean anything because this is a discussion about making changes to who is allowed in restrooms the concern isn't that it does happen it's that it could if we dont address the possibility. Personally, I dont often use public restrooms, so no it's not a phobia of mine. I do understand that it's a valid concern that should be discussed though and I am trying to make you understand that it's not irrational and that discussing restroom safety would be a better alternative than demeening women that are concerned about the possibility (see cameras in toilets for more examples of the lengths men go to, I could come up with more but I'm not going to waste my time just to have you disregard everything I said and tell me I need therapy). I am getting concerned about you, you have suggested more than once that people with valid talking points need to "seek help". Normally people project their own issues on to others, do you have a good therapist? Tell me to seek help again, it makes you sound so sophisticated. Not at all like your gaslighting...

********* I've read bad fanfics with more believable plots than this. You're missing the obvious point that men who want to attack women just do it. They don't need pretend to be trans women, they just wear their normal clothes.

I guess if some rapist comes up with an overly-elaborate plan that before he rapes a woman, first he's going to pretend to be a trans woman, that unnecessary step will at least slow him down, so I don't see how it's a bad thing. I'm picturing some rapist being like, ‚ÄúI really want to rape someone, but first I have to find the right shoes in my size, and how am I supposed to walk in these, anyway?‚Äù If you're more afraid of this guy than of the rapists who are out there in ordinary men's clothes, you're afraid of the wrong people.

You're picturing a man dressing up in heels and a dress. You dont have to wear a dress to be trans you dont even have to look like a woman to be trans whose to say you aren't transitioning and had to wear pants and a tshirt that day, why does he have to dress as a girl at all to gain access, many men grow their hair out these days and even that isn't necessarily required to be trans, it's legal for him to be in there and all he has to do is say hes trans if someone dares question him. You see enough men in various transitions to womanhood in the women's restroom you stop questioning it as a society and eventually it becomes the perfect place for men to gain access to women. No one has said it's a current issue, some people are voicing concerns about a future possibility and in response people like you are implying they're crazy. We could address the concern and start changing the bathrooms instead of telling women they are being irrational, but that would help society as a whole and tearing people down for trying to start a conversation is so much more entertaining.

***** Transphobia doesn't mean that someone is literally scared of trans people. I don't know about you, but I think most people realize this.

You can look up the definition of the word to verify:

trans¬∑pho¬∑bi¬∑a; /ÀåtranzÀàf≈çbƒì…ô/

noun

dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people.

Disagreeing with people's existence is not on the same level as disagreeing with someone for disagreeing with people's existence. There are people who disagree with black people not being second class citizens. I'd hope you wouldn't equate someone arguing against such a bigoted take with the racists as if that were the same thing.

The other point where I get concerned is when someone is no longer allowed to believe that transgender philosophy is mistaken - such as JKR asserting that womanhood is about biological sex, citing a number of concerns with changing that, and having people explode in fury, boycott her books, etc.

I get a real "Emperor's New Clothes" vibe from the whole movement. And it occurs to me that the kiddie story doesn't actually depict what would happen if the ministers of state and other government officials had stood their ground and said, I don't see the clothes.

************ First of all, there's no such thing as "transgenderism". Being transgender isn't an ideology to be converted to. It's just a thing that some people are, just like some people are gay or lesbian.

Second, you're wrong. Transgender people still existed. They might not have had the words to express it as we would today, but they existed. Look up, for example, the Roman ruler [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus#Marriages,_sexuality_and_gender][Elagabalus]], who, while by no means a good person, is reported to have "delighted in being called Hierocles's mistress, wife, and queen", and is one of the first people on record requesting reassignment surgery. Or you could look up the clergy of Cybele, which included a type of eunuch called a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galli][gallus]], who "castrated themselves and wore women's clothing, accessories and makeup, [and therefore] some modern scholars have interpreted them as transgender". History is by no means devoid of trans people.

**** I'm pretty sure that this comment was in response to a since-removed post from another user (no longer in this thread) calling trans people some pretty terrible names (?) I just noticed heff17's comment has been downvoted a lot but the context has been completely lost.

** I think that there are still a lot of fics, both new and continuing... but they're just not as good as the older ones. For one thing, most possible plotlines have already been done a thousand times, so everything feels a bit derivative by now. For another, the stories that came out, or at least started, before JKR turned a magical world into a McGuffin hunt (i.e. before book 6 dropped) are FAR better than the trash that resulted from having to deal with her obsession with trinkets. And finally, I think that most of the stories that come out now are some combination of bad slash-fics or pairings of terrible people (Snape, Draco, Voldemort) with their favorite character, Marauder-era, or dealing with Harry's kids, and I find none of that interesting.

tl;dr: No, I don't think there are fewer fics. I think there are far, FAR fewer decent fics.

Although from what I've seen, the people there aren't likely to be more sympathetic.

If you want to defend JKR's comments, I'd suggest studying them more, so you can explain yourself more clearly, rather than just making yourself sound like a bigot on a rant.

********* Genuine question. Do you take joy in being hateful? Does it bring you happiness, to purposefully go out of your way to attack someone?

Do you spend your time on street corners yelling slurs at black people, just because it sounds like fun to you?

I'm actually curious, because I can't wrap my head around someone being so intentionally vile and taking pleasure in their actions.
