I'd love to see some fics where a main character (anyone we know in canon) is good friends with Fred and George so we learn more about them. Preferably no fem! Harry please. Thank you


** This one is a whole lot of fun:

  Fred opened the book and began to write. He only got a few words down before the diary absorbed them, the ink vanishing without a trace, prompting George to lean in closer to observe.“Maybe this is some elaborate joke on Ginny's part to educate us on proper brotherly behaviour?” George mused, just as new words began to appear on the empty page. Well, that seemed a bit ambitious for a first-year...‘Hello. May I know who I am conversing with?' Or: What if the Weasley twins had been the ones who found Tom Riddle's diary?

** Unfortunately, the fic which most came to mind to me for Fred and George is a Fullmetal Alchemist crossover, and since you're asking for canon characters interacting with them I assume that isn't what you're after. I can still give you the link though if you want.

However, I do have two other fics that I really like the Fred and George in:

“Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay” (linkffn(13230340) and it's on AO3 but I don't have that link handy). They aren't main characters, but I definitely liked the fic's versions of them.

They aren't main characters in “The Prince of Slytherin” either, but the fic also does a lot to flesh them out as separate characters. But also that fic is /long/ and some people don't care for it (I personally didn't like the prologue and love the rest, but YMMV), so I'm not sure if that'd be something you want to bother trying to read. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027][AO3 series link]] and it's also on fanfiction.net, with a link to that version present on the AO3 page.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
