:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This was one of my absolute favorite fics, and it was taken down about a year or two ago from AO3 - it was a WIP 8th year fic that featured Remus/Hermione and was very slow-burn. A couple of chapters still show up on Google when you search the title and author, and I can see snippets of the text, but the fic is gone and the author has removed all the fics from her account.

Is there a way to find this fic archived somewhere else, or does anyone happen to have a saved copy of what had been posted?
