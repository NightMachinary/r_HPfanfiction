:END:
im looking for a fanfic that I can vaguely remember.

Harry goes to gringotts after killing Voldemort and fakes his death, taking on a new name left for him. he works with dragons in Romania and creates a charm that summons supposedly extinct mini dragons. only Hermione and Charlie know he's alive, she becomes his sister and he leaves everything Potter related to her in the will.

Charlie/harry slash

they both end up working for Hogwarts after a duel with Severus in the great hall, snapes the headmaster.

anyone know what story I mean?
