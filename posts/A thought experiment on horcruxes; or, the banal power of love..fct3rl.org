When Voldemort was obliterated in 1981, it took him 13 years to regain a body. This involved a series of threats, possessions, and wacky schemes.

If Harry had a horcrux, Hermione would have helped make it, made nice notes on the restoration ritual if she were indisposed, and Ron would drop a hand in a minute if it'd get Harry back. He likely wouldn't be down for more than a week.

The real power of love is having people you can trust with your dark ritual who sincerely want you alive.


** You say love, I say the power is not being locked up. Otherwise, Bellatrix would have certainly jumped through any and all loops to revive Voldemort.^{^{/s}}

*** If she had known about the horcruxes, yeah, but he didn't trust her enough to tell her about them. How locked up was he? I thought he was just a wandering spirit most of the time.

Or you meant her, she would have lain low until she could revive him if she had known about it, not attacked the Longbottoms and risked getting caught.

******** I can't remember exactly how he knew to look in Albania (I think he went back to Albania after Philosopher's Stone, and that's where Wormtail found him). It's possible he overheard it during his time at Hogwarts. But I believe it's mentioned that he tracked him down once he was in the area because Voldemort was possessing animals, and Wormtail could communicate with/sense the distress of the rats in the area while he was in his animagus form. They were running away out of fear of being possessed themselves.

I need to reread the books, it's been a while, so I don't know how much is accurate canon info.

********** He's definitely clever and intelligent. I think his cowardice and lack of loyalty overshadows that for a lot of people, and people hate him, so they tend to write him as a cowaring, backstabbing moron who is just above a squib in magical prowess. In reality, he's at least above average intelligence and magically gifted, able to keep up with the other Marauders in becoming an animagus and contributing to the creation of the Marauder's Map. He's just also fearful and only looking out for himself. He'd rather survive and support the winning side than die to protect his friends.

A really good characterization of Wormtail is in linkao3(A Marauder's Plan), which is also one of the most well-written fanfics I've read. He outwits Remus and Sirius a few times, using their emotions against them, and somewhat plays both sides by leaving them some clues to try and get on their good side in case they win against Voldemort. Voldemort actually tells Wormtail to send them those clues, but Wormtail includes more information than Voldemort technically told him to send. It shows him being a lot more intelligent, strategic, and manipulative than most fanfics, and really canon too.

Also the fic is like 800k words long and only covers 4th year. It covers a lot of information and subplots, though, so it doesn't drag on (at least for me).

*********** Yes... Somehow I view wormtail as what could have been Snape if Lily weren't around to be his 'conscience '(his only redeeming quality for me. But even that is questionable for me too). It's a shame that wormtail don't get spotlight often when even Bellatrix gets a reformed/good guy fic.

Thanks for the recommendation, btw

** Bellatrix, Crouch Jr. and I'd imagine a lot of other Death Eaters would have revived Voldemort within the week if they knew how. The real kicker was that he was too paranoid to tell them how he was really going to beat death. I wouldn't say paranoia and lack of love are necessary to come hand in hand, or else Moody would be an even bigger sociopath than Voldemort.

*** Considering how some sold out others to prevent jail and veritaserum can be used, there's a valid reason to not tell people of his method of immortality.

The problem is he never had a back up plan 'if I get killed, this how you'd revive me'. V is a narcissist and believes him to be all powerful that no one can kill him.

The Horcruxes are an insurance, a just in case thing. he never planned on using until That Halloween happened and he probably didn't think he'll be disembodied.

** Indeed.

- There is at least one fic where there is a love-based Horcrux ritual.
- Hermione being Hermione, I would imagine she might come up with a better method, my favorite hypothetical less-evil alternate methods for Horcrux /creation/ are:

1. Use Time-Turners to induce stable time loops, where the Trio travels back in time, one at a time, after creating their Horcruxes so that their past selves can murder them to create their Horcruxes (e.g. Harry murders future-Ron to make his Horcrux, does the Ritual to bring Ron back, then Harry takes his (Harry's) Horcrux back in time so that Hermione can murder him to make her Horcrux, etc.)
2. Determine the minimal aliveness of target needed to be murdered by experiment - perhaps murdering a less sapient animal is sufficient.
3. Use the less competent Death Eaters or Sufficiently Evil targets (e.g. those who commit certain crimes against children) for the murders.
4. If one has the time, they each make two (regular IRL or Hollywood-science) clones of themselves. They each murder one to make the other into a living Horcrux. Use the Horcrux bond to imprint the clone with their own minds, widen it so that it is functionally a hive mind if possible. When the clone is old enough, repeat for the clone. This way, none of your bodies ever has less than half a soul, and you always have one body in your hive mind that has a complete soul, which hopefully offsets the insanity. If possible, make the graph of your horcruxes a complete graph, so each body is every other body's Horcrux, and if you order who makes who a Horcrux correctly, each body has a total of one soul in it.

In particular, if you have n bodies total numbered 1 to n, body 1 has 1/2^(n-1) of its original soul, plus 1/2 of body 2's soul, plus 1/4 of body 3's soul, up until 1/2^(n-1) of body n's soul.

The latter finite series sums up to [2^(n-1) - 1]/[2^(n-1)], and when you add the soul fragment of body 1, you have exactly 1 total soul.

Similarly, body two has the same sum, just with the terms rearranged.

This is achieved by the following algorithm:

1. The nth clone-batch (counting the 1rst clone batch as the original body being born) has (n-1) + (n-1) +1 = 2*n - 1 clones in it.
2. The first n-1 clones are killed by the pre-existing n-1 bodies to make the new Horcrux clone their respective horcruxes.
3. The latter n-1 clones are killed by the new Horcrux clone to make the previous n-1 Horcrux clones their Horcrux, starting from the newest clone (the (n-2)th clone gets 1/2, the (n-3)th clone gets 1/4, and so on).

** In theory yes but I think Harry couldn't have created a horcrux that said I don't think you can truly love and create a horcrux. A horcurx would require you to value your own life and yourself more than anything else. And even if somebody else would love you, it would be a twisted love as the one that Bellatrix has for Voldemort. So, I would say the power of love is that it keeps you from creating a horcrux in the first place.
