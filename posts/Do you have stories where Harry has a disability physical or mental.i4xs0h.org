** I can't recall the name, but there is one where Harry is blind from the curse hitting him in the eyes when he was a baby rather than the forehead.

*** Calling him blind is a bit misleading, though, since he has magic sight that makes regular sight (when he experiences it in a Pensieve) look washed out and mud-coloured.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

Here ya go. I always highly recommend Saving Connor. The first book was an itty bitty bit dry but that's just me and I do refer faster paced books. It gets very interesting very quickly though!

** I don't remember what it was and it wasn't really serious but there was one where Harry had Multiple Personality Disorder

It was sorta weird. I don't remember much but there was something to do with the founders. I remember in the summary it said something like 'four founders and pot brownies' It was something...

There was also a more serious one where Harry has multiple personalities due to the Dursleys' abuse, but I can't remember the name for that one either.

  AU: JKR portrays Harry as completely unaffected by trhe Killing Curse cast at him, but how would things have gone if it had been different? Drabble series, five drabbles per chapter.
