Title might be strange, but I'll explain.

Was thinking about this when I was driving, and thought how cool would it be if Voldemort had a right hand man type person that did all the particular nasty killings for him. Voldemort is still a nasty guy in this, but he has someone he can call on that is loyal and able to kill and do things that he needs done that he can't do. Then I thought what if that person survived the final battle and remained in hiding. What if that person still killed but the killings had seemingly no links to one another? What if this person after years of not making a mistake got complacent and messed up?

I've been itching for a good Auror!Harry story lately, and if we combine the two, it would be amazing to read as Harry connected the dots.


** So basically Bellatrix Lestrange turned up to 11? Full batshit insane, throwing Fiendfyre around and doing atrocious rituals requiring the impaling of babies? Stuff like that?

*** No more like someone he would call upon to do something quietly.

**** Yaxley? He always struck me as more reserved compared to Bellatrix.

It could be an OC!

It was just a thought I had!

****** So like if Voldemort had a Mike Erhmantrout type character working for him?

** Death Eater internal affairs. Voldemort uses him as a secret police to spy on and kill his own people and allies when needed. His allies and other Death Eater's can't know about it because it would cause problems.

It would be pretty funny if that were one of the things Snape does for Voldemort.
