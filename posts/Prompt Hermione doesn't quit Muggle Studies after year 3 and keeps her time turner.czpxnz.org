How would year 4 and onward play out if looping back 2 hours and invisibly helping your past selves is an option?

Or getting out of a sticky situation by disappearing and leaving one hour earlier?

Or organizing the entire Order and a group of aurors a few hours before the annual Voldemort encounter.

I just want more time madness than a single scene....

Edit:

Obviously it'd be rather overpowered, so to balance it Voldemort has to get access to a time turner too... (Damn you Rookwood!)

In a universe where time turners are common enough for thirteen year olds, the Ministry probably runs on people doing thirty hour days to get paperwork done before it's filed and aurors prepare for a mission hours before they get the call to deploy somewhere.

See, that is the thing which ruins one-sided premises. Don't escalate it into an arms race of overpowered-ness, let it play out as it does dicated by logic.

Also, given the canonical "you cannot alter what has already happened" constraint, there is not that much you could really change with the time turner. The TWT tasks stay the same, Hermione does not know about the resurrection and Cedric until it is done, she cannot save Sirius (although she might facilitate an escape through time to prevent that encounter from happening if she smells the trap) and so on. It would allow for more preparation time for Harry (TWT, DA), but he already has enough time, just poor time management.

*** Actually Sirius would be savable. Remember that he vanishes through the veil, so if you could make him invisible and stop him passing through you can save him.

As long as things appear the same you can set up a stable loop of the preferable option being what always happened.

** "Why had she taken it with her? Why had she not brought it up?"

These were the thoughts running through Harry's mind as he thought back to the disastrous Department of Mysteries fiasco.

Hermione had been hit with a curse that shattered her time-turner. While uninjured she was pulled into some sort of time loop.

Harry looked back and decided then and there to avenge her.
