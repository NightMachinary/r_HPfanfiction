Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash (Though no Voldemort paired with anyone, only one I could see is Bellatrix, and that's only because they're both so crazy).

His behavior/attitude can be totally different than canon, or not.

Can be on ANY site.

Can be angst, dark, or not, I don't care.

Can have a good ending (where the Good Guys win) or not.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.

Would rather not have Lord Potter-Black-Malfoy, Harry, NO Harem Harry, et cetra, if possible.

** I read a really good Tom Riddle recently who's an extremely cunning businessman, makes friends with Malfoy despite his halfblood status, carefully manipulates the press to get what he wants, sells "miracle cures" to muggles and he's an amazing duelist.

And he's Tom Riddle /Senior/.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4536774/chapters/10325370][Warning Signs Read Desolation]] by minidraken - possibly abandoned

There was also Hit the Ground Running by Tozette. I have no idea why the author took it down, but there's a EPUB/MOBI copy [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=Hit+the+ground+running][here]].

I'd recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/614577/chapters/1108217][In Death, Standby]] by Sophisme---it was abandoned before the Harry/Voldemort pairing even started, and what's there is still worth a read, in my opinion. It's pretty amusing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2296544][Lithium]] has amazing Tom characterisation, but it's somewhat one-sided Tomarry. They're not together (Harry is dating Cedric; either pairing might be endgame).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12490736/1/Come-Together][Come Together]] by oniforever which is a HP x MCU crossover specifically Captain America the First Avenger where Tom became a solider in World War 2. This is my absolute favorite characterization of Tom Riddle I have ever read.

** Patron by Starfox5

Has the right level of evil but is clever, proud, witty, and generally one of the most intimidating villains I've read, fanfic or no

** *self-promotion warning*

In my Last Mage of Krypton series ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][Part 1]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12357124/1/Rising-From-The-Shadows][Part 2]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564837/1/A-Distant-Storm][Part 3]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12831094/1/A-Challenge-Unexpected][Part 4]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13202563/1/The-Kryptonian-Grimoire][Sidestories]]), Voldie returns several times but because he takes over living people from the second story onward, he uses fragments of the displaced soul to repair his own, leading to him gaining extra traits (such as Gilderoy's appreciation for theatrics and knowledge of how clothes send messages).

End result? A calmer, saner and more dangerous Voldie, especially after he teams up with Gellert Grindlewald and they go on a road trip around America (not kidding and played seriously. They're seeking Obscurials...).
