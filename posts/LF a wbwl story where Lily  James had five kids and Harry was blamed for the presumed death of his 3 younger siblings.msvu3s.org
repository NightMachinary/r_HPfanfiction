:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic last year and for the life of me, I can't remember what it's called or how to find it. I'd like to read it again, as I remember enjoying it even though it was incomplete.

Here's what I can remember:

- It was a Harry/Ginny fic (I think - I'm kinda 50/50 on whether or not I remember that)
- The Potters had 5 kids - Harry and his twin, and 3 younger ones two of whom were also twins
- when Harry and the wbwl were 10, the latter accidentally let werewolves led by Greyback into the Potter home (something to do with wardstones). The werewolves took the 3 younger siblings and Harry went after them. Everyone assumed the younger siblings died and Harry was blamed as a junior Death Eater or something stupid like that
- Harry and the younger 3 changed their names and were adopted by (I think it was elves? Or goblins, I can't really remember) and didn't come to Hogwarts until 5th or 6th year)
- There was a Dumbledore POV chapter where he did some pensieve-shit and found out that Harry's twin was born on August 1st, just minutes after Harry was born making it impossible for him to be the Chosen One
- I think Harry had some goblin armour and fought his Death Eater doppelganger (I'm kinda hazy on that one) in Diagon Alley

If you know about a fic like this or know what I'm talking about, please let me know! I enjoyed reading it last time and would like to have another go of it. Also, since I remember it being incomplete if anyone adopted it I'd like to read it too.

Thanks!
