Looking for a fic with this premise, where maybe Hermione is obsessed with malfoys goings on, maybe she catches him in the bathroom like harry did, maybe he confides in her instead of myrtle and shes sympathetic and helps/talks him out of it.

Without dumbledore/potter and weasley bashing. But also without everybody being buddy-buddy with no conflict, that's OOC and worse than bashing imo.

** I think Clean by OlivieBlake is a 6th year that fits at least your broad requirements. I haven't read it so I can't be sure, but her work is generally excellent.

** I really don't like Dramione as such (because it doesn't make much sense to me without deep credible repentance, which nobody bothers to write), but the only exception (and it is not really Dramione) is linkao3(Beyond the Silence by JuweWright). It is really beautiful.

*** I mainly ship harmony, but I think 6th year has potential, if Hermione can be his myrtle, maybe talk him down?

Dumb reason but emma Watson and tom Felton are so cute together and it made me want to read dramione.
