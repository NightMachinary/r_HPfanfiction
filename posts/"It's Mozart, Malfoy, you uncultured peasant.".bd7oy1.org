** "You mean that wizard composer muggles are so fond of?" he asked. "You ought to be careful making statements of taste. Not all of his work filtered down to the rabble. My favorite, for instance, is his /Symphony in D/."

(You think you have one leg up on Malfoy, but you can't beat him in a game of snobbery. He was born and raised to do this sort of thing, even if it means lying. Had he actually heard /Symphony in D/, he would have known that there was a very good reason it was lost to time.)

** I went to a party with a bunch of very rich, very cultured, very smart kids ages ~24-30 and even though they were way more sophisticated than me they were also extremely adept at making me not feel bad about it. Like if it came up they'd typically have a charming story about how they discovered it. I think the people who act like Malfoy are putting on a show and actual old money is confident enough they don't go around calling people uncultured peasants.

********** Electronics don't work in magic rich environments. Not to mention they wouldn't have any service, anything even vaguely electrical would short out as soon as it passed the ward line.

The reason for that is never given in canon, but I like to think it's an old ward scheme that prevents lightning striking biuldings by completely arresting the flow of electrons outside living things within the wards. It's so old nobody even remembers what it does, it's just included in all wards because it's got to be ‚Äòsomething'.

Buy vinyl records of the music you want to listen to.

**** The wizarding world was never really explored, and only stuck around Hogwarts. I think that's the main gripe I have with the books. The idea of wizards and witches' population being only a few thousand, or even just hundred thousand, is just absurd. These are people, too, and they breed just like any other person. Their numbers should have risen to millions easily in the hundreds of years of their civilization. To say otherwise is just... absurd. Especially with magic that could potentially make a woman super fertile. The Weasley matriarch is a perfect example.

***** There's so much of that world JKR could've elaborated on, but I kind of understand that she was trying to tell a specific story and too much worldbuilding would result in 16 books, not 7. I know she is trying to, um, update the story, but she could've done a better job (that wouldn't have caused a fanbase rebellion). Yeah, I find it hard to believe there aren't more Wizards living in muggle areas. The Ministry probably is having a hard time maintaining secrecy ;) I'm actually surprised they have for this long. At some point, some kid is gonna tell her muggle friend as a "super secret you can't tell anyone" and it all just goes from there.

****** I understand, but larger populations also tends to have wizards and witches innovate just like the muggle world. Better magical spells, better wards, better everything. It just seems hard to believe that a ten thousand population exists when the wizarding culture have been existing for hundreds of years. It should be millions of them.

******** The closest I've ever seen to a fanfic where millions of them existing alongside muggles is that Percy/Hp fanfic. Can't remember the name, but it's a femHarry. Either way, I like the idea of millions, perhaps billions, existing alongside the muggles in the cracks of reality, like a Dyson sphere of a mutated earth parallel to Earth, attached, but not attached. It's a good twist to their civilizations and cultures, and portrays their magical ability to magic everything.
