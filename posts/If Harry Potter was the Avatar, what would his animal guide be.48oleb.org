** Depends on what kind of fic you're going to write. Is Harry born/transported to the Avatar world? Or does Avatar stuff/characters happen in the HP world.

If the former, then you need to decide what will be Harry's primary element (Air for Aang, Water for Korra, Fire for Roku e.t.c.). For me Harry feels like Fire would suit him best, he's headstrong, courageous to a fault and has incredible will

As stated by Iroh; /"Fire is the element of power. The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will and the energy and drive to achieve what they want."/

Which describes Harry very well.

Therefore, his animal guide needs to be connected to fire in some way, therefore, in my opinion, the Phoenix is the perfect animal guide.

1. It can transport anyone anywhere, so it is still considered a rideable mount technically.
2. The phoenix features heavily in Harry's life as it's part of his wand core (as well as Voldemort's), Fawks was a friend to Harry and saved him in the Chamber, Phoenix's represent rebirth, Harry died at the end and was brought back, double meaning if he resurrects as a Fire Nation citizen in Avatar world.
3. Phoenix tears heal wounds, which is something Waterbending can do in Avatar world.

Hope this helps. :)

** Well, just combine two animals that are related to Harry in some way. You have: Lion (Gryffindor), Snake (Parseltongue), Phoenix (Fawkes), Toad (Neville's), Horse (Centaurs/Thestrals), Dog (Sirius/Fluffy), Wolf (Remus), Spider (Aragog), and the already mentioned Owl and Stag.

You also have to consider what element (fire, earth, water, air) that Harry would hail from and base the animal around that. Water = Polarbear Dog. Air = Air Bison.

I personally like the idea of a Spider Horse because of the small reference to the Nordic myth of Sleipnir, an eight legged horse with a connection to death (similar to Harry). This choice also steers clear of the obvious picks and doesn't go into the unbelievable like Phoenix Lion would.

**** Harry should have died as a baby. He only survives the killing curse because of his mother's sacrifice, causing the near death of Voldemort. I think this is plenty enough reason to say that he has a connection with death.

Edit to add: I was also not connecting anything to nature with my suggestion. I said a Spider Horse references a myth, not embodies it.

***** By that metric like a tenth of the human population has a "connection" with death, given the rate of potentially life-ending events in infancy. "I almost died" is not a connection.

He has no connection to death until much, much later. As evidenced by him not even being able to see Thestrals.

Edit: and this is without going into spirit animals being aligned with elements.

****** Just because he has not physically seen death does not mean he doesn't have a connection. Being the first to survive the Killing Curse is something I would give more clout to.

Animal guides don't have to be aligned with an element, though three out of the four avatars shown with a companion (Aang, Kora, and Roku) all have a creature related to the elemental country they hailed from. There could even be an argument made for Wan's as well.

This is all silly though, because the Spider Horse does not need to be similar to Harry in such a way for them to bond. Horses in some cultures have been attached to both the elements earth and air, and there are plenty of magical variations of horses that could link them to whichever OP desires. Again, I simply liked the reference it made and could even be used as foreshadowing if you want to take it that far or you could not take it anywhere at all.

My point being that a human so aligned with death that freaking /Sleipnir/ would be their spirit animal would have had no trouble interacting with creatures such as Thestrals.

Again, "I survived" or "I almost died" /is not a connection with death/. Any more than "I nearly drowned" connects you with/gives you power over water or "I was in a house fire" connects you with fire.

"Animal guides don't have to be aligned with an element, the ones we've seen just happen to be"

And that is the point exactly, that their spirit animals are gifted/drawn from their elemental background; pets/companions that are only something more because they're owned by an Avatar. Aang has an Air Bison because all the air nomads had one. Roku had a dragon because the fire nobility owned/rode dragons. Korra has a polar bear dog because polar bear dogs are a pet/work animal in the Water Tribes. They're not mystic, and making them mystical (well, more mystical than the Avatar world already is) and/or unique creatures is sort of missing the point imo.

Which is the long way round of saying that if Harry is to have a spirit animal, it should be a common (by worldbuilding standards) animal that's owned by more people than just the Avatar.

No where did I suggest this. What part of reference are you not understanding?

Death shaped his early childhood. He lost his parents, he earned fame, he became a pawn in a war, etc. Without the attempt on his life, everything in his life would be different. Having a connection to death does not mean he's tethered to Death or the afterlife. It simply means that death is apart of what makes Harry, Harry. Then later in his story, yes, his connection can be taken a bit more literally.

Again, I never said anything to dispute this. We clearly agree on this. Water = Polarbear Dog because that's where it lives and that's where she's from. I also never added any mystic properties to anything. I think you are completely missing the point of my original comment. I thought it was a cool idea, because it /referenced/ a mythical creature. That does not mean they are the same being or that they are even related in any way.

What common riding animals are there in the Harry Potter series? Thestrals and hippogriffs are the only ones I can recall being ridden on. So, if we go by muggle standards, we get the answer of: a horse. Assuming that the OP wants to have a magical or unusual flair to that, my suggestion of a Spider Horse still stands.

Unless the setting takes place in the Avatar's world, in which case any suggestion works as long as the OP can explain it well enough.

** Harry? A flying sloth. Because he always ends up having weird shit happen to him, why should that change just because he gets a power upgrade?

Well, either that or John Constantine. Now that would be a laugh.
