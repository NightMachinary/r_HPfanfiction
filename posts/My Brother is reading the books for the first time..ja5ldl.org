If he ends up being really interested in the series, what are 1 or 2 good fics for each common trope in fanon? I want him to get a general idea of what he is interested in. He's 13, so no M fics and only low T fics.


** A Ravenclaw Harry raise in Azkaban fic

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

** Hmm... A good fem!Harry fic is The Pureblood Pretense linkffn(7613196) which also includes Slytherin!Harry and is well written and rated T iirc. I got through book 3 and there was no smut at all, maybe some violence. If you want something funny, I really enjoyed the Adventures of Harry Potter, the Video Game, Exploited linkffn(9708318) It's sort of a crack fic, but the writing is decent and if he's ever played a video game he'll find it funny.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter. HIATUS
