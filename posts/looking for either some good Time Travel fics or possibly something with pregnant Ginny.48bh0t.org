I've read the Bonds of Time series, and loved it.

Linkffn (8076284)

Now I'm looking for something else. I also read The Past Always Catches Up by Hopefulled

linkffn (8163947)

any suggestions of stories similar to these?

** Time travel is my favorite HP fanfic setting, and I like following stories:

*Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855): Harry went back 1975 and turned Bellatrix. The story is creative, credible, funny, and contains tons of intrigues. I like this one even better than *Backward with Purpose*.

*Ginny Returns*, linkffn(4740107): Ginny went back alone, and finished off Voldemort in a very efficient way.

*Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059): is mostly from Hermione's POV on a time-traveling Harry, and how she came to terms with what Harry did.

*The Evil Overlord List*, linkffn(10972919): someone died in the 2010s, turned up in young Tom Riddle's head as Jerry (Harry?), and started guiding him towards world domination.

*Three Turns*, linkffn(9757451): Harry & Hermione time travel to the Marauder era.

*One Hundred and Sixty Nine*, linkffn(8581093): One of the best Hermione in Marauder era story.

*A Little Child Shall Lead Them*, linkffn(10871795): A great story showing how 'Hermione traveling back to Marauder Era should have worked'.

*The Moment It Began*, linkffn(3735743): Snape's second chance with Lily.

*His Greatest Wish*, linkffn(6548167): Another Snape/Lily story, with heavy James Potter bashing though.

*Oh God Not Again!*, linkffn(4536005): is quite funny.

** Time travel is one of my very favourite tropes.

Linkffn(The Last Marauder)

Linkffn(Roundabout Destiny)

Linkffn(4692717) is time travel, but it also goes beyond the timeline. I'm not sure how to explain it without giving the story away.

Linkffn(Sands of Destiny) is a WIP.

linkffn(Pride of Time) has Hermione staying in the past.
