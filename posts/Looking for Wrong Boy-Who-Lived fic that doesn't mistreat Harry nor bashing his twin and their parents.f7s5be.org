I dont find fic where Lily and James neglect Harry appealing, but the concept of wrong bwl does intrigue my interest. My ideal fic is Harry and his twin become supportive and protective of ech other, btw. Thanks in advanced!

I'd say this is probably the best WBWL fic where that supportive-protective sibling aspects comes in. It does start bashing and neglectful, but that's as much Harry retreating as the parents fucking up, and it resolves in probably the best way I've ever seen a serious fic do bashing ever. Even if you find it a bit cliche and bashy in the beginning, I thoroughly recommend you keep reading.

YMMV though, I admit. I'm not as vehemently hating of bashing as most in this fandom, so my tolerance and views may be less forceful than yours. Taste is relative and all that. :)

**** Fair. And no need to apologise - I never really understood why anyone would get bothered over someone else's opinion of these characters. There's something in canon to justify every interpretation, and something in canon to both praise and criticise every interpretation too. Your opinion is your opinion, my opinion is my opinion - they don't really affect each other. You hating Dumbledore doesn't offend me in the slightest, in the same way that me liking Dumbledore wouldn't make you not hate him.

And for the record, people can love their children and neglect them too. It's not overly common, but I work in Youth Mental Health and have seen it happen that parents are told "Oh, you're not doing this thing when you should be" or "You're treating your child in this way and that's wrong for them" and the fog suddenly clears from the parent's eyes as they realise they fucked up. Like when you find out that there's certain foods you're not supposed to feed a dog and you've basically been unintentionally poisoning them (not that I've done that, but I've volunteered in a vet surgery in my town and seen it happen ridiculously often). And back to Harry, if you add the lure of celebrity there, it is possible they could get caught up and just not realise they're neglecting the non-famous kid.

*** I like bashing only when the character deserve it, such as Dumbledoor (sorry if you are his fan). Lily and James on the other hand are both devoted parents who died protecting Harry so I dont feel like they would neglect Harry while showing favouritism to the other twin just because he is the supposed bwl
