Alright... I recently read the first Alexandra Quick work... and I do not really see what the big deal is. As far as I can tell she is an americanized Harry Potter, for lack of a better analogy. So my question is, does the series improve? Or will I have to lug through a series that reads as if Harry was Female and American? Because if that is the case I would rather just read something else.


** I read all of them and I am very much looking forward to the next story, but BOY is Alexandra annoying. If you find her to be an annoying brat, stop reading, it won't get any better at all. Seriously.

*** She gets better. Marginally. By the fourth book. And though her defiance is sometimes irritating to readers, one can always sympathise with her and see where she's coming from.

** I'm not sure that's quite fair. None of the characters from any of the Harry Potter novels ever show up, as far as I remember, and the plots are totally different. I've read several American female Harry's, and I don't think this is one of them. I'll agree with you that I didn't find it as good as most people seem to, though. My problem with it is that when I'm reading fanfic, I want fanfic about the series. I feel like this is fanfic only in name. Change a few spell names, and it could be sold as an original work.

*** I approach it more as an original story, and that helps.

** The first book is a /long hard drag./ Read the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th to see what the hype is about... Inverarity really improved his writing between the first two books.

** The first one doesn't do much more than set the world. The plot isn't very large scale and nothing huge seems to be happening. Hell the entire first story is just about her getting detention over and over. But the second one starts to add some really interesting characters and ideas and the third one does that again (though she's a bit annoying in the same way in this one but in a different way), but then the fourth one after a certain ways into it takes the best of everything done in the series and applies it for a really awesome arc and things really click and her character seems a lot less annoying in general. Book 5 promises to have more moments like that.

Alexandra is kind of annoying at first because she gets in trouble so much when it's obvious that she shouldn't be doing things or goes off on her own while ignoring her friends, or obsesses over something or other. But it really clicked for me when I realized what an key part of her character it is and while she's foolhardy she's also a go-getter and is willing to go to ridiculous lengths while saying "fuck you" to the consequences no matter how bad it gets and that's more interesting that Harry having Hermoine doing all of his prep-work for him. She isn't a perfect character she has her flaws and a lot of her strengths also come with those flaws, but she becomes more well-rounded as she gets older while still maintaining that attitude.

** Good question, I was bothered by some similarities as well. I posted a month ago about AQ:

#+begin_quote
  AQ Series has a lot of original plots, but I see some plot points in AQ's life that are similar to HP's life: Neglected child with a prophecy about them, secretive headmaster and Snape-like professor, abused elf who becomes her friend, gets a broom as a gift, broom gets destroyed. There are probably some others I am forgetting.

  My questions:

  First, are there enough similarities that it feels gimmicky, like the author is saying "hey look! She's just like Potter!"?

  Second, if the similarities between HP and AQ are a bit overdone, does it matter?

Here is the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3afam0/two_quick_queries_about_alexandra_quick/][post]]. You might find the responses I got helpful. Overall, it is a really original fic, and I found it enjoyable. I did have trouble getting through the first book as well though.

** I have to say, I made it about two thirds of the way through it. I kind of enjoyed it (and I REALLY enjoyed Houses Divided, Inverarity's other work) but the fact that ALL of the teachers except for the groundskeeper had it out for her was just so wearing. It was like every professor at Hogwarts was umbridge and snape--a little animosity is good, but that much surrounding her at all times was just so wearing.

** I read them because they're pretty good and highly recommended. I never could get into the world or characters and found it to be a good story in a fan fiction-y way.
