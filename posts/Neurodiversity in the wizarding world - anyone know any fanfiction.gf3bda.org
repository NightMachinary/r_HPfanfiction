** There was one fic where Harry was a trained musician before going to Hogwarts. He needed to "hear" the magic before he could cast it. Went into music theory quite a bit.

***** I think this is "The Secret Language of Plants" series by Endrina where Harry has ADHD. It's a lovely series, would highly recommend.

I can't seem to find the missing ones, but these are the ao3 search results for ADHD and autism. I think I might try neuro* next. Not to be patronising - I'm just considering another dip into it myself.

The best fic I can think of is one where Remus has dyslexia, although he doesn't know the term until much further into the fic. His muggle mother can't cope with a werewolf son after the suicide of his father. Consequently, Remus arrives at Hogwarts very rough around the edges and refuses to participate in classwork at the start of the fic. I think I'll make a post asking for it, as it pains me that it's not in my bookmarks.

  Sirius broke out of Azkaban a month before Harry's eleventh birthday. After finding Harry at the Dursely's he realized that Harry has social anxiety, so he became Harry's service dog. Keeping what he really is is harder than he thought it would be as Sirius accompanies Harry to Hogwarts. Especially when it becomes clear that Harry has a knack for getting into trouble.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!
