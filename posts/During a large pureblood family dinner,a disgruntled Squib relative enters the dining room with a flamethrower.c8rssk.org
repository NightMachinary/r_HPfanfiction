** The desperate attempt of Horatio Malfoy died a quick death as his half-brother cast a flame-freezing charm. Lucius eyed the squib with disdain before spitting at him.

"This is the reason why you are a disgrace for this family. Not your lack of magic, but your inability to carry out even a simple murder. Let me show you how it is done."

A green light was the last thing he saw.

** I Have an idea that is similar to this,in which a squib encounters a Death Eater and states /"My AK is better than your AK"/

The death eater starts the killing curse only to stop halfway as he's cut down by the squib who whipped out an AK-47 and lit his ass up.

*** Bringing an assault rifle to bear certainly takes longer than whipping out a wand and casting a curse. At least if you don't disregard gun safety. A revolver would be faster since you can operate the safety and cock it quickly with one hand. It should be faster than a long spell. But not an AK-47.

** I'm not sure if this is canon or absorbed fanon, but aren't all wizarding areas similar to Hogwarts, in that electronics malfunction? Like, if you try to bring any kind of electronic device into any kind of magical area, like Diagon Alley, or an old pure-blood family home, it will cease functioning?

This would only be an issue if the flamethrower has a lot of electrical components, which I'm actually not sure whether or not a flame thrower has to have electrical components?

Certainly not, otherwise they wouldn't be able to hide a magical district in the centre of London. In canon, only Hogwarts has that effect. In fact, Arthur fixes an electric fireplace with a spell.

Most didn't. You had two pressure bottles, one with compressed gas which acted as the propellant and one with the fuel. You had a small flame burning at the nozzle (sometimes fed by a small tank), which makes the entire thing fully mechanical.

*** Unless a piezoelectrical ignition counts as "electrical component", then no, they don't need them, and even then you could probably hack something up. Modern flamethrowers were first used in WWI, after all, and they don't need to do anything fancy.

**** They didn't even use piezoelectric igniters on many if any back then. Their pilot light was a different fuel source flame. Completely mechanical utilizing pressure to push out the napalm or other fuel source across ignition source. But the throwers didnt last as log as they did in films. I think they had like... thirty seconds of fuel?
