Looking for long fics that have a nice build up on the romance. Preferably with Harry and another guy! (Snarry...)


** I'll link you my best Novellength Snarry fics. Don't know if they are really slow burn but you might already know them

Time travel (Snarry) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3188624]]) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032]]) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]) This fic is called the boy who died a lot. I wasn't immediately hooked but after some time I got really into it. I laughed. I cried. Really good fic. Also this is Snape pov.

Maybe that one too Snarry once again. Post-war. Harry and Snape swap bodies. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16848688]])

Drarry. Amortentia fic. Harry is oblivious. (17k) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13818327]])

  When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

  Harry doesn't believe his Amortentia's scent is correct, and starts questioning the potion and his feelings. Of course Malfoy, of all people, is the one to answer these questions.

  Sequel to Forgotten. A/U from mid season 9. Castiel is human and wounded, and Dean and Sam need to get his grace back - and his wings. Things do not go as intended and Cas faces a difficult road. Long case fic with strong emphasis on Team Free Will friendship/family bonds. Will get serious and angsty and lonely. ALERT: There will be two versions of this fic, Destiel and platonic. This version (Flight) is the Destiel version. Slow build and mostly pre-Destiel. The platonic version will be called Broken and will be posted later.

*** It linked the wrong "Flight" so here's the link to the fic I meant. It's a bit different than waht you wanted. Voldemort pov. But very good. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056]])
