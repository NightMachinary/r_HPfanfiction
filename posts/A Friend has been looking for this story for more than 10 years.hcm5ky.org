:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry buys a bunch of trunks which are larger inside, but it's an experimental version, or something like that, and there's a chance the rooms could be connected. In the last chapter or so, he steps into his wardrobe... and ends up in Hermione's bathroom. Just as she's stepping out of the tub, or something like that; anyway, he gets an eyeful. It might have been leading to an H/Hr pairing, but that could just be because of that last scene, Can't remember enough to be sure. Ring any bells for anyone? It's at least a decade old, probably older. Shalon Wood

I'm pretty sure that it is not Harry Potter and the Dimensional Trunk by Ophiuchus [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2456938/23/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dimensional-Trunk]] or Not Normal by Radaslab [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7144149/64/Not-Normal]]

--


** See that's the twist. My first thought was the story Not Normal by Radaslab as that was the one story I read that Harry had experimental doors installed that connected his trunk to other trunks that has this door installed. So Harry could go from his trunk to Hermione's trunk (in her bedroom). Which means that he could catch Hermione coming back from the bathroom but not end up in the bathroom.

Are you sure Harry's appearance is due to the trunks?

I know in the story Overlapping Dots by canoncansodoff Dobby transports Harry to where he can take a bath to listen to the egg. Problem is it's the 4th year gryffindor girls bathroom as Hermione enters for her bath.

[[https://canoncansodoff.fanficauthors.net/Overlapping_Dots/index/]]

There's another story (that I'm checking for) that has Harry apparating directly to Hermione without knowing where she lives. He catches her having just finished shower/bath. Besides catching her naked/or almost Hermione is more surprised that he could apparate to a person which is "impossible". Hopefully I can narrow down my search terms to find the right story.

**** Yeah, while it sounds like it could be smutty, OP doesn't say it's smutty which would have been helpful if it were. This leads me to believe it likely is just asking for a friend. Also, if it was smut I'd have guessed Radaslab as the author, based on my memory of them being one of the two writers who wrote a /The Harem War/.

** I tried searching for stories with connected trunks. It seems I've read four. There are the two stories by Radaslab called Not Normal and The New Normal. There's a story called Harem of Honeys by Rotary File. And Finally there's a story called AU_Harry Potter is The Guardian, Balance and Protector by jordan_easton94 (but this last story is a Harry/Fleur story and Hermione isn't in it).

I've provided links to all four though I'm leaning towards these stories "not being it".

#+begin_quote
  Harry's destiny has taken a sharp turn from what was intended. At age seven, he figures out that he can make things happen at will, like magic. He uses this ability to counter his bullying cousin, Dudley, and form a gang of his own. Harry's gang is composed entirely of female members -- except of course for Harry himself. They band together to protect themselves from the Dursley gang, and form a life-long friendship that is almost like a family. When he received his Hogwarts letter, Harry James Potter is a strong, confident young man. A young man who takes his duty to protect his girls very seriously. Lucky for him, one of his girls has a cousin visiting at the time he receives his letter, and that cousin just happens to be a fifth year witch. This fic is taken over from szordara and his fic Harry Potter and the Harem of Honeys with his permission!

*** I'm confused. As far as I remember in the story Harry Crow, Harry doesn't have a customized trunk, didn't purchase multiple trunks, doesn't have any type of specialized door or portal. And finally I don't recall a scene with Harry walking in on Hermione. (If I remember correctly Hermione joins Harry in the shower after he fights in the pit, not the other way around).

Now without a doubt I could have missed something but how is Harry Crow the story the OP is looking for (though it would be great if I was wrong and it is the correct story)?
