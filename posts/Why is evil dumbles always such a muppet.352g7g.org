Is it weird that I just want a fic where the manipulative bastard version of Dumbledore is as competent as his good guy counterpart? It's like an unwritten rule that if Dumbledore isn't a good guy he must start the fic by picking up the idiot ball and acting in a way that makes it very difficult to believe that he could ever achieve the level of puppeteering that the fics usually accuse him of.


** It's because the closest analogy to an evil Dumbledore is having Gandalf become possessed by the One Ring. You're talking about a stupidly competent and capable bad guy with oodles of power at his disposal who, not only is one of the foremost pieces on one side of the chessboard, but has the capability and connections to manipulate the other side into playing straight into his hands.

Now imagine, for an instance, that you're Harry Potter, reluctant teenage hero extraordinaire. You've just had an accident that has somehow cleansed you of whatever means of control Dumbledore has over you. Your next move will either result in your liberation or your re-enslavement. Somehow, you luck out due to reasons (goblins, MI-whatever, Hermione, take your pick) and have just figured out how deep the rabbit hole goes when it comes to Dumbledore. Trouble is, he's beginning to suspect that something's up...

This is normally where Dumbledore whacks himself with the idiot stick in a typical bash-fic. He screws up, dismisses it as a slight blip on his radar, cackles manically to himself whilst polishing one of his many, many, many horcruxes or goes back to remembering when he backstabbed that schmuck Grindelwald, whatever. Point is, he doesn't do the logical 'I have read the Evil Overlord list and know how to react to this' thing, which is to neutralise the nascent threat and put his plan back on track. No, he just plays along without a care in the world.

Now, if he were an actually competent antagonist, making it past step one undetected is impossible. He would not solely rely on the testimony of a drunkard when he has oodles of obscure and useful magic at his fingertips. No, the drunkard is there as the obvious security measure that detracts attention from the nastier, more insidious ones hiding in plain sight. The second anything Harry-related happens, Dumbledore's entire office would light up like a christmas tree. Should he not be there, he would get notified by magic mirror about the situation. If that fails, he can review the in-depth report an autoquill would have prepared for him come morning (written in an obscure Latin dialect, encrypted via hieroglyphs he designed specifically to make it appear like a list of ancient egyptian wizard jokes rather than what it really is) before deciding on which course of action to take. Harry's every thought would be recorded, his words transcribed and analysed for subtext following the alert and his body would be under close scrutiny 24/7 from then until the plan comes into fruition. Should he so much as move a hair out of place, Potter would be toast; obliviated, reprogrammed and potioned faster than you can say boo. And even if Dumbledore himself is dead, he can still have others carry out his instructions for him. Being evil, he will have had more than a passing experience with ensuring absolute obedience over reluctant mages no matter what else happens around them.

In short, a competent evil!Dumbledore is basically an actively malicious Vetinari with uninhibited access to incredible magical power. To get even more overkill than that, you'd need to give Voldemort absolute control over the entire world's arsenal of WMDs.

So there you have it. Evil!Dumbledore is a scary motherfucker. To give Harry, any version of him, any chance whatsoever at winning, you need to nerf Dumbledore's intelligence something fierce. Otherwise, you need to make Harry the God Emperor of Mankind just to give the kid a chance.

**** I kinda like the fact that he's not all goody-goody in canon, actually. It's one thing Rowling got right- the best teachers and mentors in fiction are those that have more than a merely confrontational acquaintance with the other side of the fence and not just in a 'the abyss has stared into me/I have fought too many monsters' kinda way.

Actually, a good character with similar flaws to canon Dumbledore's would be Rupert Giles-he's seen and done shit that would probably have seen him labelled as evil and Dark, but in the end he became so much better a Watcher for it-even then, he still has the occasional catastrophic fuck-up in the BTVS series to own up too, but it would have been much, much worse for Buffy if he took after his fellow watchers more. More importantly, he understands the consequences of failure.

I think that that's why Dumbledore chose to take the opportunity Lily inadvertently handed him. In the end, it was one child versus an entire underground civilisation. Though he knew he would never forgive himself for it, knew he would never be forgiven for even thinking about making the plan viable, he still went through with it because, to him, the future of the magical world was worth more than his or anyone else's life. And though he died for it, set Harry up to die for it and probably talked Snape into dying for it as well, he probably hated himself for doing so. He didn't mind so much that he died doing the right thing, but he never struck me as the kind of guy who wanted anyone other than himself to have to deal with things in such a manner.

But he did. And it's heartbreaking to see a man with such good intentions have to do this to people that trust him just so that the world he loves gets to live to see another day. And you end up hating him even just taking in the canon perspective of things. And you can bet your bottom dollar virtually every person in the setting who knew what he'd done would hate him for it too.

But he still did it. Because he was as much a hero as Harry would become in DH, in his day. And though he settled down, it turned out that fighting bad guys only became harder when you no longer fought them head on. But he fought on. He died to make sure Harry had a fighting chance, knowing that he would be loathed by those he had dragged into the abyss with him and that he was little more than a footnote in magical history, knowing that he was more than likely damned by his choices and actions in his later years.

But he did it anyway. Because it was a better chance than they'd ever had. And someone needed to do it. So he did.

And that's what makes Dumbledore one of the great mentors in fantasy. He showed Harry exactly what Heroes became in the end. He showed him the good that could come of it through Hogwarts. The bad through his own death, the war etcetera. And everything in-between too. Dumbledore taught Harry everything he knew about being a Hero the hard way.

And that, to me, is what makes his character just that little bit more awesome.

But if either a not-so-evil (preferably sane) Voldemort, or some powerful character who wasn't important in the canon story-line can help Harry get out of Dumbledore's clutches, there can be some interesting drama starting from there.

Personally, I'd love to read a story where Harry is 99% doomed because of all the intelligent evil people either trying to kill him or control him.

***** I was reading that very fic when I realized that it was the first time I could recall reading about Harry escaping a manipulative Albus without Albus being a complete derp. Albus's only real mistake was thinking that Barty was Moody, which the fic handles rather well by having moody actually be Barty's godfather, and a man that Barty grew up initially trying to emulate. It also seemed completely reasonable that Barty would empathize with Harry's childhood given how his own father was.

Not the biggest fan of the fic taking it in the direction of allying with Voldemort, but I haven't finished it yet, and It may surprise me.

There are inconsistencies in the books about Dumbledore's knowledge level. He didn't know anything about the CoS stuff, may or may not have known anything about the whole Quirrell business and definitely knew nothing about Barty Crouch. Yet he was, as you put it, supernaturally intelligent and foresighted in ultimately arranging the DH plot. I will, however, point out that Dumbledore's plan was only valid until Harry sacrificed himself. He had no plans for Voldemort's ultimate defeat,and the Elder Wand Shenanigans weren't of his planning. He didn't even know whether Harry would come back to life or not.

Some of it, maybe, but he fundamentally /could not/ have planned the Elder Wand's journey, because if his plan had been to be disarmed by Draco, then the Elder Wand would not have switched loyalties to Draco, which means that, at best, he could have planned for Harry to find and destroy as many horcruxes as possible, then martyr himself to eliminate the last one (perhaps granting sacrificial protection to others, so that someone might kill Voldemort). He might have /hoped/ that the Elder Wand would become loyal to Harry somehow, but not planned it.

My headcanon is that Potterverse is not an indifferent universe, and, with apologies to the late Martin Luther King Jr., the moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends towards Voldemort's defeat. Dumbledore knew this, so he set things up as well as he could, and then trusted the hand of fate to take care of the rest. In other words, it was his WIS stat, not his INT stat, in effect.

***** Fair enough, my mind made a rather sharp right while processing your statement. What I meant to say was:

His actions do often seem... bizarre. His level of competency seems depends on how you judge his actions;

I don't think he's a very good Headmaster of a school, but I can't really say how good he was at being a Chief Warlock. Sirius being imprisoned without a trial is a massive count against the wizarding world's judicial system, but he's only a part of that not the whole. I assume there was muppetry involved, but it could easily have Lucy not Albus that was to blame. He does seem to be very good at setting Harry in motion and shaping him into the sort of person that can pull off what needs to happen to defeat Tom, though I suppose that could be attributed to luck.

** I think there is also a level in the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore. In the books, Harry really relies on his Headmaster...both as a person and a guardian figure. To make Dumbledore a competent bad guy, to make that evil twist believable, would involve a level of betrayal or heartbreak on Harry's behalf that is conceptually hard to create. It's hard to go there, and it's really hard to read about it in Deathly Hallows.

I think that's one of the reasons why evil Dumbledore is such a popular trope...even if you "knew it all along" his back story was really crushing and Harry definitely felt betrayed. That's a difficult emotion to handle.
