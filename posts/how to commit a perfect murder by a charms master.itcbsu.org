1: kill someone

2: put the person murdered into an alley way corner or something

3: place a fidellus charm around them/on them while placing the secret keeper as a random passer by who you asked a favour from

4: obliviate said passer by

5: *nothing* ever happened - wink wink nudge nudge :)

your welcome one and all may you go round offing your enemies spilling their guts down into alleyway corners like a good person.

****** ah, well ive got you there - it is the unlikely murder that always escapes - if you were to murder with a pre-abrihamic ritual sacrifice then you cant be pinned because nobody will be able to guess the correct cause of muder other than the individual injuries and of coarse 'who would use a unknown pre-abrihamic ritual sacrifice to murder someone'.

sorry lad i have a really twisted sense of logic sometimes which although twisted worse than a bent spoon is also some of the weirdly correctest logic a person can have. have a good day.

** I don't know about others, but I have this headcanon based on how the Potter murders happened that there is a trade when you set up a fidelius. As it's literally 'trust' and you bind the secret in their soul magically, any sign of distrust or lack of faith in the secret keeper will destroy the secret.

Things like additional wards or obliviating the secret keeper shows lack of faith. It is explicitly stated multiple times that in magic, belief that it works is a core component. It is also my headcanon of why James and Lily couldn't be their own secret keepers, when it works at other times. They were told about the prophesy and it tainted their subconscious, making them believe they couldn't keep themselves protected...requiring them to choose someone who didn't know not to believe. Also answers why Dumbledore couldn't do it.

**** Well, it does both. Harry literally can't see Number 12, Grimmauld Place in OotP until he's given the secret. And the secret only has the fact that it's HQ to the Order, so it's not even that the location of Number 12 is the secret. So a Fidelius, at least when applied to a location, removes exact knowledge of the location (you would likely remember there being a house between 11 and 13 if you lived there, but not anything exact), removes the location's existence from anyone's perspective who isn't in on the Secret, and removes the knowledge contained within the secret (even if you knew of Number 12's existence prior to the Fidelius and that the Order HQ was there, you might have vague memories of something being there but wouldn't remember the Order being there).

** But obliviating the secret keeper implies you don't trust them, which completely breaks down the entire charm.

**** Well, I don't think it is in canon, but if it isn't the charm is way to powerful.

My head-canon is that any preventative measures that show a lack of trust in the secret keeper break the charm, which includes using yourself, and having the keeper hide under the charmed area.

Although your method /does/ work if you have an accomplice... *wink wink, nudge nudge*

*** ah some may say this, but some may say that the perfect murder is total annihilation of the populace - 0% possibility of witness testimonies then and nobody can speak up against it. your right in saying that it is a good solution but a even better solution would be having some annoyingly complex scheme nobody would guess as it is so annoyingly complex hence you cant be pinned and you have the satisfaction of knowing it

** okay but what are the limits of the fidelius charm, can you fidelius a spell? an idea? a concept? because if so any dark lord could just fidelius something stupid like "hurting me or my supporters"

(also why didn't tom put his horcruxes in a fidelius)

*** im pretty sure the limit is it has to be a tangible, at the very least semi material (im thinking ghosts) thing, so you cant hide a concept or an idea with it but hiding something say a person should be within the bounds of it.

and the reason why is because we dont talk of thank.... 'hint hint nudge nudge plot hole nobody fought to fix or truly exploit in the creation of the story (which really annoys me, this spell to me is like the reparo charm - so broken and yet so grossly underappreciated)

so to answer your question he could of 'but harry had to have some way to defeat voldi RIIIIIIGHT' so it was completely ignored and used as a plot devise for the potter murder and that was it i believe in cannon.
