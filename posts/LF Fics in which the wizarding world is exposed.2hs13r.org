I'm about to finish my latest obsession and I want to jump into something else immediately afterwards.

Ideally a fic in which something occurs to make it essential to reveal (or difficult to hide) the existence of witches and wizards in the UK. Longer fics would be preferred with the main focus still around Harry or at least another canon character. Aside from that I'll give anything a go.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** Was going to recommend this as well. Unfortunately it updates so slowly that I stopped following it. It's also powerful!Harry, so if they don't like they won't like Emperor.

You might try AngelaStarCat's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/717542/AngelaStarCat][With Strength of Steel Wings]]. It updates regularly (last update was a few hours ago) and though not the greatest writing every, there's a lot of it to read: 617k words WIP.

  A young Harry Potter, abandoned on the streets, is taken in by a man with a mysterious motive. When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry) (SEE NOTE 1st Chapter)

** Along the same lines of Emperor is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards.]]

It takes quite a while to get into the muggle world, like a long time, but when it does it's pretty good.

*** A fun guilty-pleasure story, albeit one that's been described as having "jumped a tank full of sharks with frickin' laser beams."

**** Haha ya it's pretty crazy, especially after the events of Hogwarts and it starts to deal with world events.

** There's the Albus Potter series. He's currently up to year 6. The first book deals with the reveal and it's woven through all the books though most of it is at a hearts with Albus being that age and the main charachter.
