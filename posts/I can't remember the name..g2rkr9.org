:END:
There was a fanfiction I read where I think Fate or Destiny or maybe Death, sent Harry and Hermione back in time as a married couple. Harry was the son of Tom Riddle and the daughter (I think) of Grindlewald it was explained as Tom and her adventuring for dark knowledge and Tom and her having intercorse and tom leaving her in the tomb to die.the second time its explained shes pregnant with Toms child who is Harry and her living for some reason. I remember there was a scene where Abraxas Malfoy and the Blacks are telling him who his father is, I think Abraxus or Arcturus (Sirius's grandfather) is telling him who his dad he is pretending he doesn't know who (pun unintended). I remember Harry saying something to the effect of "grandmother (or great aunt) didnt approve of my father, i think he is a muggle" and one person laughs a Malfoy cousin, Walburga is horrifed and every one else is either schocked, horrified or both.

Thanks for any help I'm quite new to reddit and sorry for formatting whatever that means but im sure it applies somehow.
