y'all got any fics where the durselys aren't as bad as they are in canon. not like they're a happy loving family or anything just no cupboard or excessive chores. it could be for any reason really like dumbledore paying them or maybe they understand magic just the slightest bit more. I'll take whatever y'all can give

thanks!!


** there was a crack fic I somewhat remember. the durselys liked magic because baby harry's accidental magic made petunia's chest grow a few sizes. they became trailer trash and had 10 kids by the time harry was 11. vernon lost a lot of weight because all he ever did was bang his wife.

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home. AU. COMPLETE with epilogue!

** Linkffn(6443663) is a great fic. I got a good portion through it before I quit (not because it wasn't good, but because of my own personal preferences), and I fully recommend it as a good Dursley fic. It is slash, though, in case you don't like that kind of pairing.

** The Dursley's in canon weren't that bad. Most of what we see in the FF community is greatly exaggerated. The argument to this is that saying they were only a little abusive is hardly an endorsement. Which is why we also have to consider that most of what we see of them acting in such a manor comes from books 1&2 which are both children's fantasy and use the tropes of that genre. Most significantly that of the evil step parents.

None of this is an answer to your question. I'm only meaning to say that in the Harry Potter series got a re-write from the bottom up in the Young Adult tone of the later series, than the cupboard under the stairs would be cut. Harry would still be the unwanted house guest, but without the fairy tale beginnings.
