I don't remember all the details, but the basic idea was after the war Harry/Hermione/Draco all got together, and were living together, I forget why, but the ministry didn't like them, sent a group to kill them, Hermione was critically wounded, Draco put her in stasis and they did a ritual to let them go back in time (each took in one of the hallows, fawks joined at the last minute).
