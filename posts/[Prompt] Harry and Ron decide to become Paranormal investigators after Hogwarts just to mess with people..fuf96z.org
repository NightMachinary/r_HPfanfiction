Can you just imagine them going to haunted places and just messing with people to keep the legend going? Levitating objects? Piece of cake. Orbs? Just a very weak Lumos. Footsteps without a source? They called in a friend and lent them Harry's invisibility cloak. A full-body apparition? Moaning Myrtle wasn't doing anything this weekend.


** Hermione badgering them to join the minstery

** I mean, I can see it happening, but I just want to point out that that's essentially Muggle-baiting. You're freaking out Muggles, maybe harming them psychologically (and physically, if they end up getting locked up as 'insane'), which I find generally not nice to do.

I see the joke and the appeal, but when I start to think it through, I find it way less funny :/

*** It was meant more as a joke. They aren't there to torture but more keep superstitions and ghost stories alive.

**** I mean, as I said: I do get that, but I feel like that it's really hard to pull this off without it getting icky super quick. Maybe I'm just a snowflake tho
