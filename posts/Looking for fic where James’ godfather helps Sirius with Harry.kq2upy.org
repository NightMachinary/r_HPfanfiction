I think it started at the end of a trial where Sirius was freed and he sees James Godfather in the audience. He approaches Sirius and helps Raise Harry. His wife comes too.

Harry is young, but not toddler.

They move into a townhouse and James godfather and his family (of which several are parselmages) work to find the horcruxes. Family being cousins and nephews and part of there conclave.

There is a painting of James and Lily that is hung in Harry's room where they can talk to him. At one point, Harry has a box that contains a set of prophesy orbs.

It may have been a Big Bang or quantum bang story, but I can't find it on Quantum Bang.

I don't think it was a time travel story.

*** Yes. Thank you. I've looked at the synopsis of that story 20 times and thought that wasn't it because of Arcturus being it.

Thanks!
