I'm planning some one-shots based on abusing fanon tropes, but I don't fully understand how they are generally used. Obviously, there's probably a dozen different ways they are used.

With marriage contract fics, in your fics (or ones you read)

How are marriage contracts entered into? Do all parties have to give consent? Informed consent?

What are the consequences for failing to honor a marriage contract?

What riders can be placed on marriage contracts?

Any other details about them you can think of?


** Usually the contract is set up between two peoples parents or other ancestors (With no two people able to fulfill it the contract remains until it can be). The trope usually comes with the Lord Potter thing as well and the contracts are used to make alliances with other families. The punishments for breaking it can include things like forfeiting your title and place on the Wizengamot to the offending family as well as a sum of money. (This is why the Weasley's are so oor despite being an old pureblood family.) Sometimes there is a set age where they have to have children/get married etc. Usually the males family pays the brides family also but not always.

** Basically, make everyone entirely unmotivated.

- Some random ancestors made a marriage contract about children they didn't have because, ... because why not.
- This contract definitely can't be broken and does not expire, because, ... well, just because.
- It so happens that after 527 years, now is the first time that the conditions apply, and it's Harry and Daphne because, ... I mean, the author wants them to hook up, so there.

I think that about covers it?

Or did you mean in a historical sense. In that case, they were drawn up for the purpose of alliances. Family A has a daughter, they want to win influence in family B, so they (meaning, fathers -- children naturally don't have a say) draw up a contract stipulating the marriage of daughter A to son B when they are old enough. The idea is that nothing creates stronger bonds than family -- which, incidentally, is why the notion of creating a contract when no offsprings to marry off are around, until some indefinite time in the very far future, makes absolutely no sense at all. The point is not the contract, it's the marriage.

And obviously, contracts can be dissolved if both sides agree they should. If only one side wants out, they can try to buy their way out, or, if they just break it (depending on what kind of legal system you have -- from sophisticated to none) pay a fine or invite some more hands-on response to restore honour.

** Penalties can be anything: economic, social, magic, life, etc. We have magic to arbitrate this, so go nuts.

Most of the riders can be anything, because they are mostly used as treaties/agreements.

There's two types I've seen for the "A wild Marriage Contract Appears!":

- "There's no way in hell this is ever going to happen, the treaty is done, we're happy." (spoiler alert: it happens to both protagonists of this fic!)
- They actually want it to happen, but the stars haven't aligned yet.

â€‹

The most agreed common concept I've seen requires the Ancient and/or Noble family system. Family A wants to enter an treaty/agreement with Family B. They don't have any eligible members for an equitable marriage, so they make up a contract and post it for POSSIBLE members/heirs down the line.

** You can, of course, change it however you like, but most that I've seen go something like this:

- Marriage contracts are almost exclusively used by (Ancient and) Noble families, and while some may consider the practice archaic those who follow it and those who don't isn't always based on which houses are "light" or "dark."

- The heads of family get together at some point to create a contract between the families. Usually in fics, at a certain age a child of the house (usually the heir) is encouraged to start looking for a partner. The head of the family may provide them with a list of suitable options, or more likely give them free reign as long as their chosen partner is approved of.

- In writing up the contracts, the biggest focus tends to be on how inheritance is handled. There may be a clause dictating the must have /x/ number of children, usually to ensure there is always a heir for each family line -- this is ecspecially emphasized if each family only has the one heir with which to continue their line. It can also include how money is managed, whether vaults are combined, etc.

- Then there is the inevitable sub-trope: the surprise contract that our protagonist suddenly gets dumped on them. One example would be the ancient, magically binding contract between two families that for this reason or that has not kicked in until now, which is somehow the first time in centuries that the conditions have been met. The second is that a charector's parents had a contract drawn up when they were first born, and they only find out about it when they come of age. In both these situations the story almost always plays out with one or both of the parties involved being rather jaded by the situation but coming to fall in love. These stories are tricky to pull off, but when done well can be pretty great. It throws together two charectors who suddenly have to develop and get to know each other.

Interestingly, except for in the case of the last one these contracts tend to be rather voluntary. Often times the protagonist must get married but who they choose is more or less up to them. Not always, of course, but it's interesting to play around with. I've read a lot more where the love comes before the contract.

A while back I read an interesting Harry/Daphne fic with a contract but for the life of me I can't seem to find it anywhere. Perhaps someone else can point you in the right direction? From what I remember, the Potter and Greengrass families created a contract a couple of generations back as part of buissness deal. The terms have finally been met, and Daphne is now bethrothed to Harry. The interesting thing was that since the contract was written some buissness fell through or what not, essentially meaning that Harry would get everything and they get almost nothing. The twist is that Harry can simply agree to dissolve the contract... But he doesn't. He kind of comes off as a dick at first since Daphne is clearly (and vocally) uncomfortable and angry with the entire situation but he doesn't back down.

Some interesting world building and charector development if I remember it correctly. Might be a good one to look at if you want to explore the technical and/or economic ramifications of the trope.

Also, almost every fic in this trope is Harry/Daphne.

** There are two purposes of marriage contracts in fanfiction (AFAIK):

1. Create some unrealistic pairing, just because the author wants it (e.g., Dramione), I don't know much about the stuff, because I try to keep myself as far away from it as possible.

2. Show how the British magical regime is completely corrupted, and the main hero/heroine/Hermione should stay away from it. Example would be linkffn(11916243), which is quite decent, except the main pair is insufferable ([[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/review-of-escape-and-mr-and-mrs-percy-weasley.html][my full review]]).

** As far as my understanding of them goes, marriage contracts were the historical precedent for what are now prenuptial agreements.

They would have been used between the groom's family and the bride's to establish the distribution of resources. Generally something along the line of a bride price or the bride's dowry.

Like most contracts, there are penalties for breaking them. Extramarital affairs might be penalized or if a child was not produced within x time of marriage.

In theory, any rider could be stipulated in the contract so long as the parties agreed to them or if there were snuck into the fine print.

I was able to find a paper that might give more information: [[https://www.cairn.info/revue-annales-de-demographie-historique-2011-1-page-69.htm#]]
