** Best idea done poorly: Harry tricks the ministry into helping him go after MoB!Dumbledore. linkffn(Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor) The author takes it way too far and it just becomes stupid and inane.

Worst idea done well is much harder. Probably Hermione Granger is a super genius in mathematics. linkffn(The Arithmancer). Or perhaps Harry Potter travels through dimensions and saves the world. linkffn(Stories of the Lone Traveler by dunuelos)

****** Actually, I became frustrated with the story because Hermione wasn't Mary Sue enough. This fic constantly teeters between whether Hermione or Harry is the main character. It doesn't cause enough fundamental changes to canon to make me think the former, and it ends out with Hermione having all these brilliant ideas and new spells, but giving them to Harry to deal with X superficial change. In many ways, I am hoping that she gets to unless a can of whoop ass on the death eaters soon

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

linkffn(8186071). I'd /really/ like to read a story about a goblin-raised Harry where the tiny creatures who run Gringotts aren't predictable plot devices.

#+begin_quote
  Worst idea you've seen done well?
#+end_quote

'Lazy Harry' sounds like an awful idea. Protagonists who aren't motivated to do anything have the potential to be quite boring. How on earth could a character who spends most of their time asleep ever find the opportunity to have entertaining adventures?

But linkffn(6466185) does a great job convincing the reader that a lazy Harry has a lot of potential. It's hilarious from start to finish.

** *Best Idea Done Poorly*

linkffn(11033616) You're my Density By: robst

Just Suppose Harry hadn't heeded his godfather's advice, and actually lost his temper at his trial? Time travel fic and title is 'Back to the Future' joke.

The great idea here is that timetraveling Harry doesn't actually know any magic. But he has the memory of an adult muggle. Does away with the OP timetraveler, but while changing things in an interesting way. It fails at this because its a robst fic.

*Worst Idea Done Well*

linkffn(9622538) Travel Secrets: First By: E4mj

Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET.

This series features bad!Dumbledore and clueless or equally bad followers. Yet it manages to turn them bad without feeling like bashing. Not quite sure of the distinction myself, but most bashing fics feel like the author is trying to persuade me of something, and that doesn't happen here.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

** I would have to say linkffn(In Atlantean Caves). The idea of this kind of ever-changing maze to explore is super fascinating, as are the Atlantis connections (although the story was abandoned before that).

Sadly, looking back, the writing is kind of shoddy. A lot of tell over show, the romance builds way too fast and probably shouldn't be there at all, and as mentioned, it's abandoned.

*** That's a shame. Just from the summary, it seems like this fic had a lot of potential.

**** In the hands of someone like NMB, it would have had the potential to be one of the best fics in the whole fandom.
