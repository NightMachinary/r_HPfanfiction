I would like to see what pairings people like beside canon ones and like drarry. You could just say the pairing and maybe if you have a fave fic with that ship you could link it. For example I like Ron/Draco but I don't have a fave fic with this pairing, I also like Ron/Pansy and my favourite for now is linkao3(12985506) the next one well I don't really ship James/Peter BUT this one fic was really good written and I may have started liking this pairing a little linkao3(10026116) There is also Albus/Teddy (I wish there was more good fics about them) linkao3(12492556) and linkao3(8407300) and the last I can think of is James/Sirius/Remus linkao3(7877221) linkao3(6469633) linkao3(5784418)


** Hermione/Lavender

i have yet to find a single fic on them that's worth a second of time.

Could be a very interesting and surprising way to "solve" the love triangle in a book 6 fic.

** Hermione/Tonks

It's interesting to see Hermione lose control, stop being rational and just follow her emotions. There might be other pairings which do that but this one makes due without whitewashing genocidal war criminals. Favorite (and only) example: Dignity in Fear

  From the moment Charlie left Hogwarts, he'd heard about Harry Potter. The longer time goes on, the more their lives become intertwined and the more Charlie can't keep himself away (8 year age gap be damned).This is an AU, but uses as many elements from canon as possible. It follows the order of the books but is mostly from Charlie's perspective. Up until later chapters of the story, this all could feasibly exist within the canon universe.Don't be turned off by the 'Underage' tag, I just wanted to cover my bases. Also note the story is only rated at Teen. That being said, if that's a trigger for you then protect yourself and pass this one by. I hold no grudges :)
