For me it would have to be silent casting or lack thereof. For most stories it that seems the authors have completely forgotten about it. Especially if it's a story post Hogwarts, like if Harry is an auror or master of death etc. I don't know why it makes me angry when people forget about it but it drives me up the wall.


** I think overly poor punctuation, and overuse of 'nicknames'. Dumbles, dumblydore, and other similar nicknames make me just want to pull my hair out.

No person, regardless of if they agree with Dumbledore or not, is never going to refer to him as 'Dumbles'.

** Over-the-top sex scenes with ridiculous euphemisms for genitalia. Besides generally bad writing, this is something that will make me close a story.

Honorable mentions: * Story summaries where the writer apologizes for being bad at writing summaries. This doesn't bode well for the writing overall. * Use of Dark/Light and The Golden Trio. I know that these are well established concepts in fandom, but they just rankle me. Truly excellent writers manage to convey these groups without the shorthand. * Calling Hermione the "cleverest/smartest/brightest witch of /the/ age." Lupin was the ONLY person who ever said that, and he called her "the cleverest witch of /your/ age," which has a very different connotation. * Misuse of apostrophes, particularly when they are used (incorrectly) in the plural of surnames, i.e., Malfoy's or Weasley's. Ugh.

Edit to add: When writers use "phase" instead of "faze." /Although I dropped the broom on Harry's foot, he wasn't even phased./ bleh

** My biggest one is trunks bigger than a 5 story house with 18 guest bedrooms, 4 kitchens, 21 bathrooms, and a front fucking lawn.

It drives me absolutely crazy when Harry buys a magical trunk in Diagon Ally and then proceeds to use it as a house for the remainder of his time at Hogwarts.

I don't mind giant trunks that can function as a closet if you turn it on its side, or similar ideas with potion cupboards for ingredients, or a bunch of extended bookshelfs, but the idea of descending into a trunk that's as big as a house is a deal breaker for me.

Poorly writing an accent is another one. I read one fanfic where Fleur sounded more like a Russian than she did French.

I can get behind the giant trunk. It should just be so expensive, rare, and hard to make that Harry doesn't have one. The way I imagine it, there's one family that makes them and they can only produce a handful in a year. So only extremely wealthy people are purchasing them. They'd be passed down as heirlooms

Harry smiled bashfully and rubbed his hand on the back of his head. He had just referred to Ron's eyes as "orb". The worst sin ever, but he never would admit it consciously. Ever.\\
"Don't play coy with me, Harry Potter!" reiterated Hermione, "You know what you did!"\\

He was just lying to not admit his fault in front of Hermione because he was so sure she would be angry at him, he could not bear the thought.

It's one of those phrases -- like, ugh, "ghosting" or "carding his fingers through his hair" -- that is so ubiquitous in fan fiction that I feel slightly nauseated when I see it. If I see it in a description, it's usually an automatic pass; if I see it in the story itself, I'll think twice about reading on.

Also, "ghosting" and "carding" can fuck right off into the sun too. The first is not a thing unless you mean someone stopped contacting your character after a shitty date, and could just as easy be replaced by "gliding" without sounding half as stupid. The second word reminds me of sheep.

I think "passed" is a not-uncommon euphemism for death, though "passed away" is more common. I'm from the US by the way. But in the context of a HP fanfic? If someone is killed by someone else, I would definitely prefer killed/murdered/slain/died/etc. because "passed [away]" does sound super strange in that context. But if it's a "natural" death (not that common in fanfics...heh) that could be another story.

  There is not infinite energy. This explains why I can't just go into a fight yelling Stupefy continuously (Why else wouldn't they have done that?).
#+end_quote

This is interesting actually, because I would argue in the canon HP universe you can do this. From HBP:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was *throwing hex after hex* at her while she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: 'Crucio-Crucio-*you can't dance for ever pretty*-'

  Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was *sending curses flying in all directions*, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window-

  'And a Death Eater's dead, he got hit by a Killing Curse the huge blonde one was *firing off everywhere*-Harry, if we hadn't had your Felix potion, I think we'd all have been killed, but everything seemed to just miss us-'
#+end_quote

Unless I'm misinterpreting these quotes, I think they suggest that people do cast spells continuously-and the main reason why you wouldn't, is it leaves you vulnerable to attack.

#+begin_quote
  People generally hate on magical cores/magical exhaustion because they sometimes see them in bad fics.

******* I agree that there doesn't seem to be a limit on the 'amount' of magic people have, and I don't think there should be. I think the more correct way to look at it, is yelling and waving your arms around while dodging attacks gets exhausting anyways. It's not the magic that makes you tired afterwards, but everything that comes with it.

With larger spells, it's also possible that they put more strain on your body, like when Voldemort and Harry have their wands connect, and both appear to be struggling to keep hold of them.

Or perhaps even mental exhaustion, like if you were casting wards, I could see it being something that required so much concentration and precision that it caused mental fatigue.

Just my take on it.

*** I'll be honest, this isn't bad. Sure, it's not a grammatical masterpiece like some other fics are, but at least the author has a decent grasp of when to use punctuation and formatting.

** Nicknames are the biggest thing. If you make a nickname for a friend, you are making a good catchy name that compliments him. If you make a nickname for an enemy, you are either trying to mock him, or describe him. Calling Voldemort "MoldyShorts" is so profoundly disrespectful that it is ridiculous. It makes light of a vicious mass murderer, and disrespects the ones killed by him, by making fun of the situation, implying that he is weak, he is incompetent.

We generally don't mock people of that level in our society. If we do, it is because we have devolved into an uncomfortable state of dark humor.

Adolf Hitler. Josef Mengele. Idi Amin. Josef Stalin. Ted Bundy. Leopold of Belgium. Pol Pot. The Zodiac Killer.

Anyone who thinks these people are legitimatly funny and incompetent unironically, need a serious reality check. Each of these people were responsible for the peoples deaths. Not accidental. Not in the heat of passion. But instead, they decided that certain people didn't deserve the right to live, and killed them. Voldemort is much the same way. There is not point of view that you can see these people as funny, except from one of pure foolishness, and one of pure evil.

EDIT:Well, you all have made decent arguments. I suppose we will have to agree to disagree.

*** Well, sorry to break it to you, but... Hitler is getting mocked all the time. There are comedies with him. His contemporaries used mocking nicknames like "Gröfaz".

*** Wow, you are so, so wrong. Study the history of propaganda. When we were at war we made mockeries of our enemies and continued to do so long after their deaths.

*** Literally everyone you listed has been severely mocked by the media. Especially Hitler like goddamn have you studied WWII propaganda at all lmao? Like I agree with the moldyshorts bit but everything else is absurd. All we do is mock terrorists!

*** I completely disagree with you.

It's crucially important to ridicule your enemies, both to raise the morale on your side and to piss off the other side enough so that they started making mistakes.

This method worked fairly well against Hitler (or any other narcissistic megalomaniacs). When RAF bombed Berlin and called him names, he directed his bombers to attack British cities and civilians, away from RAF airfields. This move gave RAF a crucial breathing space and allowed RAF to ultimately win the Battle of Britain. Two years later, RAF and US Army Air Corp would start to pay back the Germans for their attacks on British civilians...

*** The idea that HP characters would progress from refusing to use his name at all to 'moldyshorts' (or any such equivalent) is ridiculous, if they can't even say the name Voldemort it's even less likely they would be capable of mocking him.

We do, however, have examples of characters mocking Voldemort. Fred and George's 'U-NO-POO' and Harry using 'Tom' (serves the same purpose) in the final battle. The idea of certain characters using mocking names is therefore logical. Nevertheless, 'moldyshorts' is used too frequently and too often by characters that I can't ever see saying 'moldyshorts'.

** When ' is used instead of " for dialogue. It is fine if its for thoughts, but for someone actually speaking aloud, no. It bothers me enough to click out of the story. Only a few stories have managed to capture my interest enough to force myself not to notice it.

Edit: Ethnocentric shame :( Edit deux: so many homophone errors

*** I understand what you mean, but seeing as the original story uses ' for dialogue it's perfectly understandable that others use it as such. As long as a distinction is made between ' and " quotes I don't have a problem-even if I prefer " for dialogue.
