Anything like that? I remember reading somewhere(maybe not canon?) that McGonagall was in London during the blitz.

Any stories like that, where wizards are interacting with the muggle world in times of disaster and tragedy?


** McGonagall is born in October 1935, and as far as I recall, she grew up in Scotland. All we know from book canon, though, is that she's taught Transfiguration since 1956.

As for the second question, I suppose meddling with muggle affairs is tantamount to high treason in the wizarding world, due to the SoS.

I wish Rowling would have chosen another year than 1945 for Dumbledore's defeat of a very German-sounding wizard. Then there wouldn't be all those shit-tier WWII backstories that borders on "Hitler did nothing wrong".

I imagine Grindelwald used the muggle wars as a cover to take out enemies and gain followers. The ministries were probably working overtime to stop meddlers from all sides to notice a few families being killed off before it was too late.

*** To be fair to Rowling, her own conception of the relationship between Grindelwald and Hitler is much more sophisticated than the typical fandom "Grindelwald put Hitler under the Imperius" approach:

#+begin_quote
  JKR: I'm going to tell you as much as I told someone earlier who asked me. You know Owen who won the [UK television] competition to interview me? He asked about Grindelwald [pronounced "Grindelvald" HMM...]. He said, “Is it coincidence that he died in 1945,” and I said no. It amuses me to *make allusions* to things that were happening in the Muggle world, so my feeling would be that *while there's a global Muggle war going on, there's also a global wizarding war going on*.

  ES: Does he have any connection to --

  JKR: I have no comment to make on that subject.

  [Laughter.]

  MA: Do they *feed each other*, the Muggle and wizarding wars?

  JKR: Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Mm.

  MA: You've gone very quiet.

So rather than wizards literally being involved in Muggle wars, you have a kind of *parallel* conflict - that is, wizarding and Muggle worlds mirror each other without actually having causal links from one to the other. It's like there's a "spirit of the times" which encompasses both Muggle and wizarding worlds, and when tension rises in one it is also rising in the other.

In real life the idea that there is a driving narrative and spirit behind the unfolding of human history is to be found in the philosophy of Hegel. It's an idea which I find rather absurd in real life, but in the Harry Potter world I think it fits well. In a world where many human ideas have magical reality, I don't oppose the idea that history itself (in the sense of a narrative of humanity) is also magically real.

One thing I find interesting about this is to consider what is happening in the wizarding world when Muggle society has a revolution, such as the Chinese and Russian communist revolutions. I find China particularly interesting. In Fantastic Beasts we see a Chinese representative (Mugwump?) at the ICW called Madam Ya Zhou. While I don't consider movie costuming decisions canon (whereas I do consider the script canon), it is nonetheless interesting that she was depicted in rather traditional dress reminiscent of the Imperial era. FB was set in 1926, 14 years after the fall of the Qing dynasty, and at a time when China was essentially involved in a drawn out series of civil wars.

Indeed. From Pottermore:

#+begin_quote
  Archer Evermonde

  1912 - 1923

  In post during the Muggle First World War, Evermonde passed emergency legislation forbidding witches and wizards to get involved, lest they risk mass infractions of the International Statute of Secrecy. Thousands defied him, aiding Muggles where they could.
#+end_quote

Obviously that's the first world war but one imagines the principle would be the same.

From Fantastic Beasts, Grindelwald's MO seems to be to cause chaos which bridges the magical and Muggle worlds so as to expose wizards beyond their ability to contain, thereby forcing them into war against the Muggles (a war which Grindewald is confident that wizards would win, presumably under his leadership).

**** Yeah, it was most likely his endgame, a war on muggles.

Luckily, nothing in the interview supports the idea that WW2 was primarily a magical war, with Grindelwald being the real head of the Axis (or at least playing them like a flute) or some of that rubbish.

As for FB, it might just be the film makers wanting a proper chinese flair to her or something, although even British wizards don't seem quite up to date on how to dress like muggles. The rather progressive Mr and Mrs Weasley dress in robes and have no clue on how to blend in with muggles, whereas their kids do wear jeans and stuff. Maybe the Chinese ICW representative was just behind with the times, making some sort of political statement, or just attached to the style of dress?

***** Obviously there are different levels of involvement. Just because many wizards "aided Muggles where they could" it doesn't mean they were performing combat roles. The phrase brings humanitarian aid to mind more than anything else - giving the occasional soldier a safe roof and a hearty meal before sending them them on their way.

****** That's not "aided Muggles where they could".

(And that you even mention "combat roles" shows you don't really understand the issue anyway. Wars are won by logistics, and wizards win at logistics. The Gemino Charm by itself could counteract the entire blockade - by the RN, or by the U-Boats. And feeding the civilians pretty much is "humanitarian aid")

******* /Muggle wars/ are won (partly) on logistics. But if wizards were fighting on both sides, it's not a Muggle war anymore. The decisive fight would be the *combat* between the wizards on the respective sides, because whoever wins that one is thereafter free to give magical aid to their respective Muggles.

(Of course that's not the dynamic of the magical world, since wizards consistently favour kind over nation.)

And there's a huge difference between feeding the occasional soldier who wanders through your area and leveraging magic to feed an entire nation. I think it's pretty clear that the wizards providing aid are doing so by subterfuge to avoid wizarding authorities, i.e. they're doing it on a small, "individual act of kindness" scale.

******** If wizards had fed single soldiers, no one would have cared about that, and anyone claiming this might have endangered the SoS would have been laughed out of office. Feeding the occasional soldier is a /muggle/ action.

Feeding the country would have been a wizard action - or sabotaging the enemy infrastructure. Take out canals and bridges and railways - you don't need to endanger the SoS at all, if you can mask it as sabotage - and things start to go wrong for the country. They can either use magic to compensate, endangering the SoS (since wrecking a bridge can easily be masked, repairing it in a day not so), or suffer.

So, yeah, the whole "wizards helped in WW1" is pretty much senseless drivel. If they had been involved, they would have changed the way the war was fought. No shell crisis, no trouble with rare materials, no hunger, and so on.

** The problem is that if Wizards took part in WW2, it wouldn't have happened as it did in history. Even a single wizard using the Gemino Charm or Curse could have changed the entire war by multiplying crucial supplies - VT-fuses, cavitrons, and so on, ammunition/special bombs, food... the list goes on. Now add mind control, Veritaserum, Apparition and Disillusionment Charms to the mix, and we're talking about precision strikes decades ahead of schedule. The Mending Charm might counter that to some degree, depending on how powerful it is, but overall, WW2 would be very, very different.

** I personally believe that some of Tom Riddle's immense fear of death stems from being in London during the Blitz. Well, if you look it up, technically he would have been in Hogwarts during those months, but no one at the time knew the exact dates the bombing was going to stop. Hell, maybe his orphanage blew up with everyone he'd ever known in it while he was away at Hogwarts.

**** Yeah, I always remember this because the Narnia kids were actually at the house with the wardrobe due to having to leave because of the war. Still there are numerous ways around it.

Maybe they were one of the first ones hit. Maybe they were low priority because they were poor orphan kids. Wasn't their caretaker (Ms. Cole?) a drunk? Maybe she didn't arrange it in time, for them to get taken away, or maybe she missed the date they were supposed to get on the train because she was drinking. Maybe they were scheduled to leave the next day but they got bombed that night.

A fuckton of civilians got killed, if an author wants it to happen it's completely plausible.

**** *Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II*

The evacuation of civilians in Britain during the Second World War was designed to protect people, especially children, from the risks associated with aerial bombing of cities by moving them to areas thought to be less at risk. Operation Pied Piper, which began on 1 September 1939, officially relocated more than 3.5 million people. There were further waves of official evacuation and re-evacuation from the south and east coasts in June 1940, when a seaborne invasion was expected, and from affected cities after the Blitz began in September 1940. There were also official evacuations from the UK to other parts of the British Empire, and many non-official evacuations within and from the UK. Other mass movements of civilians included British citizens arriving from the Channel Islands, and displaced people arriving from continental Europe.

**** No, many stayed. According to your link, as many as 85% of children stayed in some urban areas. Generally, the evacuation rate of children lay around 50%.

It was very reasonable to assume that the government saw orphaned children as low priority and didn't bother with them all.

***** One would think rather the opposite. Those that stayed did so because there were adults responsible for them who chose to keep them with their families rather than evacuate per government policy. But orphans don't have families to keep them tied to the city.

  I have recently have read an amazing crossover with HP and the Avengers (specifically Captain America the First Avenger) called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12490736/1/Come-Together][Come Together]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3494062/oniforever][oniforever]].

  linkffn(12490736) Status: Ongoing

  A very basic summary: Tom is still very much in character in the beginning but ended up captured by HYDRA. Stuff happens and he essentially became a WW2 soldier.

  It stays true to Tom's personality but made room for him to grow. At age 16 at least. This took place after the Chamber of Secrets which he is still very much guilty for. The story is very well written from the beginning and continues to become more impressive as I read on. It's to the point that I have no clue how many time I've reread this specific fanfiction.

This story however made Grindelwald's people more involved with WW2.

  It begins in 1943. Tom Riddle searches for his place in the world, and ends up getting captured by HYDRA. After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings. Starts in CA:TFA but will spread to the other films.
