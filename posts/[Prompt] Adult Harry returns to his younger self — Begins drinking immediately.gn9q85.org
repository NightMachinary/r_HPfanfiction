Harry Potter, white of the hair, and long of the tooth, grizzled veteran whose been fighting dark wizards for too long, gets sent back to his younger body (age depends on how cracky you want to be) and he immediately begins drinking as is usual. A rather drunk, and rather grumpy Harry makes his way through Hogwarts.

(For that over the top (but kinda funny), Harry goes back to his six or seven year old body, and does the most stupid crap, much to the shock of everyone around him.)


** Basically linkffn(6452481), but with an older Harry in a younger body?

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

*** Yeah, this is great! I was thinking any age would work, though at the time for some reason I thought younger would be funnier... now I'm just confused why I wrote that. :/
