I see countless stories where our dear Draco is portrayed as an Auror!? Anyone else feels like this is extremely unlikely? Draco is cowardly, selfish and arrogant. He ultimately only cares about himself and his family. I grant he is clever and resourceful, but him an Auror? I am certain he would see such a job as demeaning and below his family status and standing.

I'm not saying it can't happen - but I feel there needs to be a /very good backstory/ for this trope to work.


** It's pretty much just your standard 'letting off the war criminal because he's pretty' Draco in leather pants tripe. He's usually an auror because Harry is an auror and the only reason for those two to get close enough to bang is proximity.

If I had to come up with an actual explanation, I'd go with the Malfoy name being ruined by their genocidal bastard-hood and their political positions being lost, then him taking the Auror position as a show of 'I'm doing my part for the community!' that he hates in private but praises in public - politics and all that.

*** Agreed. Sadly most of these stories don't even bother to build up a believable backstory. Why someone equivalent of muggle aristocracy would go and become a cop...

**** I mean, to be fair, that's not what those stories are written to focus on. Like Rowling and Worldbuilding. They're written to explore the relationship between Harry and Malfoy. Logic isn't really something that kind of story bothers with. :)

***** and it can be a very good and well written story in its own right. Having said that I do like stories where author at least tries to set up a /believable/ premise.

** Malfoy would have to be raised by another family, maybe the Tonks, for me to believe he'd want to be an Auror. Even his parents making a break from their families and siding with the light against Voldemort in the first war wouldn't be enough for me to believe he'd become an Auror.

** I seem to recall Draco was an auror in Heroes Assemble! Harry bust a gut laughing when he realized Draco's patronus was a ferret.

** It truthfully depends on how much the ministry is changed after the war. if it is the same as before with all the bigotry and corruption I can definitley see him being an Auror as it would also help him raise the malfoy rep if he is shown to be putting "bad guys" away

if it has changed then I dont see it happening because of the shit he pulled during the war even if he got off he still took the dark mark and has shown that he isn't going to do the right thing if it conflicts with his personal loyalties

*** There are other ways he can contribute to "putting bad guys away". My contention is that his personality and what we know of his character - he is unsuitable and disinterested.

I've read a story where he wasn't an Auror, but worked as a consultant and aided them in various cases. I thought that idea worked very well.

** In my opinion its quite possible. I mean he was child who idealized his father too much and believed everything what he told him . And he was in the war before understanding what it mean for his future and for him. He was quite mess in fifth year and later didn't have a way out.

So after war it would be understandable that he want be better and do something for himself.

And we cannot forgot that Harry was auror too. Of course he will follow "scarhead" only for possibility to piss him of. :D

*** are you saying teenagers actions simply dont have consequences? because if thats the case lets let all the kids in juvie out because they cant be blamed for their actions or are simply the product of their environments

it's one thing to say people to change and become better people it's another to simply ignore their previous actions

**** No, I believe that every action need have deserved consequence. But we need understand that crime isn't black and white. There are always circumstances.\\
And anyway if I tell the truth, there was a war. In war everything is different and everyone mind is quite changing to better side or worse side.\\
I don≈• think its possible to go through war without change.

*** I agree that people change. However people don't do complete 180 either. I'm not saying he can't be a good person - I do believe he will turn for the better!

What we know of his character from the books I find it unlikely. It is not a job that garners any real respect from high society, it is unlikely to be very well salaried job, carries huge risks for death and injury, requires dedication to helping other people, would undoubtedly bring him in conflict with family and social circles he is part of.

Also I've read a story where he wasn't an Auror, but worked as a consultant and aided them in various cases. I think that idea worked very well.

***** depending on the crime

shoplifting and trying to do a drive by are 2 very different things

it's not like draco was stealing candy from honeydukes he was actively trying to assassinate someone and let death eaters into the school
