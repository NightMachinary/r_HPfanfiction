Basically, I am looking for stories which depict Harry's adult life together with his girlfriend/fiance/wife in an overall fluffy, light-hearted way. Stories about everyday life, not battling evil or the adventures of his children. Any woman with Harry is fine. Examples would be stories like "Definitions of Romance" or "Homemaking dilemma" (just without the part about Harry being a good husband because he didn't want sex when his wife had her period, that felt like the author talking).

I am not looking for stories which give a short overview about all the children the author came up or Harry being assimilated into the Weasely family. A Ginny pairing is fine, but I want to read about the Potter family, not the Weasleys and 20 inconsequential children, which all happen to be related.

Preferably without bashing, Death Eater whitewashing (this includes Snape and Malfoy) or Ron/Hermione in the background. And obviously no m/m.


** *That Old House by vanillaparchment* linkffn(4703843) fits this perfectly. Harry and Hermione adopt some orphans after the war. Each kid has a very distinct personality. My go to fic in the fluff category (zero bashing).

  An old house sits at the end of a lane. Abandoned and forgotten, no one would have guessed who was going to buy it... or how full a life that old house was yet to live. Harry/Hermione

*** It was nice right until the end part where it just felt like the author projecting her ideals on Harry.
