So just about every fic based on Goblet of Fire, even if they change the challenges and write an original fic, still has Harry entered in a binding contract that means he has to enter. But this is all based on this part:

#+begin_quote
  Bagman wiped his round, boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at Mr. Crouch, who was standing outside the circle of the firelight, his face half hidden in shadow. He looked slightly eerie, the half darkness making him look much older, giving him an almost skull-like appearance. When he spoke, however, it was in his usual curt voice. “We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament.”

  “Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said Bagman, beaming and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter was now closed.
#+end_quote

Moody enters a paragraph or so later and reiterates that it is a binding magical contract, and no one can pull out. But we find out much later that Crouch Sr is under the Imperius, and that Crouch Jr is committed to having Harry compete. Bagman thinks here's a chance to earn back his gambling debts, and might even have a compulsion charm on him to help back Crouch up, and no one argues with Crouch's knowledge. Even Hermione doesn't research how to get him out of it.

So what's the likelihood that Crouch was lying, and that the rules did not enforce Harry's participation? Or that maybe there was a rule or caveat that would let them do a redraw. And are there any fics that actually do this, and do it properly? I could see at some point Hermione going, hang on, Crouch is missing/unwell, what if he slipped up or wasn't as infallible as everything seemed to think, and researching into things.


** It wasn't brought up because JKR wanted Lord Voldemort to come back--- and how is he going to come back if the main characters wise up and actually read the rules?

It's one of those "character flaw" tricks that writers seem to like using.

*** Oh sure, this isn't me pointing out a plot hole, it's pretty reasonable, given Crouch's reputation, to accept his word and think no deeper. I'm just wondering if it's possible that he did lie, per imperius.

I've read fics where people actually hunted for loopholes, anything from Harry only showing up and performing one spell, as a token attempt, to him appointing a proxy. But I'm not sure if it's actually occurred to anyone before that there was no binding contract on Harry. I've read heaps of fic series where it pretty much doesn't follow canon at all, only for GoF to pretty much happen as always.

It would be cool if the script were completely changed, with Junior tearing his hair out, trying to somehow set up elaborate schemes to capture Harry in a spectacular way. Even funnier if Harry ended up in first place, two weeks before the third task, and Hermione finally finds the loopholes that either cancels competition, or lets Harry drop out, which he does. Imagine how mad Crouch and Voldemort would be.

**** I've written an AU where Barty inserted Harry into the tournament, but it was just a diversion to keep Dumbledore busy protecting Harry while Barty, who was not impersonating Moody, prepared the ritual to resurrect Voldemort - which did not require Harry.

*** Agreed. It's what happens when an author who is not a genius, attempts to create genius' in their story. It's brought down to simple 'everyone lacks common sense so one character looks smart'. I don't understand why Dumbledore or Maxime didn't read it, if their own competitors were going to be in the tournament.

** Forging the sword has imo the best explanation for this.

He wasnt magically bound to compete, but rather legally bound. The binding contract was between the competing nations. Had he tried the get out it, the Ministry wouldva been forced to revoke his citizenship.

*** That's a worse explanation. Both Madame Maxine and Kasparoff were incensed that Hogwarts had a second champion...if it was in their control they would have appealed and gotten him removed. The magical contract that they cannot control is way better of an explanation.

**** I agree that the 'legal contract' has other problems, but are they really bigger problems than a device that can magically enslave anyone without their consent? I'd expect any decent wizard to immediately destroy such an object long before GoF.

**** The point is that it wasnt in their control, there is magical contract in place, its just not Harry thats directly bound by it. The nations agree that whichever names come out of the GoF must compete, when Howgarts got 2 champions , they didnt like but by the rules they had to allow and enforce it.

Also its Karkaroff.

** I like how [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146), worked out a comprise:

1) Barty Jr definitely didn't impersonate Moody, and he did it in such a way even the Marauder's Map couldn't detect him.

2) Bad guys had back-up plans. They were happy to wait because they were still working on perfecting the ritual.

3) Harry's support team suggested that he only gave minimal effort, but since he was raised in an excellent environment, this Harry WANTED TO WIN.

4) All tasks were reworked and original. Spectators could follow all events nicely.

[[/spoiler][5) There was a large audience awaiting Harry in the Graveyard: Barty Jr, the two Carrows, and the Dark Lady La Pantera.]]

** There seem to be two options to play with here.

One is that Harry was not actually bound to compete. These usually go with it being Crouch's magic that was on the line, not Harry's. You see this with Powerful!Harry, who somehow knows this and exploits this. Interesting, you don't see a lot of this with Harry learning about it after the fact (usually a plot device for powerful/informed Harry)

Saw one recently with this that had a whole plot of the fic was Harry using the Triwizard tournament to give up his magic so he could get away from it all, but it fails because he wasn't the one on the hook. I'll see if I can find it.

The other way to go would be that he is bound somehow by him being a student. After all, if you could create a magical artifact that could enforce terms on anyone and if they didn't do it (even if they didn't know about it) it would take their magic, why wouldn't that be used as a weapon? I suppose if you somehow tied it to 'You have a bond to the school as a student and we use that bond' it might work as well.

*** Hmm, I can't seem to find it, but there was one I read recently that played with this. Harry had been plotting to leave the magical world when the triwizard tournament [[/spoiler][promised to steal his power, he got engaged to Hermione so he wouldn't be obliterated once he lost his magic, he gets super-mad when Hermione is kidnapped for the 2nd task and goes to rescue her before the task, then waits looking to lose his magic but it actually takes Crouch's.]] Can't seem to find it.

Ahah! Found it! Yay! linkffn(7392700)

Banking on Her. Had a pretty depressing ending, but explores some of what you are thinking here.

There was another one I had read that did a similar thing, Harry Potter refused to participate and fled Hogwarts so Barry decided to Polyjuice as Harry and try the first task.

** Canon-wise, we don't know and will never find out. Nothing is really said about the rules or the allegedly binding magical contract, so we can only take what is being said as true ... or not take it as such.

Personally, I think he really wasn't, as though Junior was good enough to confound the Goblet into accepting Harry as the sole candidate from a fourth school, I highly doubt he managed to confound it to the degree where it ignored all the irregularities around Harry's participation. As it is, I think the Goblet probably saw the the slip with Harry's name as something inserted as a joke and neither his knowledge nor permission and would neither have chosen him had there actually been an alternative nor punish him for trying to get out of it. Or, to elaborate, as I see it he still was magically bound to compete but the punishment for breaking that contract depends on the person and his would have been null.

** I think that it was a binding magical contract, but that Harry could likely have escaped competing if any of the adults had really pressed the matter. If Ron's name had come out, Mrs. Weasley would have marched into Dumbledore's office and shouted at Dumbledore nonstop until he made absolutely sure that her 14-year-old son wouldn't be endangering his life. But Harry doesn't really have anyone to advocate on his behalf like that.

There are multiple ways in which Harry might have been able to extricate himself. For example, he could have technically remained a champion, but formally forfeited each task on the morning of. Someone could have spent more time examining Harry's claim that he hadn't put his own name into the Goblet.

The problem was that none of the adults in the room were really that motivated to help Harry get out of his contract, either because:

a) they thought he deserved it (Karkaroff, Maxime, Snape)

b) because they were actively out to hurt Harry (Moody/BCJ, Crouch due to the Imperius)

c) they thought it would be entertaining (Bagman)

c) because they thought Harry could use the practice (Dumbledore)
