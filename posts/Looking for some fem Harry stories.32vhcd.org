I was wondering if anybody has read good fem Harry stories. I was really going to find some fem Harry stories where Harry is also paired with a girl.

I am also open any other good fanfiction, but at the moment I feel like I am having a hard time finding something that I have not already read.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9937462/1/Black-Princess-Ascendant][Black Princess Ascendant]](WIP) is femHP/LL, but I have this feeling that you probably would've read it already if you're at the point where you have problems with finding new things.

I think this list explains how often we get the same topic on a new post:

*** I generally read harmony fics. I find that I think this is one of the best pairings. As far as fem Harry fics I have read Holly Evens and the spiral path, but I found that it just was not for me. I have enjoyed Looking Beyond and A Girl Named Hope. I have found a bunch of one shots, but I really would like to sink my teeth into something a little longer.

I am not a fan of ginny fics generally. I also generally don't like fics where Harry ends up with an older man. What I mean is like Harry/Remus or Harry/Riddle. I have read everything by Robst, broomstick flyer(may she rest in peace), Rorschach's Blot, and quite a few others.

*** That advice really isn't helpful. You are not stating where I should search. You are just saying to look somewhere unspecified. I read quite a lot of fanfiction, and if you are asking me to check any of the sites for fanfiction I can tell you I have.

My request was to see if anyone could point me to some wonderful stories because I am having a hard time finding fully fleshed out fem Harry fics that are not incomplete.

Reddit is supposed to be a place to go and talk with people of like minded ideas, or people looking for advice. If you don't want to be helpful then just don't reply.

** Not a fan of slash so I have no recommendations for that other than A Butterfly Effect. I'm not a fan personally, too much /muh emotional damage/ for my tastes and the whole question of sexual orientation is handled pretty clumsily.

Now, I do have a few fics that I /love/ but that rarely gets posted (I guess I have shitty taste, idk):

The [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1901751/][Severus' Rose]] series by WrittenWord1. Complete years 1 through 7, post-Hogwarts sequel incomplete and (appears to be) on hiatus. My favorite fics of all time, but very fluffy and thus not for everyone.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11009412/1/Arya-Lily-Potter][Arya Lily Potter]], updating at a very fast pace (94k words since January 30th). Not sure where this will go since it's still pre-Hogwarts, but it's good so far. Again, very fluffy (I like fluff, OK?)

This author has my favorite Fem!Harry series. The author created this really original world that is both familiar and new. Really well done.
