I really enjoy fics where one of the characters tidies up/fixes/renovates their magical home. Extra points if the house is represented as semi-sentient (as Hogwarts often is). If you know any good fics with this premise being a good chunk of the story, I'd love to read them! Thanks


** Is Drarry okay?

Edit: I just saw our comment history. I definitely thought of linkao3(House Proud by astolat).

Also, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/gv0ufa/grimmauld_place_being_sentient/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share][here]] is a post I made about sentient Grimmauld Place before and there are a lot of recs.

**** They're obviously Harry is a deity, and he likes solving problems so he just does stuff, but I do like that they talk about possibilities for magical building and they renovate the potions lab, which is such a relief, frankly.

I've always wanted to write a story where someone builds a magical house but it's pretty hard to write it in a way that makes it a good read

  The Better Burrow arc from my Lone Traveler compendium: The Lone Traveler encounters the Burrow before it was expanded. Maybe it can be made into a safer and more comfortable home for this version of the Weasleys. It's amazing how much a building can change history.
