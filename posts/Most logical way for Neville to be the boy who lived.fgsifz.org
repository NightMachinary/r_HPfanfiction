Let's say Voldemort goes after Neville. The prophecy says that Voldemort marks him as his equal so I assume reality would have to shift in such away that Neville survives this attack to fulfill this prophecy.

It seems unlikely that Voldemort would give Alice the choice to stand aside as Snape wouldn't give a shit about her.

So then what's the most logical way this can play out? Is there another death eater who happens to be in love with Alice or even Frank? Do they have some other kind of protection spells that can beat the killing curse that dont require sacrificing oneself?

I haven't read many boy who lived fics with Neville so I'm not aware of the common tropes to make this work. Enlighten me with anything you can come up with or have read in the past.


** I think the only way would be for the “Power The Dark Lord Knows Not” to be something else entirely. The events of the Prophecy are utterly tailored to Harry's specific circumstances, even the slightest change would cripple it. Just copy pasting it onto Neville wouldn't take in a way that makes sense.

** In the 2nd war, Voldemort and the Death Eaters didn't kill purebloods unless they had to or if they were causing too much grief. Apply that to the 1st: Voldemort gives Alice or Frank a chance to live because he doesn't want to 'spill too much magical blood.'

*** Seems unlikely.

Fabian and Gideon Prewett are prime examples to show that this isn't true.

Also, Voldemort and his little posse of Death Munchers think any purebloods not supporting him are blood-traitors.

According to Bellatrix Lestrange, blood--traitors are next after mudbloods.

Plus, they're a bunch of egotistical megalomaniacs. If they have a chance to eliminate opposition, they'll take it.

No, they don't. They didn't kill Luna or Xeno, they put her in the Malfoy Dungeons. They only went after Neville as a last resort. The Weasleys were watched, but none of them died when Death Eaters crashed the wedding.

***** I think the main difference between the deaths in the first war and the (lack of) deaths in the second war is that by the time the second war came around the number of pure blooded wizards was dwindling. That's the only way I can think of that they were more ok killing purebloods in the first war vs. the second.

** Make it some kind of ancient Life Shield spell, where it requires you to willingly give up your life for someone. Voldemort was arrogant. Make it so he thinks that his curse killed Alice, but it was actually Alice fuelling the sacrificial spell with her own life force in some kind of ritual to give Neville the protection.
