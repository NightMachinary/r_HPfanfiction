  AU When a stray dog saves Little Dudley, the Dursley adopt it and now strange things are happening at Privet Drive, and it's not Harry! What happens when Sirius and Remus raise Harry the Wizarding way? Please read and review.

** There's one where Harry brings Padfoot home during the summer one year and he stays as a dog and pretty much growls the Dursleys into letting him stay, I don't remember what it's called or who wrote it though.

*** The new pet dog is super protective of Harry, but they can't get rid of it because Dudley adores it. Dudley treats Harry better because that is the only way to pet the dog. Fuzzy friends bring peace and harmony.

*** To be fair, he lived in a cave surviving off of rats to ensure he was on hand for Harry just in case, so 2 months in dog form doesn't seem too crazy. And I'm sure he'd get chances to spend some time in human form when the Dursley's are out of the house or him and Harry are locked in Harry's room. Though I agree that him seeing the Dursley treat Harry portly would be problematic.

** This only partly fits because the Dursleys aren't raising Harry but it has the large black dog being adopted.

  Ah yes, third year. The year that has the least to do with Voldemort yet so much happens. Too bad for Hogwarts they have a reckless Slytherin who is getting tired of taking baby steps. Slow and steady may win the race, but there's nothing wrong with taking a few shortcuts. What's the worst that could happen? Besides, if Hogwarts won't actively give Harry a normal year, he'll make one for himself.

** The Dursleys love the dog and still treat Harry like shit. And despite Sirius's best intention, whenever an unfortunate magical accident happens to the Dursleys, it's still Harry who gets the regular expulsion threats from the Ministry and locked inside his room, getting fed through the cat.
