Aside from the notoriously well know and legendarly awful 'My Immortal' what other fics(if any) became interent legends? that sort of broke outside of the hardcore hp fanfic community and were well known in general? or what to your knowledge is the most read or well known hp fics?


** The Draco Trilogy, perhaps. I don't pay that much attention, but it must be common knowledge that Cassandra Claire used to write fanfic.

**** I disliked the set up, the characterization and the whole " bickering couple" , so yeah, I did not even bothered beyond chapter 3...

In a way, I should feel a bit bad for not even having given a chance seeing that many recommend it, but people also rec other fics I seriously disliked that are, for some reason, well known, and ignore great fics that do not have half the recognition they deserve...so, what i am trying to say is that, in the end,it is pretty subejctive.

I have a HUGE list of fics I consider to be underwhelming at best and shitty at worst that have huge reputation so it might be that I am simply not the target audience for said fics,,,or that my tastes are not popular.

Most of the popular stories on FFN and Archive are trash. I mean, the most popular Fem!Harry story on Archive has her making child pornography of herself (aged 14 IIRC) and upload it on the internet. The average reader on those sites does not match with the average reader in this sub.

I love AO3 (i found my fav Luna/Hermione fic there) but they may as well list itself as a porn site soon, search any pairing by the most hits and its always some pornograhic smut. Don't get me wrong i like some sexy times in my fics but i like tons of plot and character development otherwise its just some badly written 14 years olds porn script with the names of harry potter characters pasted in there. Think the reason AO3 is getting more attention and stories posted there than other sites these days is for the sheer amount of/and lack of censorship of PWP fics. Suppose as with any medium the platform that is porn friendly-iest rises to the top.

****** Agreed...however, I would say I also do not share the average readerÂ´s view in this sub, so I am kind of an exception I would say.

There is also a problem I think here that the most established fics are the ones people think first when someone sends a Fic Search request, so it can be that some recs are not as widely well regarded as I think they are, they just happen to fit the requirements of a search.

******* Well, often there are not a lot of stories which fit the request unless it is very broad. I remember someone recently complained about homophobia when no one linked them a pure romance Harry/Ron story with a 100k length requirement. Fact is, such a fic simply does not exist, same as a decent story with Harry/Lavender or Harry/Penelope Clearwater.

******** Well, I would not want to write or read any Harry/Ron of over 100 K, so I understand why it is hard to find :)

Slash is very popular though...I would guess that Harry/Ron is not that beloved because they use to pair Harry with either Draco or Severus, not because people dislike same sex couples (I personally find it difficult to completely flip a character sexuality if there is not an ounce of sign that said character would most likely enjoy same sex company.)

I saw a belieavable Ron /Krum once...

Which makes no sense. I mean, I'm not a huge Ron fan, but if given the choice I'd prefer to bugger/be buggered by the crude frat boy and not the magical Nazis. And my parents were not even murdered by their like.

********** Yeah, at least give Harry a guy like Cedric- they could talk about Quidditch as they cuddle- or even a Justin- who would take pity on Harry poor wardrobe choices and take him to Savile Row?

I had to drop a fic where Harry was in a foursome with Luna, Neville AND DRaco; Neville was all TOP- very macho gay guy; Draco would only get with Harry when Harry was in a gender fluid mode; and Luna would giggle and clap everytime there was sex going on.

Even I have my limits.

*** I'd say that Methods of Rationality drew attention because it brought its own community with it. It's rationalist fiction first, Harry Potter fanfiction second. So, naturally, opinions on it are rather divided, many loving it and many hating it, but either way there are a lot of people who know about it.

And whatever its flaws, it does have notable strengths. Lots of clever jokes. An impressive antagonist. Thought-provoking conflicts, where fundamentally good people can nonetheless have serious disagreements about what is the right thing to do. Very few typos. And it's complete, with a bunch of recursive fanfics.

I tend to recommend that people check it out, if only so that they say first-hand that they dislike it.

** I don't know what fic it was, but way back when fanfiction was way removed from what it is now (Pretty sure it was pre HBP release, maybe even pre OOTP) there was a Dutch fanfic that was written by a 13-year-old that got mainstream media attention. Beyond that I can't say I;ve seen fics go outside the fandom. Methods of Rationality is maybe the biggest one that comes close.

** I got (back into) FFN when there was that NYT article published about hpff around 2011-2013. Off the top of my head, two fics named were Delicate (a next gen Rose/Scorpius romance) on HPFF.net, and Underwater Light (a Harry/Draco slash fic -- still to this day the only slash fic i've read)
