Sometime in fourth or fifth year the bullhockey and horsefeathers gets to be too much and Harry decides his new life motto will be “Fuck It.”

No one tells him anything important? Fuck it, he'll figure it out for himself with or without his friends help.

No one feel like training their best hope for winning the war? Fuck it, he'll sneak into the deepest most forbidden depths of the library and learn how to win.

No one want to defender the innocent teenager from the starving press-vultures? Fuck it. He's got money and an amount of political clout, he'll find a way to give those liesmiths a whooping their ancestors will feel for generations.

Snape's an asshole who couldn't teach his way out of a lamp paper bag? You know the drill, he'll teach himself potions.

Every year the DADA professor makes an attempt on his life? Fuck it, he'll make it worth their while and treat them as they treat him.

Malfoy's acting like a little bitch? Fuck it, he might as well start crying like one too.

And so on, fuck it, and so forth.

If the world is going to fuck with Harry, he's going to return in kind.


** The most obvious answer is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make A Wish]] where Harry decides that if he's probably going to die, he may as well live a little first and goes on holiday around the world. In the process, he accidentally creates a reputation for himself as the Immortal Badass Unbeatable Former Evil Wizard, Mr Black.\\
Greatest moment in my opinion? Killing a group of Death Eaters simply by leaning on a balcony while eating a chocolate bar.\\

  Harry finds out that he's Snape's son. It goes as badly as possible.

**** If you're looking for Snape redemption, I wouldn't recommend this fic. Snape is as caustic and cruel as he is in the books. It fits your other requests really well!

** I'd love to see a Harry who's entire approach to every decision is to follow his gut. Hermione wouldn't like this, fuck it. Dumbledore said I shouldn't go to France for the summer, fuck it. This is an incredibly stupid idea, fuck it.

**** I recall a fair amount of them being Harry/Daphne or Harry/Hermione; if it's not the latter, then expect her to be bashed a lot in most indie!Harry stories. A few more are typical harem stories.

Though there are /a lot/ of Harmony fics, so you may be better served just looking for Harry/Daphne ones; and while i recall a few genuinely good romances, those area bit harder to find; most Harry/Daphne fics i recall are your typical Grey!Harry, Dumbledore (and sometimes Weasley) bashing fics.

** Honest question, just because I find this really funny: You use the word asshole once and fuck like nine times, but then use phrases like "bullhockey" and "horsefeathers" instead of "bullshit" or "horseshit". Why the reticence of using "shit" but the prevalent use of "fuck"?

*** Because phrases like Bullhockey and Horsefeathers are more amusing to me. Asshole is the correct description and Fuck It perfectly encapsulates the feeling I'm going for.

And as satisfying as regular curse words are, making up your own is just more fun. Gosh B'Darnit and Bullroar and Consarnit are just more fun.

** The Shock Of It All

I'm not sure if this fits, but Harry gets amnesia and people make the mistake of treating/speaking to Harry as they always had ( taking things for granted), to which Harry's reaction is pretty much 'fuck it'.
