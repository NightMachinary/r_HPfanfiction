** This has probably been debated to death, with the always same result that JKR doesn't understand how numbers work and it can be anything from 5 pounds (as per WoG) to a couple hundred pounds (based on some scenes in the books like Ron never having held a galleon before) or anything in between (based on different comparisons of purchase power).

Yeah my head canon has always been that a galleon is something like a $100 bill or a $50 bill - a large enough denomination that a school kid never would've held one before. I grew up comfortably middle class and I don't think I ever had occasion to actually handle a large denomination bill like that until well into adulthood.

Somewhere you've gotta be willing to change canon if you're trying to create a reasonably coherent system. That or contort yourself into knots trying to make canon "work."

After checking an inflation calculator, ¬£5 in 1991 is equal to ¬£10.54 today.

If you read Gringotts inheritance fics, Harry's family money isn't meant to be realistic. It's pure wish fulfillment and power wanking, the same way he has a Level 9000 magical core, phoenix creature inheritance, and 1/4 of Hogwarts.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4486n1/so_how_rich_was_actually_harry_potter_i_did_some/][According to someone]] who took a screengrab of Harry's pile of gold from the movie, his worth in more realistic numbers is ~$1.2 million.

**** Yeah, you're right. The estimate of $25/galleon is much too high. If we assume an exchange rate of ¬£10.54 per galleon based on the inflation calculation quoted above and Rowling's ¬£5/galleon comment, one galleon would be worth approximately $13.73.

Doing some quick back-of-the-napkin math, we come up with a net worth(based on the estimate of the number of galleons in the vault from that link, the exchange rate quoted by JKR for the worth of a galleon, the assumption this was the exchange rate circa 1991 and the inflation calculation above) for Harry of $659,040.00. as of the moment he visits Gringotts for the first time.

***** The worth of a galleon also fluctuates greatly depending on what it's for. 1000 Galleons was evidently enough to rent/buy what appears to be a big store with a great location. If that's the case, his canon vault alone is enough to buy out most of Diagon Alley since I doubt there's that much more than 50 stores there.

On the other hand, people have risked their lives competing in the TriWizard Tournament for 1000 galleons (I doubt the price of a galleon in magical purchasing power has changed much over the years). Pricing and purchasing power in Harry Potter fluctuates a LOT in canon, I'm pretty sure the school books and etc. cost a hefty amount as well, that's heavily disproportionate to how much it costs for other things.

Lockhart's books for example, cost 35 galleons in total. That's the equivalent of 5 WANDS - which Ollivanders probably sells at most 200 or so a year. How on earth does he even afford his rent and supplies when WWW spends Ollivander's entire yearly earnings on just starting up the business? Stuff don't make sense man.

Considering the fact that Ron was using his brother's old wand (7 galleons) which later snapped in half in the second book and couldn't get a replacement until the Weasleys won the lottery in book three, how on earth did they afford those books?! What's the priority here. How does money even work in the wizarding world.

Also not exactly canon (even if it's written by J.K. Rowling) it cost 30 galleons to smuggle people between countries (with a 20 galleon charge to not tell anyone Newt Scamander was leaving the country). HOW IS SMUGGLING PEOPLE (A MAJOR CRIME IF CAUGHT) CHEAPER THAN SCHOOL BOOKS!? -Again I stand by my point that the purchasing power of a galleon shouldn't have changed with muggle inflation)

*** 5 pounds per galleon might be the rough exchange value, but compared to the costs of living and wages I think the real value is closer to 25 pounds per galleon, considering the price of goods like newspapers, wands, omniculars, etc and how much the manufacturers of these goods can possibly earn. With characters using a wand for years after only paying 7 galleons for it, Ollivander can't really make that much money even as Britain's only wandmaker. So if he has a salary that's well above the poverty line (which he has to have, otherwise he'd raise prices) then the living costs in Diagon Alley are considerably lower than London.

That always struck me as just about right. It's a goodly chunk of money that means Harry is comfortably off, but not /wealthy/. Especially since as a magic-user he can handle a lot of day-to-day needs with magic.

** I think there's a fundamental issue when talking about the conversion rate between wizarding money and british money, one that I never see mentioned.

What's a commodity, service, or even specific product that's shared between the wizarding and muggle world?

Land? Wizards can just make more (expansion charms) or just take a bit and hide it from the muggles. No need to purchase it from them. Dishwashers? There's easy to cast spells for that, wizards don't even /have/ dishwashers. Cars? Well, wizards have flying brooms...

We can't even assume that basic cloth is comparable, thanks to the existence of conjuration and transfiguration.

So what, exactly, is the muggle currency being exchanged used for?

We can guess that gold, silver and copper are valuable in both worlds, given that wizards use them as currency. Which is odd, considering that the only metal that's specifically called out as all but impossible to produce magically is gold. So why are silver and copper considered valuable enough to make money out of?

But regardless, we have exactly three points of comparison that we know have value in the wizarding world but which also can be found in the muggle world.

And the numbers don't add up. We don't know exactly how big the coins are, but if we assume they're all the same size we can at least tell their relative value.

For ease of use, let's assume a knut weighs 10 grams. That's pretty fucking huge for a coin, but it's roughly the size of a copper piece in D&D, so whatever. That comes to about 1.1 cm^{3} volume. A 1 kilo copper ingot costs $15 on ebay, so that puts a knut at around $0.15 worth of copper.

A silver coin the same size would weigh around 11.5 grams. A 10 oz bar of silver costs around $177, so that would put a knut around $6.55 worth of silver.

Except a sickle is 29 nuts. $4.35 of copper is worth $6.55 of silver?

Well, let's check gold. At the same size as the knut and silver, 1.1 cm^{3,} you get 21.3 grams of gold. A 1oz bar of gold costs $1430 on ebay. That puts a galleon at around $1,076 worth of gold.

It's 17 sickles to a galleon, so $111.35 in silver is worth $1,076 in gold. Worse, $73.95 in copper is worth $1,076 in gold.

Since the value of the coins aren't in line with each other compared to the muggle world, this suggests that either the coins aren't pure metal - which means we have zero common points of comparison - or the economy is so decoupled that it's impossible to turn wizarding money back into muggle money which in turn suggests that the ministry is probably "buying" muggle money through the bank to subsidize half-bloods and muggleborns. Which is odd, to say the least.

So in short, the conversion rate is completely arbitrary, because we are given insufficient information to determine what the 'natural' conversion rate would be.

The Potter family is not part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, however they are a family as old as those who are. Rowling has stated that the only reason they didn't make the list is because whoever wrote it thought that 'Potter' was too Muggle of a name and, therefore, their family line must have been tainted. But given that they were a consideration at all, we can assume that they are, indeed, an old family.

Now, being an old family doesn't necessarily mean anything. The Weasleys are certainly an old family (and are, in fact, a family of the Sacred Twenty-Eight), but have very little wealth to speak of. However, even the Weasleys have family heirlooms.

Why are family heirlooms important? Because Harry's vault, from the descriptions in the book and from what we can see of the movies, are suspiciously absent of literally anything other than a pile of money.

No books, no portraits, no old-as-dirt broomsticks. Nothing. Except gold.

So there are two competing theories:

A: The Vault Harry is given access to is, indeed, some sort of Trust Fund setup until he's of age and could access the family vault.

B: The Potters, for whatever reason, store /nothing/ except Gold in their vaults.

While there is more obvious canonical evidence to support B, that evidence isn't mutually exclusive to A and I feel as though A is the more reasonable assumption of the two.

So we have other people in this thread saying that someone has 'done the math', as it were, and have estimated Harry's network, according to the only Vault we're aware of, to be in the range of $600,000. If we're assuming that's simply a Trust Fund, perhaps one setup before his father knew he would be dying and, thusly, is just a normal Trust Fund Harry would have access to until his death, there's likely much more waiting for him.

** My co-writer and I were talking about this in terms of the translated cost of things from muggle to magical and found that things are much cheaper in the magical world, possibly because you can refill things (providing you have something to refill) and it's a lot like a story my Dad used to tell me. That back in the seventies, he could get a very good pair of boots that would do him ten years, sometimes needing a little repairs here and there and they'd cost him around ¬£20 (about ¬£80 today) with a few quid on repairs. When he was in the army, he could afford that but when he got out, he realised he wasn't able to blow that much in one go so he had to keep getting a pair of shoes every 6 months to a year and cost ¬£3 (about ¬£12 now). Over all, he'd end up spending over ¬£50 (¬£200) getting lower cost shoes over the same time period because it cost about the same new as getting a cheaper set repaired.

I imagine magic is very much like this - if you can afford a large expenditure up front, you can reap the benefits of refills and repairs but if you're not skilled in repairing yourself, making improvements, it's beyond repair like some of the wands or there's something preventing repair, then in the long run, you have to pay out a lot more over time which could account for a lot of the wealth disparity despite magic being magic. You can also just gets things like the 21 galleon unicorn horns Harry see's in Diagon or some of the items in Borgin & Burkes, which will likely accumulate more worth over time as collectors will want them.

But in terms of how much things cost, it does seem like the magical britain is a cheaper place to live. You have to consider that Mrs. Weasley had not two Galleons (around ¬£16 in today's money according to the site i checked) in her vault and had enough to clothe, equip her children and have drinks in the pub later. If this was muggle world money, then that would be impressive - my first uniform alone was ¬£25 in 1997 and that was a regular senior school. Especially so, if you consider that Harry's wand cost him seven Galleons. The Knight bus, a sleeper bus, costs Harry 11 sickles, or ¬£3.19 (¬£12 now) compared with the old overnight ones I used to take which cost around ¬£28 (around ¬£40 now). Butterbeers may be the exception in that they cost 2 sickles 58p or ¬£2.30 now, not unheard of. Hermione even buys a black and gold quill which costs her fifteen sickles (¬£4.35 or about ¬£17.50 now) when it's nearest comparison - a black parker pen with a gold trim - would cost around ¬£60 in the shops now.

Frankly, it seems like if you have a lot of muggle money and translate it to magical currency, you'd end up with money that stretched further as well as magic preventing the need to replace many things. If wealth is indeed tied to competency in magic and large one-time expenditures which can be renewed, then it's easy to see how wealth can be stockpiled over generations. Add in that Fleamont's potion quadrupled what they had, it's no surprise that Harry had "mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze knuts."

** Well, first you need to ask the basic question: Are galleons "actually" gold coins?

If they are, then the conversion rate between galleons and the British pound would be quite higher than ¬£5(JK Rowling stated that a while back). And the goblins would HAVE to follow the muggle world's conversion rates from currency to gold, and vice versa, if they want to protect their economy.

If they are a combination of alloys that "look" gold, well, I'm not an economist, so I can't answer how an economy like that would work.

*** Or, they are /actually/ gold, but as part of the forging process, the goblins have enchanted them with certain magical properties.

For example, rust and tarnish proof, heat resistant, "won't fall out of your wallet", etc etc.

If that's the case, then taking galleons into the muggle world is a violation of the statute of secrecy- a coin that can't be melted down will attract a lot of attention. Therefore the value of gold in the muggle world is completely irrelevant to the value of a galleon, because arbitrating between the two is illegal.

**** Nice theory! And it would add a new depth to the statute of secrecy, while making it a bit more down-to-earth. Protecting the goblin gold from savvy muggleborn would make sense for the wizards and give something important for the aurors to do, other than walking around looking for Mandungus Fletcher or exploding toilets and disappearing keys.

However, can you imagine the logistics of that situation? From enchanting each individual coin, gold /and/ silver, with useful properties to searching for it in the case it's sold to a coin collector or sth. Sounds like an episode of "Aurors - Special Crimes Unit".

** For my writings, I use a rule of thumb of a US nickel per Knut, making a sickle being worth about $1.45 and a galleon worth about $24.65 (or about $25).

It doesn't /exactly/ follow the books, but keeping in mind Rowling notoriously struggles with maths, it works out for most things, and makes it easier to tailor the prices in my fiction.

[[https://i.imgur.com/9TghyU1.png][Here]] is a screenshot of the calculations page I use for my rough estimations of costs. Being American, I have everything also represented in USD. I included the tentative prices for various Wizarding items.

All my prices are automatically calculated using a variety of functions. Actually, I might create a tool that outputs currencies in both GBP and USD based on the current GBP/USD exchange rate...

It wouldn't be hard to set up, and it could be useful for fic writers to do quick calculations of how much some things cost. They could enter the conversion they want to use between galleons/sickles/knuts and GBP or USD, and the sheet automatically populates based on those values.
