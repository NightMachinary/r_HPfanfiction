As the title suggest I am really disappointed with cursed child like most, I am really curious to know how other fans would have written it.

Edit: Or your own version of it.


** linkao3(11880555) is an epilogue compliant fic where Delphi is raised by the Malfoys.

** Someone recommended Raindrops on Roses to me recently and I like it, but it doesn't really have much from Cursed Child in it (I think it was written beforehand, actually). It is, however, what I would have wanted /instead/ of Cursed Child; Albus, Rose, and Scorpius going about their lives at Hogwarts rather than only a few pages of Hogwarts before everything's taken over by complete wacky shit.

[Aside: I do think something interesting could be done with the characterizations from the first three of four pages of Cursed Child, which introduced the kids and then immediately leveled them up to fourth year. I can believe in an Albus who's oppressed by his parents' fame, though I still don't know why the hat would place him in Slytherin. Maybe he took his dad's words at the station too much to heart?]

  Narcissa's grand plan to end the war is to make Voldemort retire by giving him a child to worry about. Her plan works too well. Bellatrix is left to do damage control as Voldemort takes to parenting.

** Has Delphi in it, and Belletrix as a mother figure to Delphi, and Harry. Belletrix in this became who she was with Voldemort due to contracts with her husband? After Voldemort's downfall, she was questioned with even the truth potion(can never remember the spelling), and found innocent.

  Harry gets ambushed by two unfamiliar boys with oddly familiar faces and learns some very strange things. [Oneshot. Crackfic. Time travel. Albus-bashing (NOT Dumbledore-bashing). Not for "Cursed Child" fans.]
