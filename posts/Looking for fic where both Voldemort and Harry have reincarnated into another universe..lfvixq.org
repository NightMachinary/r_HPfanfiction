:END:
In this fic, it turns out Harry has been reincarnating 100s of times and done pretty much anything he ever dreamed of. Now Voldemort has reincarnated for the 1st or 2nd time into a female body and they end up in a relationship.

  The Master of Death brings his 130,000 years of experience to slam down on the unsuspecting head of his biggest and most entertaining challenge yet. Voldemort brings all her cunning and guile to rip open the mystery that is Harry Potter. And Dumbledore, Fudge, and the rest of the Wizarding world, scrabble to make sense of what in Merlin's name is going on. - On Hiatus
