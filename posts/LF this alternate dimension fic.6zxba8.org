[After reposting this for the third time, because I somehow, yet again, managed to put the wrong flair, I'm starting to think this was a bad idea.]

Hi,

I'm looking for this fic where the OOP of another dimension summon Harry to their dimension, in order to defeat Voldemort. My memory's a bit fuzzy, but I remember Neville was their dimensions BWL, Ron was dead, and Hermione was apart of this 'death eater hunters', thing, which she joined instead of becoming a witch, since her parents got killed by death eaters.

I think OG Hermione managed to make a portal of some sort to the dimension Harry was stuck in, and eventually Ron managed to get through.

Thanks in advance!

  Harry won the war. It's a couple months afterwards, and unexpectedly, he's quite literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago and the Potter family's still fighting a war with a Dark Lord whose ruling over the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry just really doesn't want in.
