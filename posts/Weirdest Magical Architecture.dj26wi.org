What are some really out-there designs for magical buildings or structures that you have seen in fanfics? My favourite is probably the Ceil D'Azur from linkffn(Contractual Invalidation), a massive, floating, shapeshifting wizarding resort in the sky built entirely out of magic.


** This is really, really common but the fact that so many magic trunks are so extensive on the inside, but no one has explored the aspect of it that is essentially the casual creation of pocket dimensions by a luggage seller, sometimes makes me irrationally angry. But obviously not enough so that I put pen to paper and come up with something myself.

*** Hermione does it in canon as well. You don't need a pocket dimension, just some bending of space. Basically a static warp field.

**** They don't mention it either way. If it's a warp field then where are they finding all this space-time to bend into their bloody suitcases? I'm talking about the ones where there's a mansion and a garden and what not. There's an oldish fic where middle-aged Harry works with magical space, and it's probably the only one I've read that deals with this kind of thing satisfactorily.

***** Space is not in short supply, the earth is traveling through it at high speeds. So all you need is magic to act like exotic matter, which honestly seems the tricker part in my opinion.

****** Plus, space is already self-replicating (you know, because dark energy is a real thing that exists) and we have evidence to suggest that it can naturally self-replicate faster than it's currently doing (inflation theory). With the right curvature of space and the appropriate considerations to gravity (which can be done with further refinements to that spatial curvature), a space like what we see wizards do is not all that unreasonable.

*** What winds me up is that they bend space to extend bags and trunks, but don't think of any other applications. With that space bending ability you could create wormholes, travel faster than light, even create black holes. But wizards aren't creative problem solvers like that, the entire education is built around memorizing existing spells. One skilled wizard with the mindset of an engineer and muggle sci-fi for inspiration could do so much just by reusing existing spells in different ways than they're intended.

**** This! With the abilities they have, they should be spread across the galaxy!

** There's an underwater market made of glass in joe6991's /An Unfound Door/. Elderglass to be more exact, which is apparently a reference to something I haven't read. It was pretty cool I guess.

*** Sounds like the reference is to the Gentlemen Bastard sequence, beginning with /The Lies of Locke Lamora./ One of the most entertaining books I've ever read, I recommend it!
