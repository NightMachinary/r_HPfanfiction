Hey everyone!

I wrote a fanfiction about Ginny and her life with 6 brothers, ( which I've always been jealous of), and a slight AU. Fremione and Hinny too. I update ALOT. Please read, and support!

[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/203519800-my-life-ginevra-molly-weasley]]

P.S: Some parts are AU, just thought I'll tell you, becuase some people were being quite trashy about it, and I'm a 13 year old girl working hard on this story, so it hurts.


** Hey, as somebody who's been thirteen and writing fanfic, the last thing you should do is advertise you are such and that people have given unkind criticism. It's sort of a beacon to all those with unkind intentions that you are an easy target to troll that will get them the rise they want from somebody.

On a second note, It's not fair, but you are going to have to learn that not everyone is going to critique kindly and some will be just downright insulting when they don't like/agree with something. How to handle that is to ignore the worst of it and if you do feel very compelled to reply, but are upset, give yourself a few hours, maybe even 24 to cool down and think it through before you reply.

Lastly, if you're looking for people to comment on your story, I would suggest posting on more than just Wattpad. Most older audiences (which HP is slowly becoming) do not like it and prefer to read on either AO3 or FF. FF is older and does not support images in their stories, so you would have to take them out and beef up your story with some actual description a bit, but AO3 would allow for you to keep your images. AO3 makes you wait for an invite typically before you can have an account, but if you'd like, I have several invites I could share to help you bypass the wait.

*** Thankyou for your advice, I suppose you're right. I will write it on FF too, thanks!

** Hi, I like your story (and having a fourteen-year old daughter, I can appreciate how much work it must be to write it), but I am kind of lost in terms of plot. Let me present you my theory of A and B (originally [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryandGinny/comments/ceiyfj/the_character_development_of_ginny_weasley/][here]], then expanded and rewritten on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][my blog]]).

Tell me, please, what is the point A and point B of your story? Where does Ginny moves from and where is headed to? That is, in my opinion, the only thing we as readers care for. What do we have? I am afraid I just see couple of not completely related images (how does first two or how many chapters even fit in the rest?).

Also, even if you want to make a romantic story (take some classic one, e.g., “When Harry Met Sally”) we have to have some doubts and questions whether they kiss in the end or not, they have to at least make such mess of their relationship that readers/viewers could have reasons not to be certain main characters would be able to get it together (see Harry and Sally). Here? I don't think there is one reader who has a second of confusion whether Fred and Hermione will get together.
