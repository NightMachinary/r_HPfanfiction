Lately I've been caught wondering what would have happened if Harry had an older brother or was the older brother. And I wanted to see how you guys think this change would do to the cannon plot.

For me, considering the possibility of Harry having an older brother, the first big change would be with the Dursleys. First, they probably would have slept on the cupboard for some time, but eventually they would have been moved earlier to Dudley's second bedroom. Harry wouldn't use Dudley's old clothes, because he would use his brother's things (as the brother wouldn't be able to use Dudley's clothes, so Petunia would be obligated to buy clothes for him). Harry wouldn't be so bullied or alone, as his brother would be his friend and would likely defend him from Dudley's gang.

Harry would likely find out about Hogwarts and the Magical Community earlier and, maybe, he would know more about the Wizarding World, because he would read his brother's school books. He would know a lot about Hogwarts, because his brother would tell him everything by letters and during summer.

Once in Hogwarts, I don't think Harry's friendship with Ron would have been so immediate, but it would probably happen later on.

Harry's brother would either push Harry out of trouble or go into the trouble with him. I can see the older brother getting angry because Harry went to the Forbidden Corridor, for example. His older brother would likely be proud of Harry for joining the Quidditch team. Etc, etc...

I also like to think that they would be more curious about their parents, trying to learn more about them.

I don't know how the story would progress. Would Harry's brother remember Sirius Black and recognize the dog, during PoA? Would Harry always have Ron and Hermione by his side during the shitty situations he got himself into? Or would both of them be substitute by Harry's brother? Would Dumbledore tell Harry's brother about the prophecy? What about the TriWizard Tournament? Would Harry's brother be a competitor, so he could get away from Harry's shadow? Would Harry be as depressed as we saw him during OoTP? Or would the presence of the brother help him heal from the pain of seeing somebody dying?

What do you guys thin? I would really appreciate, if you guys could give me your opinions.

Obs: I haven't considered the possibility of a sister, because I think a girl living with the Dursleys or her future relationship with Snape (especially if she looked like Lily) would be too weird to even be considered. 2Obs: I don't mind if Lily and James be aged up a little so the age difference is a bit larger between the brothers.


** Since the older brother would have to be born after March 30, 1979 (unless Lily is pregnant with him at school) but before October 31, 1979 (unless Lily gets pregnant with Harry while she's already pregnant), he'll only be around one year older than Harry. I have older sisters who are one year apart, and although the older one is a bit more mature, they've always been attached at the hip and did everything together, so I think Harry would be much more dependent on his friends and less emotionally closed off, so he could deal with people like Hermione and Cho much better and not like people like Ginny as much as he did in canon.

I don't the older brother could defend him from Dudley's gang since he's only one year older than them and Dudley is much larger than the average person his age, so he'd probably dwarf Harry's brother. Harry would probably not need a best friend as much as he did in canon, so I don't think he would put up with Ron's (or even Hermione's) mistakes as much as he did in canon. Ron may even be demoted to "regular friend" status after GoF for a while.

Harry's brother would only be three and I have few "clear" memories of when I was that age, so he probably wouldn't recognize Sirius. I think a large portion of your other questions could only be answered if we knew the brother's personality. Is the brother a quiet bookworm? Is he an evil sociopath who has a soft spot for Harry? Is he just Harry 2.0?

*** Yes, I also agree that having someone to interact with since a early age would make Harry more capable of dealing with more emotional people. He definitely wouldn't be so dependent of Ron as he is in cannon. After all, he knows that no matter what happens, he has his brother by his side.

Yeah, now that you point out the age difference, I realised that he wouldn't be the very best defense from bullying, although I still think that Harry Hunting wouldn't be so effective and common. Because even if Dudley has a gang, two boys is a much harder target than one boy. So, maybe, Dudley would be able to hit them once he got larger, but, unlike cannon, perhaps there would be a fight back. When I wrote that, I wasn't considering James and Lily's age, so I was imagining someone two or three years older than cannon Harry.

Again, I was considering a different age for Harry's brother, which is why I was counting on the possibility of him being able to remember something .

I thought it would be fun to have an older brother with a personality closer to what I believe was James' personality. So I would like him to be a Gryffindor through and through, maybe a prankster, that would slowly turn into a more responsible person (like what happened to his father).

Thank you!

** Either older or younger, they probably wouldn't be very far apart in age. Lily and James were only 20 when Harry was born. And then he was 15 months old when they died. So maybe a years either way.

Let's consider a brother born June 1, 1979. Sirius would be his godfather, and Peter or Remus would be Harry's godfather (I have to go with Peter because Remus is a werewolf and wouldn't have thought it was a good idea).

He'd be 2yr and 5mths old on Halloween. Definitely able to talk. It's unlikely that he would know or understand that Peter was the secret keeper. And he would have forgotten about it by the time he was a kid.

He'd probably be given his own clothes for a few years, but as Dudley got bigger and he and Harry failed to catch up in size, he would also wear Dudley's clothes.

They'd probably share the smaller bedroom, so too bad for Dudley there. I don't think he'd be able to do much about Dudley and his gang either. But he and Harry would definitely be each other's confident.

He'd get his Hogwarts letter in July of 1990. The Dursleys would still hide from it, and Hagrid would go to collect the brother. He might also take Harry along for the trip to Diagon Alley.

The Dursleys and the brothers would go to King's Cross on September 1st and Harry would be forced to leave his brother behind as the Dursleys laughed and walked away.

Harry would then spend a miserable year at Privet Drive while the the brother was away. It's possible that the windows would be locked to prevent owls from coming from the brother. Maybe the brother gets the Invisibility Cloak.

His school books would be locked up in the cupboard during the summer. They would have to find a way to go to Diagon Alley to buy the brother new books, as well as a wand and other necessities for Harry (Harry could probably use most of his brother's old books if he wanted to).

Harry starts his first year, and his brother shows him how to cross the barrier, meaning he wouldn't meet the Weasleys that way. His brother may let him sit with him and his friends on the train. But Harry would eventually meet Ron and they may become friends, as well as the Weasleys. Idk who would go down to the Stone.

Hopefully Fred and George would really like the Potter brothers and would help them escape the following summer. They'd maybe sleep in Bill and Charlie's old room, or both in Ron's, or Harry in Ron's and the brother with the twins. Their Hogwarts letters would come while theyre at the Weasleys. Perhaps Mr. Weasley would drive the brother to the Durselys to get his Hogsmeade letter signed. Idk who goes down to the Chamber.

They'd probably run away from the Dursleys the following summer and Sirius Black is officially after his godson and his younger brother. Harry doesn't have permission to go to Hogsmeade, and the brother may not be allowed to go, although the only excuse is that if Harry isn't allowed to go, that must mean the Dursleys don't want either of them to go. They share a room in the Leaky Cauldron. Neither remember any of the Marauders. Things happen, dementors are bad for both of them. Do both boys sneak into Hogsmeade and learn the Sirius is the brother's godfather? Do both boys get mystery Christmas gifts? Do both learn the Patronus Charm? Sirius Black gets into Harry's dorm and it's obvious which brother he's after. Meeting Sirius Black, meeting Peter Pettigrew (who is Harry's messed up godfather), Remus Lupin transforms.

Fourth year the go to the Quidditch World Cup. Apparently you can just add more chairs to the boxes, so no big deal with an added person. Triwizard Tournament occurs and Harry is chosen. Brother sticks by his side as the school hates him. He tries to help Harry find a date to the Yule Ball. He is taken as Harry's most cherished person in the lake. Both regularly write to Sirius and go see him. The brother takes his OWLs. Cedric Diggory dies, Voldemort returns, and Harry is in turmoil.

In the summer, Harry doesn't feel so alone. The brothers spend a lot of time outside of the house and dementors come. Both try to conjure a Patronus and one succeeds. Both are expelled for using magic outside of school in front of a muggle. Both are rescued and taken to Grimmauld Place. And Molly still says Sirius is seeing them as replacements for James. The brother's test results come back and he can't continue NEWT potions with Snape. What are his career goals? Umbridge tortures them both. Nagini attacks Mr. Weasley and everyone goes to headquarters for Christmas. Sirius gives them both the mirror, and perhaps they open it. Idk what happens after that.

*** I agree with pretty much everything you said hahahah

Sirius would definitely be the godfather of Harry's brother, while Harry would likely has Peter - as you mentioned. I think another fact that would help Peter be chosen over Remus, is because Remus was thought to be the traitor. Therefore, being a werewolf+traitor wouldn't do Remus much help.

Yeah, knowing that Peter was the Secret Keeper would be impossible. When I wrote the memory part, I did considering a two or three years older brother, and I was really thinking of seeing Padfoot and thinking something like "Wow, we had a dog just like this" or feeling like a deja-vu.

Well, Dudley was larger, sure, but perhaps if the brother was much taller, Petunia would still need to buy clothes. Although I agree that the most likely would be they endding up using Dudley's clothes.

Even if they lock the windows, I like to believe the owls would wait to make the deliver when he was outside or something like this. I don't know. I don't he would receive the clock, I think Dumbledore would rather give it for them when both were in Hogwarts.

I don't think Harry's friendship with Ron (or Hermione) would be as close as in canon. They would talk, sure, but I think Harry would be more likely to have more friends, than just two.

Yeah, I don't know if the CoS rescue would happen. It would depend on how close they were with the Weasley. But, for sure, Dumbledore would sent someone there to pick them up for Hogwarts.

To make it believable, I considered the possibility that Harry's brother was not in Godric's Hollow during Halloween - because of Dumbledore's explanations, etc -, so he, for example, was with Sirius and this was the reason why Sirius got into Godric's Hollow and met Hagrid. Therefore, I don't think dementors would affect him half as badly as they affect Harry. He wouldn't have the memory of their parents murder being constantly remembered. But I do think both would learn the patronous as well as Christmas gifts.

I agree with everything about fourth year.

I think only Harry would be expelled. The main idea of sending dementors was to affect Harry's reputation, because Harry was the Ministry's trouble.

I like to think the brother would either be really good in Transfiguration or Charms, to honour one of his parents.

I also don't know whag would happen next, but I think that they would discuss more about the possibilities, like, they would eventually get to the question "Why is Voldemort always after me?". Maybe Sirius would tell the brother about the prophecy? Perhaps the brother would think about using the mirror, instead of crashing into the DoM? Maybe Sirius wouldn't have died? If they ever went horcrux hunting, Harry's brother would certainly be with him.

Thank you!

** As there's now someone else with Lily's blood, I don't think there's a reason for them to be at the Dursleys at all.

*** Well, sure, maybe it wouldn't be necessary for them to live with the Dursleys. But, perhaps, Dumbledore wanted to make sure that the protection would be efficient. So, two is better than one, right? Besides, the protection was not Dumbledore's only interest with Harry living with the Dursley, he also wanted to Harry live a "normal" childhood out of the knowledge that he was famous (according to chapter one of PS). So, maybe they would live with the Dursley no matter what. Either way, I don't really know. I'm just pondering over the possibility that the only change in the upbringing be Harry's brother presence and how it would affect the cannon aspects.

** Is is very interesting premise.

Knowing Dursleys ... they would force both boys to sleep in the cupboard until the letter arrives, they would still wear Dudley's cust offs, even if they small or tight or otherwise illfitting. In canon we see that Dudley is very big boy for his age, it is unlikely that Harry's brother would be much bigger than Harry.

I think a lot would depend on the personality of his brother.

For example he could end up in Ravenclaw. Not sure if it is canon or fanon, but I do think that Slytherin and Ravenclaw generally get along (or at least better than Slytherin/Gryffindor do). Meaning Harry potentially would not have such a biased/negative view of the house ... So Harry could end up in Slytherin as a result. Now that could lead to some pretty drastic changes.

There is another angle story could take - what if his older brother would grow jealous of Harry and his fame, always being forgotten, in the shadows, the "other" Potter no-one really cares about?
