** linkffn(9392346) /My Friend Tom/ Same vein of Accidental Horcrux, less well written, however (In my opinion), but equally enjoyable.

(Hit the Grond Running)[[[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=Hit+the+ground+running]]] Again, same premises as Accidental Horcrux, and there is a sequel running around somewhere (it has been taken down from ff.net and ao3, the only way to read it is through archives.

linkao3(9392346) /Lesser Evil/ Dark!Harry, with no Voldemort/Harry relationship, but Harry does use the horcrux connection at the start of the serie.

linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) (because it really deserves a mention on its own, even though it's a carck fic)

linkffn(Lithium)

linkffn(11358664) /Warning signs read desolation/ Really worth reading, not really dark!Harry, but explores a twisted mentorship with Voldemort who learned that Harry was a horcrux.

#+begin_quote
  The smallest change in details can lead to vastly different outcomes. When Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he befriends the entity that resides within. This simple act results in a ripple effect that tears the story as we know it apart, causing a descent into the madness that is the human psyche.
