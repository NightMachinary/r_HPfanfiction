I like the fics where Harry actually gets ready for Voldemort. I read one a while back where he trains and keeps it a secret from everyone and slowly get more powerful. I don't care who trains him(as long as it's believable, no Snape suddenly becomes good and trains Harry) I don't mind if he becomes super powered. Thanks in advance.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]] might fit your criteria. Admittedly it's more raised than trained, but still an interesting story.

*** That sounds great. I'll check it out. I'm looking for stories like that that have some reason why Harry can even stand up to Voldemort not just the tired," Voldemort underestimates Harry, so Voldemort loses " I want something where Harry works for it. Even if it's some kind of time travel where Harry lives for years but only x amount of time passes for everyone else. Thank you I'll be checking that story out.

Ignore the vague story info at the beginning. You will discover all of that as you read the story.

** [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunrise_Over_Britain/index/][Sunrise over Britain]] a massively long fic with an even longer sequel that has Harry initially becoming very superpowered, but spends a good amount of time training with others and hiding the fact that he is that powerful.
