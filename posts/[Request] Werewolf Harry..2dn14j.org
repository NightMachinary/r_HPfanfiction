Any fics where Harry struggles with lycanthropy from a young age, or maybe he's infected during his time at Hogwarts, and has to hide it?

I'm not looking for some kind of Super Wolf Harry, more of a human struggling with a condition beyond his control.


** Probably the "Harry is a Werewolf" story I know of is DobbyElfLord's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8106168/1/Weres-Harry][Were's Harry]], 145k words, WIP (last updated earlier this month).

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

It's a slight spoiler, but this is a plot point in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1625069/1/The-Basement][The Basement]] by Marz1; 81k words, complete.

  AU third year. I must have a sign on my back that says psycho paths please attack me. I would not put it beyond Dudley to afix such a sign to me, but I doubt he could spell it accurately enough for a psycho to understand.

**** Nah its not super wolf, it falls more in the category of "my not hating muggles makes me have super magic and now I'm forced to find ways to make the story have any conflict". It didn't start this way though, it actually started with a measure of mystery and intrigue but a lot of interesting stories built on worldbuilding lose their plot around the 40k mark.
