For me I had a time where reading fanfics were no longer fun (after reading them for 6 years) so I went back and read fanfics with my favorite pairing to get myself back into enjoying them again.


** I reached a point where every recommended fic here had been read, ffn and ao3 seached through for top 500 fics, over 3000 fics downloaded and read in ffn app, and daily searches for "newly updated" 40k+ fics. And i just couldn't find anything new to sink my teeth into. Was all just re-reading constantly. (This was a result of a 4 year long depression)

almost gave up but fanfiction was the only thing keeping from boredom, so i stuck with it and tried different fandoms, more crossovers and now i sorta keep afloat with daily updates, crossovers and fics updating.

**** First old games i used to play (dungeon keeper, overlord, final fantasy) but there werent really anything good. Nowadays its mostly final fantasy when they pup up, naruto,highschool dxd, sword art online, avengers, stargate fandoms, and whatever else i know enough of to not feel completely lost ;) Though i have been keeping up to date with new games, and have found 2 good subnautica fics recently. I usually just go hp/crossovers. Then look through the crossovers to find a fandom i know of/am interrested in. If there arent any good hp/new fandom fics to read, then i look through the fandom itself, or the fandom crossed with something else. It feels like the only way for me to find new fics nowadays xD

(Is it too much to ask for, for a hp/final fantasy 7 fic where Harry isnt reincarnated, travels to ff world, and uses materia!? Such an interresting magic system, and its bloody never used.. gahh! /rant over)

***** I totally get where you are coming from!! I never played the FF 7 but there are crossovers that I WISH did a better job of integrating Harry into the world.

** I never stopped reading fanfiction entirely, but for a long period I stopped reading hp fanfic.

I'm French, so in my teens I was reading mainly in french and after the last book was published, I couldn't find anything new (I don't know about english fic, but the main trope in french years ago was the Dramione head boy and girl sharing a dorm one, it was like 90% of the fandom and it got boring real quick). So I totally stopped hp fic and went to other fandoms for a long time.

I only came back one or two years ago because in the meantime I became fluent in english so I could explore a whole new world of fic.
