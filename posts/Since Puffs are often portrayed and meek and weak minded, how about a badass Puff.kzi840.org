Oftentimes, Hufflepuffs are portrayed as weak characters or just background ones or sheeple with the only exception being Cedric so I thought, why not a badass Puff Meg 'Crotch-Kicker' McCaffrey style? I don't care if they're OC's and/or side characters because honestly I'm ok with that. OC's are sometimes easy to work with since they are a blank slate and side characters could be a good thing. Hell look at RWBY. They got side characters and people sometimes like them more than the main cast.

** This exists in canon, and his name is Newt Scamander.

In all seriousness, this sounds amazing and I love seeing Hufflepuff being awesome.

** This reminds me of an old tumblr post that was discussing Gravity Falls and HP crossovers. Apparently, Bill Cipher in Hufflepuff, who already rocks the black/yellow theme, would make everyone lower their guards and would single handedly ruin Hufflepuff's nice reputation within a year. Possibly even elevating them to the darkest house position.

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.
