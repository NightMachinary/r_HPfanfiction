:END:
Searching for a Harry/Tonks fic that I had the sudden want to re-read. I shall line out what I recall about it.

- Harry goes back in time to when Tonks was in Hogwarts or was just starting being Auror.
- He changes his name to Ludwig or something similar and eventually becomes an Unspeakable.
- Ludwig Harry gives past Harry a gem necklace thing explaing that he is a future version of himself.
- At the end, Ludwig reveals to Ron that he is Harry and plans on staying as Ludwig.
