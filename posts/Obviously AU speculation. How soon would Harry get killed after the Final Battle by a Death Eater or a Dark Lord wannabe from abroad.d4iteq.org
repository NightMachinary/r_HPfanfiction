This of course applies as if the Epilogue did not happen, so by definition is AU.

It's something I've been thinking about. Consider this, Harry defeated Voldemort by extreme luck and a quirk of magic. Something that worked only against Voldemort specifically. He's pretty much average in magic, "reasonably talented" as Dumbledore put it. He's no Tom Riddle, Albus Dumbledore or even on the level of Severus Snape, Lily Evans or Hermione Granger, who were called either called extremely talented or did things in school that Harry never even dreamed of. He also shouted to the entire Great Hall that he now possessed the Elder Wand. Word is definitely going to spread.

How long until people hear about the wand and decide to act on it? Sure, he is trained as an auror pretty much as soon as the war is over, but still, his skill will never match his reputation. Harry's not a magical prodigy or even an extremely talented wizard. Someone, sooner or later, will want to confront him for one reason or another. Either for the wand, or for the glory of defeating the person who killed Voldemort.


** You disregard many things Harry did that were beyond in the scope of "reasonably talented" children. He cast an incredibly difficult spell - Lupin's words. He was by far the best dueller of his generation and his upper years as well. His innate understanding of magic is impressive by any standars, proven by his quick grasp of what he needs to do when he and Voldemort cross streams in graveyard, something that took Voldemort longer to realise. He has, when motivated, accomplished everything he set his mind to, and we know he is passionate about becoming an auror so it's safe to assume he would work hard at it, especially considering he knows he now has a responsibility of keeping the Wand of Destiny out of those hands that would abuse it.

All in all, his reputation plus his brilliance under extreme duress could have him smack down the odd wanna-be dark lord that pops up every few decades. Only someone as talented and brilliant as Grindewald, Dumbledore and Voldemort could potentially take from him the Elder Wand.

*** And Harry can still be snuck upon (a killing curse from beneath an invisibility cloak is still very deadly!)

As for Harry being good: He was able to learn the patronus only because it was killing his fun (quidditch)...otherwise Harry never truly put in much work, unless he was directly threatened (Year 4 with the TWT!)...

Motivated? Set his mind to? Have you read Harry's plans for the 'crux-hunt? No, you didn't (unless it was fanfiction) because Harry didn't plan, despite having MONTHS! He brough his wand and spare clothes! No bag of holding full of preserved/canned food, no tent (that was Hermione's!) etc.

Canon Harry is dumb, he is a decent fighter but he's only "so good" because his generations SUCKS! Seriously, during the Marauder's Generation he'd be below average! Snape, the Marauders and Lily were all great students (Snape created his own spells and potions, Lily was well liked by Slughorn and he only liked accomplished students, the Marauders were top-students without learning (they spend time creating pranks, just like Fred and George but better! They made the Marauder's map, they became animagi etc.)

Seriously, Harry's entire generation truly sucks!

IMHO he'd truly die (but Rowling sadly didn't take it into account that a disgruntled pureblood biggot might assassinate him (or have him assassinated, there's surely wands for hire, just like we have guns for hire in RL! You just need the money and know where to look and Voldemort's (former) followers have both!))

*** /cough cough/ The DA had supposedly members from the lower years like Ginny, Luna, Creepy, Creepy Jr?, who learned the 'incredibly difficult spell'. Also, Harry was never seen dueling, all the fighting he did was running from people (at the end of 5th year), and three /expeliarmus/ at Voldemort at different points in time. As for his innate understanding of magic? Hermione was basically tutoring him full time, she learned the spells before him and then taught him as seen during the tournament. Harry teaching the DA made absolutely no sense to me.

#+begin_quote
  â€˜Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,' Harry mumbled.
#+end_quote

Hardly passionate. Harry was mostly guilt-tripped into that by Sirius's talks about James. In fact this next line alone defines how Sirius treated/manipulated Harry, and why I find him easy to bash.

  â€˜You're less like your father than I thought,' he said finally, a definite coolness in his voice. â€˜The risk would've been what made it fun for James.'

P.S Harry was an idiot teen who survived by plot armor and the help of the real main character and obviously a Slytherin-in-hiding, Hermione.

3 fourth years? I don't remember Colin casting one. Only Luna did it in front of dementors and she damn near had to beg Harry to cast his own despite the presence of 3-4 patronuses.

Pretty sure he stopped to take down death eaters in the 5th, 6th, and 7th books and which spell was going to take down the 70 year old prodigy.

#+end_quote

He understood wands, fairytales, and symbolic/emotional magic better than she and most of the characters could. She taught him one spell in GOF and that's because he was too busy worrying he'd die in days' time.

#+begin_quote

Because he's better than her at dueling and defense as seen between books 3-7.

How does this work when James wasn't an auror and Harry and Sirius never spoke about his future career? I don't think they spoke about James that much, tbh.

You should tell the rest of the characters and the author that.

**** I don't necessarily agree with canon Hermione being an undercover Slytherin, though I do enjoy her in the House occasionally.

I do however, feel you on how completely easy it is to bash Black. He's extremely juvenile; a complete manchild stuck in the past trying to deal with his pain and grief by forcing Harry in the hole James left. It was something that bothered me throughout their dynamic in canon and even now as a fanfic author I have to keep myself from falling into /*my*/ dislike for him. Same goes with Dumbledore and all the Weasley's except for the Twins, Bill and Charlie.

Hermione is book smart and a talented witch but she isn't much of a warrior like Harry is. I do see what you mean about Harry feeling a bit subpar compared to everyone else. I always wondered how Dumbledore could kill Grindelwald but the "Saviour" of the Wizarding world lay in the hands of an infant. ðŸ™„ðŸ¤”

I personally see Hermione as the General of the "Golden Trio" she plans, they act. It worked at least...though a lot of death's could have been avoided if ole Dumbles wasn't a slippery, slimy old coot. He's honestly the most Slytherin out of all the Slytherin's besides Professor Snape...

*** He cast a difficult spell... as did Hermione with the Protean charm, as did several DA members cast the patrouns: Cho, Hermione and others (check the books). Was he the best dueler? I don't think so, he was quick on his feet and usually took his opponents by surprise (the Death Eaters at the cafe), his only real duel was against Malfoy in HBP and that was even until they started to use Dark Magic and Harry was just faster. He was utterly humiliated by Snape and Snape was not even trying in the same book.

I don't disagree that Harry has good morals and was taught by Dumbledore the significance of certain magical acts, as with the destruction of the locket which brought closure to Ron. Harry's wiser than his years and morally strong. That doesn't mean he's great at magic, he's above average at most. That was the whole point of the series btw, that you don't have to be the best warrior or the most fearsome mage in order to win, strong friendships can make up for that (the power of love as Dumbledore pointed out).

It was Harry's sacrifice and his wisdom in the face of death, not his wand skills that won him the day and good job for that, or the Wizarding World would be screwed.

**** He was the best dueller among his peers, teaching his peers to duel better than an average witch or wizard proved that. And he cast the patronus at 13, under extreme duress while in close proximity with a number of dementors, not in a classroom settings. And yes, Hermione did cast a protean charm. That's because she's a prodigy. Yet for all her prodigial skills and knowledge, Harry could wipe the floor with her. That is because, as you can guess, Harry is a prodigy when it comes to defence.

The moral of the story wasn't that if you have friends, you don't need to get stronger to defeat the undefeatable. It's that there is strength in numbers and power in love, and that when all seems lost, that strength and power can and will make a difference.

And yes, he was defeated by Snape. Quite easily even. But that's normal. No matter how prodigial Harry is, Snape has over decades of experience and quite a sharp mind of his own.

*** Hermione wasn't exceptional! Seriously, she's only this good because she reads ahead (the teachers never seem to do, show or discuss stuff that isn't in the textbooks! They don't even discuss the nature of dark-magic in defense...Fake-Moody shows some, but he doesn't talk about it much!) and reads some more because of idle curiosity!

Hermione only devised TWO magical objects in her entire Hogwart's time!

The DA-Coin (well, done! This was an accomplishment, no doubt about it - but it also doesn't hold a candle to the Marauder's map or the Mirror of Erised or Gryffindor's Sword, the Diadem of Raveclaw, Hufflepuff's Cup, the Hollows etc. etc.) and the cursed parchment (hell, that may not even count as an enchanted item!)

The Marauders and the Twins easily have her beat, as does Snape!

Seriously, Hermione knows McGonagall is an animagus, but she never attempts the transformation? Come on! IMHO she should have, as a form of "hero worship" :)

He threw the stone, has the cloak, and cant remember if he kept the wand or returned it to Dumbledores grave.

Realistically, after all the hype and bloody history Rowling gave the artifacts Harry would not live long. Remember they just need to take it from him like Gellert did. Regardless of what people say about Harry or his patronus spell skill or quidditch skills he is still not a great wizard.
