I've never been a fan of ao3 and avoid it when I can. Is there anything I've missed out on?

edit: Not interested in slash.


** Esama has some good stuff and is an ao3 exclusive. I really like /Island of Fire/, where Harry and friends build a civilisation from ground up. linkao3(3236603)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/dirgewithoutmusic/pseuds/dirgewithoutmusic][dirgewithoutmusic]] has several popular short stories that are character studies of minor characters, and a few what--if scenarios based around who raises Harry.

/Knives/ is my favorite ao3 work. Ginny attempts to take revenge on Lucius for the diary incident. Second person narrative, dark themes, not a cathartic story. linkao3(982121)

L'optimisme: An AU story of Albus and Gellert after the latter leaves Godric's Hollow. Employs rather flowery prose, heavy use of imagery. linkao3(2428940)

Left Hook: Ginny Time-travel fic. linkao3(4904485)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/jenorama/pseuds/jenorama][Jenorama]] has several short stories (and one longer WiP) featuring canon relationships. [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Inell/pseuds/Inell/works?fandom_id=136512][Inell]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Ely_Baby/pseuds/Ely_Baby][Ely_Baby]] write mainly smutty stories, pairings all over the place.

Other good ones: linkao3(565572; 396278; 27105; 142763; 76683)

  “Why are you here?” Parvati asked Pansy once. People asked her a lot, when they found her in Flourish and Blotts, or at work on the Prophet. Their eyes raked her, looking for green, for silver, for venom. Sometimes she'd smile back and let them see the danger. "Because I'm not fifteen anymore," said Pansy. "God, do you know what precious Potter Sr. got up to at school, the bully? But boys get to grow up to be men, you see, and us girls just grow up to be bitches."

** I don't think 'slash' is the issue, it's more to do with how explicit they are. Perhaps slash writers are less likely to write non-explicit romance, I don't know. I have one short story on there which I wrote for a smut challenge and an explicit chapter in a story which is posted in its censored form on ffn. Those aren't slash. They don't get many readers. Perhaps that's why.

**** Lol at that summary. Good question though. Personally I think the best slash is as good as the best het and that the worst slash is as bad as the worst Het. I've read terrible fics in both camps so I'm not sure where the stereotype that slash is so bad came from.

On ao3 there's just more slash, so there's more great slash and more terrible slash. I have my bookmarks all stored on there with comments so you can look through those if you're interested in finding something in particular. [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks]]

** I can't think of a single good HP story on AO3 that's not on FFN. But, I don't read harems stories or slash.

** I rather liked linkao3(a year like none other). It's Harry/Draco friendship and mentoring/father figure Snape. No slash.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
