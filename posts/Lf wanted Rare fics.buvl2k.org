Do you know those rare fanfics that you don't usually find by googling it or in communities? The type that you come across when its mentioned in an author notes in other stories or other means. I used to know a few HP fics but I can't remember them. One I do remember is deprived by The crimson lord. Yes,its very popular but it cannot be found at Harry Potter FanFiction Archive which is supposed to hold every HP ff(and yes,I checked) Another example I can give you is a naruto fic,everyone has darkness. This particular fic actually fits several community's tropes, like demon naruto or evil naruto. But you don't find this fic in any naruto communities. Similarly there are HP fics out there with a large number of following and reviews but you can't find them unless you google the exact title of the fic. Any suggestions ? (Fics with 300+ reviews preferred)


** If a fic has more than 300 reviews it's not rare. If you want rare you should be looking for fics with very low numbers of reviews and favourites. They are the ones that need to be discovered and whose writers will appreciate your attention.

And I am so, so tired of having to state this incredibly obvious fact over and over again.

*** Do you know deprived by the crimson lord? Do you know that it has 3k+ reviews ? Yet it cannot be found at Harry Potter FanFiction Archive | FanFiction which is supposed to have every HP ff.

Perhaps you are confused by MY definition of rare. Please read what I described above. If you don't get it,then ignore it. And if you are "so, so tired of having to state this incredibly obvious fact over and over again",then leave. Don't comment. Just ignore this post,hell even down vote it. Just leave,its that simple. The reason I PREFERRED the 300+ reviews is because I'm looking for a fanfic that I can hardly remember except for the fact that it had 300+ reviews. But since I can't remember anything too significant to describe the fic, I asked in the form of rare fics.
