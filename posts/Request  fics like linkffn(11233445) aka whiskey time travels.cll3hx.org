Hey, looking for fics where Harry goes back in time to the marauders era. Preferably similar to Whiskey Time Travels but anything where he is in the marauders era is fine. Ones where he is a marauder would be cool too. Preferably 100k words+ and finished but anything above 70k words is ok. Thanks!

linkffn(11233445)


** Linkffn(Wind Shear) sounds pretty similar.

Harry accidentally ends up in the early seventies, goes to a bar to get drunk, and a bunch of Death Eaters attack and try to slaughter muggles, so Harry puts an end to it. Bellatrix had just joined and switches sides to the mysterious and powerful new wizard. Voldemort doesn't like where this is going. And the Marauders love their new badass DADA teacher.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976
