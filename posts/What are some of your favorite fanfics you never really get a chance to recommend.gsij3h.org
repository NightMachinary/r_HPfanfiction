One of my favorites that I haven't had a chance to recommend because none of the requests really would have fit is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][/Realizations/ by wishweaver]]. I wish it was complete, but even looking at it as it stands, it's fairly cohesive, even without a proper ending.

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

******* Yeah, the cutoffs where there's at least some resolution are far more satisfying than the ones that end on a new plot twist or cliffhanger. I'd still like to see more of it, though. I really love the stories where a strong parental figure (almost always female) tells Dumbledore where to stick it with his little schemes.

Darkness, Old Friend by Lyra_Dhani. An Obscurial!Harry fanfic that I really liked.

linkao3(22810651)\\
How Like Home by waitingondaisies. A good Harry travels to another dimension fanfic. He adjusts to having living parents, as well as dealing with his grief and the changes in the new world like having Sirius & Snape be married

linkao3(10394319)\\
They Didn't Know We Were Seeds by Lucy_Luna. A good Snape, Lily, and others time travel fanfic that doesn't have a Lily/Snape pairing. I find it to be an amazing fic.

linkao3(10832529)\\
Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance by epsi10n. Read it quite a while ago, but remember enjoying it. Premise is that Hermione is the reincarnation of Salazar Slytherin.

linkao3(17268434)\\
A pretty good Slytherin!Sirius fic where he's still the same person but obviously, some elements are still different.

  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. Instead, he finds nothing at all. When he wakes up, he is informed by Unspeakables that he is from an alternate universe. Thanks to his uncanny resemblance to his counterpart, Harry is readily recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James Potter. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe. Now, Harry must adapt to life with loving parents in a peaceful world.

  They don't question why Hermione Granger is able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seems to know Hogwarts: A History by heart. They never really notice her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. A Gryffindor meant for Ravenclaw, they call her- and yet...Who would've thought that once upon a time, her name was Salazar?Year 1: Salazar Slytherin is reincarnated as a "booksmart" muggleborn girl, a debutante again in a much changed magical world. The plan for the year should have been perfectly simple: be insignificant, stay uninvolved, and observe instead of jumping right into action like a certain somebody. However, upon arriving at Hogwarts to find Slytherin house overrun by blood-purists, a murderer on the staff, a treasure on the third floor and over-adventurous children all around, even the serpent lord starts to find it difficult to stay out of trouble...
