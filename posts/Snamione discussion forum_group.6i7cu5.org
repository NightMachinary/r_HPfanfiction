I'm looking for various groups or forums that focus on Hermione Granger & Severus Snape as a ship. In particular, I'm looking for someone to co-write a fic I'm working on. Help!


** As a portmanteau, wouldn't it make more sense to smush together both first names or both last names?

Hermiverus\\
Sevmione\\
Snanger\\
Grape (well, okay, that would be just silly; maybe Granape)

EDIT: perhaps more a combo of their epithets.

Mud Prince.

I suppose we should be grateful JKR didn't call her 'Hermione Puckle', or we'd have Snuckle.

*** It definitely would make more sense lol. I didn't name the ship, though. A few people call it Sevmione or Snanger, but Snamione is the most common. I stick with Snamione for that reason alone.

** Unfortunately I don't know of any forums, but hope somebody can recommend one.

Just wanted to say, they're my OTP too :) I'm currently in the middle of my yearly Granger/Snape fanfic binge and it's wonderful ;)

** The only active community I know is over on [[http://snapeyluvshermy.livejournal.com/][LiveJournal]].

You could try asking on there to see if anyone could help.

** Hey - yeah I'd be interested. I had a similar discussion with someone over on the Granger Enchanted Survivors FB page.

*** Are you saying you're similarly interested in a Snamione forum, or are you volunteering to help me co-write?

**** Tentatively both, I currently also have a Snamione WIP and would love to find some to work with. If our styles and schedules mesh I'd be game. I'd love a discussion board/forum though also.
