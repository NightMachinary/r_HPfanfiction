I just realized that while I've read many fics with romance, and even a few focused exclusively on it, I've not read any original works in the genre. Any recs for someone who likes plot with romance? Exclusive romance is fine as well, as long as it isn't too long and is well written. Slash and femslash is fine, and even preferred, as I have run into straight romance elements in original fiction, but not these.

Please avoid angst and hurt/comfort type stuff.

Any conventions from the genre that have made their way into fanfiction, or been adapted in a different form?


** This is a really unique request! I agree that "romance" fics are not what I am typically drawn to in regular fiction, but I love them in fanfic - go figure.

Anyway, I think if you are into something a little plottier but with a firm romance genre, I'd recommend "The Time Travelers Wife" by Audrey Niffenegger. The book was much better than the movie (isn't it always) so don't make the mistake of reading in the wrong order.

I also really love the author Rainbow Rowell and actually she used to write Drarry fanfiction (although she won't reveal what her psued was). I've loved everything she has written, but "Fangirl" (about a college student who is REALLY into writing fanfic) and "Attachments" were my favorite. And she wrote a m/m slash fic called "Carry On" that is the last book of the fake canon that goes along with Fangirl. It is hard to explain but read Fangirl first and it will make sense.

I haven't come across much adult fiction with slash romances that I have liked, but for a teen one, I really liked "Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda" by Becky Albertalli.

And lastly, considering you're a HP fan, I think you should definitely read Ready Player One. It is sci-fi/fantasy with a really compelling romance. Hope there's something in here you'll like!

** Hmmm, I don't have any original fiction romances to suggest, but if you don't mind another show I can give you two.

They are both RWBY fanfics, linkffn(11655241) Stress Relief is finished and linkffn(12146135) The Entertainer updates every week on Tuesday. The Author Coeur Al'Aran is in my opinion the best RWBY author and maybe my favorite fanfiction author in general. They actual understand the traditional beats of a story, and it shows, especially in the romances.

  Yang knew better than to look for love in a bar. She was neither foolish nor naive. But when a chance encounter leads to a meeting with a mysterious dancer that has her heart racing, it can be hard to resist. For Jaune, the life he wanted was that of a hero, but such a life required training and the money to pay for it. What is a man to do, but make use of the few talents he has.

  In a world where your allies can be just as dangerous as your enemies, sometimes it can be difficult for a criminal mastermind to find a little stress relief. That blonde idiot, Jaune, was just unimportant enough, just malleable enough, to be a viable option. It was meant to be a one time thing, an easy lay. Emotions were never supposed to get involved.

*** Like..... as long as people like it and read it it's not unnecessary? I think super!Harry harem fics are unnecessary to ME but I respect that people read them, which makes them necessary to "fanfiction".

Also it's fanfiction. Literally diverging off canon??? Is what it is?????

Sorry your comment just really threw me off honestly. Why was this a necessary thing to say at all on this thread??? Just don't even open it if you think its not necessary?

**** No, to your first statement. The point of writing fanfiction is general enjoyment and quality. There is no purpose in it if you don't write convincing characters, at that point it's a waste of time. Super!Harry Harem fics are exceedingly rare, I see way more Dramoine or Drarry fics than Super!Harry fics in general. I won't get into the can of worms of those disgusting and hilariously outlandish pairings. Character development seems to be thrown out of the window in favour of romance in fics a lot of the time. Think about it, when have you ever read a cohesive Sirius/Hermione fic?

Fanfiction is taking something and changing the circumstances. If you're going to change the characters into something unrecognizable, why not just create a fanfiction within the Harry Potter world with Original Characters? Oh right, the people that write these fics don't have a single creative bone in their body.

I can comment whatever I want, wherever I want to.

***** Where do I even start?

"General enjoyment and quality" - I just find it hilarious that you don't think those things exist in romance fics? I've read many romance based fanfictions that were better and more enjoyable (both subjective qualities, you see) than published original works that I've spent money on, so that whole argument is null right there.

I think Dramione and Drarry are actually two amazing examples of how authors use plot lines to create character development and create convincing characters? So again, not sure your point there.

I've actually read quite a few incredible Sirius/Hermione fanfics - all of which were cohesive (and creative, well done, and enjoyable, so...)

"Taking something and changing the circumstances" is by definition divergent of canon. Changing the circumstances in a way that leads to two characters falling in love is just as valid as anything else.

I'm starting to think you might never have read a romance genred fanfiction before - or any fanfic in general...

"Don't have a single creative bone" oh my god this is hilarious. I've read literally millions of words of fanfic, almost all with romance as at least a primary genre. Some of the fics I've read were without a doubt some of the best pieces of literature I've read in a long time. Good plot lines, good character development, great writing. All of that takes amazing creativity.

I don't know why I'm even arguing - I'm pretty convinced you're a troll or in the complete wrong place.

You don't like romance. Great. Literally NO NEED to comment on someones post about fics/literature that heavily features it.

Jesus. I'm going to bed. Good luck with.....whatever it is you're doing here.

****** 1) That's good for you, but I don't think you really know what good writing is.

2) You think, but you have no examples of such things, so once again, don't see what you're trying to say.

3) Examples?

4) You're straw-manning, I said that they change the characters without changing circumstance. They don't allow for any build-up, it's all instantaneous.

Why does it matter? Are you some kind of fanfiction connoisseur? Go read some original ficition.

Then you haven't read very much literature, and once again you provide anecdotal evidence. You clearly don't understand what good plot lines, character development, or writing is, if you read fanfiction based on a story that had neither of those things in itself.

How about you get a life, if you have time to read hundreds of thousands of fanfiction as you claim? Do you even work? Maybe if you went out into the real world, you would understand why none of these fics are organic.

I can comment whatever I want, wherever I want. You saying shit doesn't mean anything. I have a first amendment.

I could care less when you're going to bed.
