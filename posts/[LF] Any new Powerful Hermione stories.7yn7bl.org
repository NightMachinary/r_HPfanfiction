AFAIK this hasn't been asked for a while so i would love some recommendations for stories featuring a Powerful Hermione..


** linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist): ...well, exactly what it says on the title. /Great/ worldbuilding, complete. May leave you wanting more, though.

linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor): Hermione is a Parselmouth and campaigns for nonhuman rights from year one. Also featuring: nice Basilisk, friendly Dumbledore, and the Dark Turban, among other assorted insanity.

  Hermione makes new friends at Hogwarts -- and one lifelong enemy -- with her newfound love for proper skin and hair care. The wizarding world will be changed forever! A silly idea turned serious, and dedicated to those who skim read the title of my fic "Hermione Granger, Demonologist" a bit too fast. Hermione POV, humour, no pairings, complete.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot.

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185][/Forever Knight/]] features Vampire!Hermione that disappears for five years and returns to help Harry end the war with Voldemort. Strong Harmony romance, no bashing. Ron in particular is awesome.

Those are the Hermione-centric ones that come to mind. I'm sure there are many more, and more that feature a powerful Hermione without her being a main character.

*** I dropped Forever Knight because I couldn't stand the way the romance between Hermione and Harry was written.

It's mostly a repeat of: “I love you, but my self-esteem is so low that you couldn't possibly be happy with me, so I'm doing anything I can to prevent us being a couple instead of talking to you about it. Also, I will completely ignore any signs that might show me you actually love me, despite there being multiple of them.”

They are somewhat immature teenagers, but I can at most take two instances of this shit happening per fic. Especially because it's always portrayed as being “so selfless” to “sacrifice yourself so your beloved one finds happiness”, while it's just a very selfish way to avoid an awkward conversation. At some point, I only kept on reading to see if there was someone telling either Harry or Hermione what idiots they're being.

*** /Lord Hermione/ is frustratingly dull so far. It strikes me as one of those fics where the author only cares about one aspect of the fic (typically, the main 'ship, the relationship between those being 'shipped, and those getting in the way of their relationship), and doesn't really pay attention to any other aspects of the fic, including how their massive divergences affect the setting. Like the parent says, so far, it's about dating.

We are tantalised by all the interesting stuff powerful!Hermione had supposedly done in the past, but it's all glossed over in favour of railroadish slice-of-life romance. And, while things might have happened differently in the past, the present is firmly on canon rails. For example, would this fic's Hermione lower herself to being a hostage in TWT? For that matter, where's Dumbledore, either mentoring his likely successor, worried about the next Tom Riddle, or both?

To be fair, the author did tag the fic as Romance and only Romance, but the summary promises so much more than that. Oh, and the Ron-bashing is not appreciated.

**** I agree, the idea has a ton of potential, and really while there are a few fic's that take the idea of no troll or Hermione not being saved by Harry/Ron and run with it I've not seen one that implies Hermione becomes an anti-social loner that becomes aggressive enough and powerful enough magically that most people are scared and/or intimidated by her, and seems set on a Grindalwald/Riddle path. But no, clearly the romance is the most important thing to author and the plot will revolve around the 'ship above all else.

Honestly, we need more fic's like ACA by Jacobk, that fic is frickin' amazing and portrays an ambitious, powerful, and troubled Hermione bloody perfectly, and best all doesn't relegate canon's only female main character ((Harry, Hermione, Ron) and who is also by far the most competent and powerful of the 3) to nothing more than one half of a 'ship.

And in the case of Dark Powerful Hermiome, I actually realized I've never seen one, other than ACA (which doesn't' count really as she's not actually Dark, only seemingly heading that way) an old abandoned fic where Hermione turns dark in 4th year, that has her do it on her own. It's always with either Draco, Snape, Tom or any of the other /handsome, misunderstood, darkly sexy Bad Guys/, and always ends up being more about the romance than anything else, and by far worst all is that Hermione just ends up being submissive and weak and does whatever the other character tells her to do. Which, you know, sort of directly contradicts the premise of a Dark Powerful Hermione to begin with.

  There was no troll in the girls bathroom in 1991. Hermione found no friends that night. Therefore the brightest witch of her age is on a perilous path. Because with magic it is so very true that knowledge is power. But is it also true that power corrupts? Will the only daughter of two dentists become the third Dark Lord that rises in Dumbledore's lifetime?
