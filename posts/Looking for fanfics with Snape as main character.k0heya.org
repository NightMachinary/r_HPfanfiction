Ok, so the reason I'm posting this instead of searching AO3 is because I want to know your personal favourites. Any ship accepted, I'm not picky. I just ask for something not too cliche. Obviously, don't bash him. If it helps, I've enjoyed " Snape, Head of Hufflepuff" by sheankelor, and time travelling fics. I like severitus too. Go wild


** linkao3(Of a Linear Circle - Part 1) One of my favourite series of all time. I adore Snape's character in this one. Main pairing slash, all types relationships in background. In case the bot doesn't work, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11284494/chapters/25241499]]

#+begin_quote
  A realistic Snape's daughter story. Severus Snape discovers he has a daughter, born of a brief affair with Bellatrix Lestrange. First, a journey to reach the frightened, emotionally damaged child, and then a full-blown mental war, as Bellatrix manages to possess the girl from her cell in Azkaban. Among other things, an in-depth exploration of Occlumency. AU, in-character Snape.

  Severus wasn't formally trained as a spy by either side. Luckily for him, someone noticed and took him in hand. Marty might be old, but that didn't mean he couldn't help the younger generation.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** Linkao3(a dealer not a Death Eater by Jaxon)

It's an AU canon divergence fic that expounds amazingly on Snape's character without being a pure character study. Instead, it's pretty high action with tons of complex plot and amazing dialogue.

I've spent like 20 minutes typing, deleting, retyping a summary---but I just can't do it justice. The writing is /so/ good, and this fic is so intricate, and so thoughtful on so many subjects (politics, social justice, family systems, domestic violence, mental health trauma, poverty / class, substance use, and more). It's dark and twisty, but it's an amazing read!

  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after.\\
  Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical.\\
  After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks.\\
  Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

  The additional tags of: abortion, corporal punishment, domestic violence, dubious consent, rape/non-con elements - do not occur between Lily/Severus.
