EDIT: Hmmm I'm stupid, so... Its not H/Hr I don't like, its Hermione herself, so please, no fics with her as MC.

Also, Harry as MC is preferable.


** Hmmm. Hmmm. I think this sort of fits. You'll be the Death of Me by dominikki is Neville/OC, the OC being the sister of Draco. It is the best romance in the fandom in my opinion and does some rather unique things.

*** Sounds interesting, definitely a different pairing from usual. Thanks.

EDIT: Ok, just googled it. Not only has a respectable amount of words, but it is a 6th year fic. Which I love, so thanks, this just got bumped to my top 1 "to-read" list.

** I found this today linkffn(9721378) and I thought it could fill some of your requests, as like Grow young with me the OC is also a Muggle. Might not perfectly fit what you want because the romance starts when they were kids, but it turns more mature and post-war half-way through the story when he finds her and their daughter (he does know about her existence) again in a crime scene

** - Maybe Days to Come linkffn(Days to Come): H/D, Harry split from Ginny but its relatively believable compared to some other fics. Harry and Daphne sort of become friends due to his social ostracization and it goes from there.
- The Quidditch World Cup linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup): H/L, Harry met Luna again after a couple of years and the two started hanging out on and off till eventually ending up together. Warning, goes to some darker places with Luna, but not something unrealistic either.

*** Yeah, but QWC is from TE7 and I've never read a single fic of his that has a good ending, in my prerrogative. I actually did read QWC halfway, when I got bored of the amount of (surprise surprise) quidditch in the fanfic. TE7 writes quidditch phenomenaly, but this time I got bored to pieces.

Days to come is lovely and I did enjoy it very much. It was thinking of that style that I asked for something like that. Or like Unspeakable Beauty. Or a more romance focused Vitam Paramus (also wayyyy too much quidditch imo, and one of the less horrible endings from TE7, just extremely lackluster compared to the rest of the fic.)

Thanks though.

**** This ending is, I think, one of his best. If you hate quidditch (and I really can't blame you) this story wouldn't work for you even if it had the best ending ever.

***** I don't hate quidditch, specially if its TE7 that is writing it about, and I love the fact that he uses Titus in a lot of his stories, which is a character that I enjoy reading. My problem is when there's more quidditch than plot or romance or character development. Which is what I felt when I read QWC. But if you say the ending is good, I'll get back on it, Harry/Luna is one of my favourite pairings after all.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.

  Hermione felt the pounding in her ears again. She would see him for the first time since the Great Hall, gaunt and stricken at the Slytherin table with his mother clutching his arm. She hadn't meant to look for him. Not in the corridors, not beneath the white sheets of the fallen, not on the way to the Chamber of Secrets with Ron, but she was a stupid girl.
