I've being looking for some good fanfiction where harry and Voldemort have children together but most fanfiction that focuses on this is very short or not complete. I would really like fanfictions that are similar to young princes by little.miss.xanda. I would prefer long fanfictions or short complete ones. I would prefer fanfictions where they have more than one child but I would be grateful for any recommendations.


** [[/r/HPSlashFic/]] would likely be able to help you a lot more than we would. HP/LV isn't too popular around here.
