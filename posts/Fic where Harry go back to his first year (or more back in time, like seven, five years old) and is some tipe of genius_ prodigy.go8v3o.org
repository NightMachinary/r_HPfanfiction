Fic where Harry go back to his first year (or more back in time, like seven, five years old) and is some tipe of genius/ prodigy?

I don't care if he is a Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Slytherin or Gryffindor (well... I like when he is in another house, is more... IDK ¬øFunny?¬øInteresting? Yeah, interesting) I just want a fic COMPLETE where Harry had to deal with that situation. The travel can be accidental or not, I don't mind. Just... No Snarry, please! I only find Snarry fics and I don't really like it! is weird for me. (I'm more fan of Severitus, but I'm capable of enjoy a Snape Bashing, or even TomxHarry) 

Oh! And points if Harry is Master of Death (I fucking love that fics, more if Harry talk with Death)

More points if Harry is not friends with Ron, the Weasleys and Hermione at all (or just not Ron, I like the twins). Or if he is just not his main friends (Golden Trio fuck you, Neville is better!)

And more more points if Harry is Gray or Dark gray or Dark. (Like ickle Harry joins to Voldy and drive Dumbles more crazy than he is, or something like that)

And more more more points if Harry tame a Basilisk, or a Phoenix (Or Both!) Or a Unicorn, etc.

And more more more more points if Harry destroy some lemon dropes. (In front of Dumbles?)

And more more more more more points if Harry is a little precious shit, a little bit barmy (maybe serial killer? Or just kill the Dursley's?)

I usually read fics where Harry is gay, but straight romance does not dislike me( I really enjoy when Harry is dating with Daphne, Susan, Luna, Fleur,etc. Not Ginny! Not Hermione! Every one got limits.) , just... After read the six book can't see a straight Harry in my mind (if you know what I'm talking about), and I blame Tom Felton and his wand fight to!

A bisexual trio is not bad... Maybe a bisexual harem too... Or not pairings at all! Because he just don't care.

Well... That's all. Just... I like the crazy things. 

Could you imagine a story with everything? Ha! That person really must be crazy (or just have a lot of imagination).

Let's see what can you throw me!

PS: Extra points: Necromancer Harry! Powerful Harry! Political Harry! Lord Oh-My-God-So-Many-Titles Harry!


** Well i'm not sure how many points i'll earn but how about Harry going back in time so he can give a diary to his 11 year old self just before his 1st year. He makes friends with Sally the Basilisk, hires mercenaries to take out the deatheaters, and doesn't end up with hermione or ginny (marries susan).

The story is called Diary of Time by joemjackson

This is the one that got me into the whole time travel thing many years ago. MoD, powerful, morally gray Harry goes back in time and teams up with Voldemort. It's /technically/ Voldemort/Harry, but they are both too busy and too stubborn for that to go anywhere, so don't let it deter you if you don't like the pairing. Harry gets sorted into Ravenclaw, has a whole new cast of friends. Screws with Dumbledore a little. (And with everyone else as well, really.) It's a really fun read.
