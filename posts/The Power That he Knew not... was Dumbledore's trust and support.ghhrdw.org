Oh the thoughts that occur to you in the middle of a shower... Either a mildly angsty, thoroughly fluffy Dumbledore-centred fic, or a darker, more psychopathic Harry. With the latter, i can even imagine Dumbledore, Grindlewald, Tommy, and Harry all being... clinically psychopathic to a greater or lesser degree, with the fic being a study in whether nurture can triumph over nature.

Either that, or political support


** I always like the fics that explore the idea of Harry mirroring Riddle in some ways and Dumbledore realizing it, along with the differences(Harry can feel love, Riddle can't) and doing his utmost so Harry doesn't go through the same things.

** so it's a Harry Potter's Plot in a TLDR: It was and always is Dumbledore's fault /s
