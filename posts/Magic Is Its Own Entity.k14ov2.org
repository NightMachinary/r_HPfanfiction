I subscribe to the idea that magic has its own degree of sentience. Particularly the magic within a wizard or witch.

Instead of it being a tool for it's wielder to use, or an extra limb or muscle they are to train and adapt to using, magic is a separate consciousness, sharing the body of it's wielder.

And magic loves its wielder unconditionally...

I like to think that accidental magic, as it's portrayed in canon, is magic reacting to the subconscious of it's wielder. It's reactions (such as apparating to the roof or setting a teacher on fire) is the expression of the magics response to its wielders desire. Sort of like how a genie may interpret a wish.

An obscurus manifests when the wielder actively hates and suppresses magic. No human has the power to push magic down forever and, like a child or pet, magic doesn't know what it's done wrong and fights to return to its user.

Accidental magic stops when, on a more subconscious level, the magic and the wielder reach an equilibrium through years of shared growth and understanding. By now their views are aligned and they work in unison, for the most part.

As it's not that magic loves its wielder unconditionally, just that it should. And that isn't always the case...

And the magic residing within a wizard or witch isn't the only magic that is alive. Objects, buildings, other creatures: the whimsy and unpredictability of magic comes from how magic itself interpets the instructions and desires of its wielders.


** Hmm... Interesting. So could magic maybe act against the wielder's wishes if those are not aligned to his/her best interest? To clarify what I mean: say the person seeks revenge against someone or something but by seeking revenge the person is also hurting themselves. Would magic weaken itself to protect its wielder? Or it wouldn't know any better either? To be even more specific, I'm thinking about if Voldemort losing to Harry was because his magic recognized that death would be a mercy compared to the way he was currently living, with his soul and life twisted the way they were. Also, that theory of magic being its own entity would explain how and why Harry's wand protects him by seemingly acting on its own. This way it's not the wand that is its own entity, or not just it, but maybe the interaction between the two types of magic.

*** Absolutely, additionally magic would act to either deliver on what its wielder subconsciously desires or purposely fail/not respond or rebel to reach a better outcome.

Also, with objects like brooms and wands having their own degree of sentience, magic is actually performed because of the wielders knowledge and how well the two magical consciousness' mesh

** It's a cool idea but it seems at odds with the rather mundane process of learning magic presented in canon.

It seems more suited to a system where magic is learned through something esoteric like vision questing, exploring the astral sea or bargaining for power with spirits of earth and sky.

Might make an interesting AU
