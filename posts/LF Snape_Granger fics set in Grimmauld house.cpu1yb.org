I'm looking for two fics. They eventually end up as SSHG.

The first, Snape is holed up at Grimmauld for some reason with the trio. He notices Hermione behaving oddly and sits her down in the library to discuss. She admits to developing feelings for him and he trys to dissuade her. The line I remember is he tells her "this isn't what you want" and she responds "I'm an expert on what I want"

The second is one where snape goes insane after killing Dumbledore. I remember a scene in Grimmauld where he sends a patronus with a message and the patronus keeps changing shapes demonstrating that he's really lost his mind.

Thanks!


** Not sure about the ones you have mentioned but if you enjoy SSHG have you reading "Chasing the sun" by Loten?

  Hermione overhears something she shouldn't concerning Professor Snape and decides that maybe the House-elves aren't the only ones in need of protection.

  Takes places during the summer after OoTP, the Golden Trio is forced to stay in hiding at Grimmauld Place. Hermione (who is of age!) begins gravitating towards Snape without knowing why, and he attempts keeping her at arms length, but will be able to remain doing so? AU

** Is the one you want set 8 years after the end of the war with Snape found to be alive and rescued by the trio who help him to recuperate at Grimmauld place?

The dialog between Snape and Granger is

[ “Unwelcome. No. Not exactly. But Granger, this is....this is not what you want.”

“Oh actually I'm a complete expert in what /I/ want.” Argued Hermione.]

​

If so then I have no idea what it is ;-D

​

OK so it is "The Ministry of Snakes" by "[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Grooot/pseuds/Grooot][Grooot]] "

Very well done with equal parts Comedy, Drama, and Romance.

The sequel "Restoration" is a bit darker and the third "Mongoose", a prequel dealing with Snapes year as headmaster is very dark, though still manages to have a number of humerus moments. Highly recommend you read them in the order published.

​

The second sounds like [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=13797][*The Price of Madness*]] by [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewuser.php?uid=2114][*PlaidPooka*]] on Ashwinder and while 50% of the story takes place at Grimmauld the scene I suspect you mean is in the first chapter set at Hermione's parents house with the following text.

[Instead, the silver light of a Patronus leapt from his wand. At first, the Patronus looked like a small dog-like creature, but at once it began to morph into something different. Its legs lengthened to those of a brace of chickens and then small bat-like wings grew from its shoulders... {etc}

“Fetch the boy,” was all the man holding her down said, before tucking his wand away and again clamping his hand over Hermione's mouth. ]

It is an older fic and not DH compliant.

While descent I personally feel that 2 other of PlaidPookas works are superior as well as DH compliant except for the fact that Snape survives Nagini.

"Idiot's Repose" and "Night of the Nargles" both also on ashwinder as well as AO3.

*** Yes! You're the absolute best! I need to start tagging my bookmarks with the weird stand out scenes that call to me. Or maybe it's time I join the lovely nutters that keep a spreadsheet of my read fics.
