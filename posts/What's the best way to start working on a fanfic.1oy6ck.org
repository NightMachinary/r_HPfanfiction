** I love this topic. Three replies so far at time of posting, three nearly totally different answers.

- Just write, don't over think it.
- Plan the ending at least.
- Plan everything a little.

Thing is, all of these work. I personally go with option number +three+ four first.

- Start by writing out the best, most knock-down, coolest thing about your idea. The scene that totally blows you away. The single moment that you love more than anything else. Maybe a high-level summary of what your idea is, but detailed with everything you just /have/ to include that makes it awesome.

Then, after writing and maybe editing that bit some, if you don't immediately like it then *STOP*. Because if /you/ don't like the result, likely no one else with similar tastes will. And the whole thing will turn into a slog just to get to the best part, the part that is now disappointing even to you. Then it will be a slog to the end of the story. You'll likely never even finish your fic at that point, adding to the pile of abandoned stories and the overall level of sadness in the universe.

So if it doesn't work out with your coolest new idea, just put it aside and work on something else for a while. Maybe do NaNoWriMo next month (see later link for details).

If, however, you impress even yourself with the result, then do one of those other ideas. Try them all, even. But do, for the love of dog, keep writing once you start. Every day if possible. See [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1oq4lq/writing_a_fanfiction/ccunurn][this thread for more ideas]], as well as [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1nvj1y/ff_writers_how_do_you_like_to_write_your_fics/][this]].

Good writing.

** I'm not a writer, but I do enjoy reading interviews with my favorite writers. One thing I've heard over and over again is that you should know the ending before you start writing. You don't have to map out every twist and turn of the plot - part of the fun of writing is that organic process of letting your story go where it wants to. You can take the scenic route - but if you don't know where you're going, it's easy to get lost.

*** On the same vein of writing organically, I think a lot of writers need to remind themselves who their characters are at their core. I don't write, but as a reader my biggest criticism is that auxiliary characters in fanfics don't seem consistent. I think a lot of writers forget who their characters are and what their motivations should be, especially their minor characters.

If you want Lucius Malfoy to help Harry out in your story then you better be able to define why he's helping Harry. And something better than a shady "he has his reasons". What is his motivation???

Fanfic writers are often great at showing WHAT their characters are doing, but terrible at showing WHY they are making those choices.

** I find myself doing outlines. Once I have a plot idea set, I'm thinking "okay, what are my characters doing? Where are they in their lives?". I do this especially for post-war fics. It gives me some ground to work on. From there, I think of fun scenarios and jot those down. I have an idea of where I want everything to go and I try to find a flow and a sense of time.

Usually I'll get ideas for random scenes, so I always make sure to jot those down. I do a lot of handwritten notes before typing anything up. It allows me to go back, look at things, and determine whether I like it or not. It also gives me some kind of basis or ground to work from/on.

If I'm in a particular rut, I'll re-read the chapter or preceding one to look at how things are. I might read a few of my favourite fanfics to get me into the mood, or listen to music for inspiration.

Usually what ends up happening is I'll have a scene set up, start writing it, and go wherever my writing takes me. Often times it produces better work than my outline.

Sometimes it's hard to get rid of a writer's block. A lot of times, what you need to do is get into the mood. So maybe try music, read some fics, heck I even play the Sims sometimes to give ideas. Jot down little ramblings or thoughts and the next thing you know, you're writing away.

It doesn't just happen all of the time, sometimes you need to create a mood. Try to set up a place where you feel comfortable and at ease and let the creativity flow. Just don't force it, because the reader can always tell when you force it. Let it come to you.

*** I *strongly* second the idea of keeping notes even while not working on your writing. Some of my best ideas happen while I'm eating or taking a walk or just reading something else. Keep paper and pen handy, maybe a small Moleskine, or use your smartphone or some other easy and portable way of taking notes at any time. And write those thoughts down immediately, not later and not after thinking too long about them.

** I have a hard time starting at beginnings, when I write. Usually I have a scene knocking around in my head, and I just start in the middle. I also find it's best to try not to edit or censor yourself as you're writing -- just get it all out, get words on the page. If you can touch-type, even better -- I will sometimes close my eyes and type stream of consciousness. If it's all crap, you can edit later. Even if you end up deleting most of what you have, you'll have taken that first step, and it will be easier to write more.

Also, try not to get too caught up in turn of phrase. I edit a whole lot when I write, so if something doesn't sound exactly right the first time around, I leave it be and keep going. You can always go back.

#+begin_quote
  Writing is a craft like learning a musical instrument and requires dedication and achievement of limited goals before one bites off something too ambitious.

  /Do not start writing a novel./
#+end_quote

I disagree completely. Unlike musical instruments, writing is something everyone is expected to do every day to some extent as adults. /Creative/ writing only requires the budding author to have basic familiarity with common styles and grammar, something they can pick up from casual reading and basic schooling. Anyone who has even a passing interest with books can create something of at least readable quality with a keyboard and word processor, even if it won't win any prizes.

We're /not/ talking about becoming a professional author, someone who writes quickly and well, or at least does so enough not to piss off too many people down the business chain. We're not even talking about becoming a /good/ writer. We're just talking about having fun writing. Your advice seems good for someone looking to get published as soon as possible, but that wasn't really the OP's situation, and it seems harsh even for an ambitious author looking to go pro. It seems to be trying too hard to avoid early failures, which will happen.

I think far too many people with expert level skills do this, trying to keep someone at the novice level from doing something poorly, in a way that reminds them of their own early embarrassments and frustrations. Looking back, they only see how they wish they'd done things, not how they actually got to where they currently are in their skill. Making a big, horrible mess of a novel right off the bat is fine, so long as you walk into it eyes wide open and realize that the idea you just tortured for 100k words isn't gone and can be done better at a later time with lessons learned.

Sure, if you publish it online your readers will suffer some. But they knew what they were getting into when they went to fanfiction.net. And if your idea is good enough, some won't even care about clunky style and pacing issues, or if you even finish the story cleanly or not.

#+begin_quote
  Instead, start with a flash fiction (<=1k words) short story or "one shot". Prove to yourself that you can take an idea for a story from concept through realization and final polish. Get a sense of how to do characterization and dialogue, of evocative description and pacing, of literary style. Get some people to read it and provide critical feedback on what worked for them and what didn't.

  Then write another one-shot, a little more ambitious, a little more out of your comfort zone...

  ...

  Only after you feel you've acquired some level of comfort with the short fiction game should you consider writing anything longer.
#+end_quote

As a professional writer, you should know that the vast majority of fiction authors consider shorter formats to be technically the most challenging, and ultra-short stories (like less than 1k words) the most difficult to do well. Sure, it is a small and measurable step, but it is also a really, really tough one to do well. And most people read novels, so are used to that style. Reading the amateur disaster they'll first put out will be discouraging. I know such an assignment would horrify me even now, two novel-length fanfics and two NaNoWriMo completions later.

Also, suggesting that all aspects, from start to final polish, be experienced and refined before writing anything fun seems very wrong to me, sucking all the joy out of something that should be spontaneous and fun. I think starting off by doing writing exercises at this level is a really bad idea for a new writer, and will both develop bad habits and lead to neurotic results if the end product isn't good enough. Which it surely won't be. And to make all that writing be on ideas that are less exciting than the one you're trying not to "ruin"? Another bad concept to get into.

Sure, put aside the best idea for a little while, but don't make a huge production of practicing creative writing. I think a much better place to start is something like next month's NaNoWriMo and their short novel (50k) in a month writing goal (see my other post in this thread for details). Then, in December, start on your awesome idea and do your best.

So whatever you do, OP, write a lot, every day if possible. Don't worry about style, just write something you'd want to read, in a format you're comfortable with. Get feedback, but realize that a lot of people will have opinions that are just plain wrong -- maybe for you, maybe period. So do what looks good to you and take all criticism (and praise) with a huge grain of salt. Including my own posts here.

***** Telling someone to not start off by trying to write a novel because it will be inevitably bad is what I considered horrible advice. Suggesting that one not attempt larger projects until smaller, peer reviewed works were up to some quality standard smacks of the worst kind of elitism.

#+begin_quote
  Too many fanfiction writers never finish anything, taking on this or that, starting a story and then abandoning it just as fast for the next shiny plot idea. I suppose I am guilty of wishing to advise the OP (or anyone else reading) on how to go about starting to write good fanfiction, as opposed to forgettable, barely edited, "three chapters and... I'm done" story starts, which is where "just write and don't think about it" advice tends to wind up.
#+end_quote

Directing someone to prove themselves first on shorter works, even if only to themselves, is an extremely reductionist learning technique. While this might in fact work best for some people, presenting that approach as an imperative, a required step to avoid the embarrassing mistakes of other fanfic authors (who should apparently be held in poor regard), is not a positive way to approach the subject of learning creative writing.

You seem most offended by poorly done fanfic being publicly presented. I think the casual audience can decide what free fiction they want to spend their time with. More skilled writers attempting to be public gatekeepers to the craft is a huge detriment to the culture, discourages less experienced writers, and should be avoided at all costs.

#+begin_quote
  [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] seems to be of the notion that one cannot have fun writing short fanfiction. This is patently untrue.
#+end_quote

Clearly this is a straw man. I am suggesting that good short fiction is harder to do than other projects, not that it is less fun. Forcing oneself to do so, however, certainly would be.

Writing short fanfic scenes based on existing material is obviously easier than creating new worlds, settings, and characters in a few words, something I was /not/ considering in my initial analysis. It is still being unnecessarily conservative and restrictive, however, to tell someone that they should constrain their writing projects to shorter works until they are skilled enough not to make a mess of things.

If a writer doesn't understand why people think their growing body of work sucks and they want to find out how to get better, then this is all good advice.

Saying you shouldn't work on that one thing that inspires you, no matter the length of the story you want to tell or your current skill level, all because you might ruin it, is poisonous to creativity and drives people away.

Were you /looking/ for a reason to feel offended? The guy offered his perspective and --- however good or bad it may be --- that's partly what this thread was intended for.

Counter him and people may support /your/ stance on the matter (as it seems to happen in this case) but what's the point of getting demonstratively offended by the whole community?

** I won't claim this is the only way, but:

- Write the bits you really enjoy in loving detail
- Write just enough connective material to make the important scenes make sense. (If you can drop a connective hunk, do it. But if your scene /starts/ with a paragraph of flashback, you've cut too much.)
- Don't worry too much about beautiful prose. Worry about clearly conveying the story. Once you have that down, you can worry about the other.
- Post in a way that gets you early and often feedback
