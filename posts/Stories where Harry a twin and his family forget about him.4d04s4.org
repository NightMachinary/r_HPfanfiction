What it says in the title! Fics where Harry is brother to a twin and tossed aside as a result. I feel like indulging in some stupid tropes right now, and this train of thought tends to produce a lot of them.

Can be any length or pairing!

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

** linkffn(Family Bonds) is my favourite of this trope. It's incomplete and the last few chapters were a bit strange, but it's very long so there is a lot of good material there!

I also liked linkffn(Harry Daniels and the Order of Shadows) which has at least one sequel too. I haven't read this one for awhile, but I remember enjoying it.

Harry will take Hogwarts and his 'family' by storm and by the time the 'light' realize their mistake it will be too late for them to fix. OOC!Dark!Powerful!Harry.
