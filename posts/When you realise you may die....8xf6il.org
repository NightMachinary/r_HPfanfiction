from the length of your fic. I got this really inspired idea from one single line in Deathly Hallows and it has turned into this beast. I'm 3 chapters in and it's already 50k words. The chapters are long, and I expect there to be many, because this one fic has to cover books 3, 4, 5, 6 and the first bit of 7. And I'm finally beginning to grasp the enormity of what I've undertaken and I'm like well okay no regrets at least i'll die having written something I hope is worthy of my sacrifice.

I'm terrified.


** Link your fic! Or is it still unpublished?

I love long chapters, but I totally understand how that can be a drain. Hope you get it all written down before the muse/inspiration leaves you again. Strike while the iron is hot and all that ;)

*** Yes, that happens to me alot, and my beta is also super busy as well, which makes me sad cause it also drags down my writing inspirations (As I like to correct whatever needs to be corrected that he points out BEFORE writing the next chapter). So I want to get at least 95% of it written BEFORE I publish.

However I can tell you what it's about. Do you remember in the beginning of book 7 when the Death Eaters are at Malfoy Manor and Voldemort is torturing Charity Burbage, the previous Muggle Studies professor? And when Voldemort is about to kill her she turns to Snape and goes, "Severus please, please, we're friends."

The scene kicked me right in the gut, heart and balls repeatedly at once. For me it was the one scene that really stuck with me, disturbed me and gave me heart ache. So I decided to write a fanfic about how they became friends. Platonic, no romance. Keeping Snape IC, and since JK didn't expand on Charity's character as much I had to do an entire character profile on her based on what little we know of her and how to fill in the blanks from there while still keeping true to what I believe would be here character.

I just really think this story needs to be told.

As proven in a recent thread my memory of DH is extremely bad, having only read it once and not intending to do so again any time soon. I'll just take your word for it ;)

  "Severus please, please, we're friends."
#+end_quote

I just looked up the scene, she actually says: "â€œSeverus ... please ... please ..." Nothing about being friends with Severus. But I don't want to torpedo your fanfic, it sounds like a good idea anyway and that's a strong scene to build it on. It truly is heartbreaking how callous the Death Eaters are about human life and a teacher who did nothing except teaching the wrong 'dogma' and wanting to do good for her students.

****** Well there you go then, thanks for clearing it up.

I need to rewatch the DH movies at some point. I've just seen them once and thought they were much better than the book.

But yeah, just write that you're going off the movie, or just start the fic with a quick recap of the scene and say it's an AU. It's all good. As you said, that scene is super chilling and a good entry point.

******* Thanks! And thanks for catching it! It's been too long since I've read DH and altought I read the other books in prep she only has one line in the 7th so I didn't really think I needed to re-read DH LOL.

I ALSO thought the DH movies were the best movies of the lot, I hated POA and OOTP though (Sorry peeps)

Heh, to be honest I'm not even sure I've seen all the movies. Maybe only snippts of PoA. It's funny because of my dislike for Ron and my utter devotion to HHr I'm always lumped in with the "movie lovers".

********* OMFG ARE WE TWINS?!!?!? Ron is my LEAST favorite character OF ALL TIME. And I get such crap from everyone because I hate him so much.

I dislike POA and OOTP for the same reason one minute you're at the beginning you blink suddenly it's over. I remember seeing POA in theaters when it came out and i was like 'thats it ok waste of money but thankfully can't say it was a waste of time' Movie wise anyway.

OOTP is my least favorite book. Ugh Umbitch.

*** I think it's our want for it to keep going and never ending, where as the Author is like 'ok im done' so exhausted from creating everything from scratch and getting to the end. I know after a particularly long fic, even one I'm proud of and enjoyed writing i'm like 'k no more writing for a while' haha

But it's so true as well. I plan on after this fic doing an AU of half way through OOTP where Umbridge goes too far (By inviting the Dursley's to hogwarts to humiliate harry after malfoy says his family hates him) and harry begins a "war" to drive umbridge out hogwarts, so it's going to be this funny, yet serious back and forth war. So once this is done that's happening.

** Yes. Yes exactly.

My own Heir of Darkness AU was inspired by that one line in HBP where Tom is telling Dumbledore that 'Snakes find me and tell me secrets' and was originally just going to be a quick little thing; now it's a multi-year saga with more words already than PS and still barely into Harry's first year. I have plots for all seven (or eight or nine?!) books and no idea if I'll survive that long. Even what I have so far needs a hard edit already, but I have no time to work forward and back at the same time. And I have so many other ideas to write too!

I feel ya. It's kinda overwhelming, realizing just what you've obligated yourself to do.
