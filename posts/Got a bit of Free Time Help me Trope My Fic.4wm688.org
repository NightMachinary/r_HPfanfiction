/Note: This is/ *not* /self promotion. I'm asking for help from a community of people who share the same interests as I do. That being said, the fic I am linking to/ *is* /my own fic and I know some will see it as self promotion. If you're one of those people who does, feel free to click right off with my apologies./

Now that that's over and done, I need some help.

I'm redoing the summary of my story, and I am really bad at it, which is why I need some assistance in finding out which tropes my fic belongs to, so that readers know from the summary what they should expect from the story. (Right now the summary is just a mess)

So if you've got some free time, and don't mind reading an amateur's first attempt at a story, here's what I need. I need you to read the story, and tell me which tropes you think it has.

P.S. By tropes I mean a significant or recurrent theme that you've seen in the fandom, like SuperHarry! or RavenclawHarry! or TimeTravel!

** This is a great fic and self-promotion is not considered a bad thing on this subreddit as long as you listen to the feedback and don't post the same post multiple times.

Honestly (I think I speak for the majority on this) we really like to help others out and so you don't need to seem like so guilty in this.

Also your fic is great and I am really enjoying it. The whole house elf thing is one of the most original ideas I have seen in some time.

Here's my attempt at a summary for you (no offense but your summary is really bad, like absolutely atrocious but mine might be just as bad): With the powers of the Gamer, Harry sets out to right the wrongs of the Wizarding World with tons of sarcasm while trying to stay alive in a world where many wish him dead and uncovering arcane magics forgotten by most. RavenclawHarry! SuperHarry!

** I read your story a while ago, and only re-read the prologue. If your story goes in a different direction later, then keep that in mind. Generally, I would argue /against/ tags like that, because they tend to mark stories which are terrible and cliche filled. Have you ever read a story tagged "Dumbledore!Bashing" which was a excellently written character study? But some readers do like them, and I'll admit I have read stories just because of their tags in the past. So while I've tried to write this without tags, you might still want to add them later. I would still recommend you attempt to get across the storyline without it first.

Next, do you want to stand out (and risk loosing readers), or do you want to play it safe (and risk being lost)? While you have a great little story, it isn't an original idea at all. If you want to stand out, a more abstract summary is in order. If you play it safe, doing what everyone else has is fine.

Play it safe:

#+begin_quote
  Harry's life has always felt a bit like a game, with evil relatives and cupboard bedroom. So when he wakes to hovering blue boxes and game mechanics, it isn't really that much of a surprise. Now, he just has to be smart about this. Logical. Take this as the gift it is... and find every loophole possible. After all, what's a game without a little cheating?
#+end_quote

Something a little more out there:

#+begin_quote
  Harry's always liked blue. Blue is the sky he can't see in his cupboard. Blue is the ocean he has only read about. Blue is the alert he has leveled up. Blue is freedom. Blue is life.
#+end_quote

Both, without a single tag, get across that your story is a gamer story, with Harry as the MC. The first hints he might be smarter (or at least more cunning) then canon Harry. The second is a little more mysterious, but may not fit with your more humorous plots.

My attempt at humor:

#+begin_quote
  Harry wonders if anything is ever real, or if it is all just an illusion from too much time spent in all too perfect suburbia. He may only be 8 years old, but even he can see it's all rendered a bit too sharply. 'Ping! WIS+2'. Awesome! Totally worth the existential crisis.

** I'll give it a read now, I like game fics. To be clear all you want is help identifying what the fic is about for a more concise summary?
