Say someone from The Magical Law Enforcement Patrol is addressing their superior officer, team leader, whatever. Or an Auror addressing the Head Auror. What would they call them? Boss, chief, sir/ma'am, head, guv? How would they refer to them when speaking to another person? For argument's sake, let's say they're not very familiar, so nothing too informal.


** "Boss" and "chief" both sound too American (unless we're talking M.A.C.U.S.A Aurors), "guv" is too colloquial. I'd say sir/ma'am is best if you don't want to use a rank. But really, what would seem most natural to me in at least /some/ cases would be "Head Auror" (or whatever rank you go with).

*** From an English person with police relatives who are polite enough to pretend they don't notice my blatant eavesdropping, this is correct. Though, Ma'am would be pronounced like Harm instead of Lamb or Jam. Same with Judges, actually, if anyone reading this is planning to write a courtroom scene.

** In fanon, the DMLE is usually headed by a "Director," making DMLE both the department and the person. They'd probably be addressed as, "Director."

Sub-department heads would probably just be referred to as Sir unless there is a rank attached to their position, perhaps the head of the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol is Chief Constable Bob, MLEP but Arthur Weasley, as Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts office is just Sir or Mr. Weasley.

The Head Auror would probably be referred to as "Head Auror" but addressed as Sir by his subordinates, unless he gets a rank, too.
