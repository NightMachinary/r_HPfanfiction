** Harry and co. entered the room. It looked like a war meeting. Each corner was for each house. To their right we're the Hufflepuffs. To their left the Slytherins. To the left of the Slytherins were the Ravenclaws. And in the middle was a tiny desk with four chairs at each side. There sat Malfoy, Cedric and a Ravenclaw named Kate representing their respective houses. Ron pushed him to the middle table while the rest of the Gryffindors took over the last corner between the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. Once he sat down, Cedric folded his arms in front of his face and said: „Let's plot the murder of Umbridge.“

*** Umbitch comes into the room, and with her sickly sweet voice says 'Children, i believe that in order for you to stay out of trouble, an auror is required at service.'

Tonks steps in.

**** Aurors start questioning the students:

"Do you know what happened?"

"I don't know, she just up and died"

"Any suspicions on who it could be?"

"Nope"

"How did she die?"

"She definetly didn't drink an intraceable poison that disappears once she's dead in her evening tea."

The Auror looks at the student very intensely.

"Okay", all smiley faces
