** If you are okay with Fem!Harry and like H/Hr, I'd recommend */[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11197701/1/][Yule Ball Panic]]/* and its sequels. I find the relationship between Fem!Harry and Hermione in it adorable.

*/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13285012/1/][A Fair Life]]/* one of my favorite ongoing stories.

Fem!Harry as Batgirl to Adam West's Batman. */[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11806414/1/][Amy Potter is Batgirl]]/*

  Amy "don't call me Amaryllis" Potter never went to Hogwarts, but the Goblet of Fire makes her a compelled competitor in the Triwizard Tournament. Will three years of tutelage by the Dynamic Duo see her through the treacherous tasks? Will being Batgirl help her beat the villainous Voldemort? And what's with that bewitching yet bothersome, bushy-haired bookworm? Tune in to find out!

** Dignity in Fear has a superb depiction of emotions, but becomes an utter shitshow after chapter 23 (end of the 5th year) because the author turns it into an essay for LGTB solidarity and, in private messages, admitted that she does not care about Harry because he is straight. Which means that Hermione ignores her best friend entirely BUT puts up with a lot of shit from Lupin, but he is allowed to do that because he is gay and queer people stick together.

Honestly, if you pretend that chapters 24 and onwards don't exist, it's a really good, well written fic which focuses on the characters.

The fic is Hermione/Tonks
