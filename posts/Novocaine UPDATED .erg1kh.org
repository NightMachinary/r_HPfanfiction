Like so many here, I was lamenting on the apparent abandonment of the fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022013/1/Novocaine][Novocaine]] linkffn(13022013) and today is a great day as a new chapter was published! So... not abandoned.

So here I am for those who didn't know this fic or had lost hope and weren't following it anymore. In fact I'm surprised to be the first to post about it.


** Does something actually happen finally? I'll try not to sound like a hater, but I only got to chapter 9 or 10. I've seen this fic recommended several times here and decided to try it out. And I just don't see what's so great about it. It's well written and doesn't have too long paragraphs or spelling and grammar mistakes. But that's pretty much it. Harry wakes up, has some business meetings where everyone agrees with him and everything goes his way, hires some people and then explores the gazillion castles and mansions he apparently now owns with Daphne. Rinse and repeat. The most interesting part was the row between Ginny and Daphne, but even that got nowhere. No shouting, no hair pulling, no slapping. Hell, not even a hex was thrown around.

So my point is- does something interesting happen, or is it just endless business meetings? I really tried to love this fic because it's so popular around here, but I couldn't.

*** I think it depends on your taste or mood. I enjoy action or comedy driven fics most of the time. However sometimes I crave a slow pace romance that has a good story so that it is not the main thing. I think it did a fantastic job in avoiding the whole Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin shenanigans that other fics tend to have. Instead we have Harry, who just came from war, trying to build something for himself in a very realistic way. Trying to do the right thing in a bigger way. Yes, everything is going his way and it seems to slowly become a 'utopia' fic but I still find it an enjoyable read if you are interested in the interactions of the characters and their developments from war torn teens to youmg adults.

**** I also enjoy action and comedy. Sometimes even mystery or drama. And it's admirable that Harry is trying to rebuild a war-torn country. I just think it needs a bit more conflict. For example, some politicians can try to screw him over. Or a foreign businessman can start buying out shops or goods too cheaply. Or the goblins get pissy about the brake-in during the war. Or for a bit more action- Voldemort had a secret hideout full of cursed objects and books on Dark magic (or even weapons), but it gets looted so Harry has to track it down.

***** Yeah this is not that type of fanfic. If I remember correctly, there are some politicians that try to screw him over. Other than that I can't remember any sort of conflict. As I said this fic looks like to be a 'utopian' fic where everything goes right for the characters. I think what makes it so good is that it sort of realistic. I mean he is a famous figure and a fear one so not many people would dare to enter a conflict with him. He is Harry Potter someone that tries to do the right thing all the time.

*** tl;dr: Nothing happens. Just business meetings.

I came to the same realization that you did, at around chapter 9.

It is definitely the Tolkein approach to a Harry Potter epilogue. Only, instead of the tension of the plan to deliver The One ring to Mordor, it's just... let's find out what Harry ends up doing.

I like the world is built, but it is the same world we're familiar with from canon. The characters come back, but they have some trauma to worry about. Magic isn't really part of their daily lives--besides apparating and conjuring furniture.

I just don't know where it's heading. There has been no evil foreshadowing, and only a couple of extremely light dust-ups. At this point, I'm afraid it can only be an "and they lived happily ever after" fic or a horrifying tragedy where Harry loses everything he spent 2 months building.

*** You know, I read the word hex and, for some reason, the two halves of my brain shit the bed for a second.

The conversation after it rebooted kinda went like this:

Right: hex?

Left: yeah, it's a type of magic spell.

Right: hmm...really?

Left: yes. Why, what did you think it meant?

Right: I thought it was a portmanteau of Hate and sEX.

Left:...are...are you really fucking serious right now?

*** So absolutely little happened in this update that, as someone who favorited it a long time ago and didn't attempt to update myself when the new chapter dropped, I could remember absolutely nothing about the fic.

There seemed to be nothing to call back to the previous chapters, it didn't feel like the characters were doing anything in particular or any mentions of any long or short term goals.

I think it's mentioned somewhere that an orphanage had been built and apparently Harry and Ron were fighting but had kind of made up in this chapter.

That's it.

I'm sure it's a fine chapter when reading in succession, but after such a huge wait between chapters, it's a bit of a let down.

I mean that's a lot.

I like it partially because t's so unlike most other fics. Same reason I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]'s fics. (And wish we had more in the James/Annie romance)

I think it's a bit interesting to see the mundane part of the HP world.

** Damn. I thought this story had been delivered back into the hell that spawned it.

It's dreadful from start to finish. The identikit characters roll robotically from one non-problem to the next, solving everything with Harry's vast pile of cash. None of them are likeable but neither are they dislikeable because they're all basically the same and anything remotely objectionable is telegraphed well in advance so you're ready for it.

The dialogue is shocking except at its worst when it becomes downright laughable. "This was my father's business," said Daphne. "Unfortunately, he was murdered by Death Eaters two months ago." is a particularly large turd from the first chapter.

The only good thing you can say about Novocaine is that there are minimal spelling and grammar issues, but that doesn't come close to making up for the lack of anything remotely interesting.

I read this a while back because someone on here recommended it, and they promised it got better after I queried its awfulness a few chapters in. To save others the time: it doesn't get better.

TL;DR This is a genuinely awful story. Don't bother with it.
