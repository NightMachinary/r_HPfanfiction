Due to a badly organised portkey shelve or defective enchanted quill, Sirius Black is not transported to Azkaban, but ends up in Azerbaijan instead.

By the time the error is noticed, he has already established himself in the Azerbaijani magical government/society.

He returns to Britain after seeing Pettigrew in the Daily Prophet, coming as a foreign dignitary.

Keeping in mind that this is 1981, what you're suggesting is that Sirius Black went from being a prisoner to becoming a member of the Party and gaining a position in a Soviet state, then somehow stayed in the government through the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Of course, you could always take some artistic liberties with the magical world, and decide that communism and the soviet powerblock is still going strong in the magical side to this day. After all, with all the options magic gives you, true communism could actually WORK. Especially taking into consideration the significantly lower population of the magical world.

How would he maintain diplomatic immunity if he were effectively an exile from his adopted country?

The way around this is to maintain that even though the government fell, the Azerbaijan Ministry of National Security (which had jurisdiction over the magical population) continued with many of the same personnel as the previous KGB detachment in Azerbaijan, which just so happened to include one Sirius Black, formerly of the UK.

This is basically the truth. When the Soviet Union fell, the KGB changed its name (in Azerbaijan) to the MNS. Over time, the foreigners left or were replaced by domestic personnel.

***** Class systems are inherent in our nature, so it's pretty hard to get rid of them. Communism has so far only "worked" in states with a dictatorship. It's difficult to convince a labor force to hand over their work to the government without threatening them with violence. Stalin and Mao killed millions of their own people, Castro let millions suffer in poverty while being wealthy himself. Communism is predicated on a level of altruism that isn't inherent in the human species, and the extreme nature of the system isn't effective. Something like the Swedish system is a pretty good balance of democratic, socialist, and free market capitalist, and its citizens are pretty well off for it. Not saying that works everywhere, or that communism couldn't work in a magical society, but history's example of communist implementation have not been kind.

****** I wouldn't say inherent, but let's address the rest of your argument. While the past implantations of communism have been headed by dictators that co-opted the ideals, the actual concept doesn't have anything to do with it. Communism, or at least Marxism, is more focused on putting the means of production in the hands of the workers, so that they can't be exploited by the greedy upper class, and doesn't really have much to do with the leadership or government of the country.

There can be democratic communist states, just as easily as there are capitalist dictatorships. Communism doesn't require a dictatorship, it's just that decades of American propoganda made it seem that way.

Besides, the whole "class is part of human nature" stuff is the result is unsupported pseudoscience. We evolved to form packs and support each other, not to subjugate each other.

******* As far as hierarchies goes, would you disagree that there are different levels of competence in people? Different levels of intelligence, skill, experience, inheritance, social stature, agreeableness, competitiveness, physical and mental ability.... the moment you involve multiple people in a system designed to find a solution, someone is inevitably going to hold the responsibility of handling it, which is the creation of a class structure, and if the system is merit-based, some people just naturally rise to the top for various reasons. Work places have managers for a reason. No one accomplishes anything of substance alone, but Might is a very simple way to get others to fall in line, probably the simplest, so whoever is the Mightiest gets to set the rules.

Yeah, I'm not denying your take on Marxism, but the implementation of the "ideal" communist system lends itself to be easily co-opted by dictatorial powers. Labor gets handed "to the people" but what does that really mean, in a practical sense? It gets turned over to the government, and the government decides what to do with it, and if that government is any way corrupt (which it almost always is in some capacity, though more so when it comes to revolutions), the labor and profits just go back to benefiting the few rather than the whole. In a world with strong AI or nearly-infinite energy, like a Dyson-sphere, it could work, but at the moment there are too many disparate elements vying for power, wealth, influence, etc. for a communal system to work in its ideal form. The moment you involve more than one person in any effort, it becomes hierarchical, it naturally breeds classes, because not all people are equal. Not everyone is equally as smart, equally as efficient, etc.

Criticism of current hierarchy is beneficial, criticism of hierarchy in general is an exercise in willful blindness.

The problem with implementation is that you are always going from one system to the next. There's a reason why "Communist" and "Revolution" are two words almost always married -- the government never wants to give up power, and in the case of capitalists, the land owners don't want to give up their land. The new government can only do so if they have guns, and since you have to threaten violence to transition to an eventual, possible, "ideal" -- no one wants to give up their stuff even if the ideal is an overall benefit to society -- it just ends up being the guy who commands the army (a dictator) until that dictator decides he doesn't want to be in power, which, historically, almost never happens. In theory, a "benevolent dictator" could offer this transition somehow, but the moment he gives up the army and its guns is the moment he becomes a victim. See [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs][the Rules for Rulers.]]

People are motivated for a lot of different reasons. Do you think those motivated by altruism are somehow going to stand ahead of those motivated by hate, greed, and self-preservation? That is an underlying flaw of a Communist revolution. It's ideals are based in altruism but can only come about by giving power to the hateful, greedy, and skilled preservationists, and thus nothing altruistic gets accomplished. The only way to make such a system work is if all involved are doing so for the right reasons, which won't happen without a fundamental change in either the way people work or the way economies work.

Capitalism does a fairly good job of getting people out of poverty, it just needs to be heavily regulated or else you end up with a handful of corporations owning everything, and the economy cycling through booms and busts ~every 20-years or so. Corporations also have zero incentive to actually help anyone other than themselves, and only really function well in a society if they have a lot of competition. When there is a healthy amount of competition, a high skilled labor force, and low unemployment, they end up being pretty good for society. Competition is good, as it necessitates that the most competent people end up being the "winners" that further progress us as a whole. There's a whole lot with Game Theory and the like that further explores this.

******* The problem with your argument is that you assume that the upper class are somehow different than the lower class. Like when a person attains money they lose their morals, and if they don't have money they must have higher morals.

In actuality we, as humans, are all greedy immoral beings. That is the reason communism fails spectacularly. It assumes everyone is going to accept their meager lot and work as a nationalist cooperative because it improves everyone as a whole a tiny bit at a time. In real life, every person instead works to steal from his neighbor because the neighbors stuff is now his because communism says so. Stealing from others improves their meager life greatly in an instant instead of a tiny bit at a time.

When this theft goes on a national scale the country starts devouring itself until, as in every communist state I have heard about, poeple die of starvation. The stolen farms stop making food when run by incompetent thieves.

******** I get the feeling you don't know what communism is. Where are you getting all this "stealing" stuff from? In communism, the workers own the means of production rather than the companies, making sure they get the value of their labor, whereas under capitalism, they only get a small portion of it.

Just look at Amazon's warehouse workers. Each worker makes, let's say about $400 of value for the company in a day, given how crazy overworked they are. They get paid about $13 a day, and work between 8 and 12 hours a day. That would mean they make $130 for that day of labor, while the other $270 PER WORKER goes up the ladder. Some of it goes to managers, executives, etc, but the vast majority of it goes right into the pocket of Jeff Bezos, who uses it to buy another yacht or whatever, all while his workers are starving. Capitalism sees this as a preferable outcome. After all, Amazon's stocks are going up, so clearly everything is perfect!

And no, I'm not saying that getting a lot of money makes you evil. What I'm saying is that, in our current society, the only way to get that kind of obscene amount of money is through evil acts. Jeff Bezos is only as wealthy as he is because he exploits his workers and oil tycoons maintain their power through lobbying against renewable energy.

Honestly, I think you may have a decent point to make, but it's buried under so much propoganda and assumptions, I can't adequately respond to it. Please, do your research from something that isn't the black book of communism next time.

********* I understand what you are saying about organizations taking advantage of their workers. This is definitely a problem with our current system.

Communism implies even with just its name Communal-ism that citizens inherently have a stake in every organization, property, etc in their nation. In fact the system is not even comparable with the western ideaology of personal property.

Sine an individual has a stake in every entity and is not satisfied with their current station they are naturally inclined to increase their station. In a communist country that can only be accomplished by taking parts of others allotted station, hence theft.

I've been trying to plot out a series where a Hermione who gets sorted into Slytherin takes a different approach to her civil rights activism and wages an international civil war to bring down the Statute of Secrecy so wizards can cure cancer and solve world hunger (and also take over all the muggle governments).

****** Yeah, I was thinking more about whether there could be a magical Soviet Union in the first place. As for Azerbaijan, it's been conquered by everyone under the sun and I'm pretty sure it only started calling itself Azerbaijan when it (very briefly) became a republic in 1918, so magical Azerbaijan may or may not exist depending on how they went about founding separate wizarding governments in the 18th century. If it happened according to the muggle borders at the time, then it's probably still a part of Iran, but if if happened according to cultural or linguistic lines, it might be a part of Turkey or its own country named Shirvan.

Or maybe there's a wizarding pan-Turkic state that stretches from Siberia to the Mediterranean sea, or they've had wars on the mainland since the institution of the Statute of Secrecy and Azerbaijan is now disputed territory between Bulgaria and Armenia, or any number of other things might have happened. We only have confirmation of the existence of so many wizarding countries.

He knew exactly where to look for Harry even after spending 12 years in Azkaban. When Harry inflates Marge and runs away, he sees Sirius in Privet Drive in his animagus form.

He visits Harry mere weeks after he escapes from Azkaban, just to get a look at him. He can't do much at the time, since he's on the run from the law, but he clearly sees something very wrong with what he sees, and offers Harry a home with him at the end of Book 3.

If he were to actually see Harry mistreated as a child, he'd probably cut loose and do the thing he was accused of, and destroy Surrey in his rage.

Sirius would have known the Evans family fairly well - he was best man at their daughter's wedding, and there would definitely have been a celebration or party of some kind at the Evans house.

Logically speaking, since James has no siblings or first cousins, Petunia is next of kin, before Sirius and Andromeda, so it makes sense that Harry would go there.
