So I was reading a story and this idea popped into my head.... what if by defeating Voldemort, Harry is taken to be the next great dark or grey lord by followers of Voldemort.

For example... Voldemort is vanquished, and so Bellatrix decides Harry is more powerful and worthy of following and so she steals him away and raises him. Perhaps guiding him to be the next dark lord, or perhaps when hes old enough, bedding him and turning him into what she wished Voldemort was to her. Perhaps having another dark (Malfoy?) or Grey (Greengrass?) family raise him instead.

Are there any stories like this already out there? It seems like there are plenty dark!harry ones, or ones where he ends up in a relationship with Bellatrix, or at least has a connection to her. But are there any where he, by defeating Voldemort as a baby, is looked upon as their eventual leader.

Now there are some issues with this idea. For example the Death Eaters who are following Voldemort because of his Pureblood philosophies would likely be less inclined. But there are plenty of Death Eaters who are more interested in "power" or other such things who might fit the mold of folks who would switch loyalties.

Thoughts?

believe this is the closest to your request.

*** However, caution is advised. This one is super weird. It fits because... well... its Bellatrix, but you may find it very uncomfortable to the point of being unreadable.

***** Thats the thing about it. Its not bad. Its quite readable in the sense of how its written. There are just some scenes that may provoke [[https://media.giphy.com/media/NJkIw5wfnM3e0/giphy.gif][certain reactions]] and may be too much for some folk.

  [HIATUS!]Deliciously Dark. Evil too. Bellatrix finds baby Harry left with the muggles & discovers his unusual accidental magical trait, one that she finds... Very Appealing. She decides to keep and groom him to be their next Dark Lord, and enlists the aid of Narcissa. Harry/Bellatrix, quasi-harem for a reason but H/B/N overall. M for a reason. THESE CHARACTERS ARE EVIL

** This is a (very) minor plot in linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) and its sequels. Lucius Malfoy initially believes that Harry might be the next dark lord, although he is quickly disabused of this notion. It has some interesting consequences, namely that [[/spoiler][Lucius encourages Draco to ingratiate himself with Harry, which ends up with Draco being sorted into Gryffindor.]]

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

*** Well someones got a stick up their butt. Perhaps... just perhaps... instead of acting like an idiot.. maybe explain why you think it stupid instead of just saying so.

Also, how is it stupid to think that a group of fanatics, following a leader in an almost cult-like way, many obsessed with power, might think that someone who defeated their dark lord, and is the only known survivor of a killing curse could be the next person to follow. Even if not all of them, all it would take is 1. Bellatrix for example.

In addition, yes there is such a thing as a grey lord. Grey!Harry is quite common actually. In fact, it kinda astounds me you are not aware of it and furthers the idea that you came into this without a clue.

***** Fanatics are inherently illogical in their beliefs, so arguing with a simple cause and effect in mind is probably not sufficient. Plus, we know very little of Bellatrix Lestrange other than her sadism, bigotry and fanaticism. Any half capable writer could insert reasons into her character, explaining why she would care for the baby that has bested her master. You can't make her act OOC, if the details you alter aren't part of her canon C. It would be OOC if she suddenly started having a neutral stand to muggleborns and would do her best to squelch her sadism.

#+begin_quote
  I mean sure yeah if you put in some retarded shit like magical cores and wandless magic and all that kind of bullshit sure and make everybody act ooc then you have a shitty story.
#+end_quote

What has that to do with anything? When were magical cores and wandless magic ever part of this discussion?

Grey! is a known fanon concept. Using it in a request tells a somewhat experienced fanfiction reader what he'd like Harry to act like in the story. You may not be able to put people in boxes, but you can definitely put /characters/ in those. Characters are not people.

*** Yes.. the gray lord thing is a thing.. usually it tends to be a moderate view as compared to Dumbledore's "even mass murdering psycho rapists only deserve a slap on the wrist" and the pureblood "murder all muggles and muggleborn, and any who stand in our way".
