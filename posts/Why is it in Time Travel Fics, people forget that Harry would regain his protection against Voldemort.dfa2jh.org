This is honestly something of a annoyance whenever I read HP time travel fics, I mean Harry never lost the protection Lily gave him when she sacrificed herself. Voldemort just used a loophole to get around it (which ironically helped Harry survive).

But in time travel fics it should be considered an important tool in Harry's battles against the younger Tom Riddle as the younger Dark Lord wouldn't have the knowledge of it's existence nor have a body made from Harry's blood to circumvent the protection.

I imagine that it would actually be a source of fear for a younger Tom Riddle to have to battle against an enemy who is immune to his abilities, survives Killing Curses cast against him, and is powerful enough to challenge him. Plus, the fact that he doesn't know how Harry does it adds another level of fear that would no doubt have him searching everywhere to try and find the answer of how to defeat his enemy and not being able to find one that matches up. He could even find out about the sacrificial protection but never encountered anyone who fit the criteria to cast it.

There is also ego to consider, he would likely find out that Harry doesn't have this immunity against others and is specific to him. But it would paint him as weak that he couldn't take him out on his own. So he'd likely be put between a rock and a hard place. He wants to kill Harry himself but is unable to, and he can't have someone else do it because that would be considered a sign of weakness he can't afford.

What do you all think?


** Would he be immune though? After all, this Voldemort hadn't actually acted against lily and Harry yet. I always thought the magic was pretty specific in that it retaliates against Voldemort because he was the target of the curse. This Voldemort didn't do anything so no protection maybe?

*** The magic is connected to Harry's blood, and it's specifically protects Harry against Tom Riddle/Voldemort. It thus concludes that even though this Voldemort hasn't done it yet the magic still protects him since it's attached to Harry's blood and Lily's sacrifice. Nothing can undo Lily's sacrifice since Harry carries it within his very blood, so as long as Harry lives he will be protected from Lord Voldemort/Tom Riddle.

In addition, despite not acting against them yet in this timeline, the Voldemort/Tom Riddle of this time is still the same individual (just younger) that the magic is meant to protect him from.

**** I think it's at least debatable - the specifics of the protective magic is never really stated, nor its limits. For instance, it could be that after the events of the graveyard that it broke the spell entirely, and thus that it no longer works afterwards - even with going back in time. In the same vein, if the writer keeps horcruxes and Harry deals with the one he already has, perhaps that purges the magic protection. Or the magic recognizes 'Voldemort' as the being who killed Lily and moving forward from then - and not reaching back in time.

It's just not a well defined enough system to categorically state an interpretation as true - it's unfortunate for that that we don't see Diary!Tom actually touch or attack Harry personally, as that would provide some proof either way. Although I would say that (canonically speaking) yours is likely the correct one, it's also perhaps a more boring one. That protection, narratively speaking, is necessary when you're putting a weak Harry up against a powerful Voldemort - but if Harry is now strong and on par, that protection might just be too easy, and the authors might not want to include Voldemort researching/putting in place a ritual to end it somehow.

***** It is specially, mention in Book 7 that the protection is still active it's just Voldemort found a way around it. The protection was part of the reason Harry survived Tom's second Killing Curse as Tom's body carried a part of Harry's blood within him thus the magic anchored Harry to life. So it wasn't broken at all, just worked around.

****** Well, it works in a different way (tethering him to life is different than hurting Voldemort/protecting Harry from him). You're right that it's still mentioned as active, but again it's never really fully explained mechanically. (Eg, tethering Harry to life according to book 7 - what if someone else had killed him, would it still work? Etc).

In the end it's vague enough to feel canon compliant enough for most fanfics, and having it included won't always make sense or improve a story.

**** yes, but that would make SENSE, and harry potter magic making SENSE? heh. true, fanfiction rules and stuff could have that done, but most tend to forget about it, or make harry just not use it cause then the wizarding world would be asking how he was able to make his skin basicly be acid towards voldie

***** Yes, I imagine they would be asking that lol.

Though in most plots like for example, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est]]), there are very few actual confrontations with Voldemort himself and generally their war with each other is fought through proxies or indirectly. So it is likely nobody would know about it until they actually confronted each other face-to-face.

And if they do so, it could be that it happens much like what happened in this fic where the younger Riddle meets with Harry alone when they first start directly fighting each other.

So then if in such a confrontation he discovers Harry's unusual immunity and keeps it secret to keep his followers from doubting his power and while he tries to figure out Harry's mysterious power while at the same time fighting the war by proxy and avoiding confrontations with Harry himself.

Plus, bonus points for it fitting into the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not" part of the prophecy since the Younger Voldemort wouldn't have a clue how Harry is doing these things or has the knowledge he does about Riddle.

****** there are also some time travel fics where harry goes back in time enough to either be friends with or even raise tom riddle, kinda hard to do either when you burn the one your trying to help just by touch, but yeah

** Its honestly a toss up between forgetting and just choosing not to have it.

A similar idea to make this point clear.

A lot of bashing fics are written by people who like said characters.

But many are also written by those that hate them.

Its hard to know if its like or.dislike thats the motivator

And similarly its hard to know if its a genuine decision to drop it or just plain forgetting.

** But by traveling back in time, is that the same Voldemort that the protection is targeting? What makes him Voldemort? Would Diary!Tom activate the protection? Would little 8 year old Tom Riddle who doesn't even know he has magic?
