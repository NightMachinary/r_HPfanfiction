I really enjoy Haphne, occasionally even the Ice Queen style as long as it doesn't get out of hand with the contracts and bonds etc. (To Refuse the Givens, White Nights are the best).

I was wondering if there were stories where Daphne is characterised similarly to how she is in Ice Cream - or even a straight continuation of that story - as an ice queen not out of choice, but by just being socially inept.


** Ice cream is a good one shot. I agree a similar story or continuation would be great

** Um, maybe Uncle Harry? linkffn(11185533)

My favourite Haphne is probably [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12414949/1/][Black Coffee, With Sugar]] though. Does not have an awkward Daphne, however.

*** I read one chapter of "Black coffee, with sugar" some time ago. Hated it. Her not telling him he has a daughter for 6 years? Depriving the child of a father? Absolutely nothing could ever change my view that she is a sociopathic bitch after that, no matter what imagined reason the author can come up with. I could also already see that when she finally tells him, Harry will just accept it with a smile... So, that story was an instant skip.
