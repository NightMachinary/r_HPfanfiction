** I've just started a new fanfic in which Voldemort's body was found at Harry's feet on the night his parents died leaving the entire wizarding world to believe he's dead (even dumbledore/the order etc.) its gonna play with some really interesting stories and things I've created. Including a character who is basically the only thing I've thought about for the last 6 months.

** I just updated The Mudblood of Slytherin.

Lucy, a self-insert, is trying to collect all of the horcruxes before Halloween of 81. So far it's January of 79 and she's got everything except the Cup from Gringotts.

Same thing with Daenerys Targaryen. My phone says it's supposed to be spelled Danaerys now.

  A college student is reborn as Ted Tonks's little sister. She is determined to learn all that she can in order to vanquish Voldemort before Halloween of 1981. At any cost, by any means. That intense ambition and utter ruthlessness has the Hat sort her, a known muggleborn, into Slytherin. _____________________I got tired of reading OCs and SIs and AUs that did nothing to change to the plot so here we are.

** This will be my first fully planned out book so I am very excited for it! The book I'm working on right now is a tomarry time travel fic called 'Dancing Around the Issue', it's a revamped much more thought out version of my old fic 'Going Back' which I had only written a few chapters for because I had done no planning whatsoever. I'm currently writing out Harry's life after the war 17-28(he goes back in time at 28) it's Neutral!Harry leaning towards Dark!Harry(though that could change, I still have 5 more years after the war to plan out.) It's still in very rough stages but I'm proud of it so far and I think this is going to shape up to be one of my best books yet!(finished or otherwise)

** Working on the first chapter of the Gallipoli section of my story where the British Ministry intervenes in WW1. It's a bit of a struggle because A) I'm rather new to writing so I'm not very good at it yet B) I thought I had a book on just Gallipoli but I don't (either that or I lost it) C) This fic is rather research-intensive and takes up a fair bit of time and D) this is the first point in the story where the war could spiral out of control as the other Great Powers could take notice of the British Wizards and begin conscripting their own nation's. I'm not quite sure if it is going to be during this arc (for lack of a better word) or another one, but if it is in the next few chapters I want to do it the best I can as it is very important for the future of the fic.

Just realised how rambly that was but oh well...

  Nothing in the last century came as more of a shock to British Wizards than the announcement that they would be joining their muggle counterpart in the Great War. It showed just how powerful the liberals had become as they shipped off their opponents to die in the fields France and Belgium. Though the unit would find surprising success as the shock troops known as the Devil's Own.

  Tom Riddle was a sickly child. He knew the chances of him getting adopted was slim. And the war isn't helping. When strange people came to see him, what path would he choose? He wants to be bitter at this woman, but he's currently too happy for that. He's finally out of that hell-hole! But he shouldn't be too harsh on the orphanage, they do live in wartime.Everywhere he goes disaster goes with him. Maybe he's just ridiculously unlucky, or he's creating terrible situations. Either way, all he can do is hope for the best.He keeps being chased, Don't they know that he's too tired to run? The wheelchair is a pretty clear sign in his opinion. Although the wheelchair might be the reason why he's chased.

** Just finished chapter 20 of my four year fic for my female Slytherin Harry series. At 180k so far this is the longest thing I've ever written by far. I estimate it will take a little over a month to finish writing the last six chapters, which is good because I'm ready for a break. After that I'll take a week or two to outline year five (already have the first six chapters outlined, need to reread OotP before I outline the rest) and then start writing again.

Year two is almost completely posted - I have two chapters left to post, one this upcoming Saturday and one the Saturday after that. I think I may have lost one of my regular commenters due to the subject matter of the last two chapters, but oh well. Can't please everyone I guess.

Here's the link to the first year for anyone who is interested:

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

**** This is an AU where James' last name is Snow instead of Potter.

Basically, what happened is Rachel and Harry originally started out as two different characters when I was writing this fic, but as I was drafting it I realized they were occupying the same space in the story so I merged them. I decided to keep the name Snow as an homage to a teacher who saved my life. She's passed on now, but I like to remember her in any way that I can.

Hodně jsem nad tím přemýšlel ... a myslím, že jsi šílená.“ Překlad anglického románu „Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary" od „The madness in me". Jakékoli připomínky texty (včetně oprav gramatických chyb) jsou velmi vítány.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

** I'm correcting and preparing the publication of the third chapter of "It's for the Greater Good, Ron." A story in which I try to mix adventure and the construction of the magical system with horror and madness.

It's quite AU and starts at the end of CoS. Basically Harry Potter, the son of Lilith Gaunt and James Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, who had been sent to Hogwarts by his aunt for the purpose of protecting the chamber from secrets, neglects his duties and allows the chamber to open again. When he realizes that he has screwed up, he does his best to cover up what happened, inadvertently protecting the false heir from detection and allowing many innocent students to be nearly killed (but hey, they were Mudbloods after all).

However, it all falls apart when the sister of his best friend, Ginny Weasley, is dragged into the depths of the chamber and Harry can no longer pretend that this is none of his business. He along with Ron try to rescue her, but it's all in vain. Harry murders her to protect his secrets and, after her death, he and Ron search for a way to bring her back to life.

To further complicate his already tedious life, the Hat decides to resorting him, from Gryffindor to Slytherin. His prophetic visions are more dire every day, he is getting premature gray hair and the Headmaster is suspicious of him. Quite a recipe for disaster.

Oh, and Hedwig is not an owl, she is a kind of talking spirit-eagle that follows Harry and tells him all the gossip about his companions, that too.

Anyway, sorry if my spelling is not the best. English is not my first language.

** I'm still working on my thriller gen fic that follows Charlie and his classmates from their Hogwarts days through the end of the second war. The plot and pacing have been intense af lately so, after a few admittedly dark chapters, I wrote some fluff this weekend and sent Charlie to the mountains to race brooms and take care of a dragon. I really love how it turned out.

** I am currently writing the first chapter of my book, which begins in the Chamber of Secrets, where Ginny dies and Harry is actually argued with the Gaunts and orders the basilisk to destroy the Horcrux diary. From there, it will mainly be based on the Golden Trio's struggle with a new rather grim reality. The changes have actually been in effect since the end of the second year, the Weasley family never travels to Egypt, so Sirius does not flee Azkaban, Dumbledore is removed as Hogwarts director, and most of the staff are replaced by McGonagall.

It will be a bit of an approach to Dark! Harry, because with Ginny's death, he discovers that happiness is running out and it won't save him from Voldemort, or any other dark wizard who suddenly thinks it's the perfect idea to attack the Boy Who Lived. He is particularly focused on his quest to become more than just the Dursley family's nephew or Harry Potter. Hermione and Ron change quite a bit too.

I would appreciate any advice anyone can give me regarding the plot. Do I have any serious shortcomings, or so far it may be.

** Fandom - Harry Potter

Rating - E (but just because I get pretty heavy on the sexy stuff)

Title - Hermione's Nightly Owls

Genre - Porn With Plot

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29765877/chapters/73221201]]

Summary - Hermione begins to have a series of secretive affairs ( Harry / Draco / Blaise ) while dating Ron. What happens as the men she has affairs with start to know about each other?

(I'm a bit stalled on the next few chapters so any types of comments / ideas / motivation would go a long way)

linkao3(22007563)\\
linkao3(21591595)

Both are Darker Slytherin Slash Harry stories so I completely get it if they're not everyone's cup of tea. Orphaned Serpent is more of a crack fic with the setup. Serpent's Den I feel has a more logical progression of the characters.

Both chapters laying the groundwork for some future conflict which will be pretty spicy later on. The only planning I really do is like one or two bullet points every 3 or 4 chapters, what happens in between is just the logical progression of the story I feel.

** I was infected by some sort of weird Star Wars muse and so wrote a crossover where Lily Potter meets up with a dying Shmi Skywalker on Tatooine. Nine thousand words in one sitting. It was wild, and not wholly consistent with tone. But it's the most I've written recently. (Like I seriously struggle to write 500 words in a day... I don't even know what happened. Time passed in a weird way and suddenly this thing came out).

** I´m writing at the moment at a story were Harry is not the boy who lived. His mother is a descendant of Isolt Sayre one of the founders of Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The story focuses on the magical history of Britannia and a bit on america at least in first year. In the fist year specific on Harry´s family and the theory behind magic will get slowly instructed. I´m thinking of adding mythology to it. But I am not sure about it.
