** I find her an interesting character. How can someone grow up to be so twisted. Voldemort was incapable of love which made him different from Harry. Bellatrix on the other hand was very much capable of love.

Do I like her as she is portrayed in canon? Nope

Does she fascinate me? Yep.

Would I like to know more about her? Yep

Well people aren't born evil and I always wonder, what was it that made her so twisted. Dumbledore himself said "You know, I sometimes think we sort too soon."

Hogwarts is like the perfect breeding ground for future dark lords. You are putting kids in houses and telling them how to be. You keep telling them they have those traits. You keep repeating and eventually the kids will start to believe. Keep telling the Slytherins they're evil and they'll turn out evil. It's a messed up system.

*** I agree with you. I think she's an interesting character and I'd even say she has some admirable traits. I think that, with the possible exception of Dobby, Bellatrix is the most loyal character in all the stories. I think the problem comes from people associating the word "like" with something positive. She's a horrible person, but she's one of my favorite characters in the series. This and the other thread started by the OP about Bellatrix, however, are the attention seeking antics of a child who is just trying to be contrary for the sake of it.

** Well I guess I'll bite.

1. Because she's whacko

2. Because she's whacko and has nothing else going for her.

Using Brandon Sanderson's character development [[http://www.writingexcuses.com/2014/03/30/writing-excuses-9-13-three-prong-character-development/][theory]], she isn't competent, she isn't sympathetic, and she's only mildly proactive at best. To have an interesting character you need at least one of those three traits.

She killed Sirius, and she tortured Neville's parents, yes, but even Harry didn't seem to care about her that much. He felt that Voldemort was the one responsible. (/It was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came back to Voldemort....He was the one who had torn these families apart, who had ruined all these lives.../) Being the POV character, that influenced the fandom.

tl;dr she's just boring.

**** Lack of sympathy isn't bad. You just need other things to balance it, to make a truly dynamic character. Voldemort isn't sympathetic, and neither is Umbridge. But they're both interesting characters.

It's not that any one of Bellatrix's character traits are bad, it's just that they're a bad /mix/.

But, now that I've thought about it some more, I'm having trouble coming up with more HP characters who aren't at least a little bit sympathetic. Nearly all of them are. Malfoy, Merope, Snape, Pettigrew, Karkaroff, both Crouches, they've all got some sort of sympathetic backstory.

So there's probably a selection bias. The type of people who like the HP series like sympathetic characters, and therefore they don't like Bellatrix. That just means you're the outlier. Nothing wrong with that. :)
