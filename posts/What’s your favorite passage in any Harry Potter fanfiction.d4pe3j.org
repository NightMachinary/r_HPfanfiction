#+begin_quote
  Harry punched the air in front of him. He fixated his feet on the floor with such intensity that the Earth itself stopped spinning for a moment. Harry began to roll up his sleeves and tossed his completely non-functional watch toward the crowd, perhaps injurying somebody but not caring, and then he flopped his arms around.

  And by God did he flop his arms around. It was almost like he was gonna take flight, but toward the opposite direction then turned 90 degrees to the side. He ran toward the ring ropes, jumped over Voldemort, and repeated the process. Then, as he approached Voldemort's fallen body, he stopped running and began slide.

** The ending lines of /Faith and Understanding,/ my all-time favorite one-shot, chronicling Ginny Weasley's friendship with Luna and her musings therein.

#+begin_quote
  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

** He ran and ran and ran, until he abruptly collided with someone travelling in the other direction.

The small blonde first year almost went crashing to the ground but Harry swept in and caught her in the arm that wasn't carrying the sword. He turned with her body weight and righted her with the same single movement, momentarily lifting her feet from the ground as he spun with her.

She came back to the stone floor laughing and spun gracefully on her tiptoes, then turned to face Harry. She looked up and down him with interest and Harry couldn't help but be caught by her incredible blue eyes that sparkled in the light from the torches.

"My, my," she said, a serene smile on her lips. "Mister Gryffindor, you dance divinely."

Harry looked from his red crest to the sword in his hand and smiled, then regarded the blonde girl a little closer. She was effervescent, happy and burned his eyes like the sun.

"Has anyone ever told you, you look like an angel?" asked Harry, with the acute awareness that reality was falling apart around him.

"You, every time you see me," she said. "All your life." Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/980211/][enembee]]

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change)

The scene where Harry kills Bellatrix in Diagon Alley while rescuing Tonks. The story has had a lot of criticism, not unwarranted, but subjectively the emotional build-up and pay off of that scene makes it one of my favorites.

** Difficult to say, there so many great passages, but I really liked the final duel against Bellatrix in linkffn(Lady Archimedes), Nagini's death in linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) and the Greengrass Manor heist in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief).

That's mostly action, if you want character interaction I really liked the part of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) where Snape and Sirius are forced to reconcile. And the scene where Hermione finds out about Ron being a spy in linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died).

A shout of rage immediately drew their attention to the left before they had gone more than a single step. "Get him, Coco!

A spray of blood flew from the man and his body started to fall.

  Harry had earnestly advised Hermione that the young boys serving under her were probably nervous about her being a girl with a reputation for being nice, and that she should pick something scary that would reassure them of her toughness and make them proud to be part of her army, like the Blood Commandos or something.

  Hermione had named her army the Sunshine Regiment.

  Ron grimaced. "That explains it then. Harry is pretty much the authority on traumatic."

  Godric stared at him, but before he could comment, Salazar let out a strabgled hiss and staggered back, and Godric had to catch his arm to steady him

  "Salazar!"

  Salazar didn't even seem to hear him. He stood staring at the young wizard in front of him, his face a mask of horror. Harry met his gaze, his green eyes glittering on his bloodless face. Godric glanced helplessly at Helga, but Salazar spoke then, his voice hoarse with shock.

  "What in the name of God has happened to our world?"

** Pretty long but by god do I love it!!

Harry, with a miffed little glance at him, glared at the pile of shards. Which then... did absolutely nothing. Not even twitch. Neville pressed a hand over his lips as the slightly irritated expression dissolved into completely offended. “Can't do it?”

“YOU do it!”

“I didn't break it,” Neville reminded him smugly.

“Then it looks like Mr. Potter will be returning here when he can,” Snape interrupted. “Perhaps some research on the properties of wood and transfiguration? I know how skilled you are in that area.. shouldn't take you long at all.”

Neville knew that Harry didn't care for transfigurations, or McGonagall, and grinned as Harry pouted. Tugging on his ponytail, Harry asked- “can't I just.. ask Flitwick for a charm or something?”

As Snape stared down at Harry, Neville could swear he saw amusement. That same little glint that he'd seen when Hannah had decided she liked Snape more than Lupin.

“No.”

Lupin did not like to be ignored, as it turned out. “And now what? You're just going to cater to his bad behavior? His complete disrespect towards school property and clearly defined rules? I will be having a conversation with Dumbledore about this, Snape! This is... beyond excusable!”

Yup, that glint was definitely there. More like a gleam now as Snape smirked at his fellow teacher. “I look forward to your attempt. Do let me know what Dumbledore decides is appropriate. Potter, Longbottom, follow.”

Neville grabbed Harry's sleeve and tugged just in case he'd stopped paying attention again. He wondered if, amidst the chaos and professional undermining, it had been completely forgotten that Neville had been a part of it all. So far so good... no detention or even a scolding. Cool.

Unless your best friend was a back-stabbing traitor.

“Hey, what about Nev?” as Harry jerked his thumb towards the Gryffindor. “How come I gotta look up how to transform toothpicks into a cabinet, and he gets off scot free- OW!” Ending with a yelp as said Gryffindor retaliated with a vicious pinch to the side.

“Oh yes, can't forget that little detail..” Snape snarked. “How kind of you to remind me Mr. Potter, that your friend has not yet been punished. How responsible of you.”

As Harry went back to pouting like the oversized toddler he was, Neville just sighed. “Can I be banned from broom flying?” he asked hopefully. Once Harry got his broom back, of course he'd want Neville to try it out... Nope. Not happening.

The response Neville got made it even more clear just how much Snape liked toying with Lupin, which was at least slightly more than he how much he disliked Gryffindors in general.
