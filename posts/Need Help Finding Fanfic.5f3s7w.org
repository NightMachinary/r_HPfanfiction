Couple months back I read Silver Aegis' Harry Potter&New Life because someone plagiarized his work and I have read other similar works done by authors who wrote Harry Potter&New Life (with permission), but I was wondering if it's at all possible to read the original?


** I think I have a copy. Author and title match and the attached link is dead, so I assume it's the original one you're looking for. PM me your email and I'll send it.
