It's such an odd bit of fanon. Was it somebody's original idea that took root, or another bit of post facto received wisdom?

Side issue: my headcanon insists that all fanon and post hoc canon actually derive from a series of rambling, drunken midnight presidential tweets from JKR:

“Dumbledore was gay! Grindlewald can prove everything but the Fake Media won't tell you he's still alive!”

“Babbling is a covfefe vampire! The emails prove it but she won't release them! Lock her up!”

“I have the finest investigators looking for Hermioninee Grainger's grandparents in the Congo! Where's the birth certificate? Dagworth-Grainger connection is....”

“....a hoax. Fake news!”

“Astoria Greengrass has a fatal blood curse! Sad!”


** 'canon' for a certain definition

**** that the "odd bit of fanon" you're referring to is actually from a source many consider questionable and disregard, but under the strictest interpretations would be considered canon.

I love that though xD. It's one of those things in fanon that just pop up about a character and is then almost considered as fact when writing about said oc. There's many such examples out there.
