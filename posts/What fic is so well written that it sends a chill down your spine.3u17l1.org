** linkffn(Cauterize)

Very lovely fic. I think heavily inspired by Yellow Flicker Beat in the poetic language, but it works really well.

** Chapter 14 of linkffn(8303265) does this for me.

The whole fic is a series of one shots that react to a piece of dialogue that the author thinks is messed up in some way. Chapter 2 is about sending 11 year olds into the forbidden forrest for example. Chvapter 14 is a stand out. Its set as Harry is walking to meet voldemort in the forrest so that voldemort can kill him. I think it adds to the scene without bashing canon as the other chapters do.
