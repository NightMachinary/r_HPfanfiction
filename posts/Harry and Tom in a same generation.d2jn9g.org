Is there any fanfiction where Harry and Tom are in a same generation? Maybe we get 1920s Harry, Ron, and Hermione or 1990s Tom Riddle, I don't care. I want to see the concept of 'dark lord equal' explored more when one of them doesn't have the 60ish year advantage. I don't want them to be overly OOC, so no Dark!Harry or Tom as a Malfoy substitute.

I don't mind slash, just give me anything you got.


** To be honest, these are probably all OOC, but The Glass Serpent would probably be your best shot.

*** Thank you!

I've read teaching history and it's ok but Harry is too OOC there. I still enjoyed it though, its funny.

  Tom Riddle wasn't the only "different" one at Wool's Orphanage. He wasn't the only one who could do the things he could. He wasn't the only one who could speak with snakes. He wasn't the only one who got sent to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when he turned eleven. He wasn't the only one. The other one was none other than Harry Potter. (Fem!Harry AU)

  Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, he doesn't want to die

** Does linkffn(11907443) count? Tom de-ages himself to approximately the same age, and we see snippets of other lives where they /are/ the same age. It /is/ slash, but only because they're both men in this life; due to a seemingly endless cycle of rebirth, they have grown to just not care.

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (slightly crack AU w/ some seriousness) MoD!Harry, kinda soulmates!TMRHP SLASH M/M

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, Tom/Lily and Tom/Harry, not threesome
