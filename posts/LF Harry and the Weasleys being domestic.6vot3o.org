Harry spends a lot of time at The Burrow during the books (and probably lots more after the war) and we don't get too much about how a crazy house full of wizards spend their days.

I'm looking for anything that shows the family having fun or solving everyday problems or that sort of thing, preferably with lots of family interaction.

Thanks so much!

This story doesn't have much in the way of "everyday problems," but it's basically the big Sunday dinner your family goes to after church. Lots of Weasleys and Harry and Luna.

Can this count? Mad-eye Moody is recruited to babysit the Weasley kids when they're tiny.

  The war has been won, yet the aftershocks continue. The scattered survivors are left to pick up the pieces and find ways to move on. Join the various members of the extended Weasley family as they struggle to rebuild and cope with the consequences. And of course there are still Death Eaters left to find.

  The year after the war was a confusing time for the teen warriors. They had fought against the greatest evil - what was next? Follow them as they try to find out. Cannon pairings. Thank you to Mr Orzech for the cover image!

** linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian) has a lot of Ginny and Harry being domestic with occasional cameo from other characters. The whole thing is mostly domestic life. The perspective is from their muggle neighbor but she's a very normal character (not OP or anything at all).

*** I'm going to have to put a caveat in this recommendation now. I just realized that the other stories by this author are in the same universe and that this is a prequel. Just reading the summaries have given me some spoilers for where its going and now my desire to read it just took a plummet off a hill. I thought some of the storylines were going to be coming to a head but now I guess there were going nowhere. Oh well.

The author is still a good writer, you just have to be prepared for a pure 'slice of life' story that's never going anywhere. That's not a bad thing necessarily (just not what I'm into).

** One thing worth checking out is next-generation fanfiction which tends to be slice of life stuff. I found the largest selection of next gen stuff at harrypotterfanfiction.com. They have a nice advanced search feature which allows you to pick era/genre/pairing/etc.
