** One of my pet peeves about Ilvermony is in its backstory, particularly the part about those two people working together to defeat the Dark witch. They were both using twin-core wands which increased their power tenfold or something.

Look, I can just about handle the wandlore stuff we see across the books. But this power-up when using brother wands together just smells like some Dragonball-level powerscaling.

** What irritated me was when Rowling said that the Salem Witches' Academy wasn't actually a school and then still made Ilvermorny in Massachusetts. I try not to pay attention to anything with Ilvermorny, tbh.

*** As soon as I realized the ilvermorny houses were basically copies of Hogwarts I lost interest in it.

** Go read Alexandra Quick if you haven't already, it creates a much better wizarding America than canon and it's one of the more polished fics out there, period.

It's about a young witch from a small town in Illinois who realizes early 2000s magical America is much more fucked up than it appears. The magical school - Charmbridge - is nothing like Hogwarts.

It's definitely not the easiest read, especially by fanfic standards; some people don't like the early tone of it and/or find the main character unlikable. But I've linked it below and you can also get free ebooks at Inverarity.livejournal.com

*** I liked Alexandra Quick but I think its stretches some canon world magic stuff pretty darn out there. You're right though that Alexandra Quick herself can be a hard sell. As soon I start to like her she does something bitchy. The story is written well though. She's like that on purpose. Maybe the story is heading in the direction where she realizes she's just like her dad.

**** I agree, I'm always cautious to recommend it because if one is used to reading certain kinds of protagonists she will confuse you pretty quickly.

As for the canon magic stuff, I think that's another reason its appeal is not really to hardcore fanfiction fans (although I started there and got into other fic) - it's not clearly really either canon compliant or AU, which could be a turnoff for some people who like that clear delineation in their stories. Not really a fanfic tbh.

***** I was trying to avoid spoilers because I couldn't remember how to use the spoiler tag. lol

  The part where she literally goes to the underworld and meets death felt off to me. That seemed just too far. I also didn't like how Death was rather an asshole. That seemed to be very much against the spirit of the books... It also seemed like a depressing and desolate place in general, but that could have just been the perspective of a living person skewing it.

  And personal preference, I didn't like the idea that falling into a portal to the underworld meant that you were dead. I feel like you still have to actually die... I felt that way with Sirius canon death too though. I think that's why they had Sirius was hit by the killing curse before falling into a portal in the movie. In my heart, canon Sirius just fell into another dimension or something. Maybe he's hanging out with the Stargate SGI crew.

  I guess that sequence in general just put me off the stories. I will eventually go back and read them especially if the author finishes the series.

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

** I remember that in NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series, Albus goes with the headmaster of Hogwarts on a trip around the world to visit various magical schools. It's a minor plot point but each school has its particularities and the author does a pretty good job describing them from the perspective of a visitor.

** I really liked the back story about Illvemorny and it's founder. It would make a wonderful movie or full novel. There's plenty of things people can add to the story to make it different than Hogwarts.

** The MACUSA and Ilvermorny get fleshed out quite a bit in my fic, linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)

Harry spends his Third Year there, and it explores the differences (new electives, larger population, different attitudes) in the schools, and creates a broader context for how a wizarding America would likely be extremely flawed and unpleasant - you know, like how America is in the real world ;)

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.
