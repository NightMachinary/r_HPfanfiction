After one too many "helpful goblins" fics, are there any stories where they end up wiped out for whatever reason? I don't care if it's Voldemort razing their entire nation with Fiendfyre, an OP!Harry executing them one by one for something or Muggleborn vigilantes smoking them out with flamethrowers and poison gas. I am just tired of them always being the convenient plot device and also surprisingly powerful/friendly, so hit me with something that goes in the opposite direction.

Please, no slash.

** linkffn(Abraxas): not surprising considering what happens later in the fic.

linkffn(The Firebird's Fury: Book 3 of the Firebird Trilogy): this may be the worst Goblins of any fic I can remember (seriously its screwed up as all get out).

  They had a plan, formulated from before they were even born. That plan died. From its ashes rises a Harry Potter no longer willing, or able, to let others fight his battles for him. Outgunned, outclassed, outmatched, nonetheless Harry will take up the sword to change not only Britain, but the world.

****** In the beginning, it's a generic Super!Harry sixth year fic. Harry gets superpowers, give Ginny some of them through dicking. Full-on energy approach to magic, million cliches but without bashing of the usual suspects. Dumb, but could be pretty fun to read. Then the story hits the middle and every character starts trying to prove that they can juggle the biggest amount of idiot balls in order for author's convoluted plot idea to work. That's when I dropped the fic.

****** Personally, I would say this sub in general has disdain for most fics featuring H/G, regardless of quality. Most people would discount quite a few fics, Abraxas included, on that basis alone.

So do not take the opinions of others as absolute truth. Especially on the internet.

This includes me. Think for yourself, don't let others tell you what to like or not to like.
