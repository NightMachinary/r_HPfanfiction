Looking for stories where Harry runs away from the Dursley's, he doesn't have to run away from the Wizarding World he can stay elsewhere like in a tent, a Muggle Hotel or heck even in the Wizarding World or whatever.

Never understood why canon Harry never just left the Dursley's, he could have hid somewhere while the Summer was ongoing and by the time Hogwarts started go to Hogwarts, if Dumbledore asked why Harry ran away he could have explained it to Dumbledore how awful the Dursley's were.

And I get that he had to stay at the Dursley's because of the blood protection, but it doesn't protect him from his own so called family. While running away would have been reckless it would have been more preferable then staying at the Dursley's I'm sure.

And I also know that Harry rarely if ever talked about his aunt, uncle and cousin and just said he was fine, but still running away for a while just sounds like a better option then willingly staying there, especially before Harry even found out about the blood protection

So yeah, just looking for stories where Harry runs away, it doesn't have to be that he ran away from Hogwarts just the Dursley's.

Can be as canon as possible or as AU as possible.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash

Very little to no character bashing. (Now Harry telling Dumbledore off for leaving him there would be fine or something like that since that's not character bashing, it's just pointing out a flaw of Dumbledore's).


** linkffn(Escapologist Harry) is not quite the one you're looking for but it does feature Harry escaping the Dursley again and again. It is a crack fic so not much of a plot or storyline but it's good.

  Ron runs away from the burrow at the age of nine, meets Harry, and helps him escape Privet Drive. Simple? Not when they've got half the ministry looking for them, not to mention the fact that Sirius has escaped Azkaban to look for Harry.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/438516]])

Not exactly what you're looking for, but it'sone of my favourite stories. Harry runs away, or is abandoned, by the Dursley's at about age 7 or so. He lives in the forest, and when his magic starts to show, he decides that, logically, he must be a forest elf.

It's a really fantastic story. There's a sequel, as well, which is also quite good.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

*** He may not have been sexually or physically abused; wait he was physically abused, throwing things at him is physical abuse and other things like that, but he was mentally abused.

Living in a cupboard under the stairs, who does that?

He was forced to clean and cook for the Dursley's while Dudley didn't have any chores.

He was forced to cook at a very young age, the Dursley's didn't tell Harry that he was a Wizard and punished him for accidental magic, which Petunia knew about.

He was forced to do outdoor chores and wear hand me down clothes from Dudley that were way too big, the Dursley's had two bedrooms and he could have had either one of them but they placed him under the cupboard.

**** Indeed, Harry was horribly abused! Could it have been worse (a lot worse!)? Yes (Vernon could have been a pedophile or a true masochist who got off on torturing others, but luckily he wasn't in canon!), but trying to hit someone with a frying pan, letting your other kid (who's stronger because you feed him more and better stuff probably, too) bully him, constantly threatening him, calling him freak, making him wear bad clothes etc.? Yeah, that is abuse and neglect! No way around it, sorry fandom but as much as you might want to pretend that the Dursleys are just "not nice", that's not how it works!
