So I am looking for fics where Harry falls in love with a girl and they have a normal romance, not something like a marriage contract or a "lord Potter" thing. I like pretty much every pairing except for Ginny and Hermione. Thank you very much!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me][Grow Young With Me]] is a great postwar romance with a Muggle OC.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] also has him getting together with a Muggle OC, but that fic is a dark war epic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]] is probably the best and most 'normal' Harry/Daphne fic out there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] is a very nice Harry/Bellatrix time travel. Bellatrix, not Harry, is the star of this fic.

Harry is a metamorphagus in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10516162/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Metamorph][Harry Potter and the Metamorph]], and so it's quite natural for Tonks to help him.

  lavender and ron's relationship has a knock-on effect “Lavender feels I haven't been spending enough time with her,” and then she tilts her head over to their best friends look as though they're struggling to breathe. Parvati's kissed a couple of people, she's not sure it's supposed to be quite like that, at least not at half eight in the morning. But she's not judging; she's being a good friend. Harry laughs. Parvati gets a sharp kick to the shin at that. Lavender's always been good at multi-tasking. “I hope you feel ashamed.”

  “Don't.”Maybe he shouldn't take another step. Maybe he should walk out of this house and leave Simon alone but he couldn't. How could he? Simon was his everything.“Jace, please.”But in the next second Jace was holding his boyfriend in his strong arms, ignoring his words. And then Simon hid his face against Jace's shoulder and started to cry. They were hugging as tight as it was possible.
