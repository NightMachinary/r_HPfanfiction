Hi,

I am looking for fanfiction that are coherent with canon but which can be under an extend universe categories. Like the extended univers for Star Wars

Their is so much potentiel...I think the movie Fantastics Beast are in that spirit.

Good exemple are Alexandra Quick or Albus Potter and the global revelation.

Thanks


** try that again see if the links will work now...

My series of Tamblin stories I think suits your requirements.

linkffn(Tamblin Demosthene and the Artiste's Alcove) linkffn(Tamblin Demosthene and the Harlequin Accord) linkffn(Tamblin Demosthene and the Unwanted Remembrance) linkffn(Tamblin Demosthene and the Narrow Ground) (that last one is not all posted yet, but is all written, should be posted soon, I also have a 5th book to post after this one is all up)

They revolve around other characters in Harry's year and introduce a number of new elements as they go along while being careful not to violate the book canon.

  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

  The third Tamblin story. Family issues. A descent into madness. A shocking crime. I wrote this story with a different style from the Harry Potter formula as an experiment. It begins in medias res, covers about half the school year, and is told through flashbacks.

  Tamblin, Cascata, Hannah, and Susan are in their fourth year. The tri-wizard cup, a menacing new Dark Arts teacher, exploring more of the secrets of the Artiste's Alcove. Romance and Unforgivable Curses are in the air.

** I am wondering why the fanfiction are always set around Poudlard. It seems to me that this universE as so much to offer. Their is not much stories that are not using the Harry Potter stuff rather then the background.

I read fanfiction that are completely disconnected from the originals book, but often it's don't follow the canon or the rules of the magic univers.

Do you guys think that maybe one days J. k Rowling will let some writer publish stories on her univers like for the Star Wars franchise ?
