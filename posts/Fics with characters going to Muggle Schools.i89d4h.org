:FlairText: What's That Fic? and a Request
:END:
This one is technically a 'whats that fic' primarily, but I decided to open it out in case there were other similar things that were good.

Basically, I'm looking for a fic where a Hermione at University (Muggle, not Magical) agrees to go to a bar with some friends and they get delighted when they realise 'The Guy'^{TM} is there - she, baffled, asks about it and they point to a dark-haired dude in one corner and explain that he's a cute guy who sits in the corner and doesn't talk to anyone, and one of them tried to hit on him once and he let her down nicely.

Hermione looks at the guy, nods, then walks over and says something to the effect of "Hey Harry, long time no see." and the friends are impressed to find out she used to go to school with 'The Guy'^{TM} and ask questions about it.

There's some other plot to it, I think, but I don't remember anything beyond the one scene.

Anyway, yes. I'm looking for that one first and foremost, but I'll take any other fic where a character goes into Muggle Education - no matter the country.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

  Years have passed since Ginny graduated from Hogwarts and last saw Harry Potter, but when she runs into him one morning in Oxford, how will their newfound relationship bloom, and how will her family take it?

*** It's not that, I'm afraid. She runs into him outside in that fic, but the one I'm thinking of definitely has them meeting in a bar/pub.

Looks like a good fic though - I flicked through the first chapter and enjoyed it, so thanks for the rec! :)

** I only have the one for you, but Rise Above has Hermione attending a muggle high school while Harry and Ron... well. Anyway! linkao3(7833937)

There's a sequel, but it's abandoned so you /might/ not want to read it.

  For once, Harry has taken advantage of his enormous wealth and used it to talk to a solicitor. He finds out a few things--- namely, the fact that his participation in the Triwizard Tournament has rendered him an emancipated minor and the last Lord of the Potters. Being the Lord of the Potters means a lot of things, but most importantly, it means Harry can get the hell outta dodge, and his friends can come along, too.Thus begins the new life of the Golden Trio. They're in America, they're in California, they're in Berkeley. Let the good times roll.

*** Ah, thanks! That looks fun. And eh. Abandoned stories don't bother me. Abandonment of a story just means I get to make up my own ending. :)
