Hey guys!

​

There was one of SugarQuill (I believe) called "My Time in Azkaban" and it was great. Wayback Machine did not help me find it, however.

​

Any other good Sirius in Azkaban fics? It's like a weird guilty pleasure for some reason. Maybe because I so desperately wish I could "fix" Sirius lol. Some of the ones I found did not seem realistic at all.

  What Sirius told Harry about running away from home left a lot out. Here we find out what happened when he ran, why he ran, and the things that developed after. This is an AU fic, originally posted on FanFiction, ongoing and revised. Read, enjoy, comment. No Slash, angsty and dark.

  How did Sirius Black Spend twelve years in Azkaban and come out relatively sane, when others in his situation went mad or died of despair in a matter of weeks? Complete, now in chapters, mature material, SBRL slash, but mostly gen

Annoyingly my other comment pulled right author, wrong story so here's a direct link to her story set in Azkaban.

** linkao3(The Child of Azkaban) gives a fair amount of focus to Sirius' time in a considerably less miserable version of Azkaban.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.
