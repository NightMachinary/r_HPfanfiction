He is bullied a lot and meets this young witch girl who doesn't have a name and won't talk to anyone except him. He names her Diana and adopts her as his sister at Gringotts.

They also were friendly with the Malfoy's. I remember Lucius asking Harry how Diana exists because she was introduced as Diana Potter
