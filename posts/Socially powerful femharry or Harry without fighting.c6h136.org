Wondering if there are any fics where a powerful fem!harry (or guy Harry) isn't an overwhelming dueling prodigy. I'm talking like losing to pre-DA Neville levels of bad at fighting so she has to prevent people from trying to get her before they realise they should. Don't care for economics, pureblood society, or wizarding law focused stories. Preferably gen or f/f

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

**** My main problem with this story is it's very plot driven-the characters do things that don't make sense for how they are characterized. There's just too much deus ex machina for me as well.

#+begin_quote
  A child of the Rich One rises. Wielding a smile masking a plotting mind. Carving a righteous but dark path through a world more vast and mysterious than ever imagined. In this game of gods and men, it's her time to shine. Fem!Harry.

*** What era in the PJ books does this take place? I stopped following them after the Olympians and it gets confusing in fanfic

**** The first takes place before the lightning thief and toward the end is when lighting thief happens. The sequel is between sea of monsters and lightning thief before going into sea of monsters then does the Artemis thing and if I remember right that's about where the sequels sitting. I've only seen the two movies and I didn't get confused by the story. I will warn you the first bit of the story was a bit difficult for me to read at first because it felt like she was a bit too op but that changes very noticeably about halfway through. The first story is mostly hogwarts/a bit of summer btw.
