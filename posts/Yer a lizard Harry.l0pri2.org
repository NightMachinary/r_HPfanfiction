Any animagus!Harry fics? Preferably complete


** I read this one earlier today, which actually features the line "Yer a lizard, Harry". Short but fun!

There's a bunch more I could suggest but I can't remember most of them offhand. Will search for some later.

As you may have noticed, I tend to find muggle animagus forms a bit dull.

There's a metric fuckton of fics where Harry is a peregrine falcon, but it's horrendously overdone and not really that interesting to start with. Ones where he's some form of panther are slightly less common, but usually involve some sort of magical ability like travelling through shadows, which adds coolness points.

**** Don't suppose you know of any fics where his animagus form is something stupid, and he gets viciously mocked for it?

***** I've probably read a few oneshot crack fics like that, but the closest I can think of in a proper-length fic is "Weeb", where his animagus form was a cockroach.

I don't think he actually /told/ anyone what his form was, though. He just killed it and used the magic space (where his animagus form resides when he's human, and his human form stays while he's in animagus form) as portable magic storage. Hammerspace? Malletspace? Something like that. "Tool you hit stuff with" space.
