  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.

** Linkao3(C'est La Vie by cywscross)

Harry travels from a horrible post war version of the HP universe to one where his parents never died. Deaged and sent by "Fate" to Hogwarts Harry taking on the Name Hadrian Evans, he meets the Golden Trio. He has a dimensional twin who keeps the Name Harry. Harry is quite the dick, possibly spending to much time listening to and learning of Albus Dumbledore, I say this because despite James and Lily being great people (and almost instantly wanting to adopt Hadrian the moment they learn he's a 15 year old Orphan) Harry is horrible. One piece of it was learning about the horror Greyback does as a Werewolf at a young age and decided to be against anything "Dark". Combine that with maybe one too many speeches about much of Albus's "The Greater Good" ramblings and Harry seems to have keyed into what Fannon makes James Potter out to be instead of what he was in Canon. The author while good writes male friendship kinda like the beginnings of a Slash relationship, and Hadrian has more friendship development between he and one of his guy friends then he does with nearly all female characters

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
