:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic that I can only remember one or two scenes from.

Harry is in the dungeons with Snape and is experimenting with different ingredients to see what will happen.

One of his potions ends up letting off bubbles that I think induce a mild high or euphoric feeling.

Edited to add: I think both Snape and Harry started giggling uncontrollably.

Later Harry is lounging on the steps outside the Entrance Hall. I think he's waiting for Neville(?) and when he arrives they share the bubbles for a while.

This is all I can remember so I hope it rings a bell for someone. Thanks.


** I just read this recently! It's called Blood Magic ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911]]).

** Idk, theres a scene in HP and the Problems of Potions but the bubble thing he creates is a sentient cleaning sprite, so it's probably not that

** This sounds kind of familiar! Was it where Harry got really invested in potions and was doing a bunch of experiments with different potions ingredients, like the different bases and how they react to cauldrons. Also maybe something about how one of the burners always act up on Wednesdays or something similar?

*** Sorry, all I really remember was that he was really into experimenting and I think Snape was mentoring him. It might have been a Severitus fic.

Can you remember which fic you're thinking of?

**** I think I might have been thinking of two fics, Azoth:

But also another that I can't find which I think was a Severitus, either one where Harry got motivated to get into potions by himself and Snape just sorta ends up mentoring him or one where Severus is his guardian and assigns him homework to understand ingredients.

Alas, I really need to get better at bookmarking things rip.
