After a few people recommended I do so, I figured I would plug my fic here. I'm trying to make a fic that combines a few of my favourite tropes (such as Harry having a twin, and Harry being raised by the Lestranges) while avoiding the cliches that often come with them, and figured others might be into a fic without character bashing and overpowered characters. That being said, I'm really new when it comes to writing (other than some cringy fics I probably wrote when I was 12) so don't expect perfection haha. From the reviews I've gotten so far, it seems my story goes pretty far off normal convention when it comes to HP fics, so strap in I guess (?)

​

I'd love for any feedback! Thanks!

  Lily Potter gave birth to twins. And just like that, the universe's original trajectory was torn to pieces and made anew.James and Harry Potter are believed dead after the Dark Lord is vanquished in 1981, but Bellatrix Lestrange's son, a boy with black hair and green eyes, brings such assumptions into question. A widowed Lily Potter must navigate her way through both Ministry politics and the role of being Voldemort's presumed vanquisher, and the other Potter twin faces his own problems at Hogwarts. What does this new timeline mean for the wizarding world?An attempt at a less cliche wrong-boy-who-lived/Harry has a twin fic, with no character bashing. No BAMFs or Mary-sue self-inserts (hopefully), but if you hate OCs, this isn't the fic for you. More pairings and tropes will be added later. Eventual Harry/Tom Riddle planned.
