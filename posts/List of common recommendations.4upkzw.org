I was just wondering if some of the most commonly recommended stories should have their own list so as to not fill posts with cadmean victory, alaxandra quick, HPMOR, etc.. Feels redundant after a while. Just a thought.

*** Yeah, I'll be compiling some lists of most common fics recommended for different categories / tags as well as a most common recommended fics list as well.

** If you look on the sidebar, scroll down to "useful links" there is one that says "most frequently recommended fics". Probably needs to be updated, but it's still pretty accurate.

*** So many things would be better if people would just read the damn sidebar.

**** A great recommendation for people reading on the website. If you're reading in a mobile app, there is no sidebar. At least not in my app.

******* Huh? There's the sidebar, but you have to click the little 'i' in a circle at the top of the app to see it. It's very easy to miss.

******** But it is not constantly visible the way it is for web readers. You would have to remember the existence of the sidebar and check it for whatever kind of stuff you're searching. Not everyone is going to remember that.

Though honestly, I had never clicked that button, I had no idea. Thanks for that.
