I have taken on a new project and am creating an OC to teach at Hogwarts. I don't want to make her a core teacher to attempt at keeping cannon, however the few electives I found here - [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts_subjects]] - don't really tickle my fancy. Are there any ideas for additional electives beyond ancient magic, arithmany, xylomancy, runes, alchemy, apparition, magical creatures, and muggle studies?

Thanks everybody!


** I've been haphazardly keeping a list of various courses I encounter in fanfictions.

Optional Magical Studies:

- Alchemy
- Animagus Transformation
- Apparition
- Aura Reading
- Conjuration
- Curse Breaking
- Enchanting
- Healing
- Obscure Arts (Blood Magic, Dark Magic, Druidic Magic, Illusion, Ley Line Studies, Mind Arts (Legilimancy, Occlumancy), Necromancy, Soul Magic, Technomancy, Wand Crafting, Ward Breaking/Crafting)
- Portkey Studies
- Pre-Auror
- Pre-Curse Breaker
- Pre-Healer
- Runic Magic
- Silent Magic
- Spell Crafting/Creation
- Wandless Magic

Optional Non-Magical Studies (not including general non-magical courses like Maths, English, etc.):

- Deportment/Etiquette
- Estate Management
- Ethics and Morality
- Legal Studies/Pre-Law
- Magical Being Society (Giant, Goblin, Hag, etc.)

**** Sure. Actually the "Obscure Arts" was my own category for things I didn't think would reasonably be taught at Hogwarts so there you go.

On the other hand, a "good" necromancy class could include such things as:

- detection of necromantic activity (to find the bad guys)
- ghost counseling (to help them pass on? or just help them deal with their new situation?)
- ghost exclusion (to keep them out of an area)
- ghost banishment ('cause sometimes enough is enough)
- communication with the dead (for murder trials, will/estate questions, ancestral wisdom, etc.)
- spells to lay inferi to rest peacefully
- spells to prevent corpses from being made into inferi in the first place (you'd think this would be standard for all magical funerals?)

I'm sure there could be many other "good" applications.

That's the sole purview of the Resurrection Stone, inventing spells or rituals to do the same thing would cheapen it's significance. Unless you're going for a "Deathly Hallows aren't real" plot line. :)

****** Both the Cloak and the Wand are not unique, there are other invisibility cloaks (and the disillusionment spell) and other wands. I don't see any reason there couldn't be lesser versions of the Resurrection Stone in spell form.

EDIT: And linkffn(Potter vs Paradox) has just reminded me that shades of dead people were summoned by the /Prior Incantatem/ effect at the end of GoF. So canon-possible under specific circumstances.

** Your OC could also be Hogwarts staff, like an admin assistant, working in the infirmary as Pomfrey's future replacement, being the flying teacher (which seems more like a coach position instead of an academic teacher).

Hogwarts doesn't have anything like an English teacher either, but I guess the kids write essays a lot.

** I'll also point out that Divination gets pretty short thrift in most fanfictions. But "divination" doesn't just mean predicting the future, it's really the magic of acquiring knowledge/information ("... seeking knowledge of the future /or the unknown/ ..." my computer dictionary says, emphasis added) -- which, when you think about it, is /huge/.

linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero) is taking a stab at doing Divination properly, but there's still a lot to explore in that area I think.

*** Yep. I think I remember one fanfiction that suggested that NEWT-level History of Magic was actually "present-day" history and might cover the Ministry's current organization, prominent members, etc., and how it came to be organized in that way. Hardly any students cared enough about History of Magic to continue into NEWT studies except the Slytherins who knew what it was for.

** Let's see - [[/u/mergirl007][u/mergirl007]] does mention that Hogwarts doesn't have an English teacher, but I could see there be someone offering seminars on how to improve writing, whether it's first or seventh years. There could also be a languages teacher, maybe a class or two focused on the arts, like theatre, music, etc, especially when you consider magical portraits. There could also be an advisor that works specifically with seventh years interested in playing professional quidditch. A lot of shop and home ec would be covered by the stuff listed below. While this is a world of magic, I think it's interesting to see things that we might have taken as high school electives with a slight spin to them because of magic.

*** I wouldn't recommend this, it seems very American and Hogwarts, of course, is British. In British schools, it's broken up into Design & Technology (which includes Cookery, Textiles, Resistant Materials, Electronics, and Graphics) and Personal Social Heath Education (which covers Puberty, Alcohol, Drugs, Finance, Tax, etcetera). That, however, seems very modern and not very Hogwartsy, so I'd recommend coming up with a new name for it.
