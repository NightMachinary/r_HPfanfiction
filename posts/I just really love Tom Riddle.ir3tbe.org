Let me rephrase that. I really love /writing about/ Tom Riddle.

Specifically, I love putting Tom Riddle in increasingly disastrous and disappointing situations. 

It's therapeutic. 

So give me your best "Tom Riddle in painfully humorous situations" prompts, and I will attempt to write things. Possibly. 

I guess this is a request for prompts, rather than a request for fics. I need a serious distraction right now.

Anyway

Maybe this can be one of those "how to annoy Voldemort" fics except it's Tom. Maybe he's starting to gather followers and it's all serious obviously because they're trying to take over the wizarding world and one of his newest followers is a girl and she's /ridiculously cheerful/ and her antics make him want to avada (Kedavra) himself lol

Is that any good? I hope lol

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

** Tom Riddle from an alternate universe where something (a different social circle due to a different sorting, a different orphanage, a loving girlfriend which filled the hole in his heart, a nice chat with the newspaper vendor at King's Cross) prevented him from going evil is summoned to the canon verse by some death eater in the 90s. However, since a sane Riddle would probably be closer to Slughorn than to Voldemort, he is horrified by his alternate/canon universe self and decided to fix things.

It would be interesting since the AU Riddle has the same potential as Voldemort but would be unwilling to use it, or afraid that he would end up as the same monster if he stares into the abyss for too long.

*** I really like this! But [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2595818/1/Rectifier][Rectifier]] by Niger Aquila does almost this exact scenario very, very well, and I doubt I could top it.

I'll have to think on this one. I may be able to come up with a one-shot of sorts. Though I warn you, if I try to make it serious, it will devolve into humor.

**** I am familiar with humour slipping into writing to the point where I have given up even trying to write something completely serious.

However, without having read Rectifier, I might be able to point you into a different direction (since it is tagged Riddle, Voldemort and Dumbledore).

Perhaps the easiest solution to the "too similar" problem would be to have Riddle outright dismiss Dumbledore since he failed again and again to get to this point with Voldemort en large. So he seeks out Harry and basically goes from there with a Third Way fraction of him, Harry, (maybe Ron and Hermione), and some of the Order members who have not been involved in the first war and failed to win the peace (so the younger background cast like Tonks and Hestia Jones rather than Moody, Doge and Lupin).

Of course, if you don't mind whacky humour, have Riddle adopt Harry after he went to check up on the child who defeated his alter ego only to be shocked by how the Dursleys treat him. Basically a reverse of all those awful "Harry/Hermione adopts/saves Riddle only to end up in bed with him" fics.

****** It would definitely be something different and better, especially if you don't make it romantic. Although if you want just that arc, maybe before Hogwarts so that Harry is still in the cupboard and the summoning was by a death Eater who mentions Horcruxes or immortality in general without going into details. Or maybe the revival fails because Voldemort is still around as spirit and Riddle then figures out why he ended up summoned.

** Tom Riddle gets caught with a minor offense and has to serve detention with Dumbledore. But instead of writing lines, or something easy like that Dumbledore makes his detention as painful as possible for Tom. Tom Riddle has to simply eat dinner/ drink tea with Dumbledore for an hour and have a "civil" conversation with the man he hates. Dumbledore of course, being his old crazy self, talks to Tom about his "feelings" and "love" and just generally makes Tom feel uncomfortable.
