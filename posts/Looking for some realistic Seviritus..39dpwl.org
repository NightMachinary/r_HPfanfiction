** I really enjoyed [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]]. It features Guardian!Snape.

A couple other Severitus fics I enjoyed were [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=1624][Vow]] (and 2 sequels), [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=2025][Blood Magic]] and [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=1444][Lily's Charm]].

You can also check out [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/browse.php?type=categories][Potions and Snitches]] which is the archive site for Severitus fics.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3417954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enemy-Within][Harry Potter and the Enemy Within]] is an excellent mentor fic with believable character development. It explores what would happen if Harry resumed Occlumency lessons with Snape in his sixth year. Genuine guidance/concern, but not a lot of praise because Snape is written in character. ;)

** Would To Shape and Change count as Severitus?

** The Pureblood Pretense has a mentor Snape. The rare snape perspectives are probably the best thing ever [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2027554/1/In-Blood-Only][In Blood Only]] was pretty good. Snape finds out he's Harry's biological father.

** I liked Digging for Bones by Paganaidd. I'd warn you, though that it involves Harry being abused by the Dursleys.

Another fic "Blood Magic" I liked the first time, and then the second time, Harry and Hermione were too irritating. Oh, well. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1390933/1/Blood-Magic]]
