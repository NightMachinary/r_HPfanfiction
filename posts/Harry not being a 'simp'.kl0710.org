I had got back into Harry/hermione fics a few weeks back and I rediscovered the reason why i stooped reading those fics in the first place.

It's because so many Harry/hermione fics follow the same script- Hermione leaving Harry and moving away for some jackass reason and Harry accepting her with open arms when she comes back 3 years later. These fics usually tend to portray Hermione as the smartest witch who gives all the solutions to the problems in the story and Harry as a short tempered guy who can't move on or stop obsessing over his relationship.

That is, Harry being- (for the lack of a better word)- a 'simp'.

This script for fics is really prevalent in Post-hogwarts Harry/hermione fics.

So basically I am requesting for fics that are the exact opposite of this premise. Could be that Harry Doesn't really care that she left, or he doesn't let her leave in the first place. As long as it is not similar to this premise I will take it. Doesn't have to be just Harry/Hermione, can be any Harry centric fic.


** There's a one shot that I cannot remember the name of which plays with this.

Hermione rejects Harry's advances post war due to personal trauma. Leaves Britain entirely for many years only to come back and tell a now estranged Harry she's ready to start something. A rather nonplussed Harry then introduces Hermione to his wife, Gabrielle.

Hermione is shocked that Harry didn't wait for her. Harry doesn't think much about it at all as they have a baby on the way.

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione disappears. Harry searches for her for years, but she is gone... until she finally comes back on her own terms. (Written to illustrate the flaw in this trope.)

Pointless, "happy ending" changes, heavy Ron/Weasley bashing, a Hermione that acted like she'd been kicked in the head, recovered, then been kicked in the head again and came out brain-damaged as a result, and pointless porn -- /especially/ at the end.

Who wrote that? A 13 year old?

Still, the idea of Hermione or another woman realizing that she lost out in the end is strangely delicious -- it's just the execution here was shit.

***** I'm with you on this one.

If I understand correctly, the story's reasoning is that Hermione loves Harry deeply and doesn't want to hurt him, so she can't be with him. But her relationship with Krum doesn't have any deeper meaning, so it's fine. I think it's nonsense, but you can find this kind of logic in romantic fiction (not just fanfiction).

** Harry/hermione isn't my fav pairing but I think I've read quite a few. Have never come across a 'simp' fic (although this could be bc I stop reading at the first sign of being too far out of character.) Actually, I used to prefer the pairing but got sick of how many fics had the most boring "fated" sort of getting-together moment. A lot of the times it's extremely unrealistic and jarring - or the characters are way, way too young for their actions and how they are portrayed (sometimes written in a disturbing way that must be written by either an actual eleven year old or an actual pedophile and I don't care to know which). I've come to loathe the sort of hermione that falls into harry's arms and swears undying love at first kiss. Or any fic that mentions Ron's crush on Hermione to then use him as a cheap villain.

**** Because it simply isn't. Even if you decided every single time Harry had feelings for Hermione and either doesn't act on them or significant time passed until he finally does so counts as being a â€˜simp' (which is a fucking stupid term, btw), that still doesn't make up 'a significant portion'. Hell, it happens just as much in the other direction. Not to mention, almost uniformly the feelings are mutual towards the person doing the pining.

I'm looking at the first page after sorting by favs, and I'm kind of confused how you reached that conclusion. 10 of the 25 stories are by Robst, who is infamous for having Hermione be a one-dimensional damsel in distress who only exists to fawn over OP!Harry. /What We're Fighting For, The Vanishing Cabinet Of Time, With You by My Side, When Fate Intervened, A Different Professor, Rebirth of the Founders,/ and /Reboot/ have also been similarly criticized, and I've never seen someone criticize the power dynamics in /The Reclamation of Black Magic, Harry McGonagall, Escape, The Last Casualties,/ or /Sympathetic Properties/. /Weary Wizard, The End and the Beginning, Hermione's Brilliant Idea/ are really the only ones that have the power dynamics shifted in Hermione's favor. That means Hermione has a whopping total of 3 stories on the front page where what you're saying is true, while Harry has 17. No offense, but I hardly think Tumblr would brigade those fanfics if the genders were reversed.

******* I don't get why Harmony shippers are so... weird most of the time. Hermione is a rather simple, upper class good-girl type character if you compare her to more or less any other girl in both canon and fanon. If it wasn't for the magic, looking over Hermione's character you'd expect her to attend bible class voluntarily. I'm definitely not saying that she has a lack of personality, because she's a decently interesting character on her own, but her fandom really doesn't seem fitting for her personality. This whole radical 'can do no wrong and you're not allowed to criticize' thing is something I'd expect of people stanning Voldemort, not Hermione, but even those guys are surprisingly chill about it.
