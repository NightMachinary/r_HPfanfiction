Because Snape is a mean bastard and Potter is a stubborn brat (he can probably grow out of the bratty part, but I don't know about the other things). *And they kinda hate each other.* There are ways to get around all that, it's just obviously more work - and a lot harder to find it done well.

Many authors try to soften their relation by literally forcing them to spend time together - and *still* it's usually extremely rushed and in no way convincing. I mean.. if that's too hard, just have them hate-fuck. or get them drunk. *whatever works*

Know anything?

**** "Paedophilia" is an approximation of "pædophilia" for standard ASCII. It's a British variant. I created a keyboard layout with "æ" for Norwegian, and since I have it, I use it for Britishisms.

*** I would hazard a guess that the vast majority of all non !Dark, multi-generational pairing fics happen when the younger person is over the age of consent (17). I would also say that a majority of these fics happen Post Hogwarts so that argument is moot. Believe it or not, good authors of these pairings write the pairing RESPONSIBILY so there is none of that pedophilia nonsense.

So I'm not exactly sure what you think Older Adult/Harry or Older Adult/Hermione readers are reading but it is certainly not pedophilia.

**** A student/teacher relationship is squicky even if the student is seventeen. It comes too close to Wife Husbandry.

An age gap that large bothers me in general. I'll go along with it if it's pure smut, but a healthy romantic relationship requires a level of equality and equal maturity that's largely impossible to achieve with someone who's half your age.

** I reread linkao3(Rapture mia_ugly) and the sequel linkao3(blood but also roses mia_ugly) recently and was reminded of how clever "Rapture" is with the multiple timelines and how it interweaves with canon. I find the end bits of it not as satisfying as they could be, but the sequel makes up for that IMHO.

(Let's see if this bot thing works for me on my first attempt.)

  SSHP. To avoid the machinations of the Ministry, Harry must marry a reluctant Severus Snape. But marriage to Snape is only the beginning of Harry's problems. Voldemort has returned, and before too long Harry's marriage may determine the world's fate.

Though I know there are a couple of continuations of it by other people, but it's been ages since I looked at them so I can't remember which one I found worthwhile and which one was rather "meh" and ultimately I just wish the story were completed by the original author.

** [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=19708][The Apple Tree by Philo]] creates distance from Harry and Severus' early, antagonistic relationship by diverging from canon after Order of the Phoenix, but taking place Harry's seventh year. During the elapsed time, we learn that Harry explored the muggle world, working and forming relationships, and also spent time developing his magical gifts and creating his own vision for his future.

You can easily buy this more confident and mature Harry being intrigued when he inadvertently glimpses another side of Severus.

Some readers were upset over the lack of warning about a plot point that has been construed by some as sexual assault, though there is disagreement about that interpretation.

** Ohh, I remember one from early in my fanfiction days. Not sure how well it's held up to time, but it was my favorite HP/SS for a good long while.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/714361/chapters/1321936]] - Cambiare Podentes A prophecy demands that Harry perform a ritual with Snape that forces him into sexual slavery in exchange for a massive power boost. They're both very not okay with this, but go through with it for the sake of defeating Voldemort. I remember them being largely okay in terms of characterization, and the build being believable, but the premise implies a lot of iffy consent issues.

Note--worth mentioning that Harry is 18 in this.

** I'll be honest here - there isn't a single one that feels plausible. But if you can suspend your disbelief of one of the weirdest and most fucked up and plain wrong pairings in the entire fandom, then there's probably some out there with atleast good writing.

How could you make make it plausible? Make a female!Harry and.. oh god no that'd be even more wrong, but atleast it'd fit Snape's character more. I.. I don't know why you want this and I don't know why anyone would write it.

Here, I'll leave this obscure silent hill/hp [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186953/1/Who-Has-Time-For-Tears][crossover]] that does Snape's character pretty well. I'm not sure anyone would be able to read HP/SS after it (:
