With the homogenisation of magical education the bar for the lowest level of magical education was raised to a level that the average magical before Hogwarts was founded could never even dream of. But with with Hogwarts new standardised education there was probably things that were lost as magic was slowly transformed over the centuries from a mostly self-taught art into a Science leading to even the most powerful modern wizards reaching a glass ceiling that they cannot pass because there are somethings about magic that are Impossible to teach in a classroom environment or at all for that matter.A magic user has to learn those lessons for themselves so they can break threw the glass ceiling but something about the way that the new formal education makes the modern wizard think about magic makes it almost impossible to do.

In modern times even the worst students that graduate from Hogwarts have a better formal education than the four founders of Hogwarts themselves but there is just something that the new education offered by Hogwarts just cant teach That the most talented wizards from before Hogwarts used to learn for themselves. Making it so even the the strongest wizard from modern times can't match up to there pre-Hogwarts counterparts. but the Skill of the weak and average wizard had improved so much that its comes out as a net positive.

How do you think The founding of Hogwarts effected the average power of the wizard that came after and how do you think they compare to there pre Hogwarts counterparts?


** Hogwarts. Without a question. Combined, accumulated knowledge wins out.

** I'd say the greatest wizards were always on about the same level, because people like Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald and Merlin don't have to /rely/ on lore except for the most powerful effects --- they just instinctively shape magic, Force-style, to fulfill most of their everyday needs ---, and Hogwarts doesn't really teach the more powerful magics that a grand sorcerer would need to /learn/.

On the other hand, the /average/ modern wizard knows a lot more spells (both everyday household charms and duelling spells) and is thus arguably more capable, though on the other hand the pre-Hogwarts wizards, even those who didn't have much native talent, probably knew more wandless magic than modern ones, out of sheer necessity.

*** I don't know. Instinctive, will-shaped magic is just too boring for me. I would say that they all had high magical potential and understanding, but had different skills based on the magical knowledge available to them. Due to the accumulation of magical knowledge, higher levels of magical knowledge are likely more easily available after Hogwarts was established.

And the pre Hogwarts wizards may know more wand less magic, but it is almost certainly made obsolete know with more efficient wand magic alternatives.

Well, /yes/, but that's not /directly/ related to Hogwarts. More powerful spells and rituals were created and recorded throughout the millenium that Hogwarts' existed, as others had throughout the millenia preceding the founding of Hogwarts --- meaning there are, indeed, more powerful lore available to modern-day wizards --- but that would largely have happened with or without Hogwarts, just as it always had before. I'll grant you that some of the spellcrafters may not have reached their whole potential if not for Hogwarts, but...

Oh yes. Maybe I wasn't clear enough in the first post, but /definitely/. The pre-Hogwarts wizards had wandless skills that would be highly regarded in modern wizarding society but don't amount to much if they're not a bonus over solid wand-based core abilities.
