** Richard Harris definitely portrayed the wise old dumbledore way better than Gambon. It would have been very interesting to see his interpretation of dumbledore's flaws in the later films.

Maybe physically he would have struggled but acting wise he'd definitely have been up for it - this was a guy who supported the IRA for a while and nearly ODed on coke in the 70s. I mean, he wasn't a Saint himself, and it would have been interesting to see if he could have tapped into the inner darkness, I guess

*** Lets be honest though, that delivery was likely more to do with the directing than Gambon, himself.

**** Possibly, since most of his other work in the series was good. He did play Dumbledore more intensely and emotionally, though, than Harris (who played him more serene and cards-close-to-the-vest), so it's not beyond the realm of possibility that even if Gambon didn't choose to play the scene that way, he might have agreed with that direction. Either way, I think Harris would have resisted such direction, since it was so markedly different from the way he played Dumbledore, resulting in an improved scene. I don't think Harris's way can be called /objectively/ better for the rest of the series, though - just different.

** If we're talking about fantasy situations, how about if Ian McKellen was willing to replace him...a fan can dream.

IMO, the movies would've been better with Harris. Gambon did what he could, but he just /isn't/ Dumbledore in any imaginable interpretation of the character. If anything, he would've made a better Aberforth.

** I don't think Harris could have handled Dumbledore's action scenes in the later installments, but I don't like grumpy Gambon as well - I guess it depends on their ability to find the right actor.

** i think gambon gets way too much hate. it think he did a good job of fitting what dumbledor needed to be as the series got darker and darker in later books. I can't imagine harris being as good in those Scenes. I get that people complain about that one scene in the fourth movie but honestly I can get past that. of all my issues with the movies Casting isn't one of them...

** I'm not averse to occasionally poking fun at Gambon's portrayal, but I agree that directional style had more to do with those gaffes than anything else. It took me a while to fully acknowledge that Watson, Radcliffe, Rickman et al. weren't to blame for everything that was missing from the movies, nor everything that was hammered in.

Damn you, Yates.

**** Can someone plesse tell me I'm not the only one disappointed by the prophecy reveal scene.

In the book harry literally releases a years worth of pent up frustration and wrecks dumbledores office; in the movie he's like o..ookkk ..i..guess.

** I liked Gambon's portrayal. Sure there were the occasional rough spots, but I think that he was able to capture Dumbledore's whimsical and eccentric side better than Richard Harris would have been able to.

It's really hard to say though.
