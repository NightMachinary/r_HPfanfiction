So, short story for this one: I went out last night and it was one of the best parties ever. I cam home at ~7 in the morning and made the mistake of drinking coffee. Hence: no sleepy time for this guy. Instead I wrote the beginning to an idea.

Basically, it starts off like a Do-over. Harry summons the devil and pays his soul for one more try (I would probably change that, but that is how it is right now). But the devil can't turn back time, because thats just now how this all works. He can, however, let Harry relive his life from a similar starting point in a similar universe - or so he says.

Harry agrees and wakes up in the new universe, where he was adopted by the Blacks after his parents death. The Blacks are Sirius and Bellatrix Black as well as their daughter Virgo. Joining them are Narcissa Zabini who lives an alternative "Coven" lifestyle with Alessia Zabini, Andromeda McGonagall who is married to Minerva McGonagalls son, Hephaist and their daughter Nymphadora Minerva McGonagall - who prefers the nickname "Mint".

He learns in the first chapter that Dumbledore and Grindelwald rule as Emperors over Europe, fighting against the Persians and the Russians in the East as well as the Egyptians in the south.

After a few chapter Harry realizes that at the very core, the changes from his universe were initiated by people who had lost /a lot/ during his lifetime. The devil makes an appearance and tells him that, Harry is indeed together with all the people who had sold their soul for one more try. The Universe of No Regrets.

That doc includes the start of the first chapter.

I'm really tired now, but I feel this could become something. Maybe you got some ideas as well? See ya tomorrow.

** "Any other man would have compared it to the Cruciatus curse, but the one man who had felt the torture curse more than anyone alive stooped not to such exaggerations. It hurt, but he had worse."

This bothered me the most to be honest cause it's just inaccurate. Frank and Alice have felt the torture curse more than him, in fact a lot of people fighting in the war have experienced it more times than Harry.

I do love the idea of No Regrets universe though. Please inform if you ever do make this fic.

*** Yes, now I see that was an unfortunate bit of phrasing. Eh... I was still somewhat drunk so I'll give myself a pass on that. I'll rewrite it anyway.

But yea, I do like it as well because it gives me an opportunity to go all out stupid in a fic. It may or may not become a release. Really depends on how much I get done on it this week.

** I cannot see Sirius marrying one of his cousins.

The universe of No Regrets is an interesting idea.

*** Later in the story I would explain why he still did go through with it. But yeah, its a bit out there. If I ever truly decide to write it, I'll consider changing it.

For now I had a laugh imagining that fuck up of a Black family.
