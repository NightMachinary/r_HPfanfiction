:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
so the fic is a fem harry goes to hogwarts gets sorted into slytherin and is baisicly shunned and ostracized throughout hogwarts, in her first year she spends a lot of time in myrtles bathroom and and the end of first year when she is going back to the dursleys after getting off the train she rushes to petunia and starts crying in her arms or something like that. the end paring is (femharry/friend of krums from durmstrang) and thats all I can remember off the top of my head. if any one knows i would really appreciate it. thank you.
