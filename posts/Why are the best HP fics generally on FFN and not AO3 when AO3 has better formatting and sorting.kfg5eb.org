Obviously there are good HP fics on AO3, but it seems like the vast majority of good stuff is on FFN. Which makes zero sense to me. AO3 has tags, you can load all the chapters at once, and a million other reasons why it is superior.


** For whatever reason, my fic got almost zero attention on AO3 (maybe 30 comments, maybe a hundred - at most - 'kudos', only a handful of subscriptions), whereas on FFN I got over a thousand reviews, almost 2k follows, and 1500+ favs. I think that certain communities like AO3 more, whereas FFN is a more varied audience.

When it comes to reading, I also don't like AO3. It's a little uncomfortable having to figure out how to exclude things like pedophilia from search results.

**** To be fair that all seems to be common with FFN as well, except for the really nasty stuff that violates site rules for FFN. I think all of that is just fandom preferences in general.

** FFN is older than AO3. It is where most of the older authors who have written lots of good fics have accounts.

** I read on both but prefer FFN. Your post is purely an opinion (ie, better sorting). AO3 tags give me pause. I despise when there are 3 paragraphs worth of tags on one story, and especially hate scrolling through 10 stories like that to get to one normally tagged story. And crossovers ugh.

I prefer the simplicity of FFN.

*** I don't understand how you find anything on FFN! If there's no tags then you can't sort for a relationship or a theme like WBWL and you can't sort by kudos or anything. The only reliable way I've found so far is to get recommended fics. The only fics I've read on FFN have been recommended here.

**** You can search by relationship. You can sort by highest reviewed in a category. You can search a keyword and then narrow results, too. But no, there aren't tags.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/]]

Pick your category (I chose HP), then scroll to the bottom fo the page. On the bottom there is sorting options. On desktop mode I believe this is on the right side of the page. On mobile, once it narrow down one category the page reloads and then you get to narrow down again a smaller category (the drop boxes update), and etc. It will refresh a couple times as it narrows.

Idk what WBWL is, but I typed it into the search and a few popped up. Probably not as many as AO3 but maybe there is a diamond in the rough lol. Again, narrow search if you scroll down.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/search/?type=story&keywords=Wbwl&genreid=0&subgenreid=0&characterid=0&subcharacterid=0&words=0&ready=1]]

Sometimes you can find really great Communities on FFN, too. People compile their top stories into one list and share the list. Check those out! Here's 2 examples. One for most reviewed, and one for WBWL. Check multiple communities to see stories one person may have missed. Archive number is the number of stories in a community.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Most-Reviewed-HP-Fanfiction/93861/]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/search/?keywords=Wbwl&ready=1&type=community]]

Edit: whoops, the sort by reviews is the first search option how silly of me. Here are the top reviewed HP fics on FFN, I chose all ratings (it automatically only does K-T), so there are M rated fics on this result. Fyi

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?srt=3&t=0&g1=0&g2=0&r=10&lan=0&len=0&s=0&v1=0&c1=0&c2=0&c3=0&c4=0&_g1=0&_c1=0&_c2=0&_v1=0]]

(Also total sidenote, it makes me happy to see the top reviewed is a Dramione story lol, my favorite.)

Happy reading!

** More readers on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] - popularity of a site is self perpetuating. Fan base is already there.

[[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] gives writers lots of info about their readers (how many times the page was opened, how many people, which countries loaded from, etc.) - knowing you're getting readers even if you don't get many comments/faves/follows is encouraging to keep writing

You're focused on where is better for readers, but writers are more focused on where is best for writers

** AO3 is better from a reader's perspective. You can filter in, or out, a lot of stories if you play with it a bit. While ffn is much simpler to use for writers.

I prefer ao3 because I can load all chapters of a story at once, save it, and read it at my owm pace without the need for a stable Wifi connection(yes I have that issue).

** They have different strengths. As a reader, FFN has a distinction between follows and favorites, with one being public and the other private; on the other hand, AO3 lets you put your own description in a bookmark. FFN has sequential chapter IDs, so you can edit the URL to jump to another chapter in the story. It has reviews that are visible to search engines, but AO3 comments make it easier to hold a conversation - on the other hand, AO3 doesn't have private messaging.

They're just different.

** Popularity, in social media platforms, is pretty much a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's easy to be popular, just so long as you're already popular.

The value a site to authors is decided by the number of readers it can push to their stories. The value of a site to readers is decided by the number of fics matching their preferences the site can put in front of them.

A relies on B, and B relies on A. More readers -> more writers -> more readers etc. [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] simply has a huge leg-up on AO3 for that reason.

The only reason AO3 has been able to grow to its current size at all, I suspect, is due to the general poor management of FFN (clunky, old fashioned website design, basically zero active development or improvements, driving away large sections of the fanfic community in purges). Had AO3 been the first on the scene I do not think another fanfiction website would have been able to gain much of a following at all.

Finally, though, it's very worth it to point out that the relative size of AO3 and FFN is highly dependant on the fandom. Harry Potter is old enough that it had a big leg-up where it was the only viable option for a long time. Newer franchises have a much larger following on AO3 than on FFN (and FFN is only just about able to stay relevant in fandoms like Marvel thanks to overflow from older fandoms where it still dominates).

** 1. AO3 is still relatively new. Older fandoms and older authors already have solid presences on FFN, so they don't have much reason to move.

2. AO3's invite-only registration system adds enough of a barrier to entry to discourage some people from bothering.

3. AO3's tags are an awful and nigh-unusable mess, so some people don't want to bother with them.

4. AO3 kind of has a reputation as being for slash, smut, RPF, and +child porn+ /underage/ fics. If you're not writing any of those things, there's much less of a reason to post there. And some users probably don't post there because they don't want to be associated with those things.

*** This. This is why. I don't really see it in ASoIaF(what I mainly read on Ao3), but any other fandom is filled with slash(I don't have anything against people who like slash, I just don't like when you have to go through 50 fics of the stuff to get to a non slash fic), smut, and tags that take like a good 5 swipes just to get to the summary.

** I mean, the vast majority of everything is on FFN, including the... stuff in need of more work, shall we say. It's been here for longer, and it doesn't have a gatekeeping system for uploads like Ao3 does with the invites so it's easier to upload to.

I'm with thrawnca, personally. They both have their strengths, they both have their weaknesses.

** I find Ao3 easier to read. I mostly read on my phone and Ao3 has better spacing and formatting. I find it much more accessible.

When I find good stories on Ao3 they're pretty damn brilliant but as a person who doesn't like slash/romance there's a lot to trail through 😀.

Ffn I used to use decades ago for Merlin fics so it always feels old to me and I'm less drawn to it. But I do think the stories there are also brilliant. And a lot less slashy/romance/uncomfortable topics...

** HP a older fandom so I think alot of older good fics still on ff.net

I think more people post on Ao3 now but I think alot of people in hp fandom still use ff.net too.

But I do think sometimes some types of stories easier to find on one site vs another. For example I find it easier to find stories about Harry's generation post hogwarts on Ao3 than on ff.net.

** I'm not entirely sure but my guess it has something to do with FFN being easier to find with a google search then AO3 when searching for fanfics because all the good fanfictions are already there. so people who want to write one go to the sight they are most familiar with.
