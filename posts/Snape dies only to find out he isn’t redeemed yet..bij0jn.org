I got this idea from another fandom so bear with me. Most people take issue with the way Snape acted in the books and I think they are right to. I'd love to see a story showing him having to go back and redeem himself, not go back and fall in love with Lily or have a good childhood. An old worn out Snape is sent back to the sixties/seventies by Someone on a mission to get rid of Tom Riddle during his rise to power. Something that doesn't romanticize Snape but also doesn't make him an evil SOB.


** The easiest way to redeem Snape is to give him a re-do -- it's not actually unrealistic, since Snape's problems stem from him being mentally stuck in the past -- so giving him a re-do would essentially re-start his mental maturing and would allow him to become a better person (Sirius is a similar case -- he doesn't require redeeming per se, but giving him a similar kind of re-do might allow him to properly mature).

However, usual destination times -- August-September 1971, May 27th 1976 (the most likely exact date of the Defense O.W.L. -- I looked it up once when pondering some things), or similar, makes things far too easy to him to act in his own self-interest and not truly learn to atone for his "past" but rather merely just set things up to his own benefit. I think a "fairer" point of return would be after overhearing the Prophecy, but before he reveals it to Voldemort -- this would /not/ give him his deepest desire (it's far too late for that at that point), but gives him an opportunity to atone for what he considers to be his biggest mistake, and letting him have something to live for, even if it isn't what he truly wants, would hopefully be enough for him to not turn out an asshole in the end. Hopefully this also means mending things properly without having feelings stuck in limbo after Halloween 1981, and perhaps develop new friendships (probably not with Sirius, but maybe others in the Order).

I think what you're suggesting would lead Snape to, rather than caring about the war, put a much bigger focus on giving himself -- the younger him -- a better life. So it'd probably be best to wipe that Snape out entirely from the timeline first to avoid him getting any strange ideas.

*** One could argue that it's his responsibility to atone for his sins and that making it easier for him by sending him back to when his life was still already ruined defeats the purpose.

**** It boils down to whether or not you think he deserves a punishment for his behaviour after his first life. Because I think that, even if he got the easier path, he'll ultimately turn into a better person in the end even if he has obvious self-interests at that point (in fact, the "easy" points of return immediately gives him something he considers very important to fight for to make himself a better person -- if he messes up /again/, then frankly he deserves it).
