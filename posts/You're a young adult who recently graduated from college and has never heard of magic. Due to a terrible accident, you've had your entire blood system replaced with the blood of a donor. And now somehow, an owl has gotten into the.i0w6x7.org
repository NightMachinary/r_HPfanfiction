** Damn, didn't realize that they started draining people out of all their blood when you donate.

Seriously though, if you lose your entire blood volume, you're probably dead. And if by some miracle you live, no way that your transfusions come from the same person.

That doesn't even touch on the HP stuff.

*** Still, though. Maybe the magical blood overpowers the regular blood. Or, because that would probably be too common, the blood could come from somebody unique. A magical anomaly, of some kind.

The MC could even be a squib, just never told about it, and the magical blood activates a dormant gene. That could be interesting. Maybe they need regular top ups, and over-exerting themselves could cause some kind of damage that a lack of magic wouldn't be able to heal properly. The damage doesn't even have to be permanent, it could heal up whenever they get some extra blood, creating a sort of pseudo-vampire.
