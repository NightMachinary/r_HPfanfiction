Angelina Johnson, Katie Bell or Alicia Spinnet. Harry can be with one, two or all three of the girls.

Thanks for your help.


** I am afraid most of these stories will be pure lemons, so I am not interested, but I have been always intrigued by the character of Katie Bell. I am afraid everybody forgot (including and foremost JKR herself), that when Harry was standing green waiting for his first Quidditch match, there was next to him another student of Hogwarts in the similar shade of colour waiting for her first Quidditch match. Did they bond based on this (and other similar) shared experience?

*** I don't even remember her year being mentioned until HBP, so up until that point I assumed that she was in the same year as Angelina and Alicia.

** Anyone remember the one where he wakes up tied to a chair in the gryffindor locker room and one of his team mates plays bdsm mistress with him and tells him he has a hour to guess who she is and she does all sorts of lemmony smut good things to him and then.. spoilers end story here.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's attraction to Parvati leads him to take his Yule Ball preparation much more seriously and his night is changed as a result. Includes an awesome Ron, an interesting Parvati and a drunk Katie Bell. Oh, and what's a Yule Ball fic without a little Fleur Delacour?

Probably means the story got deleted. Sometimes you can find a deleted fic in an archive, but doesn't seem to be the case for this one.
