** There was “That Boy is Trouble” but it's uncensored version is long gone. I personally enjoyed how they treated Snape.

*** +Yeah, the extended version got taken down quick. It's completely gone.+

I lied, I found it and pm'd you a copy.

Edit 2: The writing is reallllly shitty btw I wouldn't bother with it.

** Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor by Cloneserpents is described as an H/Hr "erotic comedy". Very funny yet smutty stuff. I don't know their ages in the fic but they are, if not legal, then within a year or two so I won't post the link.

** Look for "A boy and his cloak". No link due to underage characters, but it is by far the best depiction of sex I have seen in fanfic (even though they only get to third base). Harry and Hermione are both in-character and their interactions feel believable.
