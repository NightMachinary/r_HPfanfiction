What it says in the title. I'm looking for stories where Harry is a Bartender. And please, cut down on his chronic hero syndrome. He is Harry Potter, not Shirou Emiya. He helps people when/if he feels like it. Not every time. Those adventures he had to endure year after year was because he is Fate's bitch not because he goes out of his way to save everyone.(This is also true for the canon Harry as well.) Crossovers are preferred but not a must. I like them to be Powerful Harry as well but not a must.

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

** There's an awesome post-war story where Harry is held captive, loses his memories, and ends up living as a muggle in New Orleans where he works at a dive bar. Ginny tracks him down and gets a job at the bar until she can help him remember. First romance, then action. I can't remember the name, though it may have been by hgfan1111 so I'll have to check if I have it saved.

*** Sorry for the late reply, tagging [[/u/SleepyGuy12]]:

The story is named Away From the Sun by hgfan1111. It's her longest - she was one of my favorite authors, and very prolific in writing almost exclusively postwar H/G fics with a surprising amount of variation. She's since deleted all her stories but you can find them all [[http://www.perusingtheshelves.com/fanfiction/harry-potter-fanfiction/60/][here]] (requires login), or if that doesn't work DM me.

  The Hog's Head is an unabashed romance that follows the lives of Harry and Ginny from the Battle of Hogwarts through the following year. Chapter One, "Faith," begins during the Battle as Lord Voldemort calls his truce. It follows canon precisely but from Ginny's point of view. My own plot, post-DH, begins with Chapter Two, "Anticipation."

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976
