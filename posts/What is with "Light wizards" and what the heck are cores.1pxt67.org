It seems like every story I read uses some of this stuff:

- Light/Dark. Witches and Wizards "declaring for the Light/Dark" or being "Light wizards" or "Lords of Light" or some such nonsense. I get that Rowling capitalised Dark when referring to Dark wizards (and I still have no idea why she did), but I don't think she ever meant anyone to think there were equivalent "Light wizards".
- Cores. WTF are these? They keep popping up in fanfic I read, without any explanation.
- Why do wizards/witches seem to get tired after using reasonably routine spells when there's no evidence (if I remember correctly) in canon to indicate that that would happen?
- Why does every pureblood family seem to get a mansion?
- Why does the Potter family have a mansion?
- Why does Harry always seem to be some sort of God-like superbeing?
- Why is Snape always Draco's godfather?
- Why is Dumbledore always cast as being a manipulative douchebag?

Am I just reading bad fanfic, or a particular style of fanfic out of many? These all seem to pop up with surprising frequency in a wide range of stuff, though, so IMO that seems unlikely.

On a slightly unrelated note, what is with this ADJECTIVE!CHARACTER_NAME thing I see going on? Is it any different to just putting the adjective before the proper noun like normal English? Is it just there to allow tagging fanfic with something like Evil Dumbledore without having to allow spaces in tags or something?

Also, why is there so much weird (Voldemort/Harry, Hermione/Luna, Minerva/Harry /vomits/, etc.) shipping?


** As marganod said, most of this stuff is fanfic trends, particularly the cores/mansions/Super!Harry/Maniuplative!Dumbles/Godfather!Snape. Someone wrote it once, it was liked, and now everybody writes it.

The issue especially with cores, the Light/Dark thing, and the getting tired bit is an attempt to expand on the magic of the world, which JKR didn't actually do much. The cores are a popular choice for Origin of Magic for individuals. The tiredness is an easy, and in certain cases reasonable, option for creating a 'price' for using magic, otherwise everyone would be running around casting super-powerful spells willy-nilly and that's just not good for storytelling.

The Light/Dark I think is more of a political thing. I will admit the only story I've seen it majorly dealt with is the Sacrifices Arc where declaring Light/Dark was a big deal and affected what magic you could cast and the two factions opposed each other quite heavily (without being directly tied to siding with/against Voldemort). I also think that it provides an easy source of conflict and gives an opportunity to write the ideal of dark =/= evil.

Adjective!Character, it's merely the way fandoms evolved to describe a character in a certain way, particularly when the character trait in question isn't canon. See [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/!][Fanlore]] for possibilities of its origins.

As for shipping, I can guarantee you that the three you mentioned will not be the weirdest you come across. In fact, they're quite tame. The HP fandom has a /massive/ range of characters and people will ship /everything/. If you don't like it, don't read it, but for God, Merlin, and Pete's sake, *do not ship bash*. Saying you don't like something is fine, saying that you can't imagine a ship ever happening is fine, but attacking a ship and its shippers is just rude and unnecessary. Chances are there's a ship you like (it may even be canon) that others don't. We've all got our preferences and no one should be insulted and abused for liking what they like. I will never understand why some people find that so hard to comprehend.

That makes a certain level of sense, though I suppose I see it much like 'midichlorians' in the practically-fanfic prequel trilogy - just a way of reducing magic down to "science" for pretty much no reason whatsoever, except a need to explain everything.

Would they really? They don't do this in the books, or at least it isn't bad for storytelling. In the books, the restriction is that some spells (unforgivables) require you to really mean it, and some other spells are just very technically difficult or slow to perform.

It just doesn't make sense to me. The vast majority of people are going to be good, right? And the others are criminals, using illegal harmful dark magic. I don't know why one would 'declare for the Light' or 'declare for the Dark' in that case. That's like someone 'declaring for the Police' and 'declaring for the Criminal', do you get what I mean?

#+begin_quote
  I also think that it provides an easy source of conflict and gives an opportunity to write the ideal of dark =/= evil.
#+end_quote

Which is kinda strange IMO, because dark wizardry IS evil. Dark magic is defined to be magic that causes harm - curses, hexes, jinxes, in descending order of nastiness. It's horcruxes, it's the unforgiveable curses.

I don't find it hard to comprehend, I was just wondering why it seemed like nearly every fanfic I can find that's written pretty well is also lewd and in the (subjectively, from my perspective) strangest ways. Not like HP6, where there's a bit of 'hanky-panky' but frankly nothing serious, and with characters that have been hinted at being together since the beginning of the series.

I don't mind if people like it, write it, read it, etc. But there is well-regarded HP fanfic that doesn't involve heavy shipping?

#+end_quote

I had to look up midichlorians; never watched Star Wars. But I disagree with the implication that explaining things is a bad thing. Don't you ever wonder what magic, in JKR's world, /is/? How exactly it works? Why can some people use it and not others? I suppose it's a matter of opinion and that some would say knowing the details takes away the magic (terrible, terrible pun intended) of things, but for me I find it more interesting. And when it comes to writing, sometimes you need definition and explanation. JKR didn't write a story about magic; she wrote a story about teenagers and the fight of good vs evil which happened to involve magic. She could get away with not spelling out how magic worked because that wasn't the point of the story. In fanfic, we don't have to stick to that. Fanfic is about exploration and some people want to explore magic and how it works, and that includes its limits and restrictions.

Which ties in with the issue of tiring out. When it comes to using cores as a source of magic, it gives the implication that magic is a quantifiable energy, which means it's subject to the laws of conservation. You use it, you run out and need to recharge and more often than not that takes physical representation through getting tired and needing sleep. I suppose in other situations one could write them sitting in a chair and twiddling their thumbs until their recharge. Sleep is a quick way to pass time, and gives characters a chance to sit at the bedside of their friend/lover and fret over them, which, obviously, is very very important. /sarcasm

You could have endless sources of +energy+ magic, but that would make battle scenes drawn out because you could theoretically keep fighting as long as you can stay standing and shield from/dodge the enemy's spells. Introducing the potential for tiredness forces earlier time limits on these things, but also an extra component because if your enemy has a bigger/deeper/whatever core than you, you have to be smarter than them because otherwise you'll run out of energy before they do, and it usually suggests they have the ability to cast spells you can't.

On the light/dark topic: I actually dislike the entire idea of light and dark magic and despise the strict idea of dark=evil and light=good because it implies that good and evil are intrinsic forces of their own, rather than human definitions of individual actions. I mean, I doubt there's anyone who'll say the Lumos Charm is dark, but if I cast it and shine the light in your eyes until you go blind, it would be evil.

TBH, it's kind of difficult because JKR didn't actually do much do define how dark magic is different from light. We know the Unforgivables are evil, and by her definition therefore dark, but the reasons why are self-explanatory (and to be honest I have arguments against defining the Killing Curse as pure evil; it strikes me as a humane method of execution or euthanasia). Everything else, though, isn't actually defined. I mean, take a look at /Reducto/, which destroys things. Harry knows it in fourth year and teaches it to the DA in fifth, but we only ever see it used on objects. Given the damage it causes, it's safe to assume that if such a spell was used on humans it could cause extreme harm and maybe even death. Are we to define that as a dark spell then? If so, why on earth are fourth years learning it? Personally, I wouldn't. I don't think magic, in and of itself, should be defined as good/light or evil/dark any more than we would define a hammer or knife that way. To me, magic is a tool. It is neutral. Good and evil, or light and dark, are human matters.

The whole declaring thing, on the other hand, I kind of agree with you on; it's weird. As I said, I've only really seen it used in the Sacrifices Arc, where it sort of made sense because the author made magic a sentient entity and it used literal definitions of light and dark rather than light=good, dark=evil, though by human nature those ideals did occur within fic. It's an incredibly complex series and if you want to read a fic that deeply explores the nature of magic then give it a read. It is a massive AU though and has a Harry/Draco pairing.

**** Unforgivables and Patronus aside, you would have unlimited Transfiguration, unlimited Conjuration, no way to determine the maximum weight or time a wizard can levitate something, unlimited fire, lightning, etc. Well, as long as the wizard can speak and wave his wand, which I assume would be several hours. There might be better ways to deal with it than "mana points" / magical cores, but it's a pretty simple explanation that kind of makes sense.

**** One of the great failings of the HP series for many fans is the lack of romantic action for whichever characters or pairings they wanted to see. This is one of the big reasons that people like to read and write fanfiction, so it makes sense that much fanfiction focuses on relationships, sex, and romance. That being said, HP is the biggest fandom there is, so gen fics are certainly out there in considerable numbers, even if they are not always the most popular.

Dumbledore treats people like chess pieces, confident that his way is always best. He never actually grew out of the "For the Greater Good" phase. He is criminally negligent in how he runs Hogwarts. He uses a school full of children to house bait for Voldemort. Then he hides it behind a series of obstacles a group of eleven year olds is able to overcome (and announces to the entire school where this obstacle course containing multiple lethal hazards is). When a basilisk is let loose in the school, either a twelve year old girl figures out what's going on before he does or he purposefully allows it to run loose, knowing that it could kill students. He fails /utterly/ at protecting schoolkids. He employs a Death Eater without even bothering to verify their identity when he /knows/ Voldemort is active again.

The entire story is a tale of neglect, incompetence and abuse, much of which can be traced back to Dumbledore. The prophecy is not an excuse. Prophecies are subject to interpretation, and there's nothing in canon that suggests that every prophecy will always come true. Instead the actions Voldemort and Dumbledore take upon hearing the prophecy are what brings it to fruition.

The fact that everyone fawns all over him and treats him like he's infallible does not make him magical beardy Jesus. He is a deeply flawed man, albeit one with good intentions.

In the second book, Vernon put locks on the door and bars over the window. These things are /illegal/ to put on children's bedrooms because it is considered child endangerment, since they would be unable to escape the house in the event of a fire. Combining that with Petunia threatening Harry with a frying pan, the parents condoning Dudley's physical bullying, Vernon verbally abusing Harry, sending Harry to his room without supper (aka withholding meals) and forcing Harry to do unreasonable amounts of labor and you've got a pretty strong child abuse and child endangerment case. Police should have gotten involved.

I know it's been a month since you made this thread, but I feel like you really need to know this.

  Nobody noticing or reporting the Dursley's maltreatment of Harry.
#+end_quote

Nobody noticed or reported it because they were, like a lot of real people, very very very image-focused and good at hiding it.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore sending Hagrid, the Groundskeeper, to bring Harry to Diagon Alley instead of McGonagal or another professor, who then mentioned multiple times how Dumbledore is a 'great man' and how Slytherin is evil.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore sent Hagrid, someone he trusts completely, to bring Harry to Diagon Alley. Hagrid, whom he trusted to bring Harry to the Dursleys. He's not just "the Groundskeeper" which is one of the many messages Rowling was trying to send in those books. Just because he's "the Groundskeeper", that doesn't mean he's stupid or untrustworthy.

#+begin_quote
  The first person Harry meets on the train is Ron Weasley, who also states how all Slytherin's are evil.
#+end_quote

What's that got to do with Dumbledore? He only talks to him because he saw him on the platform. And notice he didn't say all Slytherins were evil, he said that all Dark wizards were Slytherins. BIG difference.

#+begin_quote
  The only reason Harry isn't sorted into Slytherin is because he met Hagrid/Weasley who told him that Slytherin's are bad.
#+end_quote

And because he met Draco Malfoy, who confirmed it to him with the whole "Some wizarding families are better than others, Potter" speech. Who'd want to have anything to do with him?

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledoring employing a staff member that was being possessed by Voldemort and storing a priceless magical artefact behind protections that three 11 year olds could beat.
#+end_quote

How do you know he could tell he was being possessed by Voldemort? What part of Dumbledore's plan was aided by Voldemort being at the school? As Hermione said in the book "Most wizards don't have an ounce of logic", so Severus puzzle (and Minerva's) would have confused them. Harry got that key because he is one of the greater fliers in over a hundred years. The troll was already knocked out. And Dumbledore's final challenge was entirely successful.

#+begin_quote
  In 50 years, nobody thought that Slytherin's monster could be a Basilisk even when it's quite obvious considering the clues, and then a 12 year old figures it out in a few months.
#+end_quote

What was obvious about it? People were being petrified. That's really the only clue. Only after having discovered the spiders did they work it out, and even then only after having worked out it must be using the pipes because Harry could hear the parseltongue. Nobody else was aware of all those things.

#+begin_quote
  Sirius Black never getting a trial and being sent to Azkaban. Being Harry's godfather, he would have gotten custody of him instead of the Dursleys.
#+end_quote

They were at war. People get sent to internment/PoW camps (which is quite obviously what Azkaban is - I doubt it's the only prison Wizarding Britain has ever had, it just because they were very, very recently at war that they used it) in war.

Also, this has nothing to do with Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore never giving Harry any special training to help him fight Death Eaters/Voldemort/Destroy Horcruxes.
#+end_quote

Did you even read the 6th book? What do think that was, mental masturbation? What was it if not 'special training to help him fight Voldemort/destroy horcruxes"?

Dumbledore realised (since the end of the 4th book) that Harry didn't need to know any particularly special magic to defeat Voldemort. He had the protection of his mother's blood, and of Voldemort taking that blood into himself.

**** I don't think he was saying the concerns had no possible answers or reasons other than "Dumbledore is bad", just that the actions are questionable. Fanfictions are derivative works and can deviate from the source material in any number of ways, as the author chooses. I've seen a ton of people explaining to you the rationale behind these ideas and only arguments from you in response. It's as if you want to get rid of daylight savings time by arguing with someone who gives you the time when you ask for it. DST exists. These fanfic tropes exist. Whether they make good writing is another matter entirely.

But why ask a question if you'll only argue with the answer? It wasn't asked in a such a way that invited debate, but one that conveyed curiosity. Were you curious or did you want to post a rant with a question mark at the end?

**** Azkaban is not for POW's. Hagrid was sent there for a while in the second book because of the petrifications. Azkaban is the wizard prison.

** Tropes Are Not Bad, but many of these things are clichés, which /are/ Bad.

Some of it can be half-acceptable if it's a clear Alternative Universe from the very start because in that case the author is building on fanon rather than canon, but it is a major, and usually terminal, turnoff when you have a story which is based off a canonical starting point and suddenly starts throwing around all these cliches
