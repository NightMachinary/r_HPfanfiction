Because Harry/pretty quidditch girl is essentially the canon pairing, and Katie is a blank slate beyond that, so it's basically a clone pairing or Harry/OC.

If you think about it pairings like Daphne or Susan play off established fanon archetypes, so Katie would likely be much more popular if she had been favoured by very early fanfics establishing her character in the headcanon of the fandom.

***** I partly agree. They do have some history and we get a small impression of what type of person she is.

**** Yeah, that's the issue I ran into when outlining my story ideas. Katie can be written as a friend without much challenge, but making her the love interest seems kinda bland since that's basically what canon did with Ginny. It turns into the whole "sport girl" tropes, especially when they begin to date once Harry becomes Captain of the team. At the same time, forgoing Quidditch takes away everything we know about the character.

*** I love the idea of Harry/Katie together and have been trying to find a decent story for years now to read. I'm also trying to write one, so we'll see how that goes -shrug-

** Lol why is Katie everyone's go-to love interest? Even the OC I have in mind ends up with Katie in the end. Did Rowling just put her there in case someone wants to write a fanfic or something?

*** ? The number of Katie/Harry fanfics is incredibly low compared to almost any oher pairing.

She was put in so the Hogwarts houses don't feel so empty. Peripherally connecting her to Harry through Quidditch adds enough dimension to raise her beyond generic student. Or rather as example of just that.
