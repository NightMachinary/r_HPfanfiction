I really like the idea of being a transfiguration master. Curse breaking sounds awesome, too...


** Charms seems to be the most versatile and powerful option, from mundane applications (which let's be real would be 99% of the spells cast by the average wizard) to battlefield uses, from Protego to Patronus it's all charms, a couple super high level transfigurations from Dumbledore look pretty marginal compared to all the charms he pulls out of his ass. Plus what are curses? Do they count as their own category or are they charms/transfigs depending on the effect?

Plus creating effects seems just more satisfying than changing one thing into another, especially because it does feel like all transfiguration does comes with a timer. Kinda wouldn't make sense not to just conjure and change everything instead of making it otherwise.

** The Dark Arts because why not? I've wanted to read Secrets of the Darkest Art for a long time. Magic that deals with the mind has always interested me, too. Obliviation, confunding, occlumency, legilimency, and the Imperius curse would be specialties of mine.

** Divination/Canon Arithmancy. Sit back and make a prophecy (or do some divining, if there's more techniques beyond the basic bitch version we got in canon), learn everything you can about things relating to that prophecy/divined thing, piece it together and analyse it, and become an information broker. Especially so if more of the IRL divination methods actually work in magical terms. There are some really fun-sounding 'mancy's out there.

** I'm a professional translator in real life so likely something to do with Runes.

â€‹

Sure, canon treats it as just a language, but if we follow fanon and the idea of old magic and the like runes seem to be insanely versatile and (in the right hands) just as dangerous as a wand. I've seen runes hidden be used to trap people, slowly drain them, lay curses, etc.

The thing I find really cool about the idea of runes is the idea that they can lay dormant until the right conditions apply, kinda like programming. If you are to transfigure or cast a charm you kinda need to be there, I guess. What's stopping you from writing a complex series of runes at your doorstep and if someone unwelcome tries to enter blow them the fuck on? (as an aside there's evidence such spellwork exists in Harry Potter - see dust Dumbledore in Deathly Hallows), magic that you can just set up once and forget about it for ages afterwards.

*** I always found JK's comments that runes is only a language strange. I mean, she named one of the textbooks for it "/Spellman's/ Syllabary". I suppose that could just refer to the surname of the author, but she's usually a bit more on the nose with her naming conventions. Y'know?

Honestly, the one screenshot of the book on the wiki shows glyphs like you'd find in the Necronomicon or the Lesser Key of Soloman. So that doesn't help.

** Personally I would have to go with the Mind Arts and Transfiguration - though you could make the argument that Mind Arts are an extension of Transfiguration since it's just changing people's minds, including your own. To be able to turn anything into anything else would be unbelievably handy. You could walk into a forest and make a house out of trees, turn grass and wood into food, etc. You wouldn't need to be dependent on anyone for anything. I would have to learn a few good charms as well, for heating and cooling and such.

I would go with Mind Arts and Charms if I was going to stay as a part of society and not just go off to live a happy peaceful life on a mountain somewhere, and go heavy into duelling and security. Other Witches and Wizards would be your most imminient threat, even if you choose to live peacefully, so I'd have to prepare for that. Probably with some runes and Warding thrown in.

** Enchanting and inventing magical items. It's something where you can spend a lot of time in a workshop tinkering around, and when you have something useful you can make a lot of it assembly line style and make a lot of money. Once you have a decent business model you can hire more people, invent more awesome things and make more money.

And there's a lot that can be done with some small additions to muggle tech. For example, see if there's a way to create a magic calculator that runs on completely different principles than a digital computer and might be able to run some algorithms much faster. Could make a ton of money if there's a way to magically solve the math for crypto mining. $$$.

Robotics and automation are very interesting topics, if I could figure out how to enchant something to do a simple task repeatedly that could cut a lot of costs. $$$.

Maybe see how much you can modify and improve a remote controlled drone. A swarm of invisible eyes in the sky might have useful applications. Possibly even competing with owls on the package delivery market, more speed and significantly less upkeep. Low cost, scalable package delivery plus online ordering = magic Amazon. $$$.

Or magic spaceships. Violating conservation of momentum is easy, turn that into some method that can provide decent constant acceleration, that's enough to fly around the solar system. Tourism opportunities, and NASA says there's gold in some asteroids, that might be worth to check out. $$$.

Astronomy is a big deal in the magical world, so let's take the most absurdly oversized hypothetical muggle design for a space telescope, get rid of every expensive technology that can be replaced by simple magic, and build it. Add all the additional enchantments used on smaller magical telescopes and it should get pretty decent pictures. $ and PR.

Assuming I'm not stuck in a war I'd try to build things that can earn money to do more cool things to earn more money. Everything perfectly legal of course, dark stuff is just more trouble than it's worth. Why use human sacrifice to slightly improve spellcasting ability when you could just create a magitech startup and hire people to do the spellcasting for you?

** Dunno if it's a seperate art or just a fanon but definitely wand less magic. I mean everybody gangsta until expillarmus ðŸ˜….

With wand less magic, I'll dabble in thought projections (clone, wordless magic), all thing potions can do but without using potions (gotta be some spell, or one can always be invented) and healing (and by extension passive shields - kinda like shield cloak but stronger and maybe like a double skin instead of cloth)
