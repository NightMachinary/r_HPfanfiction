I decided to finally write a serious fic, but since it's my first one, I decided to start easy with a short fem!harry story. Problem is, finding Harry a girl name isn't really easy since there's no real female versions of Harry and names like Harriet just sound plain bad. Also, I'm looking for a believable name for an actual female version of Harry, not a Victoria, or Addison, or even worse a Charlotte. I've considered Rose and Poppy because it makes a bit of sense that Lily decided to keep the flower name tradition, but I still find it a bit OC sounding. Any ideas?

Edit: After some hard thought between Heather and Rose, I finally decided for Rose. For me they make the same amount of sense, and Rose just sounds more natural to me. I've seen the name on a couple pics now, so no points for originality, but it's the one that I think makes sense while sounding fairly decent.


** I think you should start your story off with some meta fanfic tension right away.

Name her Pansy Potter.

** I tend to like â€˜H' names, and if it's a girl I think James would want a flower name like Lily's and assume Lily would also like that, so I like Holly, Heather, Hebe, Hellebore (maybe just Helle?), Hyacinth (might be a bit much. I feel like Petunia might use it lmao), hepatica...

anyway I generally go with Holly lmao

*** I Like Heather. It has the 'H' and still sticks to the flower trend. I might go with it or with Rose I'm still not quite sure. I don't think the H is a great deal in this case though, since it's not very Harry like. These are the best ones so far I'd say, Holly just doesn't feel right for me

**** all good! I love Heather too! I'll probably end up with a Heather story before long, knowing me.

Rose is also a strong name and totally believable

Truthfully, you're not going to make everyone happy. Pick one you like (that isn't too "extra") and just go with it.

*** Yeah. I also did some research (Including your post I think?) and came across the 'rose' name, but nothing else really caught my eye, so I decided to make my own and see if someone else had a good one

** Holly.

Holly is a flowering plant, Harry's wand is made of Holly, and it's very close to Harry in appearance and cadence.

*** Oh that's a surprising bit of information. It does make the name seem more appealing but the Potters didn't really have way of knowing so it would be more of a coincidence

** Heather was one of the most popular birth names in 1980. You could also go Mary is sound is more important to you.

Rose Potter is a really common for both fem Harry and little sister in WBWL stories.

**** Well, in that case, I'd suggest you look at some of the most popular names by year and country on the /Behind the Name/ site. Although the UK records don't go back to 1980, you may be more likely to find a name that you like there, since it seems like you haven't really liked any of the common ones.

** Honestly, I'd just use Harry. Super cute girl name and besides, assigning strict genders to names is sooo outdated!

EDIT: However, I've seen Jasmine, Harley, and Helena and thought they worked well :)
