Snape is found dead one morning at Hogwarts and the Ministry sends a team to find the culprit. However, it is soon found that everyone from Harry, the twins, Hagrid and Mcgonagall had means and motive to do so. That very morning he had humiliated Roger Davies in front of the whole school, belittled Filch's cat, suspended the Quidditch season, distressed a patient of Pomfrey and messed up with Sprout's mandrakes. Aurors have a complex case in their hands, as even people as Sinistra and Vector land on the suspect list, and long time allies such as Draco had been seen arguing badly with the dead teacher recently.


** Murder Victim: Severus Snape (now deceased)

Suspect 1:

Harry Potter was the first suspect the Aurors questioned. The-boy-who-lived was very quick to ask to testify under Veritaserum. Which was good, everyone in the Minister's camp and all the old families were pushing for Veritaserum.

Potter confessed to a lot of other things, but he was clean in this case. Turns out he was having problems with headaches and focusing, so Dumbledore had him learn Occlumency from Snape. Thus, the detentions.

Minister saw the-boy-who-lived as a victim of trauma, after everything he had been through, with Black first then the tournament (Fudge still denying Voldemort's return). He saw a chance to gain public favour by helping the young man. Fudge would be seen as a kind and helpful leader, and he might also be able to gain Harry's favour, after he stops sprouting lies about You-know-who.

Harry Potter was offered tution from some of the best Unspeakables, for Occlumency lesson.

Suspect 2:

Sirius Black was the prime suspect in most of the crimes committed since two years. Being a loyal follower of the Dark lord, it was thought Black murdered Snape for turning a traitor. Black's rivalry with Snape during Hogwarts' years was also well documented. And finally, Snape had almost captured Black months after he escaped.

The biggest factor against Black being the killer was he hadn't been sighted in Britain for over a year. Latest rumor according to Kingsley was Black being in Tibet. That followed by Dumbledore's assurance of having added wards against Black, it was hard to argue with the Headmaster.

Suspect 3:

The Weasley twins had just played a prank on Slytherins, or so Snape said before assigning detentions without proof. And the rumor was that the twins always retaliated. Nobody had seen the twins around the time of murder.

However, the twins confessed to having to sneaked to Hogsmeade with a pair of Griffindor girls. The story was verified and twins assigned a ton of detentions.

There were over fifty suspects.

Ron Weasley: "Snogging with Lavender" was his alibi.

Hermione Granger: Her presence in Library was confirmed by a dozen Ravenclaws and Madam Pince.

Rubes Hagrid: His alibi was him being on a romantic sight-seeing with Beauxbatons' Headmistress. Everyone wanted to take a forgetfulness potion after that.

Minevra McGonagall: Rumor that stern Deputy had lost it after Snape gave detentions to twins without proof, and finished him. Later it was found the Deputy was getting pissed with Professor Sprout at the Hog's Head.

Horace Slughorn: The previous potion's teacher might have killed Snape to come back to Hogwarts, but no-one had seen or heard from Slughorn for more than ten years, not even the members of the Slug Club.

Surprisingly among the accused were a vast number of Hufflepuffs and Draco Malfo no one had any idea why.

Even after a month, the investigation yielded nothing. Life went on. Life waits for no one.

At Hogwarts, Dumbledore himself decided to teach Potions for the rest of the year. Most of the students were happy to be rid of Snape.

But none was happier than Lisa Smith. A Muggleborn, pretending to be a pureblood, Slytherin. Lisa was giddy with excitement. Outwardly she remained the same, calm collected, and curious.

Molly Smith was a Muggleborn witch sorted in Hufflepuff in 1982. Exposed to magic recently after the-boy-who-lived vanquished the dark lord, she learned of the little hero. She also learned about many Aurors who fought with everything they had against Death Eaters, complete Ministry propaganda. She dreamed of being an Auror.

She worked hard, got into NEWT for transfiguration, DADA and charms. But Snape didn't accept her lowly EE in his Sixth year. Molly was crushed. Her dreams were over. Two years, she endured. But after her seventh year, she decided to return to Muggle world. Molly gave up magic and swore to never touch a wand.

Molly had a little sister, born two days after the-boy-who-lived, whom she loved very much. After finding about being a witch, she started reading about the wizarding world with her sister very much. Molly told her sister about the wonderful place called Hogwarts'. She told her sister about being a magical protector. But after her dream was crushed, Molly did not utter a single word about magic.

Lisa grew up with stories about Magic, the-boy-who-lived, and Hogwarts. But one day those stories stopped. Since that day Lisa saw Molly losing her love of magic. And after two years, Molly gave up magic altogether. It took some time for Lisa to learn reason behind Molly's change. Since then she hated Snape.

With the help of Molly's stuffs, Lisa learned about the Wizarding world. After a few visits to the Alley, sneaking when alone, she understood pretending to be a pureblood would be better to survive the new world, and she started to pretend. Related to Pureblood Smiths, that's what Lisa decided, a branch long separated that lived in France till now.

After receiving her own letter, Lisa went to Hogwarts, and was sorted in Slytherin.

"Pureblood" Lisa answered to Malfoy, to which he nodded. That was that. Now she was a somewhat average Slytherin. Slightly better with theory but average overall, that was what everyone saw in her.

But in reality, Lisa was as studious as the most avid 'claw. She learned everything she could. She had an ambition. To get revenge for Molly.

What would be a better way to kill a Potions Master and spy than to poison him. Lisa decided on this in her third year. Her preparation started.

Lisa had finished with the plan. A three step plan. Requiring three ingredients:

A tiny piece of copper, enchanted with heating charm. It was also enchanted to stick on a person's stomach. A piece small enough for the person to not feel it. She slipped the copper piece a week and half ago. She asked a Hogwarts' elf to add the piece when the Twins tried to have them sneak something to Snape. That's how twins became unknowing accomplice, when they sneaked him a potion to change his hair colour.

Fumes of smoke of a magical eggshell. The eggshell was an ingredient in this year's potion. Causing a few accidents with her own and a tripping Longbottom, Snape was high on those fumes. The fumes, were very powerful fumes, which when heated rapidly, would paralyze a wizard instantly.

The Pepper-up potion was supposed to be ingested by victim himself. The potion was needed because the copper piece would start to work when in contact with it.

A month after fifth-year started, Lisa supplied Snape with the copper piece. For a week straight, Snape inhaled fumes of eggshells. And four days ago, Snape drank Pepper-up potion. He drank poison, unknowing.

A minute or two after drinking the potion, the heating charm started to heat the fumes, still in his body. Three minutes after drinking Snape was paralyzed. His body was completely unmoving. Snape could still see, feel and think things. He had deduced about the eggshells, but wondered how his body was heating rapidly. He knew what to do to save himself, only he couldn't. The charm continued to heat his body. Well there was a limit till Snape could hold consciousness. He was in despair. Lisa hoped he felt the same despair and devastation Molly felt.

Soon, Snape was nothing but a corpse. Losing its soul, the body no longer remained magical, so the potion stopped working. A few hours later, the enchantments on the copper piece vanished. Lisa wasn't a powerful witch capable of permanent enchantment. And nobody bated an eye when a very small copper piece was found on potion master's gut. Lisa was never a suspect, not even a single rumor. And she got what she deserved. Revenge for Molly. Maybe now she will gain a new interest in magic. Lisa could only hope.

In the end the truth is that she didn't die, she was abducted to the DoM to be experimented on to find out if she is or not a new breed of magical toad, she stayed there for the last thirty years of her life in almost constant pain being subjected to unspeakable experiments. And everyone lived happily ever after, the end.

** The end:

​

The residents of Hogwarts were all gathered in the Great Hall, students, teachers and ghosts all. At the front stood Amelia Bones, alone.

​

"I have, I believe, solved the crime. Or at least... I believe I have managed to narrow it down to two possibilities.

​

The first: he-who-must-not-be-named, either alone or with a group of followers, snuck in via a secret passage, killed the late professor and snuck out by the same exit."

​

Dumbledore piped in at this point. "That's ridiculous, how could they possibly sneak around without anybody-"

​

Amelia Bones held up a hand to silence him. "Hold off on that, for the moment please. I want you to hear the other possibility before you dismiss this one out of hand.

​

For the second possibility, you have only to look at the facts: namely that he was cursed thousands of times by such a varied number of curses that we may never know which one dealt the final blow, and that despite every single one of you having a motive, you were all given alibis for the time of the murder from random people who you'd normally have no contact with. I can only assume from this that the murderer was not One, or even Many of you, but Every Single One of you here. You all cursed him at the same time so that even under veritiserum you would not be able to determine who dealt the killing blow, so you could truthfully say you had no idea who killed him."

​

The silence in the hall was deafening.

​

Amelia Bones took off her monacle and cleaned it with a handkerchief. "Now, I rather think the first outcome is more likely, don't you?"

​

The entire hall nodded almost in unison.

​

"Off the record on a personal note, that bastard deserved everything he got for what he did to my brother."

***** But once they knew about the Horcruxes they didn't actual need such a complicated plan and Snape nor Dumbledore were essential for it.

I mean the magical world has to have some good Aurors, that are able to do some detective work. I mean all the locations were more or less easy to figure out once you digged a little bit into Voldemorts past.

We had the dairy and an example of Voldemort trusting them to one of his loyal followers, there would be maybe a bit more hit and miss, but more competent people were on it, that just 3 teenagers, that had to pock in the dark for hints.

The ring and the locket were hidden at places important to Tom from his childhood and Harry knew about his name and had enough information that you should be able to find out the rest.

The diadem would be tricky, but Harry already knew that Voldemort cursed the DaDA post? If not it would be nice if Dumbledore left behind all the info he has on Voldemort in some way. But Harry definitely knows that Hogwarts was important to him and I mean it was more or less luck and Harry's connection and gut feeling that they found that one.

Nagini is an easy assumption.

So the only one left would be Harry and there are tons of ways for that info to reach him later, my favorite one is that Dumbledore planned to show up with the resurrection stone after they dealt with the other once. I mean that is definitely the end, right...

And when it comes to destroying the things without the sword, they could have some competent like Kingsley or some trained cursebreaker with them, some probably knows how to destroy stuff like that and if all else fail, they know were a basilisc with a whole jaw of teeth lay around and maybe someone older and thinking more straight would have thought about getting some before leaving Hogwarts after Dumbledore's death and McG in charge...

​

Quite frankly, that the whole plan hinged on Snape so much, was probably the worst kind of plan.... Now the students at Hogwarts in the last book would have an harder time, but there is no reason that Voldemort has to win without Snape.

And if it comes to getting to know their plans, you just have to be a bit more scrupleless. You have torture spells, Veritaserum (and I'm sure Snape is not the only one able to make it for the good guys), legitimacy, love potions ( I mean give an death eater some of that stuff and they will probably tell you everything they know), oblivate, Imperio, animagus, and so many more things, be creative!

Dumbledore's need to keep everything secretive was his biggest flaw

****** I will never understand why people refuse to accept Snape helped. I get why people don't like him. He is a sour person and if you love the mauraders you justify their bullying and hate of Snape.

So I totally understand the hate. But why not at least admit he helped.

He knew all about the dark lord and could give valuable information to DD. That's valuable man. Take the seven potters trick. Knowing the attack would happen right then was helpful.

How about when Harry was stuck with umbridge and have Snape a one sentence code that the ministry of magic was being broken into and Snape deliverers the message?

What about Snape deliberating the sword to Harry to help desires horcruxes? What about Snape killing DD so a kids souls isn't destroyed?

Snape making potions for Lupin and other order members?

Not everything Snape did can be in the books, but I think we can intelligently assume that having a spy so close to the dark lord was super dangerous but super valuable.

You mention how easy and elementary it was to figure out the horcuxes, almost like you didn't read the books.

That brand of dark magic was long forgotten and very rare. We knew all about it because DD took the time to explain it to Harry, but most people had never even heard of it, let alone how to create and destroy them.

******* I didn't say he didn't help, I just say he doesn't have to be this lynchpin people make him out to be. He can be replaced, everybody, but Harry can be replaced, and even he could, if the right people just had the necessary information...

And sure the seven Potter trick was neat, but it was Dumbledore's idea and could be done in other ways, never mind that they attacked at that moment because Snape told Voldemort about it, to make him seem more trustworth.

And the message about break into the minstery... Did he inform the order by turtle express instead of owl or any other way? Because those kids flew from Scottland to London on testrals for what most be hours and the Order arrive long past them...

And I talked about the sword, nice to have, but not necessary because there are other ways. And sure he saved the soul of a kid that was willing to hurt and kill people around him and gave him another chance and that is good, but not strickly necessary to bring down Voldemort. Because they knew wher to get basilisc fangs that they knew destroys horcruxes

And I gave example how the order could work without Snape, he is nice to have, but not of that much importance. The only reason he is as important as he is, is because in the books Dumbledore decides to go with the most complicated plan imaginable. I'm always shocked how much dumb luck was need in this plan, made by meant to be intelligent characters... Those characters are supposted to be clever, but many don't act it

Snape was literally super close to the dark lord, by the end he was probably his most trusted lieutenant. The dark lord was famously selfish, yet he liked Snape enough to teach him the power to fly.

********* I just say that the idea without Snape a victory was inthinkable is just not true... He made things easier and there would be probably more people lost without him, but it would have been doable. All the pieces of info was out there and none of the game chaging ones were brought to the light side by Snape. We didn't learn about horcrux, how many, or how to destroy it from Snape and the only location of a horcrux he gave, was the one in Harry, but that info he got from Dumbledore and didn't recover it himself.

I never said he did nothing or that he was 'easily' replacable. I say he was replacable, how easy or ruff is another discussion and hinched on for one how Dumbledore changes his plans without Snape and shares information with others and what kind of infomation Snape passed on that we don't know about. Because sure you could claim he saved the world three times over, but we just never heared about it, I could claim that is rubbish and we don't have any hints for things happen at that level, but we would run in circles here.

It only happened the way it did because Rowling wanted to "redeem" Snape and did a shit job of it.

*********** I mean I know we read a youth novel and the idea is that we watch kids and teenagers be the heroes, but it never felt so obvious and sloppy to have the adults and arguably more competent people pushed to the sidelines...

I mean I can believe that people didn't believe the kids about the stone being in danger and decide to maybe wait for Dumbledore to deal with things when he returns (even if looking back at the book, the whole idea that he rode a broom to the ministry when later we learn about floo and apperation...)

I can believe that Harry was in a unique position to recognize the danger of the basilisc, because he can hear it

Third year doesn't need too much handwaving, because Harry and Co react to what adults do

Similar with 4th year and 5th year. Harry has to react and deal with what Voldemort throws at him.

6th year, yeah it is maybe about time that Dumbledore explains a couple of things to Harry and it is stupid that nobody believes Harry about Draco and even if you start to think why there are not more use out of all those competent people around them, it is still ok, because Dumbledore is in charge...

But the whole plan for the 7th books seems to be how can we stumble over the right things with luck and minimal hints, while not using all the resources their allies could offer... I mean they even are at Billy's house at one point, a curse breaker, whose job it is to break curses and if necessary destroy dangerous artefects and to recognize and search for them and who works for the place they know they next target is... And they do nothing with it...
