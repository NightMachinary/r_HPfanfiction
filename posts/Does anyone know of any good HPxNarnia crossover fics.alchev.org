Whilst reading a story, the author described a wardrobe in great detail (and for no apparent reason).

Made me think of Narnia though, and so the above question bloomed into existence!

Prefer long fics and no slash


** 1 The Made-Up Things: The Muggle Princess of Narnia ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2423300]]) Once upon a time, there were four children. Their names were Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. And then only Susan was left, and she had two daughters. One was name Petunia, and the other was named Lily.

2 A Chance Meeting ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8351385/1/A-Chance-Meeting]])

The first day Susan Pevensie met Tom Riddle, she thanked Aslan for giving her the strength to ignore his advances... The second day she met him, she hoped that she would survive. The last day she met him, she hoped that he might have repented over his life.

3 The Little Prince ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7140785/1/The-Little-Prince]]) A woman's heartfelt prayer; a world in dire need; a Child of Fate to guide and guard; a King's generous love... and with the warmth of the Lion's breath, everything changed...

** So I got 3 out of 3 for you here.

Whydoyouneedtoknow wrote a series of 5 veeery long stories. It doesn't have slash. Anddd it technically crosses over with narnia (but only very subtle, not importantly, and only in the last book)
