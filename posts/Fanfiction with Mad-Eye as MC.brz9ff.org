Hello all, Do you know any stories where Mad-Eye is MC? He has always been my favourite character, I would love to hear how you see his origin stories & spells he is skilled in.

Auror training, First Wizarding War & important skills he has.

  Some things never change, no matter a past which no longer sleeps. This is a lesson Alastor Moody must learn first-hand.

** He is not MC exactly, but there is a lot of him in linkffn(12155794). It is Haphne superwarrior-Harry (which I don't like generally, neither of them), but this is rather decent one.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
