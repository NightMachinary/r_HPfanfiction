I am waiting for a fic where someone thinks they are being clever and says "Accio Trevor the toad!"

Cue Trevor flying towards them from further down the the train only to slam into a wall/door. Only thing is, the spells is still pulling on the poor toad. Something has to give and I'm afraid it's going to be that poor toad, smooshed or exploded.


** If that's how accio works, then how Did harry's broom make it to the Dragon task?

Harry summoned it from his bedroom - you can see it coming from way up in the sky during the movie i believe- so what it just went straight through Hogwarts walls? The brrom owuld be smashed against the wall and harry is Dragon Food.

And then why is it referred to as summoning when it really is just an attracting spell.

*** My thoughts are:

1. Harry knows where his broom is.

2. Harry likely left it somewhere he could summon it easily without it coming to harm.

**** Except for the fact that in OotP Fred and George summoned theirs undamaged and their brooms had been chained to a wall in the dungeons. Which means the brooms had to snap the chains on the wall without breaking and smash through either several walls or doors to get from the dungeons to Great Hall without getting damaged in and of themselves.

***** My head cannon - a well cast Accio will bring the object summoned whole and undamaged regardless of obstacles or distance. A poorly cast Accio won't bring the object the entire way, or at all. A horrifically miscast Accio will result in the object being summoned smashing itself into any and every obstacle even remotely between the object and the caster, doing irreparable damage to the object in question.

So maybe some 5th year is trying to show off, after having not cast anything all summer... resulting in a very traumatized Neville.
