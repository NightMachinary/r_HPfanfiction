Hey! So this is a story that I've always wanted to write, but I never get more than a couple of chapters in. Please tell me what you think! If you have any (constructive) criticisms, please let me know. :) I did write this a bit quickly.

-------

/I couldn't sleep. A hard cot, topped with a ratty old blanket was the only thing in the otherwise empty room. Moonlight shone through the metal bars near the top of the window, casting rays of dim light through the room. A high, deranged voice could be heard from upstairs./

/“That sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringrotts, how did you get it? Did you and your friends take it from my vault?”/

/“I didn't take anything. Please. I didn't take anything.”/

/“I don't believe it.”/

/Horrifying screams echoed through the expansive Malfoy Manor. Hermione Granger's shrill, panicked voice was all I could hear./

I woke with a start.

My hand went to chest, trying to calm the thundering of my heart. My bangs were sticking to my forehead, damp with sweat. It had been weeks since I'd the dream.

With shaking hands, I pulled back the blankets and swung my legs over the side. Walking over to the window, I pushed the curtain aside and peered at the street below. It was mid morning, and loads of witches and wizards were already doing their morning shopping. They walked to and fro, their bags in their hands as they peered into the windows of this shop or that one.

The start of a new school year was nearing, and there were many school aged children wandering around Diagon Alley as well. Some were old enough to do their shopping on their own; others were just starting and hadn't even purchased a wand.

I tilted my head to the side a bit, frowning. Part of me couldn't help but be jealous. I enjoyed school, but I'd been booted out of Beaxbatons after...

Swallowing the lump in my throat, I pushed the thought out of my mind. There was no use in being upset about it now. It was less than seven months until I turned seventeen. When I came of age, I could teach myself magic.

Until then, I'd continue renting this room from Tom and keep my head down. I didn't enjoy going out very often. People recognized me more often than not. After all, I looked exactly like her. And the name wasn't very common either.

A soft hoot echoed through the room, and just a second later a pair of talons landed gently on my shoulder. I turned my head to the side, peering at the barn owl. I'd found him just a few weeks ago, injured on the street. He was jet black, a real beauty.

“Good morning, Kingsley,” I said fondly, reaching up to pet him. I looked at his food bowl, which was nearly empty. “I suppose I'll have to get you some more food.”

After I'd found him, I had intended to treat his wounds and re-release him, but he had refused to go.

“Which means I'll also have to go to Gringotts to get some more money...”

Kingsley hooted then, as if in agreement.

“Alright, alright. I'm going.”

I opened the window, and Kingsley flew out.

I pulled a cloak over my shoulders and pocketed my coin pouch. I would have taken my wand, out of habit, but it'd been snapped when I'd been expelled. It'd been a hand-me-down anyway - the orphanage I'd lived in before didn't have the money to buy everyone new wands. There was no use buying a new one if I'd get arrested for using it.

“Time for a spot of breakfast, Charlotte?”

Tom, who was always always up earlier than I was no matter what time I rose, spoke cheerily from behind the bar.

“I'm alright. Thank you, Tom.”

He was one of the only shop keeps that didn't actively avoid me. On the contrary, he acted as if he didn't know who I was at all - which was the kindest thing that he could do. Many of the others would be polite enough, but avoided me as best they could.

When I stepped into he bright fall morning, I pulled the cloak's hood over my head and began the walk to Gringotts. I slipped through the crowd nearly unseen. If people recognized me - they'd whisper and point. It was best to be invisible.

While I was ascending the steps of Gringotts, a flash of blonde hair caught my eye. I turned my head, my breath caught in my throat as I searched the crowd for the familiar face. I hadn't seen him since that awful night at the Malfoy Manor.

He was my /family/, and I hadn't seen him. Sure, we'd exchanged letters but I suspected that he needed some time to heal.

Even if he didn't admit it.

It wasn't Draco, I realized, as I looked through the crowd. I shook my head and turned around again, continuing through the wide marble doors into the bank. I handed the key to the goblin at the front counter, and another goblin took me down to the family vault.

As I was the only one in the family left, it belonged to me.

I swept a small pile of gold into the pouch and returned it to my pocket. As I was leaving the bank, I nearly bumped into someone.

“Excuse me, I didn't mean-” I began, but was cut off with the cold glare I received in return.

“You should be locked up in Azkaban with the rest of them,” She snapped nastily.

The woman shouldered past me, and I stood on the steps of the bank, rather stunned. Sure, people usually whispered and pointed. But to have someone be so openly terrible to me took me aback. After the initial shock, anger flashed through me.

It wasn't my /fault/.

Not only did I not do anything illegal or hurt anybody, I didn't even want to be there. I had been forced to.

I slipped into Eeylops Owl Emporium, buying some more food for Kingsley. The shop keep was a friendly witch who treated me no differently than any other customer. Her and Tom were the only ones. She helped me nurse Kingsley back to health.

When I slipped back into The Leaky Cauldron, I spotted Tom cleaning off one of the tables in the middle of the bar.

“You got a visitor,” He said, looking up.

“A visitor?” I asked, confused. I had never had a visitor here, and I'd been here four months now.

“Indeed. I let her into your room.”

Rather nervously, I walked up the rickety steps to my second floor room.

I didn't really know anybody that would come visit me. Just weeks after the school year ended, I received a scathing letter from Beauxbaton that I was not welcome back. It might be someone from the orphanage, as I hadn't been back there in years, but I really doubted that.

I turned the handle and entered the room. There was indeed someone in the room.

At first, she had her back turned to me. She was wearing dark blue robes and her black hair was pulled into a severe bun.

The woman turned around, and I recognized her immediately.

“Charlotte Lestrange. I'm pleased to meet you.”

It was Minerva McGonagall.

** It's a really interesting premise and one I've not read before. You put in enough information to hint at the protagonist's background, while still leaving it enticingly vague. The only problem is the fact that it's too damn short! I'll be heartbroken if it's left like this. Please continue, because I'll definitely follow if you do.

** I really like this, even though I don't really know what's going on yet. I don't usually like first-person stories, but your prose is excellent, IMO. You should definitely keep writing. As for constructive criticism:

#+begin_quote
  I turned the handle and entered the room. There was indeed someone in the room.
#+end_quote

This line sounds a little awkward, IMO. Maybe just replace the second sentence with something else, like:

#+begin_quote
  I turned the handle and entered the room. A tall witch stood at the window, idly watching the children in the Alley as I had done this morning. At first, she had her back turned to me...
#+end_quote

*** I agree, that part stood out as different from the rest! Also typo here:

#+begin_quote
  It had been weeks since *I'd the* dream.
#+end_quote

Overall, it seems like it is a story line that doesn't have to conflict with canon (which are my fave fics), and also can examine some interesting ground about morality.What are our choices when we are under duress? How do we move on and prove ourselves? Who are we trying to convince, everyone else or ourselves?

Good luck, and keep writing!
