I'm trying to find a particular Ron fic where he looses his memories and it's permanent so he constantly forgets that he's married to Hermione and they have a kid (I think it's a daughter...). When I initially read it, it was 1 chapter, but maybe it's more.... Any help would be appreciated, thank you!
