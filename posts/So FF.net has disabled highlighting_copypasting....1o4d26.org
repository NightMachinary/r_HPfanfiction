It's driving me crazy, I can't read stories without highlighting them bits at a time, and I like being able to cut/paste. Are there any ways to get around this rule?

I don't think it's temporary.

Update: According to the latest news update from FF.net, they have "disabled the basic copy protection of story content within modern browsers. Currently it is enabled for all but authors will be able to disable/enable this feature in a coming update."

I'm realizing that I literally can't read without highlighting...


** [[http://benalman.com/code/test/jquery-run-code-bookmarklet/?name=FF.net+Copyfix&ver=1.3.2&code=%24%28%22div.storytext%22%29.removeClass%28%22nocopy%22%29%3B][Here you go.]]

Works in all browsers, just drag the green button into your bookmarks. Click it when you're on a ff.net site and copy/paste to your heart's content.

Edit: probably won't work on mobile browsers due to how they implement bookmarks, sorry mobile readers.

*** For mobile browsers (or all browsers really), just copy paste the line below into the addressbar after the page has completely loaded.

javascript:document.querySelectorAll('div.nocopy')[0].classList.remove('nocopy');

** I thought there was just something wrong with my browser! I hear you about the highlighting, I can't help but follow along by highlight parts of the text or just random sections for entertainment.

** If you use firefox, you can change this with your userContent.css file in your profile/chrome directory. userContent.css is an override file that tells firefox how to display webpages.

Add exactly this to your userContent.css file (or create a new file if it doesn't already exist):\\
* { -moz-user-select:text !important }\\
* { user-select: text !important }

user-select:text means that you can select any text. !important means that it won't be overwritten by whatever the webpage wants. Note that this is an override for ALL webpages that prevent you from selecting things, not just FF.net. You can make some changes to make it only apply to FF.net, but I can't imagine ever wanting a website to TELL ME what I'm allowed to browse, so /fuck that/.

Google Chrome and Internet Explorer can do similar with global user stylesheets, though I'm unfamiliar with the exact steps.

**** Hmm. There's a couple of things I could think that might fix it.

userContent.css is (oddly) case specific. So try checking capitalization.

Try making sure that userContent.css is in the correct folder. It shouldn't be in your ProgramFiles\Mozilla Firefox\Chrome directory, but instead in the <appdata>\roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles<jibberish letters>\chrome folder.

Lastly if those are correct, try manually typing the exact thing, in case reddit changed out some of the unicode characters or something.

Hopefully one of those will fix it for you.

This fixed it, I had it in the incorrect folder. Thanks!
