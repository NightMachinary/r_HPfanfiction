we see lots of Tom becomes a father to Harry but none where he is for Hermione


** The only ones like this I remember seeing are stories where it turns out she is actually his daughter - Cleotheo on fanfiction.net has several linkffn(Children of the Dark - Year 1) is the first of a 7 part series she also has linkffn(Goddess of Vengeance) which has a sequel among others. Some have Hermione being aware he's her father when the story begins, some have her finding out as a plot point. As far as I remember none of them show Dumbledore in a favorable light.

  It's time for Harry, Hermione and Draco to start school. But what happens when two of the golden trio aren't who they appear to be and are best friends with a Slytherin? Dark Hermione! Dark Harry! First in a seven part series.

  When Hermione Granger discovers she's really the daughter of The Dark Lord and that The Order of the Phoenix were behind her kidnapping as a baby and her parent's murders, she sets out to gain revenge against everyone who had wronged her. Dark Hermione!
