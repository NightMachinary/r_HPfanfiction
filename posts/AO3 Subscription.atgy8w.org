On AO3, I'm subbed to a story. Do I get emails when it updates like on ffnet? Because it updated recently and I didn't get a notififcation and only found out because I checked.

Edit: found the email.


** You should, normally. Have you checked the email in your profile?

*** Thanks. I did before posting this, but I realized I might have my AO3 account on a different email. I checked and saw I got it. Thanks

** It's also possible that the email would be tagged as spam and sent to that folder.

** Also; they had a problem recently where all the notification e-mails suddenly got caught up in my spam filter and I had to confirm that they were not spam.
