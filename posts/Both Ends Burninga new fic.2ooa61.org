Hey guys, I'm new to this forum. I'm writing my first hpff, after years and years of reading them....I admit I'm a bit lost, and I don't have a community, so I'm not really getting any feedback on my writing. I thought perhaps I might share it here and see what y'all have to say about it, since whilst perusing this subreddit I can tell that it takes fanfiction seriously.

Anyways it's Wolfstar (remus/sirius) slash. I'm planning for it to be novel-length, spanning their 7th year up until Halloween 1981. My main idea for the fic is to explore the effect of war on relationships, and the idea of responsibility. I'm drawing inspiration from my recent experience in a war, and in part this fanfic is somewhat therapeutic for me. That being said, it's only 2 chapters thus far, so it's a bit predictable at the moment.

Basically I'm really struggling I think with dialogue. I would appreciate any criticism; it would really help me out! (Also I'm looking for a beta so if anyone wants to take this one/can point me to a place to find one, that'd be grand)

(this fic has adult sexual themes and foul language)
