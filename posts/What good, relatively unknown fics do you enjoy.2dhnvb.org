By: The Carnivorous Muffin 

Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

She thought she was the only one, but then a letter comes and reveals to Alex a world she never knew existed. Will she become the hero so many believe her to be?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9843978/1/Let-Us-Cling-Together]] Author: UndoneRhapsody

Synopsis: SB fic H/Hr through a different means.

Although the start is rather poor, and there are various errors and grammar mistakes, this fic really kicked off when the 1st Task begun and hasn't looked back. Probably needs some endurance to get through to the good stuff, but that's not to say the beginning isn't bad. Just isn't as good quality as the later chapters.
