I'm looking for fics that use transfiguration as their weapon of choice.

I've used the search bar and I've seen Harry Mcgonagall HP and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi, What You Leave Behind by Newcomb, and The Golden Needle as stories that rely heavily rely on transfiguration. In addition to those fics I've also read linkffn(Child of Mercy by Fyrning), which started this whole thing.

The branch of magic has an amazing potential for dynamic action scenes and I'm surprised that some authors use the usual "gun fight" scenario.

So other than the fics mentioned, are there other stories that heavily use transfiguration in their arsenal/repertoire?


** This one has a Harry who is a natural at Transfiguration - also, probably a psychopath.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

However, as you already know, until there is more scientific research, then the only thing we know is that psychopaths are nature based, whereas sociopath is nurture based.

TL;DR: the science is bad, the pacing is awful, and the author is supremely arrogant.

Edit: and in response to OP: Transfiguration is not the main magic Harry uses; he most heavily relies on, in fact, the time-turner.

**** For time ellotted, it is not worth it. For example, if you are reading for pleasure and only have few hours each day to do so, that is NOT the story you want to read. Because of the structure, and the story style, it almost requires to be read in as little sessions as possible. If you pick it up, read for a few hours, then put it down, you will lose most of the small changes that occur during each chapter.

Also, the characterization in the work is wack.

***** It's a lot better if you think of it as a crack-fic and not a serious work. Also, if you have a few free hours every single day, you could finish HPMOR in just a few days, so there's that.

Eh, I know this sub hates HPMOR, but to me that's the fault of the author's arrogance, and I'm not one to keep up with what fanfic authors do outside of their stories. It's not the world's greatest, but I see worse stuff recced here that doesn't get ragged on near as much.

**** Its "science" is wrong, its characters are badly written and pacing is downright horrible. Its premise is great and on the first look, the fic is great. But when you look into it more, it doesn't hold together. It's the ReCore of fanfics.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** Linkao3(1049966) - I figured I would add in this one even though it doesn't exactly meet your request. It's not the protagonist that's the transfiguration expert, it's Draco. There also aren't fight scenes, but how Harry's newfound potions interest combines with Draco's transfiguration is incredibly interesting and ingenious.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.
