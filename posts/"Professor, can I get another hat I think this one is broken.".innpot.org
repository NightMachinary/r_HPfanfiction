******* Personally, I like this sort of correction. If someone is using the wrong their/they're/there, they probably know the difference if they really thought about it, but often uncommon words that are used verbally more than in writing, I don't think the author is always aware of their mistake. I know I often google things like that just to make sure I'm using/spelling similarly uncommon words/phrases properly.

***** Fair. I just can't jive with Dumbledore and the entire DoM not figuring out a way to track down horcruxes.

******* I never got the impression knowledge of horcruxes was widespread enough for any real research to be done on the topic. If only a couple dozen people know about them and essentially all of them view it as some of the darkest, most vile magic imaginable then who is doing research on it?

Dumbledore is a genius (or supposed to be, according to the narrative) but he is still just one man, and a man with many other responsibilities and duties. Maybe he doesn't have the time to delve deeply into their creation and specifics. Maybe to do so properly he would have to create one himself and he is unwilling. Perhaps he did not consider that Tom had made horcruxes until much later. There's plenty of potential reasons why Dumbledore couldn't or wouldn't find a method of tracking them down.

Personally speaking though, I would have a tough time believing that neither Dumbledore nor the Department of Mysteries could figure out a method of tracking down incredibly dark and unique objects like horcruxes when they have knowledge of what they are, how they were created, and by who.

********* I always thought Voldemort's best weapons were his tactical lethality and the mistakes of his enemies, personally.

He's an incredibly unstable megalomaniac who's lost most of his charisma and continually relies on the dregs of society to prop himself up. I honestly wish more fan fics would just dispense with him and introduce a new villain. Trying to twist canon to make him more intimidating or compelling is very tiresome to read after the twentieth or thirtieth time.

  Also, you'd think that Dumbledore, a genius himself, would have found some way of doing it ever since becoming aware of Tom delving into that art.
#+end_quote

Ah, yes, the "if it was possible, then the great and infallible Dumbledore would've found a way" excuse.

That's a bad argument to make. Remember when a sixteen year old teenager managed to smuggle several Death Eaters into Hogwarts, bypassing all of Dumbledore's "protections", something which he believed impossible?

#+begin_quote
  And remember, if Voldemort has spies within the research team or anywhere nearby, and they inform him of the tracking spell being created, he'll very likely just counteract it anyway.
#+end_quote

That's no reason to stop trying altogether. Not to mention, there are Vows and Oaths to counteract betrayal.

*** Alternatively: the point where the Ministry abducts a first year Hogwarts students to experiment illegally on him in the Department of Mysteries, thereby also endangering every plan to defeat Voldemort, is the point where Dumbledore finally says fuck it and overthrows the Ministry.

And given his promise to protect Lily's son, Snape at least will back him in it. Lupin would for the sake of James' memory, and the moment Sirius hears what happened he'll break out to join in. I can't imagine McGonnagle taking any more kindly to the abduction and torture of a student either.
