I just noticed this reread, the potion isn't a one off you take the day before a full moon, you have to take it every day for a week. He should have had most of the effects already, if it worked that way.

Other notes, it has to be drunk fresh so you can't mass produce it in its current form as in fanfiction. (Unless maybe you made big vats of it and arranged for all the werewolves to come drink it every night they need to at a specified time)

But beyond that. What happens at the end of PoA if he's got the wolfsbane effect at the end of PoA?

Possibilities: Wolfsbane just kinda knocks you out. This seems most probable based off of the name and the description of Lupin just curling into a ball and sleeping it off the night of his transformation on the potion.

Wolfsbane let's you entirely keep your faculties. So maybe Lupin has a special pen so he can grade papers while wolfy. I like this mental image but it seems less likely.

In case 1, Pettigrew might still escape. Lupin was the one keeping closest watch on him, the dementors are nearby and might be able to distract Sirius quite a bit, and Harry and Hermione just aren't used to dealing with a rat animagus or really, competent adult wizards. Snape and Lupin both have to be protected to some degree and Snape is still a serious liability if he wakes up so that has to be watched out for too. It's common fanon, at least, that werewolves are very resistant to magic so the mobilicorpus technique might not be so effective for transporting Lupin. (If the magic resistance is canon it's not in book 3)

In case 2, Lupin is probably able to catch Peter pretty easily in rat form. Whether Peter can survive it is another story. With only a dead Peter the hilariously corrupt ministry still kills Sirius if they catch him. Barry Jr. could still escape.

It's very easy to keep the story on its rails without making Lupin forget his potion. :/


** There's no reason to think an incomplete course of treatment would do any good. Even in the real world, drugs don't necessarily work like that. An incomplete course of antibiotics doesn't cure the infection, it just makes it come back worse.

*** It's true, but you could easily write a fanfiction where Lupin had already taken the final dose.

The events in canon are: Lupin sees Wormtail on the map, runs to the shack. Snape brings the potion, sees Lupin has already left, sees the map, then also runs to the shack.

What if you changed it so Snape arrived half an hour earlier? Lupin drinks the final dose of wolfsbane, then Snape leaves. Lupin then sees Wormtail on the map, and runs to the shack.

Does Snape check back on Lupin and see the map like in canon? Or is he unaware of what's happening? How does it change if Lupin keeps his sanity as he transforms?

**** It would be /really/ lame if the author just copied canon and had all the original players, including snape, there.

***** It's called 'for want of a nail', the idea is to keep things as similar as possible until your point of divergence.

Although why would Snape see the map if he wasn't dropping off potion,and why would he drop off potion of it had been taken already?
