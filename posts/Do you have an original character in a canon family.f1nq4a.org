If so, how are they different from their family? How are they the same? Do you nitpick their names or are you more loose with it? Are they destined to follow their parents' footsteps? How did you decide their appearance?

/Add here any obvious question I can't currently think of./

Just curious as I personally have one from the Goyle family that I've come to really love writing about.


** I have a handful, mostly in the background. I've always kept a list of interesting names and a while back I began a wizarding name sub-list, so I tend to refer to that first. If names in that family follow a pattern, I will try to follow it. If the appearance of any canon members are known, I overlap their appearances a little. Most are a product of the way they were raised, no dramatic deviations so far. I'm sure it'll happen eventually.

** I have two.

One is Alphard Marius Black, or what happens when a Sirius who sleeps around slips up on the birth control with Marlene McKinnon (pureblood but also a blood-traitor), resulting in the obvious.

Alphard looks mostly like his father but has the height of his mother, making him taller than even his father. Sirius takes reluctant responsibility for his newborn child at first, but after Harry is born and he introduces the two infants to each-other, he becomes much more involved. So it is a tragedy when canon happens, with Sirius getting imprisoned in Azkaban. Marlene flees surprisingly to Orion and Walburga Black (both survive longer) but it recommended to check herself into Saint Mungo's to treat her for lingering trauma when she barely survived the death of all her blood family.

As much happens, and young Alphard is raised at first mostly by his grandparents until around age seven, when his mom finally truly recovers from her trauma and rejoins the family in 12th Grimmauld Place (much less dilapidated in this timeline). This OC is named for Sirius's uncle and a squib great uncle, names chosen at Sirius's prompting to spite his Slytherin Pureblood supremacist parents. Despite this, Orion and Walburga start to mellow with little Alphard around, and become genuinely regretful for their past beliefs, even if they remain classist and disdainful of muggleborns (At least Sirius had the sense to knock up a blood-traitor, is what they believe)

Alphard differs from his parents in the way that he will be more ambitious and cunning before being brave, as both Marlene and Sirius are Gryffindors, meaning he will be a shoe-in for Slytherin. I am very careful with names because names matter, specifically when you read them time and time again, and chosing something silly or non-thematic can make reading a fic jarring. Alphard is not destined to follow his parent's footsteps, though he will share some of their disposition by nature, much as Harry does too. I chose to make him mostly his father's clone because we have little evidence for what Marlene McKinnon would even look like, and as such this would make developing him easier, certainly as Marlene is a supporting character in the thing I am writing.

The other one is Ramsey Cygnus Lestrange, who is the son of Bellatrix Black-Lestrange and Rodolphus Lestrange. His parents were married and likely did their marriage duties at least once every while, if not enthusiastically. One of these monthly duties results in a firstborn son around the time Alphard and Harry are born, but none of the younger Lestranges are really good parents by any stretch of the imagination. Voldemort is temporarily extremely pleased with Bellatrix however for ensuring the continuity of the Lestrange bloodline, and this reinforces her position as his informal head Death Eater.

After the arrest of the younger Lestranges Ramsey is sent to his grandfather, Lestrange Senior, who raises him with the help from house elves. Initially Ramsey is every bit as bad a blood supremacist as his parents, and goes around mainly with the likes of Malfoy (his cousin), but prolonged contact with his dorm-mate Alphard helps sway him into more moderate beliefs, though he hides them well. Eventually, this becomes the setup for a Romeo and Juliette style romance between him and Ginny Weasley (I have Harry paired with someone else) for who he finally publicly comes out as a blood-traitor after having aided Snape as an Order informant upon his recruiting into the Death Eaters at the tender age of fifteen.

I chose Ramsey because of GOT, which gave the name an insanity connotation that mixes well with the Lestrange family, and Cygnus because of his maternal grandfather, who would want to be honoured in that way. I have yet to decide how he looks, though I am currently toying with the idea to give him most of the facial features from his mother.

Still another character I cannot yet reveal, as they are a main character of my work who will be revealed in time, but would spoil it if I typed it here now. But in general, I use these rules :

1 : Names in HP are important and must follow common family themes (usually) and not be in any way silly or ''creative''.

2 : Appearance should not be silly either. No two colour hair or weirdly bright eyes or other nonsense.

3 : Character is not hereditary, though common childhoods may develop similar traits.

4 : If a character is an extreme blood-supremacist, they need a good reason to switch sides. Same goes for Order members.
