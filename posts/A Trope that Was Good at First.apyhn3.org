The first time I ran across a story where Dumbledore was paying the Weasley's, it was shocking. A total blindside attack that worked for the shock value. Every time I read a trope like that now, it's essentially enough to make me stop reading.

What idea like this worked well but only that once.


** I think most tropes were good at first. And they still are in a fashion. However at the start the revelation that something like that is happening was already interesting by itself. Nowadays doing a reveal that the Weasleys are using love potions on Harry and Hermione is no longer a surprising development. A trope now needs to lead to something more interesting or be developed in an original manner than the standard things.

For instance the Harry goes to Gringotts trope is tired and lots of authors that still use it aren't original with it and just use it as a convenient way to heap on money, inheritance and power onto Harry. But the basic idea of Harry going to the goblins and discovering something is not inherently bad.

*** Good way of putting it. I think the HP fanfiction community is pretty unique in how exhaustive it has been in creating tropes in the continuity. Practically all the low-hanging fruit of key events happening differently, key changes to backstories or worldbuilding have all been thoroughly explored in all sorts of ways.

Nowadays for a fic to stand out it's gotta go either /reeeeallly/ far out there to try something novel, or have excellent writing so readers don't care how similar it is to established stories.

**** That's exactly what I mean. Older popular fics very often don't stand the test of time that well because they were build mostly on establishing new ideas which developed in what we now know as tropes. The writing was not that scrutinized because the concepts were all new and interesting. Reading about all the money Harry inherits and the magical powers he gets from his ancestors was a novel and interesting concept. But now that the trope is established you look back at those early stories and recognise the often bad overall writing around it.

I think you are correct with this, but then again I still encounter fics where there are major events done in a way I haven't seen before. In a universe as expansive as fanon HP it's almost impossible to involve no tropes in your story (there are way too many), but finding original takes on those tropes, small additions or clever ways around them really can change an entire story.

Yet there is hardly anything which can reasonably be found at Gringotts which hasn't been done to death. You have:

- Money & Other physical assets

- The "keys" to some property/house

- Stock in various companies (Nimbus, the Daily Prophet, some apothecary)

- Magical Portrait

- Trunk/Journals

- Family magic books

- Connections to a different magical family/cheating mother (eg Snape is Harry's father)

- Some form of sex dungeon, possibly with sexual slavery

Short of a Prothean Beacon or a Klingon Bird of Prey, it is not original.

***** The one I really regret reading was FemHarry forced into sexual slavery to pay for the breakout (and a bunch of Death Eaters for being overall dicks). It had some graphic rape scenes, which I read in the hope of getting some bloody vengeance.

But no, instead of Hermione and Kingsley concluding that sexual Slavery excludes you from the Hague conventions and introduce the Goblins to the wonders of chemical warfare and flamethrowers, FemHarry develops Stockholm Syndrome and goes back to the Goblins after her "debt is repaid".

**** Even something not being original doesn't make it inherently bad. I generally dislike Harry goes to Gringotts since it is very often an unoriginal, drawn out affair that has very little baring on the entirety of the story. Far too often it's a convenient way for the author to dump the premise on the main character (i.e. Dumbledore has been stealing money from him, he''s the descendant of all four of the founders, he has marriage contracts aplenty, etc.). So the execution of the Harry goes to Gringotts is often poorly done and unimaginative (which all too often sets up for other deficiencies in the rest of the story).

However just because the execution is often done so poorly doesn't mean that the general idea is bad. Gringotts and the goblins can make for interesting story elements. I don't even mind an unoriginal Harry inherits stuff scene, as long as it's not 10k words where the author is trying to amaze everyone with uncovering all kinds of amazing stuff that's not at all relevant to the story.

"Oh no, Headmaster, he's not a man, he's an android with a positronic brain. I'm fiddling with the tachyon inverse-structural relays that make up his analog for the human vestibular system."

The green-skinned man, apparently in no pain whatsoever, looked up and briefly made eye contact with the Headmaster before returning to his thousand-yard stare. "That is correct. I have been experiencing a phenomenon that you would call 'dizziness' and I hypothesize that blunt force trauma along the mid-axillary line caused a deviation in the..."

Here, Hermione cut him off. "He got kicked in the chest by a unicorn. It got spooked when he moved and it suddenly realized he wasn't just a funny looking tree. He's been stumbling around since."

"Yes... well, yes. That's all very good. In any event, Miss Granger, I was wondering if you have seen Mister Malfoy lately. I spoke to Harry and he was less than forthcoming."

"I'm pretty sure Draco got beamed directly into the brig on the Bird of Prey that Harry has parked at the L2 Lagrange point out past the Moon."

"Ah, yes, yes. Of course. Wonderful. And that means..."

Hermione paused, huffed out a breath and went back to peering into the Android's chest cavity.

"Headmaster, this is really fiddly work and Harry wants Data back up to full functionality today. Is this urgent? Because if not, my work here /is/."

Dumbledore nodded wisely and twinkled merrily before giving out a slight cough when he realized Miss Granger was ignoring all of his wise grandfatherly twinkling. "Yes, well, then I'll leave you to it, Miss Granger. Do please have Mister Malfoy check in with me as soon as he's back."

"It was an accident, honestly."

"How can you beam someone by accident?" Hermione wanted to know but Harry's mumbled reply was too quiet to understand. "What was that?"

"I said that I shot him, but I didn't mean to -"

"Explain, now!"

"I was outside of Myrtle's bathroom, when I heard sobbing. I - I went to see what was going on because it didn't sound like her. She was there, but she was talking to Malfoy about something. He was sobbing and - and then he saw me and attacked. He opened with the Cruciatus. Not even a stunner or blasting curse - Just an Unforgivable," Harry explained, not looking up from the floor. His hands were still trembling and he was paler than usual.

"So you just shot him?"

"I - I didn't had my wand out. I tried to draw it and the next thing I know, I'm holding a phaser and Malfoy, he just disintegrated."

"You didn't mean to kill him?" she asked slowly and put an arm around her shaken friend.

"I - I don't know. I wanted to find out what he was up to, prove that he was a Death Eater - And now he's dead. I saw that curse - I remembered how it felt like - "

"Don't - don't blame yourself. You did the right thing," she said and pulled him in a tight hug."

"Hermione, I KILLED HIM!"

********** Hermione rolled her neck and cast her eyes across the bridge of the /Hedwig/. Harry was slumped in the helmsman's chair, his eyes downcast.

"Captain, if I may offer a suggestion?" Data spoke up from the Science Officer's station.

Hermione turned to him, "Data, I told you yesterday. I'm not the captain."

"Captain, I have an eidetic memory. You do not need to remind me of anything. However, after your assertion I queried Lieutenant Potter, and he forcefully asserted that he was not the captain and that he was 'good at flying but that's it.' I suggested that he therefore take the helmsman's station and the rank of Lieutenant. He was amenable. As the only remaining member of /Hewig/'s crew, that makes you the Captain, Captain."

Hermione let out a slow breath.

"I don't have time for this," she muttered. "Okay fine, I'm the captain. Let's hear your suggestion, then."

"If you were able to obtain a sample of Mister Malfoy's DNA, we could use the bio-replicator in the sickbay to create something that would passably resemble his body. You could then bring the replicated body into what you call 'The Forbidden Forest' and stage an attack by one of the dangerous animals therein. With enough damage to the body and the surrounding forest, none would suspect the ruse."

Harry's head shot up. His eyes, glistening from the beginnings of tears, held a feverish hope.

"However, I must inform you that my ethics subroutines would not permit me to carry out such an action myself."

"Why not!?" Harry exploded, coming instantly to his feet. "If the Captain ordered you..."

"Sir, I must..."

Hermione interrupted. "Data, Draco carried out an action that carries a life sentence in a prison designed to break a prisoner's very soul. Harry acted purely in self-defense, and you can see his remorse plainly," she reasoned.

Data cocked his head slightly.

He paused for just a moment, silence falling over the bridge.

"Very well."

Hermione let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding.

"I shall proceed to the sickbay and start the necessary programming on the bio-replicator. The task will take approximately four hours, three minutes, 29 seconds."

Harry nodded along as Data spoke. As the android turned to leave the bridge, Harry pounded his right fist into his left hand. He spoke to Hermione, still facing the closed turbolift doors, "Guess we're staging a break-in of the Slytherin dorms."

"Do you still have that Felix Felicis?"

I mean, if the popular tropes weren't good at first, they probably never would've become tropes in the first place.

** How about a trope that was never good? Harry changing his name to sound more important, or more befitting of his new rank as Lord Potter-Black (Merlin-Le Fay-Gryffindor-Peverell). I give bonus points if Harry corrects Dumbledore, Snape, or his other teachers for calling him plain old 'Mr. Potter' in class.

Of course, all the names he chooses are terrible, but the main offender is *"Hadrian Peverell".*

I take it as a cue that the author isn't planning to stick to any canon characterizations in their story, as Harry in the books was just happy to be "Just Harry" when confronted with news of himself being special and magical. Harry has a different type of personality than Tom Riddle, who knew he was special all along, and /wanted/ to change his name to match that perceived status.

They make him "Hadrian Jameson Peverell-Black" because a protagonist who is the object of prophecy, and the largest magical core in history, cannot possibly have such a simple name as "Harry James Potter". Writing characterization is treated like the player character stats screen on an RPG, where you can "build your own", including choosing a cool name.

As for OP!Harry, that's actually somewhat easy to pull off if you follow some principals. Don't tell the reader that he is powerful. I'm currently reading "Harry Potter and the Homecoming", and Harry is powerful. But the story isn't trying to tell me that. It just drops hints here and there without saying it. The biggest helper here is how much Harry thinks he is weak. He doesn't think he is too weak, but he doesn't think he's particularly strong. Show don't tell is important in those stories. It must be gradual, it must be explained, and it must be difficult.

One story with an overpowered character came from him being destroyed in a fight. X beat me. I need to counter X with Y. How do I do Y? The next fight he gets destroyed, but he gains the knowledge of how to use Y. He didn't use that Y in the fight. He just made a revelation.

While I don't mind Hermione as a character, she feels like the worst character to gimmick into the next Merlin, because her personality is rather well defined and nothing ever feels fresh with the execution of her "genius".

  ‘Not really,' said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet. ‘I've never really liked horses.'

The Lockhart stuff was, again, to save lives, while the Umbrige one was because the government was literally making their up and coming adults less able to defend themselves. Whether or not they believed Voldemort was back was irrelevant to that, they very likely messed up a bunch of 5th and 7th years by taking away their classroom practicals for a class designed to learn to protect themselves.

Putting quotes around the word necessary suggests it was frivolous, but you know as the reader why it was done. I ignore the fanon, boring Hermione because... She's boring, like an OP "Lord Harry".

** The first time I ran into a truly evil Dumbledore was excellent. I'd read stories where Dumbledore was antagonistic, mostly because he didn't want a teenager risking his life but Harry knows best, but none where he was actually villainous. Earlier this week, I read a story and thought "aside from the tired old MoB Dumbledore, this was good"

That said, I think [[/u/MartDiamond][u/MartDiamond]] was pretty on the money. The shock value/new idea will go along way to make otherwise mediocre writing seem much better.

I'll add that many tropes, when initially done well, were things that first, added to the overall plot of the story, rather than just something that was tossed in because the author liked it, or needed to check a box. Secondly, new ideas are scary, and so authors tend to take the time to fully flesh out new things. Once something's become a trope, it's really easy to just try to use the trope itself as a shorthand, instead of actually taking the time the idea needs to be good.

***** I give this a pass depending on how old Harry is when Snape "adopts" him. If he's an actual baby, then it doesn't bother me if he acts like one. However, some of these stories crank up the angst and make the Dursleys more abusive than they are in canon, so you get ultra Woobie Harry, and it's ridiculous at times.

I read one fic where one Woobie Harry kept trying to sleep in Snape's potions cupboard and broke the glassware and wet himself while in there, and Snape had to take him to his bedroom and rock him till he fell asleep. It happened multiple times, Snape getting more upset about the Dursley abuse, while it made Harry look like he was a kicked puppy instead of a human child.

The lesson learned: if one character in a fic is OOC, then there's a good chance everyone else is too.

***** The biggest thing to remember that Snape is a dick. No matter his role in any story, the baseline tenet of his personality is being a massive dick. Even to people he loves (like Lily) he will still lash out. To people on the same side (Remus in PoA) he will put his own grudges first. He's selfish and motivated by self-interest.

- The main trope that annoys me in Severitus is "Affectionate Snape", which waters down his dickishness. If he shows approval for something, he doesn't cuddle and hug. Nowhere in the books did Snape ever look like he was going to hug Draco, his canon favorite student.

- Snape also isn't an emotionless robot, and Book Snape isn't the cool and subdued threat of Movie Alan Rickman Snape. He has emotions, has trouble repressing them, throws tantrums, and hasn't reached the point of emotional maturity where he realizes holding onto 15 year old grudges and crushes is weird.

- Snape is competent and good at his job. He invents spells, brews advanced potions, and writes his own recipes. I am annoyed by Fanfiction Snape who spends all his time brooding around or looking after children's needs, instead of doing magical stuff. Show how intelligent and capable he is through using magic as an important plot device in a story, instead of just telling the readers this guy is clever.

****** Your view on Snape is my view on Snape. I have been putting together a 'good' Snape and.... he's still, quite honestly entirely self-involved. If he offers a hug, it's so that he can drag someone off by forced side-along apparition. Although I don't have him ever being a murderer unless forced. He was too upset in canon at what Dumbledore asked him to do to have really wallowed in atrocities as a Death Eater, at least willingly.

I like to think that he's fairly dutiful towards his Slytherins though. That, /if/ you were a Slytherin, you'd see Snape as distant but someone reliable you could go to with anything, at least until the teenage stage where adults are all the absolute worst.

*** I like them as concept, and there are some really great severitus and mentor!snape fics out there. When it's done well, it's so good. But I really hate that in so many of them Harry is infantilized and his agency is taken from him. So many severitus fics will amp up the abuse to 11, like what Harry's been through in canon isn't traumatic enough, and then make him a sad little angel, who is pathetically grateful to Snape for the minimul level of basic human decency (and sometimes not even that) and trusts him even though Snape still treats Harry like garbage. Like, Snape still heaps a ton of verbal abuse on Harry just like he always did (and even sometimes physical, which he didn't before), but now that's fine, because deep down he's beginning to realize that Harry isn't some spoilt prince and starts to like him. Deep down.

haha, I feel that it's perfectly in character for Snape. But whether this infantilizes Harry depends on how Harry himself would react to the situation. At 14, he has long been self-sufficient, and he'll do just fine for three days by himself.

Also, Harry is opinionated and sassy, and there's going to be some clash of personalities. He wouldn't just stand there silently, eyes downcast, while Snape shouts at him for being just like his father, for example, or maybe he would, but that would be a sign of a deep mistrust.
