** linkffn(Renegade Cause) is the what you are looking for, its also rated 4-5 stars on DLP forums, which means it will have amazing writing and no grammatical or spelling errors. Pretty sure its Harry/Tonks.

**** Hmm ... if you mean the feeling of “well, everything's fucked” that the first chapter might have given then not really, however, the grimness of the world does always remain to at least some degree because the author recrafted the world instead of just making a few changes.

It is depressing only at points. It's always dark, though.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
