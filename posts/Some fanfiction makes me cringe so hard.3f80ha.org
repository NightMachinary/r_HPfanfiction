Title says it all really. Nothing deep or philosophical from me. I just so happen to force myself not to hurl when I read some stuff.

I just read a few chapters of a Harry/Harem. I'm not sure why. Maybe curiosity? Anyway after reading a few incredibly cringe worthy paragraphs about Harry's relationship with Luna and Hermione it got me thinking about some of the more, how do I put it? Off-putting things in fanfiction, for me they happen to be things like Harry/Hermione/Luna specifically but also Harry/Harem and slash.

Nothing against any of those things, if you like it go for it mate. However I find that most of the Harry/Harem fics are either just terribly written or the characters are so different it's not even fanfiction. It's merely a story someone wrote using Harry Potter names and concepts. And the conversations are what make me cringe the most. Hearing a bunch of 11 year old children talk about them having sex or all that Pureblood Lord stuff is so weird to to me.

Slash is just a personal thing. Don't read it. Don't care if you do.

What about you guys? Do you have any things like this you avoid?

Edit.

I would just like to thank everyone for the mostly civil conversation and I would also like to say I have been reading the H/Hr debate with popcorn on hand.

** I'm generally not a fan of non-canon pairings, although I did like the only Dramione story I read. I read one Harry/Harem that was just ok, the Accidental Bond. It's not one I would re-read though.

There's one series out there (Honestly Harry by Captain Compass) that I really enjoyed until it started feeling like the author was a guy writing his threesome fantasies over and over again. It's a H/G/Hr "pairing" but I got way too many allusions to anal play and the like for me to want to continue. Oh, and then he decided to add a fourth in the form of Daphne Greengrass. I liked the story, but thinking about 14 year olds sticking things up asses just made me feel a little dirty, and not the good kind of dirty where you're secretly enjoying it. This was the kind of dirty where you wish you could take your brain out and wash it off.

Generally I like non-canon pairings but some of them are just bad. One of the best things about them for me is that the girl is usually relatively undeveloped so it gives the Author something to work with, without writing yet another generic fic with Harry/Ginny or Harry/Hermione.

** There is very - /very/ - little good out there that includes Harems. I think the almost omnipresent inspirations from Ecchi-Anime is almost descriptive for this "genre".

The only harem I have ever read that I found actually fitting for the story was the Harry/Luna/Hermione/Astoria/Ginny harem from the Firebird Trilogy. It just fit the world and the story. But even there were scenes I just skipped because I was highly uncomfortable reading about children going at it.

My big red light is stupidly written slash. What I mean by that is slash that was obviously - really obviously - written by someone who is A) not gay (hello femslash writers) or B) a teenage girl/boy dealing with their own, newfound homosexuality in the form of fanfiction. I must add that while I detest the first, I completely understand the second.

The next big no-go is Bashing. I mean, I find it interesting to make good characters into bad characters and vise versa. Mixing it up is what fanfiction is there for, after all. But I dislike when you take a character and stomp him into the ground for absolutely no reason. Best and most often seen example is a borderline mentally retarded Ron. Or our much loved manipulative Dumbles, leader of the magical world, who has a weakness of leaving loose ends for /14 year olds/ to abuse.

Ah well... in the end I can look over a lot of stuff when the story is good.

- Slutty characters, either because everyone is completely ooc or if it's just a few slutty characters, there will be a sanctimonious slut shaming vibe, which I hate.

- H/Hr. I just don't get this pairing at all.

- Incest, particularly when it's Fred/George. I don't like incest fic in general, but Fred/George incest especially weirds me out because the actors that play them in the movies are brothers in real life.

I've never run across something like this and it's kind of intriguing to me. I understand why you think it doesn't fit with the world, but there was a pretty sweet dance scene in the UK at the time the HP books were set, and I think you could do some interesting stuff with it. A sixth or seventh year Hogwarts student or young Auror trainee would fit right in at a rave, age-wise. The underground dance scene happens in crowded, dark rooms where a lot of people are taking mind-altering substances; Dark wizards could probably get away with a lot of weird stuff happening without anyone noticing.

Sorry, I know you said you /don't/ like that, but I've had a vague desire for a fic like this for years and I've never seen one.

H/Hr is pretty polarizing with both sides being vocal and kinda intolerant of the other. If you're doing nothing, check in every so often on the comments in this thread and watch them rise and fall with the votes! It's a shipping war that's gone on forever.

I disagree. But I do understand where you're coming from and don't hold it against you that you don't ship H/Hr. I understand where you're coming from because I've seen more than enough writers of H/Hr fanfiction doing exactly that in their stories. But I've also seen other fiction where it's been written much closer to canon and I'd say that Harry/Hermione has as much of a chance of happening as any of the canon pairings.

#+end_quote

Personally I don't see a problem with that in fanfic either. I mean all relationships are the same when you get down to it. All of them are "boring" if you think about it. Harry/Ginny is the same as Harry/Hermione or Harry/Daphne or whatever. They go on dates, they kiss, they have sex, whatever. All of that remains the same regardless of the partner. Just like in real life.

The only pairings in the fandom which might be "exciting" in comparison would be pairings with Fleur, Tonks or one of the half giants. But that's down to them being different species/having rare magical talents that allow for them to alter their appearance at will. Which, if people want that from a relationship, says a lot about that person's personality if they want the person to be more than what they are or to be someone/something else. :/

****** Is it really? Harry seems to be just as irritated by Hermione's pushiness as Ron. See pretty much all of HBP or the SPEW stuff or even regular homework. The only difference is that he complains out loud a lot less, and settles for quiet grumbling, or just waits till Hermione is gone to do something she might disapprove of.

Plus in GoF he all but admits that Hermione isn't much fun to be around without Ron there as well (unlike Ginny, who Harry always found to be fun after she got over her crush), and the two times he gets to be alone with Hermione without Ron (GoF, DH), he is utterly miserable.

#+begin_quote
  “Miss him?” said Harry. “I don't miss him. . . .”

  But this was a downright lie. Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just wasn't the same as Ron. There was much less laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when Hermione was your best friend.
#+end_quote

Not saying that Ron/Hermione would work, but a lot of the same reasons Ron/Hermione supposedly wouldn't work applies to Harry/Hermione as well.

Not that realism matters much in fanfiction, I just find most Harry/Hermione tropes to be distasteful: Hermione wank, Harry being reduced to Hermione's bitch (makes for a very unbalanced relationship), *Weasley Bashing* (bold because it is /the/ most distasteful trope ever), Dumbledore Bashing, Purebloods are teh Evilz, Muggle Wank, Wizarding world bashing etc. If there is a Harry/Hermione story without these tropes (see: Lori's Paradigm of Uncertainty), then I have nothing against it.

Is Hermione the only one who's realized they're /at school/? You see Hermione as irritating, I see Ron as holding Harry back from getting a fucking /education/. Ironically, Ron dreams of outshining all his older brothers, but does /nothing/ to accomplish it, except eat, complain, play chess and polish his hair-trigger jealousy.

"/I wonder how I can become Head Boy?/"

"Hey Harry, drop that homework and come play Wizard's Chess!"

I see Harry being irritated, but he never calls Hermione /mental/, like Ron keeps doing over and over /and over/. Ron and Hermione are polar opposites, pulling a near spineless Harry in opposite directions. Hermione is actually being a better friend to Harry, she pushes him forward, while Ron holds him back.

Ron is lazy, jealous, bigoted, and dismissive of anything muggle. Ron has more in common with Draco Malfoy than with Hermione. Ron's treatment of Hermione is a textbook example of [[http://liveboldandbloom.com/11/relationships/signs-of-emotional-abuse][emotional abuse]]. First he calls her names and dismisses her academic prowess, and then he expects her to help him out after scoring an O in procrastination. It's a match made in Hell. Talk about "unbalanced relationship"!

Hermione is studious, helpful, supportive, open-minded, and a fighter for social justice. She stays on Harry's side every time that Ron skedaddles, and he does so several times. The biggest break between her and Harry was with the Firebolt gift, and she did so only to protect him. And she was even /right/, the broom /was/ from Sirius Black!

The only thing they have in common, is having Harry as a friend. Without Harry, they wouldn't be friends at all. I can very much see her leaving Hogwarts, if she even survives the Troll incident. And the wishy-washy way Harry is portrayed makes him a good match for /anyone/. No wonder it's so popular to match him up with all the antagonists. He has the personality of a boiled potato!

No matter how you slice it, H/Hr is /more compatible/ than R/Hr. Call it less /in/compatible, but the result's the same.

Hermione is not the average person. The vast majority of people do not continuously, tirelessly work to further their knowledge. In fact, quite the opposite. Most people do the minimum or less. Harry and Ron are very much the average person in regards to their schoolwork and education. Also, Harry has a very active sense of self and cannot be bullied into something. If he's playing wizard chess with Ron, it's because he wants to be.

** Ron/Hermione pairings (I actually regularly contemplate destroying my copies of the sixth and seventh books because of it, and I love books in general), pairings with multiple girls in them and and slash (although I don't mind slash in a triad with two guys and one girl).

The final thing that REALLY makes me cringe is when the protagonist is doing something too obviously stupid, especially when it's written in first person. Like I recently discovered the House of Night series (not fanfiction), and I really liked the first book, then in the second book the protagonist swears an unspecified favor to her main antagonist from the previous book. I still haven't gotten myself to continue reading despite that it's been weeks and I liked everything about the series so far. Maybe this is why Pottermore put me in Slytherin.

You've got real issues if you 'regularly contemplate' destroying books just for a side pairing which doesn't affect the plot of the story at all, and doesn't really come up much. I can understand not reading stories where Ron/Hermione is the main pairing, but anything more is just ridiculous.

***** There is a difference between cringing and 'I actually regularly contemplate destroying my copies of the sixth and seventh books because of it, and I love books in general'. If you wanted it to be a lulzy hyperbole you should have been a lot clearer because as it is the statement just makes you look like an idiot.

****** Well I contemplate getting rid of them, and throwing them in the thrash is destroying them, and I don't think there's a lot of a market for old second hand English books that are still readily available new in a non-English country. The fact that the books will be destroyed is actually what stops me because I can't stand the idea of destroying/purposefully damaging a book. Doesn't stop me from considering it every time I encounter a fanfic has Hermione dating Ron at any time in the story.

******* I don't think wanting to destroy those two books is at all odd. See I have a little secret . . . I never finished 6 and I didn't buy 7.

I think book six is still sitting on a shelf in the garage where I put it the day I stopped reading (likely the evening of the day it came out)
