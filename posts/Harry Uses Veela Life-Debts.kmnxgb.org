I believe the debt was originally Gabrielle's and when Harry called in on it Fleur asked for it to be transferred to her. Harry's big plan with the debt was to escape to the Veela enclave away from the machinations of the wizarding world. It is not a romance story and I think the Delacours actually hate him for the entire story.


** I believe you are taking about Enslavement by Jeconais. [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/][But his website seems to be down at the moment.]]

** [[/u/pysixofpandemonium][u/pysixofpandemonium]] is right: this is Enslavement by Jeconais (there's also a sequel). Fanficauthors dot net seems to be down right now; don't know if it's a glitch or just the latest archive to disappear on us.

I have an MSWord copy, if you're interested.
