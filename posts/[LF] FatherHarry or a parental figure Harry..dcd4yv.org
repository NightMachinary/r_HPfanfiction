** Let me be the first of what would likely be many to recommend 'Grow Young With Me'

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me]]

Absolutely wonderful story, and I normally dislike the entire genre this best fits. Author is also sometimes active in this community, and then we all badger her to write more :-)
