** linkffn(Grow Young With Me) comes to mind. The summary sounds unbearably dramatic, and it /is/ a romance, but there's a lot more to it than the summary shows.

Just knowing that Harry has been widowed and is now looking after his three children helps a lot, I think, to put the story in context.

Just kidding lol. I've always thought about going back and changing it up a bit, or at least adding more details. I wrote it almost 4 years ago and it has not withstood the test of time.

** The Lesser Sadness has a summary that doesn't at all match the tone of the work. If the author's "extended summary" in the notes section was instead what showed up on on the fanfic bot summary, I'd have enjoyed this fantastic work much sooner.

** Don't know if this is what you meant, but Linkffn(The Longest Nights by GreyMurphy) is pretty good, and hasn't received attention.

The writer used a quote from the story, and while it is tangentially relevant, it is really misleading when combined with how they labeled it a Sirius/Lily pairing. Honestly wish it was more vague, because it's really well written, if kind of tired and sad. The pairing only plays a part insofar as it is a backdrop on which the author explores Sirius' relationship with Harry and how he struggles with regret.

Fair warning, I find it best read with a cup of tea nearby and slow acoustic music playing quietly; in other words, it's kind of depressing, but oddly hopeful at the same time.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/464017]]) Girl in Red. The most fitting part of it is the warning about it getting darker as the series goes on. It's long, incredibly well-written, calls back to some of the lighter moments with a lot of foreshadowing, and it updates once a week. However, it's very hard to explain and I wouldn't have given it a chance if someone hadn't recommended it to me.
