They fear establishing direct contact with Harry in his retirement as to avoid raising suspicion of the newly appointed Minister of Magic - who has begun a purge of the "old guard" in an attempt to consolidate power and "move on" from the ministries' "wartime mentality" and bring the magically community into the 21st century.

The cult call themselves Potter's Army but their leaders fashion themselves as his Messiah, speaking in his name, revering him as a mysterious figurehead, sending coded messages through his increasingly rare public talks and appearances...


** Plot twist: Harry is already the master of death, because he had already had all the Hallows since he was young and his ageing is faked to not arouse suspicions.

BTW, I think iamluna97 is on to something here. This is an interesting premise. I hope someone good does something with it.

** There's a somewhat similar idea being foreshadowed in a series of fics that I'm reading that is set around 6 years after the 7th book where Rabastan Lestrange is starting a cult about Harry (unbeknownst to him) while being imprisoned in Azkaban called the ‘Followers of the Fated Child' that is rising in popularity among the Neo-Grindelwald factions across Europe, centered around the claim of Harry being the inheritor of a legacy surrounding the Deathly Hallows.

So it's more of an international cult, and not quite a secret amongst the Aurors. Which I think is quite a level up from domestic terrorism in terms of antagonists. But yeah, I would really like to read more fics around this concept.

**** Just to temper some expectations, the cult is mentioned /much/ farther into the story and hasn't made an actual appearance yet. The series started out as purely a smutfic sprinkled with a light dusting of plot and worldbuilding until it slowly increased with subsequent chapters and fics advancing the plot and character development while still retaining bits of detailed smut here and there.

If you're fine with that, I'll gladly provide the link!

#+begin_quote
  The wedding was lovely. Really. It was. Harry isn't even jealous that Ginny is marrying Draco, more frustrated that he's wound up at yet another wedding without a date.Pansy, still somewhat of an outcast after the war, has been left behind by her own date/flatmate after Blaise spotted a boy he was interested in.Daphne, having lost her standing in Pureblood circles thanks to a failed teenage romance, has shown up mostly for her own amusement. When these three "leftovers" find themselves without any other prospects at the end of the night, bemoaning their singledom at an afterparty at Daphne's flat makes sense, right? After all, they can't stay on their best behaviour forever.

** This would actually be a pretty cool next-gen idea. I always found that most next-gen fics don't have a credible hero because the protagonists always have a pretty good life (loving families - even Teddy, no real tragedy) to feel the need to become heroic. What if Albus discovers one day that his dad and uncle and aunt have all been killed by a cult that advocates for a new world order, only to find out at the end that the original trio is behind this cult and they want to change the world into a magical utopia... only it's in fact a dystopia in which everyone that doesn't abide by the rules is erased from existence even for the tiniest transgression?

** Plot Twist: Harry is Dumbledore-level, has all the Hallows and knows about the cult, but is just pretending. That's because there IS a Dumbledore-level wizard whose existence the 'Potter's Army' simply does not want to acknowledge.

Hermione Granger, the new muggleborn Minister of Magic. Her popularity isn't only due to her history with Harry, her resolve to help the downtrodden and her good relations with the other races and Wizarding Nations. She is also the publicly acknowledged strongest wizard of Britain.

  the only reason that Daphne considered Ronald Weasley to be Harry's right-hand-man was because Hermione Granger stood beside Harry as an equal, not as any kind of “follower”.
