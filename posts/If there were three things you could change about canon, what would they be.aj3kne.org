Personally 1. Scrap the Harry and Ginny pairing or at least offer a lot of buildup and let her be an important character from far earlier.

1. The way that Snape is some sort of hero doesn't sit well with me because regardless of doing one thing out of love for his lost love he was a terrible person and basically did it for selfish reasons

2. Dumbledore not training Harry in anything but history was total crap and kind of made the final battle anticlimactic as the magic was pretty basic compared to Dumbledore vs Voldemort which was epic.

Let me know what you think!

Edit: Thanks for all of the responses! I posted this before work and my phone has been blowing up like nuts! Will read them all when I get home!

Edit again: Geez I can't believe this post blew up like that! Thanks so much and all of the responses and it's great seeing what the community has to say on the topic!

Edit! After reading through all of these I'm going to say that we have our winners!

1. Time Turners
2. Epilogue
3. All Slytherins are Evil

4.HBP and DH entirely

Obviously I didn't go through and count all of them. But I do plan on doing that! And making a graph from the data. But I'll do that when I have more time!


** 1. No Pairings/No Epilogue. The books would have ended far better with them taking the boats back across the lake after graduation and ending as friends.
2. Flesh out at least one decent Slytherin classmate that isn't evil.
3. Rewrite the entirety of HBP. So much in that book makes no sense (the length of time it took Dumbledore to go over TMR history even though the headmaster was dying, the relationship angst that really had no place in the books, no one figuring out that Draco was using the RoR, Hermione's reaction to the HBP, Dumbledore's willingness to potentially sacrifice other students to protect Draco, etc).

**** I would argue that you should go the other way. Show us that Ravenclaws can be useful for more than to out-Wikipedia +Wikipedia+ Hermione. Show us Hufflepuffs who are courageous out of their loyalty, not just "hard workers" or the spares. I mean, even if the sorting represents the students at age 11, by the time they are adults they are different people. Maybe some Ravenclaw who has overworked himself into burnout/depression. We already have cowardly Gryffindors (Pettigrew) and brave Slytherins (Andromeda Tonks). The best addition would have been Neville as Hufflepuff yet he gets his heroic moment in DH (or scarp that idiocy altogether and focus more on the DoM battle).

3. How most of the messed up things that happened in the last 3 books didn't accurately reflect the characters she'd previously created, and only served to move the story in the direction she needed.

** Make Dumbledore a character with goals, desires, and abilities rather than a plot device to move the story forward. As a plot device, he makes more sense as a villain. Stop it.

Make more characters 3 dimensional while you are at it. As you note, H/G doesn't really work with how underdeveloped she is a character.

Show more of the social reasons why someone might want to side with the Death Eaters, or be Neutral. This might be harder, as things are mostly from Harry's PoV, but seeing the legitimate conflict inherent in a heavily intermarried wizarding world would increase tension.

Avoid white washing characters based on the trim of their robes. Rowling did a decent job of this with some of the Gryffindors (Lupin running out on his wife and kid, and Sirus's casual cruelty towards Kreacher spring to mind) but she could have let someone from Slytherin not be a jerk. Sure, Snape and Draco have their moment in the end, but that's only after spending 99% of the story as antagonists. Actually write some decent people into the house of the ambitious.

Look more into how the magic system works. As it is, I've heard the HP magic system get compared to X-Men, where it changes as needed. Explore the how and why of magic, rather than treating it like a Swiss army tool. I don't want "change a match stick into a needle" I want the underpinnings of what that exercise demonstrates

5. Give Ron a plotline that mirrors James'. Getting serious about his studies, trying to be a better person. Realizing that Hermione is better off without him.

I do agree that part of the series would be scrapped in this hypothetical scenario of my dream story.

** In the spirit of the question I'm going to focus on discrete changes which leave canon largely intact.

*ONE: THE HERO'S PATH*

Make mild adjustments to HBP to make Harry better at magic. Not super Harry or anything like that, just enough for us to respect him more as a character and progress his "hero's journey" arc that was running through the Patronus training/Triwizard Tournament/Dumbledore's Army.

HBP was full of references to how much Harry was struggling with magic; I'd remove those and replace them with a few sections pointing in the opposite direction. First and foremost I'd make him good at non-verbal magic, which really he should be good at, drawing on his strength of will from the Imperius and Priori Incantatem incidents in GOF. He was bad at occlumency but that was because of poor emotional control, not because of a lack of will/focus.

In addition to making him better at non-verbal magic, I'd insert a couple sections about how he was finding his classes easier as he was coming into his own. By the time DH comes around, in canon Harry suddenly pulled out a load of new spells we never saw him learn (Confringo etc.) so I'd /show/ him actually learning them in HBP to give him a greater sense of being proactive after hearing the prophecy.

*TWO: HALLOWS FORESHADOWING*

I'd foreshadow the Hallows much more, throughout the books. JKR has historically been very good at foreshadowing. The horcruxes in particular were a masterwork of foreshadowing, with major elements as early as CoS. I'd do something similar for the Hallows -- given that they are instrumental to Voldemort's defeat, the reader deserves to have more of an "Aha!" moment at the end of DH when everything comes together.

I genuinely think JKR just didn't invent the hallows until post-OotP at the earliest, and possibly even not until post-HBP. By which time it was too late to foreshadow them - the best she could do was go back and co-opt pre-existing story elements such as the ring horcrux.

*THREE: TEEN RATING IN LATER BOOKS*

I'd progress the tone of the books as the characters age, so that the later books were more YA in tone than children's stories. So basically: more direct speech strong language, rather than secondary speech like "Ron swore"; and more sexual references/jokes.

I don't really think he was. As seen with Neville, they seemed to have situational greatness. There's a reason Harry was able to cast such a powerful patronus, even though it was his first time. And to a lesser extent, even Ron does this. With his near-broken wand, designed to be entirely against him, in first year, he managed to cast his first levitation charm on a troll's club, which is quite heavier than a feather.

***** I somewhat disagree. You're right that Harry often succeeds in life-or-death situations, but I think there's plenty of proof that Harry did have raw power: being able to throw off an imperius curse in a classroom setting, which is the exact opposite of a life-or-death situation, is nothing to sneeze at. What sets people like Snape, Voldemort, and Dumbledore apart from him is the fact that they were not only powerful, but driven as well. Essentially, all three of them are Harry with Hermione's work ethic, without a Ron to keep them grounded and on the right path. That flaw of Harry's is remedied by the fact that Hermione and Ron exist, so while he'd never be as strong enough alone, together they can defeat Voldemort, neatly slotting into the theme that love (or friendship) can overcome evil. But if you diminish Harry's magical ability, then the trio add up to one slightly better than average wizard and aren't a match for Voldemort without winning via Deus ex Machina, which canon pretty much does by introducing the Hallows.

Snape, according to Sirius, knew more dark magic coming into Hogwarts than most seventh years. He invented spells in as a teenager and corrected text books. He was also the greatest in occlumency, maybe second to Dumbledore, being able to keep Voldemort out for years.

I think it's pretty unquestionable that Harry sort of gets an aptitude nerf in the later books of the series that can't just be attributed to him having poor work ethic. HBP in particular goes out of its way to show Harry struggling with magic in ways that seem to contradict previously established abilities (as [[/u/Taure]] pointed out with non-verbal magic), and I guess we could mention the point about adrenaline and life-or-death situations but I think it's poor writing to make your protagonist unspectacular 99% of the time but then constantly write him succeeding in situations where he should fail; it completely defeats the point of writing a "normal" protagonist.

I also think that the fact that Harry's role was seemingly rewritten halfway through the series brings up a lot of problems for the dynamic of the trio later on in the series, because it essentially makes Ron a redundant character since Harry now takes up both the role of the hero as well as the slacker everyman in the party that the average reader identifies with. Maybe JKR wanted to subvert the trope of the prophesied hero getting a magic sword and slaying the evil wizard, but it doesn't work as well when she basically writes Harry as Ron but moodier and with a shitty childhood.

**** I think we agree, it's just that the English language gives the word "will" several meanings which is obscuring our agreement.

Willpower can mean having self-control, the ability to resist your own desires. A synonym for this type of willpower is "discipline".

Willpower can also mean having force of will, the ability to resist the will of other people. A synonym for this type of willpower is "stubbornness".

It was the latter type of willpower which was involved in Harry overcoming the Imperius Curse and winning the Priori Incantatem against Voldemort.

It is the former type of willpower which occlumency requires, which Harry lacked (past tense because he learns in in DH after Dobby dies). Occlumency is all about having discipline over your own thoughts whereas Harry lets his thoughts go wherever they are led by his emotions.

When it comes to not wanting to learn occlumency in OotP, Harry's problem was being too immature to (a) set aside his dislike of his teacher and (b) defer to the wisdom of more learned individuals regarding the need to learn it. These are both problems of discipline, i.e. the former type of willpower.

I believe the performance of non-verbal magic has more to do with the latter type of willpower - the force of will type, not the discipline type. So Harry's failings at occlumency do not mean he should be bad at non-verbal magic, as they have their sources in a different type of willpower.

(There's actually a third meaning of "will", but let's keep it simple. My headcanon doc has full details).

Snape was a significant background presence in HBP as was Dumbledore in DH. I got the feeling that by "The Flaw in the Plan" Harry had forgiven both of them and somewhat understood their actions in the war. The name "Albus Severus" tied along with the character fretting over his Sorting serves to show that both Houses and their members are worthy of honor and appreciation. This is in stark contrast to Harry panicking in the first book when the Hat suggested Slytherin.

***** They are certainly intelligent, but whether this renders them sapient (i.e. capable of exercising true independent judgement/decisions) in the HP world is up for grabs. The HP world is dualist - it is your soul, not your mind, which is your true self, your essence.

Magic seems to be able to gift things with intelligence quite easily, but it's not really full sapience - these magically intelligent things, while they have general intelligence in the sense of passing the Turing test, are generally constrained in some way. They do not exhibit independent judgement like a person has.

The Sorting Hat, for instance, is clearly intelligent but at the same time its intelligence exists for a function - Sorting. For the rest of the year that intelligence is content to sit on a shelf and do nothing. It's not sitting there wishing it could be free. Its general intelligence is directed entirely towards the performance of a single task.

Similarly with portraits, they have intelligence but it's a kind of constrained intelligence. Sir Cadogan is a good example: clearly he can interact with people, but at the same time he's a kind of caricature of the real Sir Cadogan - the portrait is locked into certain over the top behaviours, incapable of introspection or change, like a person stuck on repeat.

With dementors, it seems clear to me that they are intelligent but also constrained by their nature. A dementor could no more choose to do good than a person can choose to fly.

Keeping prisoners contained is a good deed. Burying the dead isn't just good, it's also showing respect for the dead. Their nature doesn't dictate if they can do "good" or not, I disagree. Otherwise don't you think they'd just freeze up or start spasming all the time because they're already doing good? They have free will, they can think and reason and choose to do what they want. If someone taught them morals, gave them punishment or reward they could certainly do good.

I don't think of them as "constrained" by some innate thing, like a programming block or something. I think it's more like URGES and INSTINCTS. Like sadists and serial killers. They have urges to harm, to kill, and in the Dementor's case to sap emotions and take souls, but they can resist those urges if they want to.

They do, in canon, otherwise wouldn't all of Azkaban be full of empty husks? Wouldn't they swoop onto the first Ministry worker that they have to be around? But they don't. And when they got ORDERED after harry by umbridge they certainly didn't just go nuts and have a feast on the entirety of little whinging!

**** I cannot speak for reproduction with other humanoid species such as house-elves, goblins, or centaurs, since none of the above are mentioned in canon.

In the specific case of Veela/human interreproduction, however, I think you're not that far off the mark. As Bill Nye used to say, consider the following:

- Fleur's grandmother is a veela. Which one(paternal or maternal) is never explicitly stated, but can be inferred from subsequent details.
- Fleur has no male siblings that we know of; Her only identified sibling is her younger sister Gabrielle. Both seem to have inherited the blonde hair characteristic of veela, along with being abnormally beautiful and being able, to a much reduced degree, to influence the minds of any male individuals in their immediate vicinity.
- Fleur's mother, IIRC, is identified as being strikingly beautiful and likewise shares these characteristics.
- Cousins are mentioned, and while their gender is not IIRC explicitly identified, they are implied from the dialog and actions of other characters to likewise be female.

*Conclusions:*

- Fleur's */maternal grandmother/* is a full veela. Fleur's mother is thus half-veela, with Fleur herself being quarter-veela.
- The veela's ability to influence men is inherited, but with less potency in mixed-blood
- No male part-veela has been identified in canon.

Thus, it is entirely possible that veela abilities are passed down matrilineally, and it is conceivable that the offspring of human/veela unions could indeed be exclusively female.

*EDIT:* This actually brings to mind another question of mine, actually. Of the ones seen in the series, veela are exclusively female; no male veela is ever stated to appear. Which brings to my mind two possibilities:

- They do exist, but are not as prominent; perhaps they may lack their female counterpart's abilities, or have them to a much lesser extent. Sexual dimorphism does occur in real-world species in nature, and it is possible that some form of the same could be at play.
- They do not exist, and veela exclusively depend on procreating with humans in order to maintain their numbers. This would be in line with your hypothesis that the offspring of these unions are exclusively female and are always veela, and as such do eventually exhibit the abilities shown by veela at the World Cup - perhaps once they reach adulthood.

When they mate with other races, however, the kids are not 'half-Asari' they're full Asari with some traits - mostly personality-wise - from the 'father' (who can be a female alien, but the Asari is always the one who bears the children).

They also live for a thousand years or so and mating within their species is very much discouraged because there's a mutation that creates Asari who kill their mates when mating, which happens only when Asari breed with other Asari.

My point is he had to endure horrors (and abuse - it didn't really stop during the series, did it?) that most kids in fantasy don't have too.

I get your point, but Harry's character isn't without its set of trauma. And Luke isn't really comparable, because he was practically an adult when the series started

****** He lost Dumbledore, but pretty much every coming-of-age hero loses their mentor (and usually to death). That's a trope of fantasy. Luke lost Obi Wan, Frodo lost Gandalf (and didn't realise he'd reappeared til the end).

If you'd rather compare him to a kid in classic fantasy, see the Belgariad or an equivalent - child brought up, usually without parents, gets forced into an adventure they don't really want, realise they can't go home, see a lot of death and destruction along the way, end up having to take up responsibility and then life changes irrevocably for them if they survive. Harry ticked all the usual boxes except for his win - he didn't sacrifice anything for his defeat of the dark lord, and the epilogue is so sickening because it hammers home that life carried on as if Voldemort had never risen again.

Harry's life is no bed of roses, absolutely. But compared to other fantasy heroes with a similar arc, he gets away pretty easily with his victory and hence why it feels very anticlimactic and hollow to me personally.

Yes, please! If you're going to make that a pairing, then you need to give them moments before the kiss and stuff leading up to it. If you have to one Weasley member stop being friends with Harry, then let another Weasley family member take Ron's place in the mean time.

Or hell, let Harry and Ginny get to know each other sooner, after Ginny was brain washed of sorts, from Voldemort's diary, Harry never tried to make sure that Ginny was okay, and that always striked me as odd.

** Hmmm... three things? Okay, I have three things.

1: Give Ron a break. Seriously, the guy spent seven books only being the overshadowed sidekick and the universe's chew-toy while everyone around him got more attention and more importance. He was allowed to be upset about this, but not to actually do anything about it... after the first book, pretty much EVERY success he has takes place either totally off-screen, or it's overshadowed because Harry (and occasionally Hermione) has something more important going on, or both.

2: Move out of Harry's head more. Alternately, keep to Harry's POV for six book and then have the seventh book be multiple POV. That would really underline that this was the Big One, and how the entire wizarding world of Britain were fighting or suffering, not just Harry.

3: More girls. Seriously. The only girl who plays a central role in all seven books is Hermione. Ginny's a background character in more than half the books, Luna doesn't even appear until the fifth one, and all other girls are either minor characters or just get one book to have any sort of important role. The HP series is a boy's club... while that's okay for some series, I always get the feeling that JKR didn't INTEND for this series to be.

If I'm allowed to have a fourth thing, then it would be NO PROPHECY. I hate prophecies in fiction, they're terribly overplayed. But if I was given a choice, I'd change the above three things and keep the prophecy, rather than the other way around.

1. No Horcruxes. I hated the idea of them, how much they dictated the story, and felt they restricted things far too much, not allowing the story to breathe and expand beyond its boundaries.

2. Better pairings. I know everyone has a different opinion of who should end up with who, but I know for a fact I would have scrapped the Ginny/Harry Pairing, even IF she was "built up" better. For me personally, I would have liked to see Harry end up with either Hermione or Luna. Ginny with Neville, and perhaps Lavender with Ron, or have Ron die in the final battle rather than one of the twins in some heroic fashion, to really put a twist on things. See 3 below on my thoughts on the Weasleys...

3. Removal of the Weasleys as Harry's "crutch". Should they play a role in Harry's life? Sure, but I always felt they were TOO important and it seemed like a setup from the start, and at the end, JK decided it needed to be even more on the nose and so boom.. Harry/Ginny. Instead... develop the Tonks family more. Perhaps have Sirius or Remus/Tonks live. Perhaps make Dumbledore more into a father/mentor figure, or Minerva into a Mother/mentor figure. Anything else.

Start the series with a black and white, Gryffindor vs Slytherin world view, and gradually demonstrate through the characters we meet that the quality of /all four houses/ can be used for good /or/ evil, and that it's our choices that matter. And by Merlin, at least one Slytherin in DA please!

2. Either better character development and a bigger role for Ginny plus the complete overhaul of the H/G romantic subplot, or no endgame pairing for Harry at all. (And before you say "just have him end up with Hermione instead," I prefer them to be friends/pseudo-siblings, as one of the rare examples of a completely platonic relationship between a male protagonist and a well-written female main character).

I mean we have a coward in Pettigrew who is evil and betrayed Lily and James Potter, who sent Sirius to Azkaban, who killed twelve Muggles. We have a Regulus who found out that Voldemort had a Horcrux and decided to try and destroy it, labeling him more neutral, we definitely need more evil to neutral characters in other characters.

Thinking about Pettigrew, I want a better written Pettigrew, he was a complete and utter coward; and yet we're suppose to believe he followed a plan like betraying Lily and James without any suspicion?

I mean, we know he was very young when he was recruited, and as we know, terrorist organizations and gangs etc have really good methods of drawing disenfranchised youth into their fold. Now imagine if Snape had been brought to the DE on the premise of people who appreciate his talents, people who want to protect the WW from the dangerous Muggles (given what we know of his home life he would absolutely buy into that) and so on. And then he gets in and he sees what it's actually about and he's like 'this is not what I signed up for' because he's an arsehole, but not a fucking murderer and he's not here for genocide.

So he goes to Dumbledore and he's like 'Big V is horrible and I've made bad choices, let me help you bring him down'.

You don't even have to cut Lily out entirely. Make her his only friend, have the whole story with their relationship play out as it did, but don't make her his only motivation for changing sides. It's disrespectful to both of them - Lily turns into a character with no more purpose than to motivate a man, and it leaves Snape ambiguous by implying he never would have turned if it hadn't been for her being threatened.

To quote Wikipedia (each claim is sourced)

#+begin_quote
  The first use of the barrier troops by the Red Army occurred in the late summer and fall on the Eastern front during the Russian Civil War (...) to station blocking detachments behind unreliable Red Army infantry regiments in the 1st Red Army, with orders to shoot if they either deserted or retreated without permission

  Each Red Army division was to have an anti-retreat detachment equipped with transport totalling one company for each regiment. Their primary goal was to maintain strict military discipline and to prevent disintegration of the front line by any means, including the use of machine guns to indiscriminately shoot any personnel retreating without authorization

  A report to Commissar General of State Security Lavrentiy Beria on October 10, 1941, noted that since the beginning of the war, NKVD anti-retreat troops had detained a total of 657,364 retreating, spies, traitors, instigators and deserting personnel, of which 25,878 were arrested (of which 10,201 were sentenced to death by court martial and the rest were returned to active duty)

While I think Dumbledore's lessons in sixth year were stupid in the way they were done, I don't think even Dumbledore could have trained Harry to be able to stand up to Voldemort in a duel. Voldemort had decades of experience over Harry. Harry wasn't catching up anytime soon. Still, /something/ more could have helped, if only against the Death Eaters.

And though I understand why JKR went the way she did in the final battle (it was never going to be some epic fantasy-esque duel), I also think it could have been made better. Perhaps Harry & Voldemort race to the Room of Requirement to get the Diadem, and rather than dueling Voldemort head on, Harry has to just keep Voldemort behind him. Or something, I dunno.

As for my own choices, one would be to make Harry more proactive and generally better at magic. It seemed like JKR was going in this direction with Prisoner of Azkaban, but then decided to make him more just above average when it came to his peers.

As for two other things, I agree with [[/u/Deathcrow]]. 2) Scrap HBP and 3) Scrap DH. Especially in regards to Hermione's character. Everytime I relisten to those two audiobooks I want to write a Hermione bashing story just to get the frustration out of my system.

Make it so because When Dumbledore looks in the mirror to see Grindelwald and Ariana he knows he has to do everything in his power to help Harry. With this solid foundation he sets for Harry it opens up more possibilities in thefuture books, GOF and onward.

Also to the people who say it isn't worth it because he can't catch up in experience I would like to point out that Voldemort has spent from 1981-1994 as a Wraith. He graduated in 1945 giving him 36 yrs to learn different things. It is also believed he worked at Borgin and Burkes til around 1961 which leaves 20 odd years of the unknown to becoming the dualist he was. Final point is that I think his new body made from the ritual might hurt him in someway, hold him back in a way his original body didn't

*/1. Either ditch or completely rewrite the Epilogue./* Most importantly, /change the name of Harry's second son/, even assuming I keep that part of it at all...which is not likely.

*/2. Severely overhaul the relationships angle for most of the paired characters./* Harry/Ginny is severely underdeveloped, Lavender/Ron is a completely unnecessary Romantic Plot Tumor, Harry/Cho is badly mishandled and borders on RPT as well.

*/3. Drastically alter the inter-House dynamic./* As it is, Gryffindor is The Good Guy House, Slytherin is The Bad Guy House, Ravenclaw is The Nerd House - and even that's an informed ability, since there's no Ravenclaw ever actually shown to be substantially /equal/ to Hermione, much less superior. And Hufflepuff is The Sort-of-there-but-basically-irrelevant House in five of six books that are set at Hogwarts. One idea I had was to have the main characters be students from different Houses, rather than lumping all of them together into Gryffindor.

- ditto with vernon and petunia, but to a lesser extent

- scrap snape being a professor entirely. give him a more active role in defeating voldemort, and more opportunities to show off his skills. he doesn't die at the end of the series, and walks free

** Great question!

This might be a bit different to some answers, but, I actually have (little to) no qualms with the epilogue, call me old fashioned, and the main pairings, so these will just be small things.

1. Less final pairings of people they dated when they were 16-17. JK, you established that wizards are longer-lived than Muggles, so everyone getting married to their teenage friends and/or getting married and having kids at 20-21 is really unrealistic. I would be fine with keeping Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny, but would prefer them to be two outliers among their classmates which would also help them stand out due to their experiences.

2. Lupin/Tonks is never a thing and Lupin is canonically bisexual or gay. He might still need to die for thematic/JK's endgame purposes, unfortunately, but we would neatly sidestep the weird absentee!father + adventurer/reliving his youth Lupin beat that we hit in DH, the weird student-teacher thing, and the sudden (what I feel to be) straightwashing of a character explicitly introduced as an allegory of someone living with HIV, written at a time when that was strongly connotated with the LGBT community. Also, by extension this would probably spare Tonks and leave Harry and co with a female role model who isn't a matron or an old maid, as well as sparing Andromeda what in canon feels like a harsh belated punishment for leaving the Blacks.

3. Ron doesn't choose to leave out of the blue in DH, or, if he has to leave, some other means comes up or it is more explicitly caused by the Horcrux. After the same beat happening in GOF, it struck me as off for it to repeat, as well as out of character a little for it to be the boy raised in poverty on hand-me-downs and rough and tumble play who breaks from a few months in the outdoors, as opposed to Harry or Hermione. I would have found Hermione snapping to be more realistic, as well as stronger thematically and from a story perspective to both equalize Ron and Hermione as Harry's friends, as well as to bring them together as having similar flaws, and also to come full circle to book 1 when Ron was Harry's first real friend. It would also help to counter the image of movie!Ron as useless and a poor friend.

If you're making an allegory (which I think Rowling was), I think it's helpful not to hit the nail /too/ hard. Basically it's better for the sake of the allegory if Lupin isn't gay because if he was, readers might just think that other characters don't like him because he's gay. The theme that I get from Rowling (see also hatred of muggleborns) is that people will find something to hate about other people even if it seems ridiculous to other people. Making Lupin gay would dilute that theme.

I just think its mean to queercode characters and then pair them up, and then to also explicitly rule out bisexuality.

Sure, Lupin may have been an HIV metaphor - but his 'condition' also works as a nice implicit metaphor for being a gay teacher written at a time when homosexuality and pedophilia were strongly conflated by the mass media.

As a queer kid growing up who didn't know about STDs that was always my take-away - confirmed bachelor, good with kids but not a dad, openly a fan of chocolate and sweet foods (just like Dumbledore), never shows any inkling whatsoever of a wife or girlfriend, seems pretty outcast by a society which seems just as heteronormative as our own...I mean, draw your own conclusions but there was a lot of fuel there. Before we even get into his single-minded devotion to Sirius, the hug, the wolf-dog connection, and them buying Harry a present from them both.

To address that point directly also, it's not like no gay people ever have married the opposite sex and had a kid.

Beyond that as someone who's been an adult in the fandom for a long time, it was tacitly assumed by many fans from POA to GOF and beyond that Lupin and Sirius were lowkey lovers and that JK simply wasn't able to be explicit about it. Both Lupin and Tonks are heavily queercoded as well - which was why then shifting gears and pairing them in HBP came across as a slap in the face for many adult and LGBT fans. JK has since expressed that Lupin and Tonks are both definitely straight addinv fuel to the fire - though no doubt come 2020 she'll u-turn on that for brownie points.

Essentially all my post does is ressurect those beliefs of us early fans before JK had her first apparent u-turn and, apparently, a chunk of the younger fandom went with her for the sake of getting (yet) another heterosexual otp because we didn't have enough of those in the universe.
