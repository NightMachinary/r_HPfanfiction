*** Circular Reasoning is legend. If you're into dystopian themes, angst, all things gore, bloody and dark, you won't find a better fanfic.

*** For the people of DLP "Circular Reasoning is one of those fics that you have to go back to simply because it's one of the few creme de la creme of it's kind in fanfiction.

*** I think it was less than a year, and the chapter is especially long, it has more than 17 000 words. Also the quality of the writing (writing style and plot wise) is really worth reading, even if it takes a while to update.
