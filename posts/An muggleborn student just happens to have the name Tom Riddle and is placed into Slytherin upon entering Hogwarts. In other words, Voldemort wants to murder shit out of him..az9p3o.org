*** even better :

Dumbledore almost shits himself because he thinks its Voldemort with some kind of time travel magic.

So he wants to murder him but because he (for some reason) doesn't want anyone to know that Voldemorts real name is Tom Riddle he can't openly murder a eleven year old child.

Voldemort also thinks it is himself with time travel and wants to keep himself save (plays in the first book so Voldemort is Quirrel).

So Tom kinda befriends wit Harry a bit (Voldemort and Dumbledore think this some kind of evil ploy) and tags along to go after the stone(he wants to prove it's not Snape that wants to steal it).

When they finally reach the stone (because of plot Tom joins Harry into the room where Quirrel is but nor Hermione) they see it was Quirrel, because Voldemort doesn't want his "other self" to know its him he just lets Quirrel deal with them.

After they talk a bit Quirrel touches Harry, explodes an Harry and Tom fall unconscious.

Dumbledore enters the room and thinks it his chance to finally kill Tom because it was clearly him who killed Quirrel and only failed on Harry because of Lillys protection.

Just as Dumbledore was about to cast the spell Mcgonagall and Snape enter the room stopping Dumbledore unknowingly.
