I'm new to this site and while I'm not completely new to fanfiction, I'm not exactly an 'old stager' either. But I am a failed fanfiction writer; I'm just no good at it and I know it enough that I can be fairly objective. Every so often I find myself trying to work out what that magic formula is that makes a story really press the right buttons to become popular. I've tried to work it out and while I can see broad similarities in some popular fics, I can't put my finger on the mystery ingredients. I do know that fabulous prose isn't one! So does being a good fanfic writer translate into being a good writer of original fiction? Does being a bad fanfic writer mean you're a bad writer altogether? What is the magic formula, and is it different outside fanfiction?

#+end_quote

Absolutely not. Being a good fiction author translates well into fanfiction, but not vice versa.

I think fanfiction that is popular (I want to stress that there are objective marks of quality that make good fiction what it is, that /most/ Most Favorited fanfictions do not meet), is fanfiction that hits the nerve of a particular part of the fandom or even its entirety with the right inputs to kickstart their own imagination of things.

I think a lot of readers on FFN look frantically for confirmation of their own fanon. If you can satisfy this need, you get a lot of readers.

I'm sure this isn't even close to all factors, but I feel it is a huge one.

** I'm sure there are hundreds of different things people can come up with. But for me, I always appreciate a story that a) doesn't treat me like I'm an idiot and b) doesn't lay everything out right away

So what I mean by that is:

a) Learn the art of subtlety. You don't have to outline every single feeling. Readers can read between the lines. If someone says something in sarcasm, you don't have to add "he said sarcastically". In fact, just get rid of adverbs altogether. For me, they break immersion because they are the opposite of subtle. Basically, just leave more to the imagination.

b) This second point is especially true for AU stories. If there's a divergence in canon, you don't have to spend the entire first chapter outlining all the differences. Give it some time, give the reader some mystery. And only point out differences when it makes sense to in the story. For example, Harry isn't going to meet someone on the train to Hogwarts and share his whole life story to them. Nobody does that. We share things with each other bit by bit. Don't worry about the reader not getting the whole picture right away. That's fine. It even becomes more engaging that way.

The same is true for new characters. This is one of the reasons I think most people don't like OCs. You get their whole back story before you even grow to actually care about them when it should, in fact, be the opposite.

Anyway, these are just two points, but there are so many other things that go into making a good story. Basically though, just remember. Less is more.

For writing generally I certainly agree with that, but from what I can see, that doesn't seem to apply to fanfiction. The more subtle and thoughtful fics seem to be the ones that get lost. Is your experience different?

**** The thing is, as others have mentioned, there's often a difference between popular fics and good fics (unfortunately). But I can tell you that the truly good fics I've read have mastered this art. And while they may not have 1000 reviews, the reviews they do have are the quality kind. And I think 1 quality review beats 100 'update soon' reviews any day.

If you want a good example of subtlety, I would recommend the one-shot linkffn(Cauterize). Funnily enough, this one actually does have 1000+ reviews.

***** Oh yes, that's firmly on my favourites already. In fact it was reading that and her other stories that turned me on to fanfiction, while simultaneously making me feel I was wasting my time writing it. There aren't many stories of that calibre though.

And another thing I can say about that is about a year ago I reported a user for plagiarising that story (I never report for anything else). They had changed the character names and listed in in another fandom. It had only gathered a few reviews - less than ten I think - over a few weeks, so it seems it's not enough to be good; time and place (metaphorically speaking) is important too.

****** This is a good example of a fic that is long enough to carry out its mission. Most fan fiction is written without a story in mind or one that is vaguely outlined. And so the filler parts and poorly executed turns seem just like that, poorly executed filler.

Another good point about categorize is that it's length doesn't make the lack of style grating. If you take a look you'll see that the fix is written in the past tense and is in passive voice, yet it doesn't seem flat because it is full of substance, short and doesn't beat around the bush.

To summarize - if you want to write a better Fanfic, write it only so long as it needs to be, defining all of your good ideas well, and omitting anything that you see as weak or not worthwhile. Have a good story, write it well. Probably not much help but it seems to be the rarest sort of fic.

** There are two things about within a fanfiction that can make or break a story for me, but anyone can fix easily: spelling and grammar. The author may be weaving the most amazing story, but that won't matter if I don't make it to the second chapter because the author keeps mixing up their theirs and theres, and continually miss spells words making it seem like it was written by a preteen who's failing English.

I also really dislike when HP fanfic authors have the clearly English characters refer to their mothers as "mom" instead of "mum". However, I recently learned that the US editions switched a lot of British colloquial out for US equivalents leading a lot of kids to believe that mom was the correct British term, so I just have to get over myself on that one.

And I do notice and dislike Americanisms in HP fanfiction - but I don't believe it has any effect on popularity because most of the readers are from the US and don't notice them.

**** You're right that Americanisms don't seem to affect popularity of stories much. Afterall, I watched enough American TV programming as a kid that it takes me a while to notice Fall vs Autumn. But I wasn't talking about popularity (it's very hard to pin down), mearly what makes a 'good' fanfiction in my opinion.

If you have an American character then their use of Americanisms would be natural. Having them use "mum" would be weird. But I think if your fiction is set in a specific country and your characters are from there, then using the local terms in their dialogue and making sure they celebrate the right national holidays is important. I once read a fanfic where Harry and co were celebrating Thanksgiving at Hogwarts like it happened every year. Things like that really annoy me, is all.

***** Yeah, I'm guilty of completely disregarding any story that has an OC as the main character. This is personally for two reasons:

1) I generally read fanfiction to see the characters in that universe take on new and exciting challenges. Not a new character take on that universe.

2) I have seen a lot of OC's that either aren't well fleshed out, are super OP, or some combination of the two. I guess it has just left a bad taste in my mouth.

But I have also seen some OC's that avoid the pitfalls of the second bullet, while simultaneously complementing a main character from the universe. I thoroughly enjoy stories that manage to accomplish this, but they are so few and far between that I don't feel it is worth the effort to wade through all of fics that don't meet my tastes.

****** I'm the same. I actually don't read much fanfic because I'm so picky.

I have written an OC though. And, as you pointed out, I didn't want her to be the only main character so I wrote her to complement Harry. I think a majority of people are coming to Harry Potter fanfiction to read and write about Harry, or at least another major character. A bunch of OCs means you have to take a lot of time to emotionally invest, with no guarantee it will be worth it at the end.

I think if I had started with my current fic it would have been completely ignored.

** I think there's been a lot of good advice said so far (especially that good and popular are not one in the same), but I think there is a lot to be said about practice.

You say that you're a failed fanfiction writer. You've only failed if you've given up. I don't know how long you've been writing, but I get the feeling that you might be a newer writer (I apologize if I am wrong in that regard.) Nearly all writers suck and fail early on. I've been writing HP fanfiction for a LONG time and the early fanfics that I wrote were absolute shit. You can't even find them anywhere (at least I hope so). But those early fics of mine were so important to my development as a writer.

I would recommend: 1. Not giving up 2. Keep writing 3. Find a beta/editor (or even a few!) I would also not worry so much about writing something that is popular. Write what interests you.

And don't forget: Practice, practice, practice. (Someone somewhere once said that you have to have written....I think it was 300,000 words before you could be considered a good writer)

I'd have thought more than that even.

Well, I use the word 'failed' as there doesn't seem to be another way of putting it without being disingenuous. I started writing my first story just over two years ago and started posting it a few months later. Since then I've been on a steep learning curve and archived about 200k words on ffn across four completed multichapters and some one-shots. I honestly don't think what I've done is altogether shit. It's certainly not great literature and there are a few things I wish I'd done differently, but on the whole I quite like them still. They just aren't what most fanfic readers are looking for.

** Factors I consider objective (i.e. universal regardless of taste):

- No errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation and formatting is a minimum requirement for being considered good. (Will forgive one or two typos, no one can catch everything)

- The fanfiction should be able to stand on its own feet. So, for example, if you're writing an OotP AU and you introduce occlumency, since it hasn't appeared in the first four books from which your story continues, you should fully introduce the concept as if your reader has never heard of it before.

- Consistency in character abilities and actions. There's nothing more frustrating than characters making uncharacteristic decisions or temporarily gaining/losing abilities just for the sake of shoehorning a certain plotline.

- Dynamic characters with believable motivations, desires, plans and actions. These characters should exhibit the ability to change and learn. They should not make arbitrarily stupid decisions or assumptions just so that your protagonist can have an easy victory over them.

- Conflict. The protagonist must face some kind of challenge with a real risk (or actuality) or loss.

- Dialogue that is realistic (i.e. with identifiable character voices, featuring elements of real conversation such as interruptions and tangents) without being actually real (real conversation is too unfocused, the story needs conversation to drive the plot/characterisation somewhere substantial).

- One major plot/characterisation point per chapter.

- A plot structure that has a clear beginning, middle and end, that doesn't dawdle or meander.

- Descriptions that know how to leave most of the scene to the reader's imagination to fill in the gaps.

- Progress. Things should not stay the same for a large part of the story. People, or the situation, should be changing.

Non-objective factors:

- Factual canon compliance, where "canon" means book canon.

- Tonal canon compatibility, where canon means the original 7 books.

- Harry-centric with a pro-active Harry whose best traits are emphasised.

- Set at Hogwarts.

- No crack.

- No Muggle wank.

A writer need to question "has this been done before." If it has been, do you have the skill and style to overshadow the others? I agree with the people who said a bit of mystery is important, the info dump will cause me to lose interest pretty quickly. I like stories that show me a different side of a character, or answer a question I didn't know I had. For example, the story "The Little ones" describes what happens at Kings Cross during years 7.

** In my opinion, a good fanfic first needs good planning.

One aspect is the speed of events. There are fics, that are so fast-paced, as reader you lose sight of what's happening. Then there are stories, that focus a whole chapter on each day. That's alright if your overall plot is about a short time or it's an important time, but if - let's say - you want to write a story about the seven years in Hogwarts and spend 100 chapters on the first two years, readers might lose interest, especially if not too much is happening and you describe lunch with five paragraphs.

Another thing is the overall plot. As writer, you gotta plan roughly, how many chapters you are planning and vaguely the content. I have read fics, where the author clearly planned the first eight chapters and then the plot takes a sharp turn because he had no plans for the ninth chapter.

If the planning is done well, the quality can't be too bad, assuming you have some talent for writing in general and your plot isn't ridiculous.
