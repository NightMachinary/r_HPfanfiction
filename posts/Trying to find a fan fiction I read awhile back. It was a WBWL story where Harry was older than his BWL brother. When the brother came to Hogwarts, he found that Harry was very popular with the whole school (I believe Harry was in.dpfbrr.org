#+TITLE: Trying to find a fan fiction I read awhile back. It was a WBWL story where Harry was older than his BWL brother. When the brother came to Hogwarts, he found that Harry was very popular with the whole school (I believe Harry was in Slytherin). Any clue?

***** I know! Canon rehashes suck. I do not respect AUs that pretty much copy canon. You can easily play with the timeline. Voldemort only made it to the school because of Quirrell. The diary was dropped on Ginny probably because of the muggle protection act. Sirius only escaped Azkaban because of the picture of Peter. Voldemort only got his body because Peter freed Barty Crouch Jr.

I also hate revisionist history. You know when the author takes a canon event and makes their favored character do X action instead of another character to "fix" canon. Or for want of a nail fics that completely change a character. Like Harry asks out Hermione but +Ron is a bigot+.

He definitely is. His bigotry against everything Slytherin is right up there with Draco's bigotry against everything muggle.
