Why haven't we read about someone trying to pay for items with actually Galleons, the boats, actual sickles, the harvesting tool, and actual nuts, just some acorns with a K painted on them---to make them Knuts? I can definitely imagine Sirius wanting to do this, if he hadn't been imprisoned he probably would have had the money available to do this (legally). And when someone asks him if he's serious about trying to pay for a butter beer with some farm equipment and acorns he could say, “of course I'm Sirius!”


** I'm going to guess that no one's written a story with this because, like the Sirius/Serious joke, it'd quickly lose the novelty and humor.

The difference between the Sirius/Serious joke and this is that this takes up much more space within the story, hence why repeating it would quickly become a detriment to a story.

*** Unless it's some sort of collection of pranks fanfic. Then it could stay young for at least a chapter.

*** “That'll be 17 Sickles to a Galleon, but this one seems to have a bit of wear and tear on it, did you use it for this years harvest? So, I'll need two Knuts as well. “ “Here you go.” “Alright, Jones will take you out back to the harbor.”
