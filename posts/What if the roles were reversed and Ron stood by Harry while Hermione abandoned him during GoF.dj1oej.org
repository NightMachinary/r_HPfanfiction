This thought randomly popped up into my head and I want to know what you guys think.


** I think for this to work perhaps we can change WHEN it happens.

So instead of Hermione immediately turning on Harry when his name comes out of the Goblet perhaps he should do it after the First Task. Hermione is only really shown to be jealous of Harry (particularly, upset when he shows her up) in the Half Blood Prince. So maybe him making a spectacle by out flying a dragon and mastering the Summoning Charm (with enough skill to earn massive praise from Flitwick) Hermione THEN doesn't want anything to do with Harry, becomes very jealous and refuses to speak to him.

She then spends her time with Viktor, the argument she and Ron gets into (at the Yule Ball) has a bit more emotional weight behind it and is less of Ron being jealous and insecure and then Hermione can have a turn around after the Second Task (maybe by seeing how lost he was without help and how he got really lucky with the Gillyweed or by finding out that he waited to make sure she was rescued) and "redeems" herself by helping him in earnest for the Final Task.

I think this scenario may hinge on Hermione feeling a bit inadequate (most of the info Harry got for the First Task that helped wasn't from her) and everyone singing his praises and seeing the skill he has would be more likely to cause her to do a Ron over his name simply coming out of the Goblet.

*** I think you'd need to change a bit more there - because in the books, the only reason Harry does that Summoning Charm at all is because Hermione spent /ages/ on making sure he got it. In that case, I don't see it making much sense for her to get jealous over it.

She gets more jealous when he doesn't do it with her help, really - or she feels he 'cheated'. I think we'd need to add in another twist to make it more believable - maybe the common fanfic route of making him more powerful, perhaps, or having someone else help him as well? Actually, maybe an easy road would be to take the Horcrux and do something with it (the stress/fear making it pollute Harry's thoughts for a bit? When he's in mortal danger, /something/ happens? IDK).

It is tough for me to picture a canon Hermione through the start of book 4 abandoning Harry in the tournament without some large-ish change - either to personality or to the situation.

**** I agree with you here, but I was trying to rework the scenario by not adding anything to canon. Honesty, I really don't see Hermione turning on Harry at all, but if it HAD to happen then I think that would be an alright way for it to go down.

Maybe Ron "brags" about Harry's flying and how he would have been a goner if Hagrid hadn't told him about the dragon and it all rubs Hermione the wrong way because SHE HELPED TOO but all the recognition goes to Harry. She is very used to (at this point in the books and maybe even her whole life) receiving credit where she deserves it and seeing Harry receive all the praise rubs her the wrong way.

She and Harry have a 'talk' about it but Hermione's emotions are running high, Harry has never been too good at defusing a situation and in turn gets irritated and they fall out (identical to how Ron and Harry's fallout went down). Then everything occurs as I previously stated.

***** Oh, definitely - you do have as reasonable a way of doing so given the constraints of canon, it's just hard to picture.

To add a twist, maybe we can add another bit to it? Maybe instead of Hagrid revealing the dragons, it's Charlie or Ron that does so, despite the ongoing spat. So then when Ron and Harry make up, Ron's bragging about how it's basically him who helped Harry make it out by telling him about the dragons - and their recent fallout makes it so that Harry is gingerly walking around saying that it's not really the case, causing Hermione to act out that way.

That doesn't fit with the reversed roles, of course, but I think it'd be the smallest/most reasonable changes in canon that could have Hermione falling out for a bit with Harry in such a dangerous position.

****** Though I like this and can kinda see it being in character for Ron and Hermione would definitely be mad, I don't understand how Hermione would be mad at Harry in this scenario. Ron ABSOLUTELY but not Harry, especially if he's going around trying to set the record straight. I see you mention it doesn't fit the reversed roles but I don't think Hermione would be unhappy with Harry specifically. Maybe she'd try and make him 'choose'to be friends with one over the other? Maybe she'd be mad that Ron suddenly comes back into the picture and she feels like he's forgotten all the hard work she put in whilst he ignored him? That would maybe work in canon (though I don't think Hermione would be that petty).

*** While I dont have a specific scenario as to how I think its possible to maybe build on issues they had during their argument in book 3 in addition to the jealousy aspect.

Harry was mad with her because she went and told Mcgonnigal about the fireboldt and got it confiscated. Sure her concerns were valid but it was Harry's broom and she didnt even consider talking to him about it before deciding that what she was doing was for the best. Which even it is , its an attitude that can damage friendships. This issue is resolved because they decide Hermione is more important than a broom and a rat. The broom also gets returned and the rat is Pettigrew. Plus they do like her and dont want her isolated and miserable. But this also means that the issue Harry had with her actions isnt necessarily adressed.

So if Hermione and Harry have a falling out in book 4 maybe it can build on those unresolved issues. So lets say Harry and Ron dont have this fight. Ron notices Harrys very stressed and awkward about all this or something and realizes that hey he didnt want it. So instead works with Hermione to get Harry prepared.

But Hermione starts getting a bit too controlling over the whole thing. She pushes for Harry to do all these things that she thinks will help him. Often signing him up for things or suprising him with training without consulting him or considering his comfort level.

Or maybe she tells the prophet certain things on Harrys behalf in order to perpetuate a certain image and help him. But Harry is very uncomfortable with the results and/or is mad she did it without consulting him. And she doesnt understand the problem cuz things turned out fine in her opinion.

Either way this leads to a huge fight at some point at least after the first task. And either its resolved by the end of the fourth year or in the begining of fifth year.

I would love to read a fic where Hermione abandons Harry in GoF. Where Ron is the more loyal friend. There doesn't have to be bashing involved, but it would be a nice change from all the other fics where Ron is only written as slightly less worse than Voldemort.

** /I invoke the Lingling insurance against Hermione stans. Please, I'm just trying to answer OP's question./

The scenario I could imagine for Ron to come to his senses quicker was that instead of sulking, Ron would straight up get angry and yell at or even punch Harry right after the announcement for supposedly hiding a way to get to the Goblet. And then they have a huge row where everyone in the Great Hall can hear Harry shouting that he didn't put his name in and he didn't know what was happening. Somehow, this earlier confrontation brings Ron to his senses, as opposed to the book where his negative thoughts were allowed to fester during the time that all the Champions were led away for their briefing and all the other students were told to go back to their rooms. It also prevents Harry from just walking to the other room without protesting at all, which we readers know was because he was shocked, but to the rest of the people made him look like a willing participant.

As for the falling out with Hermione, the best I could come up with is a scenario where Harry is hellbent on getting out of the Tournament and asks Ron to ask his dad and Percy for advice on any loopholes in the law to get Harry out of the tournament and Bill to find out if the Goblet was cursed. On the other hand, Hermione believes Dumbledore and Crouch's pronouncement that the contract is binding and non negotiable so she nags Harry about studying and preparing for the tasks. This grates on Harry's nerves until they have an argument about priorities. Hermione stomps off saying she'll just watch if he can survive without her.

The first task draws near and no one is close to finding out how to break the contract yet. Meanwhile, Hermione really wants to apologize but her pride also wants her to make Harry (and Ron) realize that she is the brains of their group and they can't cook up a good plan without her. The day of the first task comes and she discovers it's dragons, along with the crowd. She panics about Harry dying but when it's Harry's turn he already has come up with a spectacular plan to "participate" in the task in such a ridiculous, hilarious & entertaining way which makes it clear that he so does not want this.

Hermione gets her wake up call that 1) yes, she's intelligent but she's not always the most intelligent person in the room, and 2) just because an idea is silly, she should not dismiss it as a solution. She and Harry make up but she is surprised to see just how much Harry's circle of friends and advisors has expanded (i.e. The Weasleys, Lupin, Sirius, Harry's roommates). Harry realized while she was gone how much he had depended on her before and also got a wake up call that there are other people he could ask and trust.

If someone were to write a fic out of this, I think it might be good if it was a comedy or parody.

Like what the other replies mentioned, Hermione wouldn't be jealous of Harry getting the glory so I tried to explore Hermione's canon character traits such as respect for rules and authority, "I'm clever and I know it," holding grudges and looking down on people who seem to be stupid or silly.

You lost me there. I really dislike the trope that Ron and Hermione were holding Harry back from forming other friendships. I can see the part where Harry gets Sirius and the adult Weasleys involved (Lupin did not care about Harry in the TWT at all).

But that wouldn't magically make Dean want to hang out with Harry more, even if Harry was looking for someone to fill the hole Hermione has left.

**** OK, I respect that.

For the roommates, this is not really about Harry /actively/ looking for people to replace Hermione and more of him and his room mates getting to do silly stuff together. I know it was a scene added only in the 4th movie that didn't exist in the books but I liked the part where he and the boys were just sitting around eating the Every Flavored Beans and other candies. I guess with Harry and Ron not fighting at that time, the atmosphere in their dorm would be lighter and conducive to the guys getting to know each other a bit more, which in turn will prevent a Book 5 scenario from happening.

TBH, I feel like JK forgot about the existence of Lupin in the 4th book and just remembered he existed in the 5th, which makes him a plot device rather than a person. But then again, she was making things up as she went along so this is not really different from, say, a manga artist forgetting that a previous character of his had a power that could defeat their enemy right now.

***** The thing is, while Harry isn't estranged from his roommates, they aren't friends. Dean and Seamus do their thing, Harry and Ron theirs and Neville, well he's overused in fanfics anyway. They might have some fun together, but with everything else going on, especially with the more proactive approach for Harry, he won't really have much time to form deep friendships within less than four weeks. Especially since Dean and Seamus already have a dynamic with each other and lack an incentive to do much with Harry.

I would argue that abandoning people is one of Lupin's defining traits, so it wasn't OOC or forgotten.

Characterization did. You give Harry more friends and the villains' writing suffers.

Neville could easily be replaced with an animated statue with a sword for instance.

That being said, Hermione was used for exposition a great deal. Reducing that means having another way to have Harry learn things to forward the plot.

With the scenario that the OP had in mind, it follows that the characterizations would shift as well, and one of the possible consequences could be making Harry getting to get along with others differently from how canon went. Perhaps not a deep friendship but at least enough to not make the people immediately around him believe rumors so easily.

** This came up a while back with a discussion of how the books would have been if Ron had been the consistent friend to Harry and Hermione was the one with a rocky relationship with them. Ron might still be jealous about the Tournament, but he would believe Harry about the Goblet and would put aside his jealousy and help Harry figure out how to survive a dragon--something he's uniquely positioned to do because of Charlie.

Hermione, meanwhile, wouldn't be jealous and wouldn't outright disbelieve Harry, I think. However, she would be nosy and suspicious and would question his honesty, especially after the First Task. She would also be preoccupied with figuring out how he was entered over actually helping him.

I didn't think about fourth year in more depth at the time, but I think I would first drop some hints that hostages have been used in past Tournaments early, even before the selection, as a result of Hermione's research. Or maybe even make them common knowledge since the Tournament was /supposed/ to be historically famous. Next, change it so that Fleur succeeds in the second task, while Krum either fails or hurts Hermione with his shark teeth. Harry then saves Hermione and Ron together, and it's a wake-up call for Hermione to see that she's been a lousy friend, and there's no way Harry would risk his friends' lives to enter the Tournament.

I had ideas for the next three books, but not in as much detail. Ron believes Harry about Malfoy in Book 6, for example, and Hermione gets impatient with the horcrux hunt before Ron and leaves to try to do it on her own. I'd like to see this story someday, but with the state of the community, I don't know if anyone would take a serious crack at it.

Ron's defining character flaw is he can't stand being outshined and excluded. Thus, him ignoring Harry 4th year is within believable character for him given his understanding.

Hermione doesn't have that issue in her character matrix. Some authors try to cast her as competitive, getting angry if someone steals too academic spot from her, but it isn't really shown to be that way in the books at all. She is just enthusiastically into magic and trying to know as much as possible, not a competitive class ranking based spirit.

Now Hermione does have her flaws, primarily when she convinces herself she is right. So that would be the angle that makes most sense to explore.

Except in HPB where she was pissy that Harry was better than her in Potions and was saying that the Potions book he was using was evil. Harry even calls her out on it, but then all is forgiven because plot needs to happen.

Her biggest flaw is convincing herself she is right and refusing to see any other viewpoint even when the facts are shoved in her face. See: the earlier Potions book debacle, Malfoy doing something nefarious, house-elves wanting to be free (looking at Winky when freed by Crouch Sr., and the Hogwarts house-elves when Hermione tries to free them as prime examples of her being wrong), and Oblivate-ing her parents.....just to name a few.

******* I actually like your example because I think it explains what the issue is here. There's a really great YA book called with the Fire on High that has a main character with an instinct for cooking that takes a cooking class. She constantly clashes with the teacher because she'll make edits to the recipe, and that's not what she's supposed to be doing. She's supposed to follow it. He explains to her why that's so important: consistency, preventing allergies, and well, because sometimes instincts are wrong.

What Harry does is take different steps from the book they're supposed to be using. If he actually had an instinct for potions, he might understand what they mean. He doesn't. He's depending on the fact that this person is right. Not only could this cause issues -- we don't know that the ingredients available in Snape's student years are the same as the one Harry uses -- but he's falsifying having this instinct for potions. He isn't doing more work for it. He didn't look up new instructions and put it academic rigor, or experiment a la Weasley twin. He's just going on blind faith that these instructions are better than the original ones in a subject he's not the best at. That's reckless.

Ehh, but even the potions book is described more as "it is wrong" and "it is cheating" than "I am super competitive and need to be on top".

Hermione's flaw is that she crusades for what she considers right, damn the consequences. My point to the OP is you need to make her conflict with Harry about that. (Instead of a feeling of inferiority and being left out)

Which probably leads to a very different situation. Such as Hermione convincing herself a path Harry does not want is the best path forward and doing it against his will. You can still have a wedge between them, you just want to use a different wedge...

Realistically, it first should have taken a lot longer for Harry to forgive Hermione for her not believing him, and I think Ron, that Lockhart wasn't a good professor and had no idea what he was doing. After that, there should have still been a rift that would have been widened a lot more with the secrecy of the Time Turner and culminating in them no longer being close friends by the end of HBP.

  Oblivate-ing her parents
#+end_quote

Minor nitpick here, it's only Movie Canon that Hermione used the Obliviate spell on her parents, in the book she just used some unnamed memory charm(s) on them. For all we know, she could've used a combination of the Confundus to alter what they think their names are and some form of compulsion spell to get them to move to Australia.

***** The point is that she messed with her parents' minds. I used the general term of "obliviate-ing" to show that she erased parts of their memories (anything involving Hermione) to get them to move to Australia....while also altering their motivations and their identities.

** Hermione is by no means perfect. Like others in this thread have said, she has character flaws, and these are a part of what makes her a believable, complex, character. So I could envision a scenario in which what you've just put forward does happen. That being said, my favorite part of the books was Harry's and Hermione's friendship, and I'll personally not read a fic with the above scenario. I dunno if this makes me closed minded, but there ya go.

** Hermione's outstanding character trait is her loyalty to Harry and her willingness to cross lines for him. She lacks social graces, but she is there for Harry.

Which is the reason why "Hermione abandons Harry" is my least favourite divergence. You can avoid their friendship with an AU 1st year, but once they are friends, there needs to be a proper reason why she would ditch him (eg Harry starts to torture people for fun).

#+end_quote

So is Ron if you look at the books before Goblet of Fire. His reaction to Harry's name being drawn was a departure from his previous characterization (Harry's surprise at Ron being jealous is a good indication of that). Hermione not believing Harry could certainly happen if she thinks she has a good reason to think he's not telling the truth. After all, Hermione not willing to change her mind when she thinks she's right is as much of a defining character trait as her loyalty to Harry.

** There is no kind way to put it: Harry would have been much happier (only marginally though).

The thing is that Harry and Ron have more common interests and behaviors with each other than with Hermione. The two are mainly friends with her because of the shared morals/values/history/comraderie/etc. That is not to say they wouldn't be friends with her (they would always want to), it would just be easier for both of them to stomach.

Its actually not impossible to conceive either. On Ron's side, you just have to have to do one or more of the following:

1. Harry being more cognizant of the difference in status he holds over his friends (wealth, reputation, lifestyle and so on)
2. Make Ron see the threat to Harry more clearly (have them look up the tournaments history for example).
3. Have Ron start with Quidditch or something to boost his confidence or show Harry as being unskilled or lacking in something important (both of which Rowling waited too long to do or barely did at all).

For Hermione, its also relatively simple in that you only have to look at PoA or HBP. Hermione is /prideful,/ just as much as Ron is about many things. So use her whole thing about seeing Harry suddenly improving for one reason or another in magic (or general intelligence) and raise her jealousy up a notch. They're teenagers, this sort of thing happens all the time.

** I could see this maybe working under certain circumstances.

If, say, there was a set time limit to the events, Hermione might be of the opinion that Harry should simply wait out the time limit and not attempt to win as a sort of protest. She could suggest that he disillusion and shield himself for the first task and just stand there instead of approaching the dragon, and just wait at the starting point for the second and third tasks. But Harry, being Harry, wants to at least try to win and make people like Sirius proud. Hermione gets angry, thinks that he's risking his life for no good reason, and maybe even in a heated moment accuses him of entering on purpose. After this, they don't talk until after the first or second task when she decides that her friend's life is more important than their argument.

However, there's a difference between a flawless character depiction and taking away their defining attribute.

Because you would have to take away his core theme as well. At which point you aren't writing about Harry, Ron and Hermione, but Harry and two OCs.

She knows that the DoM is a Death Trap yet still goes. She suspects the Basilisk and still goes to the library to give Harry a fighting chance. She sets Snape on fire a few weeks into their friendship ffs. And she chose to stay with Harry over her romantic interests.

In order for Hermione to leave Harry in GoF, you would need to make bigger changes elsewhere, something OP didn't ask for. And those changes would make her ditching Harry way less impactful because you would need to make their bond less strong.
