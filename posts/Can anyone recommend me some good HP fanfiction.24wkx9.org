I'm looking for really good fanfiction on fanfiction.net. I tend to have pretty high standards so I only really want the good stuff. I'd just try to find some myself, but it seems like HP fanfiction is just infested with shitty fics.


** What kind of fics do you like and what do you consider good? I've read a LOT of them so I can probably recommend something.

*** I like any fic that focuses on Harry and is all around well done. Good writing, plot, etc. I've read and liked Methods of Rationality, Delenda Est, Prince of the Dark Kingdom, the saving Conner series, the firebird song series, Again and Again, Rebirth, and The Lie I've Lived. I prefer stories where Harry is darker, but that's not necesary and I prefer straight pairings over slash, but I'll read stories with slash pairings so long as it's not just one giant lemon.

**** Ok, so I can't link cause I'm on mobile, but everything I'll suggest is on ff.net.

There's Vox Corporis by MissAnnThropic. It's a Harry/Hermione story. It doesn't exactly match any of your preferences but is well written.

Brutal Harry by LordsFire explores a badly abused Harry who has had to learn to take care of himself being introduced into the magical world.

The Wise One: Book One: The Becoming is the start of a three part series. In this Harry is rescued from the Dursley's at 8 by Sirius and they leave Britain traveling around the world to keep Sirius hidden. The trilogy goes from the time he's 8 all the way through his teenage years.

The last one I'll recommend is Broken Mind, Fractured Soul by SensiblyTainted. This story deals with a Harry who is horrifically abused by the Dursley's having Multiple Personality Disorder. It's a story that has Snape as a mentor and as Harry gets older he's not light, but he's not exactly dark either. I'm currently in the middle of the sequel and it's a very interesting read. I should warn you that the sequel will have elements of slash, but it isn't the focus of the story.

Hope I could help! If you'd like more just let me know.

** Well, [[/u/wordhammer]] (author of one of my recs) suggests on his FFN profile page [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP_5_Starred_and_Featured_Authors/84507/99/1/1/][this up to date, DLP-related C2 list of fics on FFN]]. Also, my top recs, reposting from [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1qiha3/recommendation/][an old thread]] on completed fanfics.

--------------

I suggest:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda-Est]]

#+begin_quote
  By: Lord Silvere

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
#+end_quote

- Rated: Fiction T - Harry P., Bellatrix L. - Chapters: 46 - Words: 394,216

This one has some of the best time travel ever, and has alt history and alt present day characters that the author actually makes one care about. Harry has some idiotball issues, but he does in canon as well. Some people don't like the romance; that is the pair listed. I like the historic stuff, as it seem so well done. Original magical ideas that thankfully don't result in Harry immediately rolling over Voldemort. A good read.

and /maybe/ the extremely violent and body-horror-filled:

  By: wordhammer

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.
#+end_quote

- Rated: Fiction M - Adventure/Suspense - Harry P., Hermione G., N. Tonks - Chapters: 50 - Words: 405,903

I'm still not sure if I actually recommend this one. It is a thing that stands alone amongst all the sappy and crappy gray/dark Harry Azkaban shitfics. This story is *dark*, it is the exact opposite of a comfort fic, it does not have a happy ending, it does surprising and horrible things to the main character. It does have a sequel, which I have not gathered the courage to continue, but it stands alone just as well. And you'll be happy to finish it, because you know there isn't another chapter of the main character being tortured just a link away.

** Hogwarts Battle School is really good. Very interesting set up and the writting is terrific. If you like one shot I suggest Dearly Beloved by Digfruit.

*** I'm definitely going to read digifruit's HP stories sometimes. I've read all his Naruto stories and those were some of the best one shots I've ever read. Thanks for the suggestion.
