In my main HP story, I reference a lot of religious stuff. Harry didn't really get on well with Christian churches (for more naive reasons than anything), and most wizards's pagan views are hinted to be (broadly) a sort of mirror to how the Muggles are with respect to Christianity (or at least how Americans view them, whether true or not): most are quasi-adherents, more cultural than anything firm. A "do this 'cause it's tradition" mentality.

I really wanted to capture how they (especially the more strict adherents) would view the beliefs of Muggles. The occasional blithe remark about "silly Muggle ideas" by some, a less brunt yet still dismissive "Oh yes that's one of those Muggle religious things, right?" by others. It's not common and I don't go out of my way to do it. I didn't think much of how readers might take it, perhaps because my own atheistic views incline me not think about that too much. But it did give me an excuse to read about a lot of old religious cults and their beliefs and practices, which are fun to put a spin on in a story.

But I got a fun guest review (joy) in which they angrily communicated their disappointment with a remark Harry makes. So it got me wondering. How do you think a sensitive topic like religion ought to be handled in stories? Don't touch it? Keep it vague? Don't have characters voice their opinions (Subtly or not) about what they think? I thought my approach was realistic in terms of how people think about religions other than their own but evidently some people find that a bad mark against a story. Maybe there's no general rule here, hmm.


** Honestly? I think getting into how witchcraft is affected by religion, especially for muggleborns is very interesting. You just have to make it clear that the character's remarks don't fit into what you actually think of religion, and is instead a cultural thing for the characters in the story. I think it just has to do with your true intentions and how you approach the topic.

*** I think this makes the most sense. And I agree the Muggleborn view is interesting. In the chapter I released earlier this week, Mr. Granger is implied to be surprised that Harry's extended family really are practicing pagans when he sees a figure of Hecate outside one of their homes. I thought exploring that a bit would be interesting, as the next chapter (a Christmas party, oddly enough) has them see a bit more of what they do and believe.

** Christianity is like 2000 years old. The Statute of Secrecy was passed in the 1650's. Wizards /should/ have some idea about the local religions of where they live -- for British wizards, that's Protestant Christianity, for Indian wizards, Hinduism, etc. This is supported in the books when Draco Malfoy, from a traditionalist pureblood family, says things like "My God!" or "Saint Potter!". They don't pray to Jesus, but they're not totally ignorant.

My personal opinion is that religion shouldn't be mentioned unless it's relevant to the plot. If you're writing a Founder era story, or a story featuring Muggleborns, eg, Goldstein linkffn(10847788), by all means, bring up religion. But if you don't want to lose readers, don't bash for no reason, and do your fucking research.

The time period and setting of original flavor HP doesn't have much room for religion, so you have to be careful with how your incorporate it, if you're trying to capture the whimsy and magical feel. Religion is serious business to a lot of people.

*** Perhaps the implication wasn't clear, but my story is very AU. While wizards are more integrated into Muggle society (at least to the degree of better hiding themselves), they are not really culturally Christian. They know what surrounding Muggles believe but are somewhat dismissive of it. And as the story involves religion heavily as I said, it's not really me bringing it up for no reason or bashing anything (imo anyway).

But you say it shouldn't be mentioned unless relevant. Mentioned at all? No implications about what some character believes from what they say or do? Or just no overt speech about it? Even HP canon has some references to it, mild though they may be (the Bible verse on the Potters's grave comes to mind).

** IMHO it's not worth it. I have a similar opinion as [[/u/Taure]] that religion just doesn't mesh well with the Harry Potter universe. The occasional good stuff found in some fics about a Pagan wizarding world could have just been done with the rituals and culture, there's really no need to go into organized religion. On the other end of the spectrum I've seen plenty of stuff that made me cringe (Hermione inviting Harry to church and he realizes how loving and great god is, Dumbledore teaching Harry about Hecate).

Then there's the problem of divorcing your own opinions from what you write. This affects both atheists and christians: The dismissive and flippant tone of Wizards towards Muggle religions that you describe may reflect on how you as an atheist imagine an 'ideal' non-religious society. It can quickly give a reader the feeling that you're just on your soap box. What does throwing in occasional religious references really add to your story?

Sometimes I wonder whether a HP fic that focuses entirely on religion as its main topic (like science/rationality in HPMOR) could be done. Then you could take your time to really go into history and nuances without pissing off your readers.

It's primarily a matter of tone -- the same reason why space travel and the HP magic system do not mix well except in a crack fic -- but it's also a problem of "if you mention it, you have to address it". And having the HP characters talking about religion just feels wrong. I don't think there's any position they could adopt other than extreme agnosticism which would feel right.

But any wizard seriously following an organised religion would be akin to Stockholm syndrome, given the inquisition and similar witch hunts in other religions.

** I typically go with the Deist interpretation of the monotheist God as a primarily logical mathematical entity, such a being would probably despise magical effects for not making any empiric sense and therefore wizards would be forced to rely on pagan deities out of necessity. So they make Norse runes and watch the sky for Greek astrological constellations while chanting in anglicized Aramaic, but at the end of the day the God of Abraham is winning the divine popularity contest and so magical effects are entirely localized around the pagan wizard communities.

** I always thought he lack of religion in the original series was a bit strange. Religion plays an important role in people's lives and culture, and you would think wizards would still have some type of belief system. On the other hand, if you bring it into the story you do run the risk of offending people and soap box preaching is boring to read. I suppose you have to determine if it adds to your story or develops character, and decide if it's worth it.

Blue Gardenias and Poppy Seeds linkao3(7876690) has an interesting take on religion in magical society. It's a marriage law fic, but that's really not the main focus of the story. It sort of turns Hermione into an oddly traditionalist landed gentry type, which may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's got some interesting world-building in there. Religion is presented as being very central to traditional wizarding life, specifically Christan/Catholic with some Roman and pagan rites thrown in.

** I've used it. I don't make it a main thing, but elements are sprinkled in. A few times my Slytherin characters have said things unfavorable towards Christianity. I don't think that many pureblood families ignore what religions tried to hunt them down and burn them alive. I can see parents telling their kids this about the muggle world and teaching them that the religion is another aspect to hate. It's your story if it adds to the plot and you have reasons behind it then why not put it in? An example of mine is Neville said love thy neighbor and Pansy said “Dear Gods, are you telling me that not only is Longbottom a dirty blood traitor, but he's into their religion? Do you think it's the same one that says to burn us alive?” Ive shown that more of the pureblood characters are traditionally Pagan in religion celebrating the thinning of the veil with old rituals. At that celebration there is a few scenes where it's made very clear that a lot of the pureblood families have a lot of animosity towards Christianity and towards their worlds acceptance of a lot of Christian culture. I've also hinted that Neville is respectfully not religious. It's what forwards your story in the end. None of my readers seemed to mind, if they did they didn't mention it.

** I would say keep it subtle. Not necessarily vague because it's perfectly fine to say which religion someone is, but if you pick any religion in particular, you're going to offend people. And because writing good religious fiction is very difficult.

Personally, I do have a hard time seeing wizards as atheists (or at least materialists) because wizards /know/ there are such things as souls. They don't have to take that on faith because they've seen it. They wouldn't necessarily be Christians, but I think nearly all of them would have some faith.

That said, I think it's pretty clear that JKR meant most wizards to be culturally Christian, just like most Brits in the 1990s. Harry had a godfather, which in Britain is a specific religious role in the Church of England, and his parents and many other witches and wizards were burried in a church graveyard, which strongly suggests they were members. And wizards celebrate Christmas in something pretty close to the muggle way.

The way I handled religion in the Arithmancer series, it was mostly a background thing. I wrote Hermione as a girl who was culturally Christian and maybe even on the path to atheism who was suddenly shown tangible proof of the existence of souls. Most of the religious elements in the story flowed either from that, or from using the Bible as a cultural text (e.g. quoting it for rituals because it sounds good).

*** Thanks for the reply, that makes sense. Any purely physical worldview would definitely be out of the picture for a wizard. Waffling's 1st Fundamental Law of Magic - "Tamper with the deepest mysteries ― the source of life, the essence of self ― only if prepared for consequences of the most extreme and dangerous kind." - references the existence of one's soul so wizards are dualists by necessity, even if they don't attach a religious importance to it.

I did think of a pretty interesting take that could be considered as the closest a wizard could be to an physicalist or an atheist. Basically, reject gods not because they don't exist but because reliance on them weakens wizards self-sufficiency and assertiveness. Given they can magic up nearly anything, a "might makes right" person like Riddle may well see gods and religion as pointless at best and counter-productive and in need of destroying at worst.

** Religion is pretty much non-existent in the source material, apart from window dressing. None of the characters are religious, and even when the afterlife is mentioned and when Harry meets the shades of his family, there's nothing said about religion. Further, most western Europeans don't really care much for religion, apart from the fringe.

As long as that's the base for a story's portrayal of religion, pagan or Abrhamaic, I don't mind. But I'm not willing to read a story where the main characters go to church and talk and think as if they were in a cliche version of the bible belt.

** Making your characters religious is fine, just keep in mind that's going to turn a lot of people off who are not religious, because they suddenly won't be able to identify with the characters.

​

What is not fine is narrating the existence of God as an author via your characters. I encountered this in The Last Casualties by muggledad, and I was completely shocked. Safe to say, I never want to read anything by the author ever again, and told him so in a review.

​

Making Hermione religious, the quintessential logical character of HP, is completely backwards and inconsistent. But that's fine. The problem is going on a rant about people who dislike religion when you're deliberately writing in such a way as to make it difficult to distinguish between the character's voice and the narrator's laying down of the law(this is how it is). In short, the author pretty much declared God is real, and heathens are bad, and you're now supposed to read this as an atheist. Go fy is what I'd say to that.

​

Imagine reading a story where the author casually explains that objects have souls and thoughts and can speak to you, but then never goes on to show any evidence of this, he just inserts it randomly into the story. You'd think it was weird. With religion it's worse because people actually believe this stuff in reality, and so it has no place in a story in that way, since you're not going to expand on it and actually make it real within your story.

** I think everyone has covered the bases really well, but I wanted to add another element that I didn't really see being touched on. (I'm not saying you do this, just my personal feeling on it!)

I read a story once that essentially stated that Jesus was a wizard who “created” Christianity by performing feats of magic and passing them off as miracles. I'm religious so it definitely was a HUGE turn off for me and I stopped reading.

Doing something like that is just begging for people to start harassing a writer (whether it's deserved or not), just due to the “sacrilegious” nature of stating that a fictional character assumed the mantle of one of the most important religious figures to create one of the largest religions in the world.

On a side note, I think it's fine to incorporate gods of dead religions as being wizards---meaning, Greek/Roman/Norse, etc. It might be a bit callous of me, but no one who seriously worshipped them on a super religious level is alive to get upset about it.

Again---My feeling is that it's fine for characters to have opinions about religion for whatever reason you want, but don't make up characters to replace the actual religious figures themselves to “invalidate” the religion for the story's (or author's) sake. If I were the reader, I wouldn't leave a bad review or anything---but I also wouldn't read it any further either.

Best of luck with your story! I'm sorry that people are rude and told you you're going to hell. It sounds like you're doing a really great job so ignore the flamers!

** I think there is a lot of potential for fun here, but some people will be offended. If you are willing to accept that, there should be lots of interesting stuff to explore.

So lets dive in! Why not?

Seems like two ways to go about this: Integrated or non-integrated.

In non-integrated, the wizarding world doesn't follow any of the same faith structures as the muggle world. This poses a lot of problems on exposure. A lot of faiths (particularly abrehamic faiths) put stock in absolute truth. Sometimes even as far as God actually talking to the leaders of the faiths. And the absolute truth that they are the chosen ones over everyone else. Historically, that hasn't ended well with items that contradict the narrative. Think early science, or even modern science (the whole creaitonism vs evolution). If your god says the sun rotates around the earth, evidence that is not true is /a existential threat/. If god is a source of absolute truth, and his church taps into that absolute truth, being 'wrong' can be fatal.

Its always fun to imagine what would happen if we were to come into a culturally shocking challenge to our belief systems. I usually read sci-fi stories about this (If aliens discovered us, it would be a sudden and conflicting shock to the system), but it would apply just as much to HP Magic. There would be a reaction, likely a bit violent. Probably not as much from some of the eastern religions.

Add onto this that the HP universe is a bit of 'history is littered with hidden magical events', and suddenly the history of the abrehamic religion and witchcraft becomes much more sinister (or less maybe? If you assume actual magic, maybe the rampant, institutionalized murder that took place under that is somehow less worse if you think there was actually an organization is was combating?). I think you have a nice setup for the wizarding world NOT wanting to get involved with muggles since they largely follow a faith hostile to their very existence.

There is also the fun of how Muggleborn families will deal with it (I can assure you that at least SOME of them would not be ok losing their children out of the faith. Even more so than seemingly all muggleborn parents being ok losing their children to another world. Religion is weird like that).

And if you *really * want to go down this route, you can use magical explanations for religions. Zeus & Co? Wizards playing with the muggle population. Jesus and Mohammad? Dark lords setting themselves up for godhood. .... And you would imagine the muggle world would take that less well than even the above. You know, I would totally read that. (And if you think about it, what was considered miraculous in ancient times really isn't all that much. Someone with modern technology could pretty easily fake most of it, and if you imagine magic users back them, it would be pretty easy. Following that train of logic goes... interesting places).

Now the other way to go would be integrated, which is to imagine that the churches are set up much like the government is: Magical branches and all. You see that in some fics, a magical Vatican, maybe the pope / other religious leaders having knowledge of the wizarding world much like the government does. Then your wizards are following much the same systems as the muggles are, although different (and more archaic) systems. I think this is what most go for as it allows religion to be brought in in a non-hostile way, but seems a lot less interesting than doing it as a completely separate thing.

*** Interesting ideas! My story sort of straddles the line you've set up. Generally, wizards consider believe that various gods of their culture (and foreign ones) do exist, and in the story they really do exist (Aphrodite is mentioned to be known to appear before a French coven who made a cult to her, and they obey her decrees as their matron goddess). But because of how awesome magic is and its nearly limitless ability, wizards generally have a sort of "cultural paganism". They might participate in the occasional religious ceremony at certain times of year, but they don't really actively worship or think about their deities; religion is something they do without.

Muggleborns are an interesting case, though I haven't delved into it. Especially in highly religious countries like the U.S. and many Middle Eastern and African nations, I suppose I'd have to acknowledge there should be quite the blowback from the families of their Muggleborns.

**** The integration of muggleborn in canon is already filled with gaping plot holes even without the religious aspect. (or if you like, the secrecy implies very dark things).

There are simply too many muggleborn whose families know to keep the secret without coercion. There are enough for the series fantastical racism to occur.

What happens to those who refuse to let their 11 year old child go to a boarding school they have no control over? (Common: magic sealed and mind wiped)

Why don't muggleborn parents get more involved in magic? They should be a bit more prevelent, like squibs (common: parents Bewitched to slowly forget about their offspring at school.)

What about muggleborn who chose to live in the muggle world (common: school is more brainwashing than seen in canon)

What about muggleborn families that actively try to resist the magical government? After all, the Statute of Secrecy is generally shown as cleanup of accidental magic. You can get away with saying rouge wizards don't know enough about the muggle world to actively destabilize things, but that is not true of muggleborn and their parents. (Common: mental control spells like the above and/or a much stronger police state that monitors the muggle world closely)

As you can see, the implications get dark *VERY* quickly. Religious tensions would pile on to this, although it is sort of optional. (Exploring how exposure is controlled with muggleborn does not require diving into religion, yet exploring muggleborn religion does require exploring how exposure is controlled.)

One of my favorite explorations of this isn't fanfiction at all but the HP inspired visual novel /magical diary/. If you take the wildflower (muggleborn) route, it shows the magical world spelling wildflower families to /slowly forget and force non acknowledgement of their magical children/. It also shows a magical world hostile to the idea of science. (Wildflower witches attempting to apply logic/science to magic are committing a high crime and will be bound/mind wiped. You can get around it by calling it arcane research instead)
