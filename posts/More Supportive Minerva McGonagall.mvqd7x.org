A Minerva McGonagall who calls James, Sirius, Remus and Peter out for their bullying ways. A Minerva who calls out on things she finds wrong. For instance when Albus is demaning that Harry stays at the Dursley's. Seeing the way that Malfoy treats Harry or Neville. etc, etc.


** The biggest thing for me is she says the house is like your family, so that means she's the mom of the pride, but she doesn't act like one.

BOOK 1: With the dragon incident She took 150 from from her on house yet didn't stop the billing that Harry, Hermione, and Neville got. When the Trio ask for help she pretty much says bugger off.

BOOK 2: When the school treated Harry like rubbish just because he can talk with Snakes, she didn't do anything to stop it. I honestly believe a witch of McGonagall smarts would put Slytherin chamber means monster is a snake.

BOOK 3: She never help Harry with the Black incident and punish Neville for losing the list of passwords because the new painting suck, let's not forget that Black broke in before this. She was one the Don't-Tell-Harry-Anything train and left out why Black was "after" him.

BOOK 4: This whole book was bad for her. Not once did she tell her lion's that Harry was innocent of the GoF. This might be just a movie point buy still she got on using Harry as bait train with Dumbledore and Snape.

BOOK 5: She told Harry to stop getting detention but not asking why. She doesn't really stand up to Umbridge until her career meeting with Harry, I do personally believe that McGonagall push being a Auror on Harry because it's said that James was one, but she didn't really help him much in other choices.

BOOK 6: I don't really remember book 6 so I'm going to skip it.

The worst thing she allowed to happen is Snape and Malfoy (mostly Snape) bullying of Harry, Neville, Ron, and Hermione (again mostly Snape bullying of Harry and Neville).

Please don't get me wrong I love McGonagall but I would love to see her be a better Head and Professor. I believe that Sprout is the best Head of House

*** 'Sprout is the best head of house' Because at Hogwarts, being entirely off screen so we can't prove you made things actively worse for your students is as good as we get. Seriously, that school is horrifying.

** Malfoy was careful to not bully people in front of teachers, and I doubt the Marauders weren't either

*** There were times in the canon where it was made explicit that Malfoy would look out for any professors before he started on with Harry and Neville. I imagine that James, Sirius and Snape were careful not to do anything in front of the teachers, either.

What I find atrocious is that the bullying of Harry and Neville at the hands of Snape was being swept under the rug by the other professors. There was at least one case where Snape belittled Neville in front of a professor (Lupin), and I can imagine that this sort of bullying behaviour was done in front of professors like McGonagall.

However, I do like this prompt.

**** McGonagall participated in the belittling too. She singled him out and humiliated him in front of Gryffindor during GoF when telling them not to embarrass Gryffindor in front of the visiting students.

She also put Neville's life in danger by forcing him to wait alone in the hallway outside until someone with a password came to let him in, after Sirius Black had literally broken into the tower and slashed up his dorm-mate's bedding in what everyone believed was an attempt to murder Harry.

That was the SECOND time Sirius had broken into the castle and slashed something up with a knife. The other time was the Fat Lady's portrait. Why the heck would a teacher think it's appropriate to make a young boy wait alone in an unsecured location where a knife wielding mass murderer had already appeared twice and knifed stuff? He could have easily killed Neville or taken him hostage if he was actually a bad dude.

***** Yeah, canon McGonagall is awful. It annoys me because she has so much potential for awesomeness but is just a major disappointment

****** And she's still held in high regards in HP spaces despite being majorly useless and as incompetent as most other HP adults.

In a fanbase that widely cherishes someone like Snape, though, that's not really surprising. Sorry for the late response, also
