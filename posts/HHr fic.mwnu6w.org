So I'm looking for a specific HHr fic. Harry asks Hermione to be his girlfriend after Victor has asked her to the ball, so she goes to the ball with Victor. She ends up making out with Victor to make Ron jealous at the ball. Harry forgives her after a bit. It is over 100k words long. It is on fanfiction.net.
