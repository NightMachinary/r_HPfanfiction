** I recently read [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/449265][Dumbledore's Lost Boys]] and loved it! Not exactly a "feel good" fic but a great Snupin regardless. Linkao3(449265).

** It's not very shippy (more of a Remus character study with bonus smut) but if that's your thing there's linkao3(Are We Yet Free Men)

  Twenty-year-old Remus Lupin tries to keep the werewolves on the side of the light. He's accepted it might cost him his life, but that's easier to reconcile than the other costs. Even if they win, who will he be, after he's seen the depths in himself?

** Oh also I'm reading [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=11240&font=&size=][Becoming Neville]] right now and there's a great Snupin relationship developing. I'm only about half way through so it's too soon to know how it turns out, but this fic is great so far! Also this same author has a bunch of Snupin stories in the same AU.

  Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry safe, but his relatives are expendable. Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry looking like his adoptive father, but it's wearing off. Blood is a bond, but so is the memory of hate -- or love.
