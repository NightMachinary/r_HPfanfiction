Read this one awhile back on fan fiction.net, but can't find it again. The story goes that Harry and Hermione have an affair with each other over the years, cheating on Ron and Ginny. Harry even cheated on Ginny on their wedding night. Hugo and Rose turn out to be Harry's kids. Ginny reveals that she knew all along when Harry finally tried to leave her. She threatens him for more money and other stuff. Harry ends up moving far away, and he runs into Gabrielle. They have a relationship for a bit. Harry's kids then come to visit him, with Al turning out to be gay and Rose reuniting with her real dad. Anyone know if this fic is still around?
