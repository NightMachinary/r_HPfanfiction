I don't mind rating at all, but this is something I was curious about as I'm writing one such fic myself.

Some possible ideas I'd love to see (if they exist):

- Severus and original character give up Harry to James and Lily to prevent Voldemort from finding out Harry's true parentage.
- Blood adoption (to work around Lily's sacrifice)
- All except for a few know the truth.

I'm not going to hold my breath, of course, as I can see this would be a rather strange idea in the fandom. If anyone knows of any, please drop them in so I can +devour+ /cough/ check them out.


** i don t think this is what you asked but Veiled Truth has him as son of Severus and Bellaxtrix excellent fic.

*** It's all good. I was excepting, if not nothing, then a canon character such as Bellatrix. Frankly, I don't think my idea or search is all that popular if the downvotes are anything to go by.

Eh, oh well. I'm just going to continue working on my WIP; I'm starting to like this character I'm creating. She's already a lot of fun to write, though I'm debating on just creating a new character instead of using Harry. That means I'd need to use a different secret adopted family. Perhaps one that's not even in the know themselves.

Thank you for your recommendation. I'll check it out.

***** Thanks. If you're still up to that (please don't feel obligated), I'll leave a link here. I decided to instead go for an original character for their son, though, and he only appears as a newborn. It's a one-shot dealing with the mother's grief of letting her child go during war times, but I'm thinking of expanding it to an actual series. Following who, I don't know yet.
