The plot doesn't have to be necessarily romance-centered, it could be just a really good romantic subplot that caught your attention.

(some context: I'm writing a romantic story, and would like some references of what to do and not to do, and what kind of thing stays in people's memories.

Also I just really want to read good romance, haha)


** I really loved the romance between Harry and Hermione in MissAnnThropic's /Vox Corporis/ which I just realized was pulled from the web, holy shit. Thank god I saved a copy, jfc.

I remember reading a lot of Harry/Draco fics that fit the bill back in the day, but fuck if I remember them. That was ages ago. Most of the HP fics I read these days are either Gen or Harrymort, which, for obvious reasons, I can't recommend. Lol.

**** I'm so glad you've enjoyed them! Annerb is the best.

Fics of that caliber are few and far between but I like a few that, while maybe not 100% H/G, still portray them excellently.

linkao3(6015) /such a beautiful blank (but smooth it)/

Shorter H/G fic, sort of a Groundhog Day!AU but it's so lovely. I just re-read it to make sure it would be a good rec and I was reminded on how great it is and why I bookmarked it on Ao3.

linkffn(282139) /After the End/

If the lack of a detailed summary doesn't bother you (apparently it does for a lot of people idk), this is one of the best fics in the fandom. It's much older than most fics, it was written before OotP came out so a lot of it is canon divergent. It's more of an ensemble cast fic (canon pairings however) and H/G are great in it. It's a behemoth of a fic (600k) so it will last you a while. I think I've re read it a handful of times and each time I'm swept away by it. 600k goes fast when it's written so well.

linkao3(7737991) /Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time/

This is the first of from bluetoreds It's Tea Time Series (she's currently writing the third), and it's post Cursed Child. One of the very, very few fics (I think there's only one other) which has managed to make me care for the next gen characters. H/G shares the stage at about an even split with pre-Albus/Scorpius but jesus, Harry and Ginny shine in this. Their interactions are so real, so /hilarious/, that I can't help but want to read it over and over again.

linkffn(12089295) /Twenty-Two Days/

Another sweet, well-written H/G fic!

Hope you enjoy these, feel free to PM me whenever.

  "While he bumbles about, making a beautiful fool of himself, Ginny feels sick all the time. She catches him with a faraway look in his eye one dismal afternoon in the common room, and her stomach twists itself so tightly she can scarcely move, because she knows who he is thinking of, day dreaming of, and it is not her."

** I like stories like "Call Me" or "Dignity in Fear", where it doesn't take 200k words for the ship to sail. Way too few fics go with a casual beginning of the main pairing, where there is no angst-fest as a prelude. Some pining or uncertainty is alright, but writers tend to forget that teenage romances can begin for as trivial reasons as two people being bored and deciding to make out to pass the time or because they are simply curious.

*** Yep, that's young love all right.

BUT my aunt and uncle met in high school and they're still happily married for at least 15 years now. They've outlived my parents' marriage (well, it only survived for one year, so there's that) and every new relationship my parents have had after that.

*** I prefer the first one, since all too often the second one is written for pure angst and it annoys the ever-loving hell outta me. And I've personal exp with the first so I guess I can just accept it as a story element more easily.

** I'd say the best romance story is not a romance at all, but rather another genre in which a romance between two characters take place. They don't get together or even fall in love at once, but things go slowly and we get small hints here and there about their growing feelings for each other, such as jealousy, worry, or just ordinary everyday care.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1864945/pottermum][pottermum]] has a lot of Harry/Ginny one shots/multi-shots. Some are AU, some aren't. Some are about them falling in love, some are older, family-esque stories, but pretty much all of them are very fluffy (except Deja Brew which has a fair amount of angst). What I especially like about these stories, and what made me think "this is how romance should be written" is that they feel realistic to me. Not just... fanon or canon realistic, but like, actually parenting realistic (if also a bit idealistic).

Some of my favorites by them (not all romantic) are A Man, a Boy, and an Umbrella; Clueless; Serendipity; Uncle Harry; Identity Crisis; Fort Grimmauld; Cupcakes; Deja Brew; and Missing Moments.
