** I quite like Ninja Wizard: The Adventures of Harry Potter, Dimensional Traveler. linkao3(719529) The same author has another series which I quite like, Mischief's Heir.

Steve and the barkeep linkffn(8410168), it's only about 34k but I've seen it recommended a few times and enjoyed it.

On ff.net you can browse/sort all HP crossovers at once, there's a button near the top of the page where you choose the second fandom. Hopefully that made some sort of sense. I know it isn't the same as having people recommend but you might find something that catches your fancy.

*** Obviously Coal Mine isn't the one I tried to link, I keep forgetting the bot doesn't like it when I try to link a series page instead of a fic.

  Re-post. In the aftermath of the fall, Molly is trying. Failing, maybe, but trying nonetheless.

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

** You can check out my RPF HP Crossover if you'd like!

It's fully written, not fully posted yet, but I'm posting about 2 chapters a week, and it's 2/3 way up. It would definitely make my day if you wanted to give it a go.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard as he learns to separate the magical fantasy world he's always known from its dark reality. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, Dan's happy days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. But what can Dan do, in Harry's place? And how high will the cost be... to switch them back?
