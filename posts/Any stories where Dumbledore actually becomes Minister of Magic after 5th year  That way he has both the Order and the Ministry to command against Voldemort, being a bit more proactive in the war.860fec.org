Only ever read that premise once, and it was, i think, the last chapter of a fic that was abandoned.


** Dumbledore taking up the Minister position is very rare, and you have to put up with Hermione as the main character:

*** Yeah, definitely not then, can't stand Hermione anymore, fanon ruined her for me. The only type of Hermione I can enjoy is battle veteran or slightly crazy, kinda like from Stages of Hope or Ragnarok. Is she like this in this one ? Although I've heard a shitload of compliments of this fic.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

**** Only very briefly.

In the "The Dark Lord Never Died", Dumbledore was the Minister throughout the last third of the story.
