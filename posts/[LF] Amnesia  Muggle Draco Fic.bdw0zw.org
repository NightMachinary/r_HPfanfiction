I've read a couple of fics with Draco in the muggle world as a premise. Looking for the following in particular:

1. Dramione fic where Hermione finds a Draco in the muggle world who's completely lost his memories. I believe he might have been working at some sort of a stripper joint or something? And Hermione sets out to find out who did it to him in the first place.
2. Dramione fic where Draco has been sent to the muggle world as a punishment for his crimes. Hermione I think is like the officer who is looking over him and checking on him periodically. Narcissa was also in the muggle world (but I might be wrong about that).

​

Both may or may not be the same fic. And if anyone else has fics similar to these, preferably non-slash, with Draco being banished to or forced to live in the muggle world for whatever reason, please feel free to rec them as well!!


** The first one is A Pound of Flesh, I do believe...

** The second one could be “Thirteenth Night”. It was on dramione.org, but perhaps the DMHG tumblr has a copy.\\
Summary: When Hermione is assigned to keep tabs on a memory-charmed Draco, she is faced with a decision that could change her life forever. Post Hogwarts, muggle life.\\
And the link, just in case you need it: [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=718]].

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
