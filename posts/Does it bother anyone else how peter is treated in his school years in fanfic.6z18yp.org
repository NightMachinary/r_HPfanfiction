I mean he was their friend and part of the group and that is why the betrayal hurt so bad. But in fanfics they treat him so horrible I wouldn't be surprised he betrayed them. And sometimes the authors just pretend he doesn't exist. They also don't seem to get that the reason he looks like that is because he spent twelve years as a rat.


** Yeah, actually, it really does.

That's the thing - there are definitely some uncomfortable dynamics going on in the Marauders, I have no doubt. James and Sirius were "like brothers", and plainly had a very close relationship in school, even more so than their relationships with Remus and Peter.

But Peter...

Look. Peter Pettigrew, just like the other three, became an Animagus as a teenager. We see him performing some relatively powerful feats, like travelling out to the middle of Albania and somehow tracking down Lord Voldemort, acting as Voldemort's (perhaps not ideal) right hand, but we even see some non-verbal magic from him in Deathly Hallows, just before he dies.

Now, people sort of brush him off as being a weak wizard and useless compared to the other three, including McGonagall and Rosmerta, but we also have some evidence that kind of conflicts with that - what I'd /guess/ is that Pettigrew has a lot of, for lack of a better word, performance anxiety. He's obviously an extremely nervous man, and I imagine that was actually way worse back in school, so the support from the Marauders probably helped him a lot.

Which means they must have supported him.

Now, don't get me wrong - I definitely feel like if there wasn't another target to play with, Sirius and James would likely pick Peter as the butt of their main jokes, because despite his lycanthropy, Remus is described as tall and charming and humorous, whereas Peter is fat and bumbling and ugly... But they were still close friends.

People more interested in the Marauders have analysed this better than me, but James probably insisted on keeping Peter and Remus around: I'd take it from the analysis that he was very arrogant, but also quite concerned with the /nobless oblige/ of his position; Sirius, on the other hand, was a lot more impulsive, and a little bit more cruel.

But Peter was one of them. Yes, he was the weakest of the four, but that probably means that the three of them were just more protective over him, and G-d help the guy that chooses to pick on Peter from /outside/ of the Marauders, because he's within the "pack", you know?

It's a shame that people throw Peter aside, but it's hard to think of him as being a friend to the people he betrayed, you know? Peter is actually my favourite of the four of them, but I don't like that era much, so I never write for them.

Alas.

*** What really gets me is when Peter is described as /cowardly/. He's certainly a very anxious person, but he wasn't sorted into Gryffindor just because the Hat thought it'd be a funny joke. I think he's more like Neville than anyone---typically overlooked and unwilling to speak up, but more likely to show his bravery through action.

The difference is, Peter is much closer to the other Marauders than Neville is to Harry's group. Neville is acknowledged as a good sort, but Peter is close enough to James and Sirius that he becomes an Animagus with them.

That isn't even a "whole group" kind of thing, since Remus /doesn't/ become an Animagus---iirc, they thought Remus would have disapproved, and kept it from him until they'd achieved it already. Peter is canonically no more on the "outside" of the group than Remus is... and it's not unusual for two really close friends, or brothers, to be part of a larger group of friends. It doesn't mean they like their other friends any less.

And even if Peter isn't remembered as being /particularly/ gifted, he's no slouch at magic. Sure, James and Sirius were the popular kids, and Remus was enough of a teacher's pet that he was made prefect, but /all four of them/ were the Marauders. And again, Peter was /also/ an incredibly young unregistered Animagus.

It's more than that, though---do you /really/ think the Dark Lord would have taken some weakling for a servant? The man was a huge snob. He didn't mind weak /sycophants/, but all of his most trusted Death Eaters are terrifying. And there's no question that the Dark Lord trusts Peter. Peter's "betrayal" would have made a great trap if it'd been Dumbledore waiting instead of the unsuspecting and totally unprepared Potters, and Peter was to all appearances loyal to the Order, but the Dark Lord trusts him enough to go, alone. It... actually does lead to the Dark Lord's temporary demise... but he /still/ trusts Peter years after the fact, since we see that Peter (somehow) has guardianship over his creepy-withered-baby form.

Which brings me to the point that I think people /really/ miss: Peter Pettigrew is /evil/. It's something that a lot of fanfiction ignores or undermines by making him into some bullied loser. Peter Pettigrew is not a coward. Peter Pettigrew told the Dark Lord about the Potters, even though he was under /absolutely no threat to do so/, since nobody---not even Dumbledore, apparently---knew that he was the Secret Keeper. Peter Pettigrew became the Dark Lord's /most trusted servant/. He's the Servant that /prophecies/ and /rituals/ call for. Consider, in /Prisoner of Azkaban/:

#+begin_quote
  /The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers. His servant has been chained these twelve years. Tonight, before midnight, the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant's aid, greater and more terrible than ever before. Tonight... before midnight... the servant... will set out... to rejoin... his master.../
#+end_quote

This is /not/ some half-assed "I was conned into it" kind of service. Peter Pettigrew has gone fully to the Dark Side, and there's no "Luke I am your father" last-minute redemption for him. It's only through the efforts of Peter Pettigrew that the Dark Lord rose again! In GoF, the "/Flesh -- of the servant -- w-willingly -- given/" is a crucial part of the ritual. Barty Crouch might have sent Harry along, but Crouch was more than half-mad already, and /he/ didn't cut off any flesh. Peter Pettigrew /wanted/ the resurrection of the Dark Lord so badly that /he cut off his own hand/. He wasn't tricked into it. There were plenty of other Death Eaters still around. Peter Pettigrew was just the only one brave and powerful enough to act. Peter Pettigrew was evil.

**** See, I find it so interesting to think about Peter's actual motivations when it comes to Voldemort - so like you said, you can totally view it as feeling very unappreciated and like he's the least valuable of his friends, so why not betray them and go to where he is valued instead?

But I often see him viewing it as an eventuality - like, when Peter's talking to Remus and Sirius in the Shrieking Shack, he's talking very quickly and trying to explain himself, saying, "You don't know..." to the two of them... And they're like, yeah, we do know, you monster.

I feel like Peter genuinely saw it as an eventuality.

If you're viewing it as a straight fact that Voldemort is going to win the war and that Voldemort is going to kill all of your friends... Doesn't it make sense to betray them? On the one hand, he can kill all of you; on the other hand, he can kill everyone else, but you survive! It's only logical!

And I think that if you look at Peter, who is obviously very, very anxious and paranoid and jumpy, and is very much a rat willing to jump ship when he sees a few drops of water...

From his point of view, he was probably only doing what made sense.

Which in many ways, I think, is more evil than simply feeling unwanted: in this scenario, he /does/ feel wanted and does love his friends, but feels it's pointless to try to fight for them.

**** peter pettigrew is evil- that doesn't make him not also a loser and a coward, because his actions were done out of preservation and fear for his life, and unenthusiastically. as opposed to say, a belief in voldemort's cause and person, or vague personal advancement. he's sad that he's sacrificing james, but selfish and cowardly enough to still go through with it. the threat he was under would be his own perceived sense of voldemort's power. we know his motivation because it's the only one provided or suggested in the books themselves, and explicitly confirmed by jkr

*** Or they just let him tag along (which is also a - minor - confidence boost if you are insecure but are allowed to hang out with the popular and smart people!)

As for "but of their jokes" - not to mention that Sirius and James probably kind of felt sorry for Remus (so they wouldn't mock him!) and he probably checked their homework, too (like Hermione does for Harry and Ron)

Yeah, nobless oblige describes James - he'd let you feel that he thought you were lucky to be allowed around him, but he wouldn't go out of his way to mock you either (unless you are like Snape (Slytherin, knowledgeable in dark magic and close to Lily Evans!)) and he'd help you if he saw you were treated unfairly or needed help (I am sure he helped the lower years if they asked for his help)

Hm...would they protect him? Good question, I'd say Remus would and James probably as well, but Sirius? I don't know (young Sirius probably is/was even more selfish and arrogant than James...especially since he felt superior to his own family, who he kind of saw as a lost cause!)

** I'd honestly be a lot more sympathetic to Peter if he was actually treated the way he is in fanfiction in canon.

With friends like that, who needs enemies?

I think a lot of people underestimate him too. His character is pathetic but he's no slouch as a wizard and he probably got overlooked due to the natural charisma of the others. I honestly think the Marauders dynamic was centred around James and Sirius while Remus and Peter tagged along. Remus was immensely grateful despite this because of insecurities regarding his condition but Peter let his resentment fester. (I'm just as gifted as them! Why do they get all the attention? etc) And James and Sirius were too busy being James and Sirius to notice.

** My personal characterization of Peter has him as an average wizard, who is friends with geniuses. A standard person who is surrounded by those who excel. He grows to like these people. These people who everything comes so easily to. He finds that they help him, they protect him. Sure they poke fun at him, but he does the same! Remember that one liner he told Sirius? Yea he got them good then!

But we see this naturally in relationships with males. Especially when one is less talented, and believe me, Pettigrew was /talented/. But compared to James, Sirius, and Remus? His star was weak. This wizard was competing with a Black, who grew up around magic and had a bone to pick with his family, a Potter who was a transfiguration prodigy, and a Werewolf who would eventually hold at least one mastery in a country where he shouldn't have even went to school. There is no way an average wizard is going to compare!

Peter grew to loath that... maybe not openly, but definitely it grew. Then Voldemort showed him favor. maybe he was left alive in a raid, maybe he was passed by, or captured and not tortured. All because Voldemort said that he was "the best" of his friends. Slowly that ate away at him, and he switched sides around the same time that Severus did.

The thing is, this characterization relies on something that the fanfiction portrayal does not show. In fanfiction, Peter is always the traitor! Always the filthy rat who would gladly sell them out to Voldemort and the teachers. But the fact is... that just isn't true. He would have died! He would have gladly died... until he realized that he didn't want to die for people who he felt didn't care for him as much as they cared for each other. At this point, James married Lily, Remus was away at the werewolf front, and Sirius and James never stopped being close. What happened to Peter? Who cared right? In comes Voldemort, who knows his Death Eaters by name, asks how their children are, and makes people matter.... at least in their minds. And he strokes that damaged ego, that broken confidence, and all it take is betraying people that already in Peter's mind, betrayed him.

That ^ would be a good Peter Pettigrew.

** Not just fanfiction - I very much disliked how Sirius spoke about him in Snape's worst memory. Granted, he was overdoing it applauding James every time he caught it, but that's on James and Sirius just as much as it is on him. They were contemptuous of him - but he also clearly felt he needed to grovel to his 'best friends'.

None of them were nice boys. James started to grow up into a decent man, apparently, Remus did, Sirius never got the chance, Peter didn't, Severus didn't, but found redemption. Peter never did, but I think he had just as much potential for it as Snape. But I don't think canon or fanfiction do him justice.

Anyway, I wrote a sort of thing on Peter, Linkffn(The Rat by Brynmor) because I really hate how everyone calls him a typical dirty rat, when rats are amazing animals. That led me to believe that most of Peter's problem was how he saw himself. As a rat animagus, he could have been so awesome, and I want to write a redemption fic for him, but that's not what this ended up being. It's mostly canon, except the bit about him asking for his friends to be spared. That's my own personal belief.

  This story doesn't have a point. I just dislike how rats are portrayed. And Wormtail makes a convienient villain, but he was just as human as Snape, or anyone. I think he truly believed Voldemort was undefeatable. The bit about him asking for his friends lives to be spared is my headcanon, everything else is canon.

That said, I don't really get why people do that kind of thing. I mean, I do get the “catharsis via putting a character you don't like down” thing, but I find having the characters be portrayed as humans, flawed as humans are, and yet choosing the better thing that we've already seen them choose, to be much more cathartic and in a way better way.

Case in point, “Coexistence” manages to give us a flawed Peter who manages, for whatever reason, to choose differently, and it just gives you the fuzzies; the same about Severus in the same story. And then you have “Last Chance” which gives you a /Tom of all people/ who struggles, really struggles through his flaws and the darkness that he has, to do the right thing, sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails but /he tries/ and that is incredible to read about.

I agree with the top comment here, though --- there are some very uncomfortable dynamics within their friendship. It's a hard thing to write.

** I read the title and for a few solid seconds wondered who the fuck is Peter before having a "Oh..." moment. Guilty as charged, honestly I don't think it's far-fetched that he could have been the "tag-along guy". James clearly was an asshole as we already know and I assume Sirius was one too just in a more sarcastic and mocking way. Remus was the guy who didn't really like some of the things that were happening but never spoke out (Which happens a lot in real life anyway) with Peter kinda being there just to be there. There dynamic is actually pretty common, two people who do their own things. One who sometimes may disagree with some of those things but never says anything, and the one who is there but never really gets noticed.

** Partly - I mean he was a tag-along for the most part, a groupy in a way who hung out with the popular kids (James and Sirius!) and their "token smart-guy with a dark secret" (Remus) - that is also what probably made his betrayal easier! He wasn't really treated as a full member of the group! Otherwise he might really have died for them!

Still, fanfiction writers often exaggerate this (like Sirius and James know that Peter isn't trustworthy and thus he's marginalized which wasn't exactly true!)

ps: At least the few marauder-era fanfictions I've read have done this...it's not my favourite genre because we kind of already know what went down (the broad strokes/important parts: Pranksters, James was good at transfiguration, animagi, map, Lily is friends with Snape (till he calls her a mudblood), Lily marries James and Harry is born...Lily and James die, Harry survives, Sirius is locked up, Peter hides with the Weasleys and Remus (the fucking coward!) leaves to god knows where and Harry is tucked away at the Dursleys!), so it's not all that interesting IMHO!

** Nevil is treated the same way. Remember when Draco? put him in a leg lock and the golden trio just laughed and walked away? I wonder if the reason why Nevil became a hero is because the actor grew up to be hot.

***** Yes, for his own good. He wanted to keep them from breaking the rules and they, not knowing what else to do, body locked him so he wouldn't be able to snitch - or worse, follow them.

I simply call bullshit. Thats not in the books.

Plus, Neville was never part of that particular group of friends. It wasn't Harry, Hermione, Ron and Neville. It was just the three. Simply because of that the dynamic between them would not be the same as the dynamic of Peter with the rest of the Marauders.

******* If anything it was bullying, not abuse. Abuse needs the assailant to be in a position of power / authority that he - hence the word - can abuse. And I'm not gonna say that it would've been okay as some sort of schoolyard "prank". However, in the situation, they assumed that without them going out there, someone would steal the Philosopher Stone. Its not like they did that for no reason whatsoever, at least in their *11 year old* minds.

******** You sound like Dumbledore. Have you thought about what that night would have been like for Nevil? Who already has CPTSD, for sure. Anybody with a wand and not afraid to use it is in a position of power. Next time you want to go on a date with somebody I don't like, I will come over and tie you up so you can't go and leave you in a less than safe position. Do you get how wrong this is?

********* The only thing you've shown here is that you are incapable of looking at the exact circumstances because it is easier for you to decide that the characters must have been oh-so-damn evil.

Even if what they did was wrong, it is a justifiable action because given what they knew they simply could not have known that they didn't need to go out and /protect/ something. They acted in good will, and when he tried to stop them for the sake of stopping them, which was not intrinsically bad but which means that their need to act outweighed his need to stop them, they stopped him from doing it with as little harm as they could have caused. And no, his alleged PTSD or whatever (doubtful he had that, for all we know he just had massive problems with self-confidence) does not mean they automatically became the worst people ever when they used probably the only spell they knew that could stop him without causing him harm because stunners are an upper-year thing.

So, yes, the fact that you compared this situation to /you/ deciding that you have the authority to fuck up someone's life on a whim with no real justification of why that would be necessary is /very bad/. But that's about you, not about the situation in the books.

*** Everyone in the common room was laughing, except for Hermione, who immediately ran forward to perform the counter curse. Is that the part you're talking about? Yeah, it's a little asshole-ish for the kids to all be laughing at him, but from my experience, lots of kids laugh at the misfortune of others.

When they froze him when leaving the common room to protect the Philosopher's Stone, none of them were laughing. It seems like you combined the two situations.
