#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

*** Characters are sometimes different in Problem with Potions, which is the fic OP is talking about. They keep the core aspects of themselves in canon, like Goyle is still pretty damn dumb and just... Goyle-ish, but some aspects are changed for the story. It's good.

** I'm pretty confident it's this one: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8034380/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Garden-of-Intrigue]]) although Problem with Potions is also a very good fic
