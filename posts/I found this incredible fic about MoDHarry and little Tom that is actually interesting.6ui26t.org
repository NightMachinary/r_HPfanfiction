It is a gem, as usual for esama's works, but a lesser known one. I highly suggest trying it for a light and interesting read. I know only of linkao3(689909) that has a Spellmaker!Harry and I found it delightful.


** Damn, I want more of esama.

Anyone else know of any other spellmaker!Harry stories?

** It's not that great tbh. It has some mildly interesting spell discussions about the fidelius but that's about it. I was intrigued by the premise of Harry travelling with Voldemort's Horcrux to another world and raising him as his son, but it never actually gets beyond the infant stage - or even very far into that either. Tom Riddle as a baby can be replaced by literally any other baby in this fic and it wouldn't make a difference as people don't generally start showing interesting personalities at less than a year old, so the premise falls flat. And it's abandoned, and has basically no steam. I personally wouldn't recommend this - it reads like the author became a parent and wrote this to vent because that's literally all this is.

*** I disagree, but I can see why you think so. I liked the light tone of the fic, compared to the many angsty ones out there, and the magical theory was a nice touch. It being abandoned is obviously a downside, but then again almost every good one is, and it at least is over 50K.

**** True, and I did get an hour or two of reading out of it. It was at the very least somewhat decent as I actually finished it.

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable in the highly complicated and controversial subject of Spell Creation, a subject he soon becomes enamored with despite having to hide his interest from everyone. Besides, it's not like he's going Dark, after all.
