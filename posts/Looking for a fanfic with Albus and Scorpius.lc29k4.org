** I'm not going to link it to you. It was an actually trash fic. The world would have been better without it. I even heard they did a play on that fic.

I regret reading it.

The time turner logic was all wrong and the plot didn't make sense.

And Harry named his kids really bad names. He literally named his child after a death eater!
