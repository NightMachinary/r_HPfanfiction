I can't remember much but harry is raised in a highly developed culture millions of light years away from earth. He becomes his Hogwarts letter via portkey. He has a constant companion in an AI/KI his culture is ruled by Minds/KIs? He can apparate in hogwarts because he goes in upper space instead of under space? He was adopted and raised by a very old person. It was not finished. (At least it wasn't when I read it some years ago.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.
