Hi all! The HP fanfic writers' guild is a discord server where we work as a community to improve our writing. It includes a well of resources posted on a regular basis, exercises of various aspects of writing, and challenges to help us push ourselves further.

We provide opportunities for review swapping and spaces where writers can post excerpts of their work for detailed feedback. Since we're an HP focused place, we also regularly discuss different aspects of canon, characters and lore. It's a friendly and welcoming community, currently standing at about a hundred members.

All skill levels welcome :)

You can find us here: [[https://discord.gg/WMRbTsru]]

*** Hi there! The links expire after 24 hours because we prefer to grow gradually. A sudden influx of a few hundred people can be difficult to manage. I'm really glad you wanna join though! Here's another link, keep in mind that this one also will expire in 24 hours :)
