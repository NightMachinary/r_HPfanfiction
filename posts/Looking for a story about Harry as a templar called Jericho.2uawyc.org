I read this year's ago and I lost the link some time ago. I've tried searching but found nothing. Details I can remember are that Harry is taken and raised by a group called Templars in a hidden city and given a new name of Jericho. There are 3 types of templar and they have special weapons that are unique to them all. Harry (or rather Jericho) isn't aware he's Harry potter until he's told later on. Thanks for any suggestions
