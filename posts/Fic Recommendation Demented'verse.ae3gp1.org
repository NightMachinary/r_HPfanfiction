Just wanted to rec a HP/Supernatural fanfic that doesn't seem to be well known: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/18947]]

Well written, characters are true to canon and an interesting combination of the HP and Supernatural worlds.

The plot is actually focused on Supernatural since Harry and friends are already now adults and accomplished wizards. Draco is amazingly written: he still hates Harry with a passion but has now become sort of a okay guy. His rapport with Sam and Dean is fantastic (unlikely friends, I know).

The only complain i have is that Supernatural is such a long running show that I've forgotten most of it and this fic assumes you know and remember almost the entirety of Supernatural's canon plot. But the writing is so great that I had no problems remembering the characters.

I highly recommend this to hp/supernatural fans. Its strange how well these two worlds combine together into the same universe without the author having to do much additional world building. Enjoy!


** I know this post is rather old but I just wanted to say I had it saved for awhile and finally got around to reading it... 3 hours later and I'm on ch22

No sleep for me tonight :D
