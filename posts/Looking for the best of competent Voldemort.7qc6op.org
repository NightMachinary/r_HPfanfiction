or another competent Villain, if Voldemort isn't available.

Anything goes - I don't mind AUs, slash, even OP characters... Just no PWP, I guess XD

Whatever is good. Or cool. Because sometimes the cool factor can make a not-that-good story worth the read :)


** My series, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) linkffn(The Chessmaster: White Knight) features a very competent Voldemort, although he hasn't truly come into play yet. It's a political AU with world building.

  Sequel to The Chessmaster: Black Pawn. AU. Tensions continue to rise both inside and outside Hogwarts with the announcement of the International Scholastic Quidditch Tournament.

** The divisive linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) has a complete AU as setting, and some think the main character is overpowered. And it has one of the smartest Voldemort ever written in a starring role.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** Completely AU, Hermione/Voldemort with an extremely interesting plot in my opinion : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5216059/1/Of-Elusive-Realities-and-Convincing-Facades][Of Elusive Realities and Convincing Facades, by cosettex]]

Basically, since the summary isn't much : the ministry is convinced the Order is as bad as the Death Eaters and they're now wanted and criminals too, so the Order and Voldemort form a sort of temporary alliance to deal with the ministry. Emissaries are sent to each sides (that's where Hermione enters the plot), and stuff happens from there. I really, really loved it !

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12025821/1/The-Unbroken-Saviour][The Unbroken Saviour]] by ElegantlyDone made Voldemort scarily persuasive. I'm mean seriously persuasive like making me want to side with him even though I intellectually know the way he want things is wrong. It did not help that this takes place in during Voldemort's coming to power so he still has his looks. The story gave valid reasons how he got his followers the way he did. He did not start his campaign simply out of fear yet, he done it with promises and words.

The story starts off in Harry's 6th Year then time travels back to the Marauder's Era.

  It's known that skilled Occlumens can fake memories. What if Severus Snape wasn't quite as committed to protecting Harry Potter as Dumbledore thought? What if Snape looked at Harry not as Lily's daughter, but as James' son? What if he was a bit...vindictive? A small oneshot about how such an event might shape things at the very end.
