It wasn't because he was touched by the "true love" that Snape had for Lily(gross). It was because he had been Snape's wingman for the past 15 years yet somehow still didn't make any progress.


** Dumbledores eyes still watered heavily.

Harry smelled Dumbledore , "how much weed did you smoke tonight , Professor?"\\
"Sprout wanted me to give a lesson to the Hufflepuffs." Dumbledore said. "Fuck that was deep."

** Dumbledore was crying because he spent fifteen years being the best bro he possibly could, and in the end Snape was still a massive simp. Just the biggest simp imaginable. He let the thirst do it to him. He allowed the thirst to control him, until the very end. Fifteen years a simp.

He was born a Prince, and could have been a King... but he turned into a Snape instead.

Dumbledore's last thought as the killing curse impacted and threw him off the tower:

/"That's pretty cringe, Severus. At least James faked it until he made it."/

"Severus......please". Snape killed him before he could finish the sentence, because Dumbledore was about to ask him to finally do something with his hair

****** Until it turns out that the family goat wasn't dead, but had only been apparated to another continent. The faithful goat travelled seas and mountains to get back to Aberforth, only to discover there was a new goat on her place now. The new goat wasn't going to accept that easily though, she had asserted her claim to Aberforth and enjoyed to goad about it.
