/^{Or perhaps someone who had him as a bit of rough on the side?}/

I tend to think towards either staff at Hogwarts during or before the time maruaders attended hogwarts, or someone who lived in Hogsmeade at the time.

- Madam Rosmerta
- Madam Puddifoot
- Bathsheda Babbling
- Pomona Sprout
- Septima Vector

However I've seen the names Jane Court, and Patricia Rakepick floated as well.

Who do you think of?


** Maxime is the only person I can imagine.

*** Completely agree. Whenever I started to think how Hagrid was conceived, my head hurts. I would rather not repeat that experience.

*** Ehh, Hagrid is said to be twice as big, with three times the girth. Ron Jeremy is bigger.

** Knowing Hagrid it would probably not be a human, but somebody from a race that everyone rightly thinks of as dangerous, but he just thinks is misunderstood.

Like I could definitely see Hagrid dating a vampire or a hag.

Hah! I can too. However, I was thinking of this as a mother for Hagrid's son.

** I like to think of Hagrid as having a very anamilistic and feral view on life and that carries over to his dating life. Lots of animals don't have life long partners and Hagrid realisticly probably cannot inpregnate anything because of his heritage. Maybe Hagrids relationship with the centaurs go a bit deeper than previously thought, perhaps their are some trolls who let him join their circles. I don't think Hagrid ever had a serious relationship but still has his fun
