** I don't know of one, sorry, but in linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) he gets the chance to use the Resurrection Stone to properly apologise, without being cursed. And he visits Gellert in Nurmengard and thinks there's a good chance he's had a change of heart.

*** "Arianna, I knew I would see you someday. I did everything in my power to be here. It was a large journey to the resurrection stone, and quite costly too. I had to use almost all of Harry's money!"

**** You're very welcome! It's unfinished but updating monthly (and the author is quite organised, with drafts several months in advance).

Let's see, Chapter 16... Ooh. /That/ one. Yeah, that chapter has an extensive quote on the TVTropes page. It's pretty significant.

#+begin_quote
  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.
