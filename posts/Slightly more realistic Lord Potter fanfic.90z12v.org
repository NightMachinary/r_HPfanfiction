** I'm working on a series linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn; The Chessmaster: White Knight; The Chessmaster: Black Bishop) that has a realistic take on Lord Potter as well as Harry, Ron, and Hermione all sorted into Slytherin. It starts in first year, and I'm in the middle of writing third year. The fic gets more poltiics heavy as time goes on, and I've posted about 150k words total in the series.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) is a WBWL, Slytherin Harry fic that also focuses on politics.

  Chessmaster Volume I. AU. Harry discovers that cleverness is the best way to outwit Dudley and his gang, which leads to a very different Sorting. While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain. Sequel complete.

  Chessmaster Volume II. AU. Tensions continue to rise both inside and outside Hogwarts with the announcement of the International Scholastic Quidditch Tournament. As international influences begin to creep into British politics, Dumbledore isn't the only one worried for the future. Thomas Gaunt is concerned as well, but for very different reasons. Sequel now posted!

  Chessmaster Volume III. AU. All is not what it seems to be. As information and disinformation spreads, Death Eaters are released from Azkaban and several long-buried secrets surface, exposing hidden truths. With reputations, plots, and lives on the line, schemes come into fruition as the Chessmaster makes his next move...

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
