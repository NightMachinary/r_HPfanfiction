  When Rose resurrects her brother, she pushes the world to the brink of another war. Meanwhile Albus, cold and brilliant, may just be the second coming of Tom Riddle. Forced to work together to unravel their parents' suspicious deaths, they must solve the past if they want to survive the future. And answer the question: Just why does history keep repeating itself?

She's been slowly reposting on ffn; she's got ~20 chapters written, so there'll be updates for awhile. She's also been editing her initial chapters to get the writing up to par with her later chapters. Great style, great characters.

*** That was actually where I got the idea from. I read that and enjoyed it, and I was wondering if there were any others similar.

**** Ahh, this is the only one I know of. I remember when it was first published on HPFF and it caught my eye, and I haven't found any others that appealed to me immediately like this one had.

**** It's just hidden on HPFF at the moment, not removed; she's getting it resolved and she's also writing a new story, so both are taking some time out for her. She posts updates and answers questions on her blog [[http://shezsblog.tumblr.com/][here]]. Drop a nice review to nudge her! Kindest way to guilt :p

***** The author is focusing on her new time travel story more at the moment. Seeing that it is much more popular than /Clash/ on ffn.net, it is quite understandable. I do hope she comes back to it soon though.

** This one is pretty awesome. 6 complete books with the 7th (and I believe final one) in progress.

*** Started reading. Stopped after like four chapters. Why the fuck would Harry & Co. tell everyone that a horcrux is?

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.

*** I read through everything in a long fit of boredom, and I'd only recommend it to people who are as bored as I was. The story 'features' wizards using two wands, super-spells, bizarre plot twists, batshit escalation, etc.

There are also almost no canon characters anymore; wherever possible, OCs are used, and the canon characters aren't characterized particularly well, either.

There's also the really strange twist in book 6. Like, really? /They're/ the mastermind? Are you shitting me?
