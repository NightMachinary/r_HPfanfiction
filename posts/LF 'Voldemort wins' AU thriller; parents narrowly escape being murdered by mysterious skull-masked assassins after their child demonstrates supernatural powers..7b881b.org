Just an idea I find myself musing on; Harry in Deathly Hallows worries that the new Blood Status under the Voldemort-controlled Ministry mean that the Death Eaters would round up and imprison, or even murder, 11-year old muggleborns instead of giving them Hogwarts letters.

Does anyone know if there's stories that focus on this? Some ordinary parents, whose home is attacked by a strange assassin in a skull-shaped mask and a black cloak, right after their child demonstrates the ability to use telekinesis, or teleport, or whatever?

In particular, what does the muggle government do, and muggle police forces do, when faced with a mysterious supernatural enemy who can tamper with memories, mind-control people, teleport, and blow up or vanish any obstacles in their way?


** If you're looking for thrillers,

Linkffn(Elizium for Sleepless Souls) and linkffn(Concentric Wavelengths) are great. Not Voldemort-focused though, but still great.

There was one Voldemort-focused thriller I read once. Unfortunately my browser closed and i never finished it or got its name. But it involved Harry, Tracey, Dean, and Harry killing (?) Tracey's dad?

** I've written an AU where Malfoy fakes Voldemort's survival in 1981, and takes over Britain. How they deal with muggleborn children (and their parents) is a major plot point.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

**** Yeah. He mended blood relations quite well I think. Sure it was a bit of a crude solution but what works works. His son's a bit of a Joffrey but can't have everything I suppose.
