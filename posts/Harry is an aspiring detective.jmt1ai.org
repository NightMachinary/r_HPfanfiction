  I've re-uploaded The Chronicles Of Harry Holmes so other people can enjoy this story. This story was written by Zeno-no-kyuubi, and he has given me his blessing/permission to re-upload this story. If you enjoyed this story check him out i'm only a humble fan. He has great stories similar to this like In The Mind Of A Scientist with the sequels branching out to SG-1, and ME.
