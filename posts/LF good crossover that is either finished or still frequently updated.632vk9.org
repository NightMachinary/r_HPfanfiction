X-over with other magical system is preferred but quality work will be appreciated either way.

I don't care about slash but please warn if lime, lemon, mpreg, a/b/o...

Would prefer stories like linkffn(9082593;7929587;7939180;11634921), i.e. stories with Harry being raised in the crossover verse rather than characters from the crossover coming to Hogwarts.

Crack is welcome.

For some reason there seem to be mostly x-over with Naruto that fulfill my requirements, that is the reason why there's no other.

That should be all, thanks in advance!


** I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), a SG crossover. I would say it could be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][Darth Marrs]]'s best work by far, as long as he doesn't mess up the remaining half of the story (which he did sometimes). BTW, it's the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942), a SW crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136), is about Ginny and Sirius making a new career in the World of Ice and Fire.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/Gods-Among-Us][Gods Among Us]], linkffn(7725354), is a decent Battlestar Galactica crossover with Harry and Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8712160/1/The-Next-Lord-of-Kobol][The Next Lord of Kobol]], linkffn(8712160), has Harry ending up in BG world after falling through the Veil.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11690341/1/The-Salem-Settlement][The Salem Settlement]], linkffn(11690341), is a rare Fallout crossover. I think it's written by [[/u/UndeadBBQ]], but hasn't been updated in a while.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11567521/1/Is-Your-Great-Aunt-an-AI][Is Your Great-Aunt an AI]], linkffn(11567521), is a humorous Portal crossover. Half Life's Gordon Freeman and Black Mesa Research Facility also make their appearances.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), can be considered a crossover with Kantai Fleet Girls. The Trio was in a romantic relationship postwar, and had to fend off attacks by the zombie battleship BismarckMort. Fortunately, HMS Hood returned to help them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]], linkffn(11027086), is a great LOTR crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King][The Sea King]], linkffn(7502511), is a beautiful one shot and a crossover with "The Deadliest Catch".

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

** linkffn(8400788)

Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens.

Very crackish, although serious in some places, and an extremely enjoyable read. The first book is complete, one sequel is complete but another is incomplete but still being updated. The premise is that Harry performed accidental magic during the summer after first year and ended up in the Warhammer 40k Universe where he is trained into an Adeptus Astartes: a super soldier meant to fight extremely dangerous things. Then he ends up back in the HP Universe sometime after the start of what would have been his second year, had he not been around three hundred years old with almost all of it spent in life-or-death combat.

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

**** You'll be fine with Uncle Google at your side. It does require some basic info---of the “Harry is a wizard and Hogwarts is a school of witchcraft and wizardry and Tom is a dark lord” kind of basic---but outside of that it will only be occasional stuff that you will need to search for as a lot of WH40k stuff is fairly easy to get with just that basic info.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** That Which Holds the Image by TheAngelsHaveThePhoneBox is a very-written HP x Doctor Who crossover. It's finished, and the author is writing a sequel. linkffn(7156582)

The Savior, Child of the Tardis, Son of a Mad Man is also a well-done HP X DW crossover. The premise is that Dumbledore gives Harry to The Tenth Doctor (David Tennant, if you're unfamiliar) to raise instead of the Dursleys. The author's worldbuilding as the group visits different planets is remarkable. It's currently at over 500,000 words, and the author was posting regularly until January. Dunno if it's now on hiatus. linkffn(8187591)

  Out in the Universe is a bright blue box, holder of a fantastical realm. Inhabiting this box is a mad man who calls himself the Doctor, his son, the Savior of the Wizarding World aka Harry Potter, an immortal man from the 51st century who affects a Captain in front of his name, Jack Harkness, and a pink and yellow once-human who is simply Rose Tyler. What was Dumbledore thinking?

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.
