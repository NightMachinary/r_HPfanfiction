After trying google for nearly an hours, I've got to ask you guys:

The fanfiction I'm looking for is about Hermione beeing the princess to the throne of the wizarding world. During the first war the knowledge about the existence of the wizarding royal family/thron has been hidden by a fidelius-like spell (might even have been done by Flamel, not sure).

After Voldemort is truly dead (chapter 1 may or may not begin here) the secret gets lifted and Hermione discovers who she truly is and that her parents are King&Queen and wizards, not muggles.

This causes trouble becaus she can not be with Harry, but rather has to enter an marriage arranged years ago. Turns out her parents kept from her that Harry (which he learns even later) is the person (prince, duke, whatever) Hermione has to marry.

You see I seem to recall the content pretty well, but I simply do not find it! Any help would be really appreciated!

Thanks!
