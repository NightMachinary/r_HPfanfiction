** This happens in linkffn(Potters Against the World by Temporal Knight)

Fair warning though: It's twincest + Gabrielle

*** Honestly, if harry had a female twin and they both had to live the life he had, It would be hardly unsurprising if they became co-dependent of each other, emotionally and physically.

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).

** Up. That would be extremely cool even if improbable- Harry has that Hero-thing. He should be a psychopath to leave.
