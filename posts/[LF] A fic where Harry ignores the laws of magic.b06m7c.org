I remember reading a story about Harry absolutely ignoring the laws of magic, for example the one about not conjuring food. In his first year he conjured an apple and found that children were taught that it was not possible because then those who sell food would run out of business. Then he started to time travel without time turners, created Atlantis (and when Luna -its a H/L pairing- wanted to explore the past they traveled in time with Atlantis... and that when Atlantis collapsed it wasn't because of an accident but because they traveled back to their own time period) and his own pokemon. I remember he used a Growlith he created to sniff out Voldemort's Hocruxes. It was rather cracky and not very long.

If you have any other fic that fits those parameters (Harry studying magic and its laws) feel free to recommend it too! I'm always on the hunt for good stories.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

** Jeconais has a story where Harry does not know that there are any limits to magic so he can basically do anything. Others realize this and specifically asked him to do impossible magic and he does it. I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're asking for but...
