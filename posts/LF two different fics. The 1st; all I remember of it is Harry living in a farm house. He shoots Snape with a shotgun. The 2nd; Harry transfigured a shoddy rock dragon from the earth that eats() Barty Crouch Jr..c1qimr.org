  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** Thanks! It was annoying me I couldn't think of the story but this one scene I really liked.

Kind of disappointing as I didn't like where the ending went in that story.

**** Yeah, I couldn't even get to the end of that fic. I lost 100% of interest in that story around where he started just hanging out under the cloak all the time naval gazing.
