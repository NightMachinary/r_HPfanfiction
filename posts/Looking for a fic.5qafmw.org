The story was rather curious but I barely remember it, I do remember some major points that interest me enough to look for it.

Sirius was the Secret Keeper and he got tortured until he gave away the secret. Eventually it was revealed that Sirius was actually a traitor and a Death Eater. In the same story arc Rosier also escaped Azkaban and did some fucked up shit. Wormtail wasn't a traitor, in fact if I remember correctly he was actually an assassin for the Order or something.

That's really all that I remember, I'm not sure if the story was any good but the role reversal of Peter and Sirius intrigued me.

Please let me know if you found it.

EDIT:

Found it.

linkffn(Prophecies, Secrets and Lies) It's written by the same author as linkffn(Hallowed) so it should be decent. Going to reread it soon.

Thanks for the help guys.


** Did Harry have a brother in it?

*** I'm honestly not sure. The only things I remember are all connected to Sirius actually being evil. It might have been a WBWL but I can't be sure.

***** I don't think so. I dislike slash and have never read more then a few chapters of any Slash story.

It was a multiple fic series, at least I think so...

******* Nope, it isn't saving Connor. I'm sure of that.

Guess I'll have to keep looking by myself. Ah well.
