:END:
Quidditch scene in a fic where there is dispute over what happened first, a goal to put Hufflepuff up 230-70, or Gryffindor seeker catching the Snitch to end the game in a 220-220 tie. Is there any chance of Gryffindor actually winning? I want to heighten the drama a little bit.

Edit: No, I don't believe it's possible. I suppose I could make it against Hogwarts rules to allow ties.

Edit 2: My resolution- Hufflepuff leading by 150. Snitch is caught before the goal goes in. It's against Hogwarts rules to allow ties, so Hufflepuff gets a penalty, then if they miss, Gryffindor gets a penalty, then if they miss, sudden death overtime is played until the next goal scores.

** Just did a quick search to see if there are any codified rules here. There's a mention in The Daily Prophet in one of the earlier books of the Chudley Canons drawing a match and breaking their sixteen-game losing streak, so evidently it's possible for matches to end in a tie. Since the Snitch is such an important part of the game, maybe you could have them go into a sudden death round to resolve the match?

*** That doesn't answer the original question though, which was a dispute of whether Hufflepuff had scored before the snitch was caught.

Since quidditch is established to have human referees who sometimes make mistakes, then it would basically be whatever the ref (usually Hooch) called. If she said the Hufflepuff goal came first, then they win. If she says the snitch was caught first, it's a tie. The students may groan and argue about it to their heart's content, but whatever the ref calls is the official result.

**** True, but sudden death is a reasonable, non immersion breaking way to resolve the dispute that allows the possibility of Gryffindor winning, which is what OP was asking about.

*** The fact that professional games allows a tie doesn't mean that school rules do. There are often rule differences between professional and amateur levels.

**** That's true, which is why I suggested sudden death as a possible tiebreaking method here. That seems like the best solution to me, for balancing immersion/canon compliance with increasing the tension of the story.

***** Maybe instead of sudden death, each chaser gets a single chance at the opposing goal, like a penalty kick? Three chances for each team, leaving it up to the keeper. Would draw it out longer.
