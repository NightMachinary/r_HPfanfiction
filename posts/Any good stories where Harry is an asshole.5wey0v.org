  A slightly different take on indy!Harry. A summer vacation leads Harry to do some exploring someplace not so far afield. Sixteen, bored, and faced with the newest threat to his sanity - the cute waitress. Music and a little mayhem. Post 5th, slight AU.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
