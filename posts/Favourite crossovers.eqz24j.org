I am personally a big fan of crossover fanfics where people from other shows enter the Harry Potter universe (they maintain the origins of their powers from that universe). My personal favourite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10037927/1/The-Mad-Professor][The Mad Professor]] which I think handles the crossover story very well. What are your favourite crossovers?

This fic made me read skitter and is an excellent example of a character doing their upmost to have the advantage.
