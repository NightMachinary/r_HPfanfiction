Ive read these two takes on Scorbus and I absolutely love them and have to suggest them!

I loved reading these but both of them take place after cursed child so I'm interested in reading anything with Albus and Scorpius before the time turner incident and would be super thankful for suggestions!


** This fic is set after the time turner incident, so it doesn't quite match your criteria, (which is to say, it doesn't match it really at all) but it is rather sweetly “scorbius”

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.
