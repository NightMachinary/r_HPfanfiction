Harry, after the events of the Chamber of Secrets (which resulted in Ginny's death), is accused of murder. He loses his supposed best friend, as well as all the support from his best friends (Susan and Daphne). Dumbledore has no choice but to expel Harry from Hogwarts (but promises to try his best to get Harry back to school) even though he knows his innocence.

Desolate and alone, Harry wanders aimlessly through the streets of the diagonal alley. Stopping for ice cream, he ends up sitting with a gentleman who looks kind and outgoing. Harry begins to ramble about his life, and what led him to be alone there, (including his escape from his abusive uncles, after being threatened by his uncle, and having nothing to lose, decided to leave.)

The old man then says that this is a great opportunity to get another apprentice, after all it has been many years since the last one. Harry gets confused and ends up asking his name, the man just smiles and says nonchalantly, "Nice to meet you, Harry Potter. Call me Nicolas please. Oh and by the way, the philosopher's stone that was at hogwarts was false, I never would allow such a dangerous item to be out of my sight. "

Harry is surprised, and asks several questions to Flamel, who tries his best to answer the excited boy sitting in front of him.

Finishing his mint ice cream, Nicolas asks Harry again, if he would accept. Harry says that he would love to accept, but he couldn't afford it, and he had nowhere to live. Nicolas waves his hand, and says he has no problem, that it would be fun for him to teach again after so many years.

And there begins the great adventure of Harry and Nicolas Flamel around the world.

*** Agreed! No reason to have multiples, although it was probably just an accident
