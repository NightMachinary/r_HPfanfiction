What do you look for in a fanfiction?

Specific pairings? Specific plots? Specific non-romantic relationships? Happy stories in which everyone is alive? Angsty stories in which everyone is dead? AUs? Original characters? Answers to life, the universe and everything (aka fics that explain Magic through Science)? The Marauders era? Porn without plot? Porn /with/ plot? Redemption fics? Sick fics? Silly fics? Short fics? Long fics?

And how do you guys find the specific thing you want? (besides coming to this here subreddit and submitting a request, that is)

Scryer? FFN's terrible internal search engine? AO3's hella useful tags? Reading summaries one by one of a hundred thousand fics until you find The One that screams "me, read me", only to find you've read it before and there are no good fics left because you already devoured all the best ones so now life is meaningless and not worth living? ... Google?

I am a curious person~


** One of the big ways to find fics that you've not listed is looking through the favourites of an author you like.

What do I look for, well increasingly post Hogwarts. There are 700,000 HP fanfics. A lot less after I filter out Hermione and Snape but there are still loads. I'm not claiming to have read all of them but I'm sure I've read the archetype at least once and I don't feel the need to read a dozen poorly written copies. Post Hogwarts has a lot less limits which makes it far more interesting but much harder to write as almost anything written has to be somewhat original.

If you're feeling you've read all there is to read, even when you know its not true I recommend branching out into crossovers and other fandoms for a while and hopefully something new crops up while you're away. If you're desperate for a Harry Potter fix then have you read linkffn(2859327) ? One of my favourites and I rarely see it recommended.

  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?

** What do I look for? Explorations of themes, elements or characters I like about the Potterverse (Horcruxes, Basilisks, Elves...), and a good dose of humor.

Where do I find them? Mostly this very subreddit. Barring that, I use the already-mentioned "look at your favorite author's favourite lists", and if that doesn't work I do use Fanfiction.net's search engine.

** I like a good OC story. Usually in a pairing with one of my favourite characters. Usually set in the marauders era. In recent years I've drifted toward AUs. Mostly ones set after Hogwarts/high school.

Search wise I am one of those people that filters by character and then reads every damn bio. It's exhausting but I've found some cool stuff that would have been filtered out otherwise!

** I have my own app written to not deal with FFN horrible search engine that I have been using instead for past 2 yrs. It's a bit different in design philosophy from Scryer and mostly made so that I don't have to read through the same fic in search results more than once.

You're free to try it, but do keep in mind that a database incompatible version will be rolled out in a month or so that will be much much faster. (not that it is really that slow if you only look inside HP fandom)

** I mostly stick with AUs, time travel fics, Wrong or non BWL, and OC/SI fics. How I find more fics? Click the author's name who's fic I'm reading and check their favorites mostly. Sometimes I just get lucky or come here to find more fics.

** I look at the faves and bookmarks of authors I like. On AO3, I also look at the ship tags so I don't miss anything excellent and new.

At one point I started at the earliest SSHG fic on AO3 and read every one with a decent summary until I got to the beginning.

I also consult rec lists and keep an eye on the appropriate tags on tumblr.

As for what I'm looking for - I'm at a very shippy phase right now. So I look for the ship I like. I look for fics that have a cool name or lots of reviews. Occasionally when I've been burned by people breaking up my fave couple without warning, I check the last chapter to make sure they're together by the end.

** I mostly use Scryer, supplemented with following through to an author's favourites list if it looks like their preferences are similar to my own.

I think it has a problem, where it does not show newer fics. Or is it fixed already?
