Title says it all. I'm looking for good FFs involving Neville. There aren't really any forther specifications.I'll read just about anything, really. Can be AU, Crossover, Slash, Het,... Only thing I won't read is mpreg and bashing.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness]] is a pretty popular one.

** Have a peek at these, kind sir. There are varying amounts of Neville, but I liked them all. Slash in one or two, I'm not sorting as you said you don't care ;)

  Neville is completely oblivious he's revealed anything, Harry doesn't know how this will affect their friendship or their working relationship and the only liquor he has tastes like peaches. HP/NL slash. My kingdom to my beta reader Alex.

  After the war, Neville and Harry meet up to mock people and get drunk. It's a good life. Post-DH oneshot crackfic.

#+begin_quote
  When the Hogwarts house-elves are felled by a virus, the students discover that looks can be deceiving. Starring the Golden Trio Neville and assorted Hogwarts staff. Warning for adolescent humor and an excess of silliness.

#+begin_quote
  Neville's most spectacular Potions failure ever. 'You have twelve minutes to complete your cackhanded concoctions and hand them in to me.' Snape is going to wish he never said those words...

#+begin_quote
  A what if AU story where too many people meddle with the Goblet of Fire with surprising results. Neville is selected instead of Cedric and Harry is Fleur's hostage to rescue. Dark Dumbledore. Rated M for a reason!

*** Gossip Queens is one of those fics I read when I just need something light hearted and short(ish). Makes me laugh every time.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]] "Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new."

Neville is a major player and primary love interest, carrying on in the "Hero of Hogwarts" mode. Lots of smut, including slash and Polyjuicing.

** At the risk of blatantly self promoting, I am currently writing one... It's AU Neville/OC pairing, rated M, and, currently, is over 100,000 words and I update ever week. The OC is Draco Malfoy's twin sister. It all takes place during the 6th book, after the ministry ordeal. So yeah... Hopefully it is interesting to you.
