Most of you must recall the quote of Voldemort in canon about him possessing small animals when he was a wraith in Albania, and how snakes could bear him the longest. Most assume the animals died of magical weariness from having to channel Voldemort's dark powers, and snakes, being more closely affiliated to his magic (Parseltongue and all that) were more resistant.

While this is still my leading theory, my work on a more comedic Voldemort for the /Ask Lord Voldemort/ blog has given me the following alternative: what if Voldemort is just no good with pets? When possessing the animals full-time, he would suppress their instincts of when to feed, to rest and not exert themselves. He would have no idea what, when and how often a mouse should eat, and, stubbornly refusing to give up control, end up with his host starving to death, dying of exhaustion or dying of food poisoning. Snakes could bear him longer because, being close to Nagini, he has a somewhat better idea how to keep one healthy and running... but again, even his knowledge of snakes is far from perfect and sooner than later he makes a fatal mistake.


** Or perhaps it's because snakes go a long time between meals? He could be an all round idiot when it comes to animals, maybe. The power he knows not...

Or if he just did't care. Depending on how easy it was for him to [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf][bodysurf,]] it could've been more convenient for him to just burn the bodies out and switch hosts than bother with the whole mortal ‚Äútaking care of the body‚Äù thing. Ugh.

And snakes could've either just been more fun for him to ‚Äúroleplay‚Äù as or provoked at least some kind of empathic reaction.

Also, I think this is good enough to also be posted to [[/r/FanTheories/]] (unless it already has been, somewhere in the past).
