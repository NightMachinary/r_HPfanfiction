**** Yep- "Alexandra Potter". He mentions it in the 1st chapter A/N. IIRC, Taure ended up not liking how it played out and deleted it with a note that he was going to rewrite it. Hence, "Victoria Potter".

I'll be honest, I hope Victoria ends up being just as much of a bitch as Alexandra was.

******* I quite enjoyed them, but Alex herself is not a likable main character. She's flawed, but written that way, so she's not badly written. She's interesting to read about, but I probably wouldn't be her friend.

********* Yeah, you're right. Brian was ok? Archie wasn't bad. Claudia was not perfect, but she seems to have been heavily traumatized, and thus wasn't a great mum. But she got a raw deal. Alex's boyfriend who's name I forget was decent, ASAIR.

Julia! Actually, most her sisters seemed ok. But Julia was best.

All the House Elves were great. Specially the library ones.

**** That may be true but it doesn't really answer my question. There are a lot of good writers out there that write stuff I'm just not interested in. It claims to be different from canon, but in what manner? What's the tone of the story? "Magic, friendship, and boarding school life" doesn't really tell me anything.

***** Ok, so my take - Victoria is not a female Harry. She's an entirely different person, a new character. Some femHarry stories just rewrite canon but Harry has different genitals, and sometimes red hair. Even if the books are different, her childhood still happened exactly the same.

Victoria is very different. Harry believes what he is told - magic isn't real. He never really ponders his accidental magic. He's completely oblivious. Victoria actually experiments with her magic. She seems to have slight metamorphmagus abilities, which is what most of her magic is. The hair thing she takes and plays with. She's treated differently, being a girl - she gets her own clothes, rather than Dudley's, Dudley isn't allowed to get away with hitting her, she has friends, since Dudley isn't going to threaten girls away. The whole ridiculous letter debacle never happened, that's all treated very differently. Also, I don't think Vernon and Petunia use 'corporeal punishment', and I'm pretty sure she gets fed decently. Also, no cupboard.

***** There is only 3 chapters so there is not much to go off at this point. I can't stand canon rehashes and I enjoyed what is written so far. There are different events (so no zoo or hagrid thankfully). Instead McGonagall shows up at the home to show Victoria around in a different way than canon. Solid writing, good original descriptions and characterization (so far at least).

It's just a different take on how Harry's life may have turned out if he was born a girl. Interesting to see how different characters react to her rather than Harry, how more feminine qualities influence things, interests, friendships and abilities. There is also a bit of a different tone and thought process to her than Harry. I would say good writing often makes all the difference in how much I care about a fic and this one seems great so far. Always nice and rare to see a fic where author really let's you get into the head of the main character and explore characterization of someone. Also has some good humour, lighthearted undertones at times which I enjoy. I can't say how it will turn out though since there is barely anything written at this point.
