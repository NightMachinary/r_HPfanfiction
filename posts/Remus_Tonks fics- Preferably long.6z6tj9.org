Out of all the pairings in canon, this is the one that made the least amount of sense to me. I'd appreciate some good long fics that fill in the gaps of their romance and builds up their relationship convincingly from OOTP. Anything that shows how and why they fell for each other. Thanks.


** [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2339&chapno=1][Shifts]] and its sequel [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2681&chapno=1][Shades]] by Fernwithy are both pretty good. OotP and HBP, respectively. Remus works as a muggle teacher in Dudley's school in the first story.

** I can't recommend the epic [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/325274][Be the Light in my Lantern]] series by starfishstar enough. Couple of things - the entire series is canon-compliant and covers pre-OOTP to the end of HBP, while many of their other works from their other series all fit into this amazing "what the adults were doing" timeline that's all perfectly canon-compliant, plausible, exciting and romantic.

I'm a sucker for well-written, canon-compliant Remus/Tonks fic and this epic is, personally, the best I've ever seen. It's so good that this is literally my headcanon alongside whatever we have from Rowling in the books. The author especially shines in the little details, something that Rowling nailed in the original books - making the narrative seem as though it belonged perfectly in the actual HP series.

And although there are OCs in the series (in case they're not your thing - I usually eschew OCs), the ones that the author has included in this series are so well-written and developed that I kind of forgot that they weren't an actual part of the canon HP world.

We never got enough of Remus/Tonks in the books and movies - and although Rowling has clarified their romantic timeline via Pottermore, I also enjoy that the author saw fit to alter that a bit without deviating from the books, making it (IMO) more convincing than Rowling's timeline of when they fell in love.

Do also check out the author's other works as well - though not everything is Remus/Tonks-centric, most of all their fics, when put together in chronological order, provide a series of absolutely delightful, funny and even heartbreaking alternate perspectives on the series.

Having collated and pieced together all the author's canon compliant fics to read chronologically alongside my re-read of the whole series as well as another amazing author's take on Snape's life, I have no regrets. Hope you enjoy them too :)

*** Oh wow. That's huge. I wonder why it doesn't have more attention. I always feel bad when writers create such large work but with disproportionate kudos and comments. Thanks for the recommendation! I'll be quite busy with my reading this weekend.

If it's not the Snape Chronicles, can I know which fic this is? He's my favourite character so I'm always on the lookout for more fics about him.
