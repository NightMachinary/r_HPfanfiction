  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Not From Others by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] is my absolute favourite. The best fanfiction about Hogwarts under the Death Eater regime. Calling it just canon-compliant would be an understatement, given how beautifully it fits into canon.

A great strength of the fic is characterization. Ginny is perfectly written and the minor characters and OCs feel like real people too.

There were several scenes that made me cry, especially during the Battle of Hogwarts, which was just perfect.

**** Neville is a major character as he's one of the D.A. leaders, but the story is very focused on Ginny. I don't think his role is as large as you're looking for.

I'd be happy to find a good Neville-centric story too, as he's one of my favourite characters.

I didn't like Year of Darkness either. The author takes "Army" far too literally. I also found the characterization quite off.

  One year into Voldemort's rein, a confrontation with the Dark Lord catapults the Boy-Who-Lived into 1975. Will he be content to sit around and let the past repeat itself? Absolutely not. Time Travel. Not very HBP or DH compliant. Awesome!Harry. Eventual Harry/Lily/Narcissa/Bellatrix. Not a smutfic.

As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

** This is totally non objective and it has been years since I last read it but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/282139/27/After-the-End][After the end]] by Zsenya and Arabella is always going to have a special place in my heart. I remember it had a couple of issues (mainly the characters being stupid with each other) but other than that it's one of those fics that defined what HP fanfiction could be during the 3-year summer (along with Barb's and others).

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** linkffn(A Little More Time by Jesse Pallas).

A Remus/Tonks fixfic for their deaths that manages to be epilogue compliant and has few, if none plot holes. Teddy Lupin, wishing to save his parents at the battle, brings his parents foward some 20 years into the future and the plot carries on from there. Features a time travel story that isnt about travelling backward in time, Remus/Tonks feels about being displaced and general Lupin bonding

linkffn(Heart and Soul by Philosophize)

3rd in a series of Fem!Harry/Hermione femslash, it starts with the fic Yule Ball Panic! Fem!Harry falls in love with Hermione and has to struggle with the desire to ask her out for the Yule Ball Panic, while facing traditional societal boundaries. It has compelling worldbuilding, especially focusing in how witches are treated differently in the wizarding world, a fem!harry story that acknowledges that difference, a romance that explores the growing sexualization between the two witches and recognizes that they are a young couple and some moments while Fem!Harry has been training and gaining in magical strength and the results are spectacular. Plus, for a series in progress, it has a regular update schedule, which is a major plus in my book. Quibbles include some lengthy exposition(250k+ words is pretty long for a fic that covers half of 4th year and would have been an instant turnoff for me if not for the quality) and a Dumbledore that is kinda clueless about the fact that Harry and Hermione are together

Linkffn(Renegade by 1991kira)

Explores Ruthless/Grey/Dark! Harry. It does succumb to some of their faults at times, by forgetting that Harry is pretty young in some of the earlier chapters and is a little too competent and hyper aware for his age and some dark moments regarding the Dursleys. But it does something different by exploring Harry through different characters' Pov, doesnt bash Ron and instead uplifts and supports him, a rarity in our fics indeed, plus i enjoy the moments he delivers some righteous vengeance upon the Death Eaters

linkao3(1859733)

First Harry Potter triad fic starring the Golden Trio that got me interested in a polyamorus relationship.

There's also "La déclaration de guerre" (the declaration of war) which is about ... a lot of things actually. But it's really fun, and it doesn't take itself seriously. It's long of course, but definitely a must read !

Another funny one is "Il pense donc il est" (He thinks, therefore he is), where Harry is really cynical and sarcastic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4477709/1/Il-pense-donc-il-est]]

And the last (for now) is "Et si tout était différent" (And if everything was different) where James potter may not have died the 31st October, and many other things :) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5754121/1/Et-si-tout-%C3%A9tait-diff%C3%A9rent]]

** ''The Diggory Papers'' linkffn(2846963) Essentially GoF from Cedric's PoV.

It's heavily influenced by the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Flashman][Harry Flashman]] books so Cedric is clever and charming, but also a lying cheating cowardly anti-hero scoundrel. As it\s written as the memoirs of an elderly Cedric, it's not a spoiler to say he survives the events of book four. But the story still quite cleverly manages to be compliant with canon and not an AU.

** I can't decide which one is my favorite, so instead, here's the one I think is the funniest: linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/654840]])

Technically Lucius/Hermione, but even if you don't care for that pairing, it is /well/ worth it for the part where Lucius is drugged and gets arrested after he goes to McDonald's for a Happy Meal. High Lucius makes me laugh every time, no matter how many times I read it. XD

** I'm going to give it to you straight up. The /Alexandra Quick/ series is the best fanfiction in the fandom, and possibly the entire world, and I'm not exaggerating. It's fucking astounding how good it is.
