** The same things most other HP fics lack, I'd guess. There are just fewer of them, which makes it more prevalent.

** As already stated: Most lack originality, creativity, good writing... the standard grievances you have with a lot of fics.

But fem!Harry specifically often just make it "Harry Potter, but as a girl", with no change to the character whatsoever. I think if you make Harry a girl, you need to think of the implications of this switch.

*** After thinking about it, I agree.

I was going to comment that some writers may be more comfortable writing females and that it could be a valid reason for a female protagonist. While this is true, it isn't true for the top stories. Top stories are typically written by good writers. They should will be able to write both genders decently and therefore have no real reason to go for a fem-harry. This leaves us back to that a gender change should have a purpose.

** Originality...

Also, Lily would most likely name her daughter after a flower rather then something like Harriet or some variety of that.

*** One fic I read had an explanation for her being named Harriet. Lily had a name picked out for both a girl (Holly) and a boy (Harry) depending on which she was having. But once she gave birth to a girl, she was a bit loopy from all the post pregnancy hormones and broke down in the hospital after deciding that the name Holly did not fit well and that the name Harry was better. So James ended up agreeing to name their daughter Harriet instead of Holly. Although Sirius still ends up calling Harry Holly quite a bit.

**** It's not that the name Harriet is bad. It's just so unoriginal in fanfics. A girl name does not have to be just a ‘female' variation of Harry. From what I recall, the main reason why Harry was named Harry is the fact he was named after his great-grandfather, Henry.

It's like calling a female Draco, ‘Draconica' Malfoy. Seriously! No sane high class pureblood would call their daughter that! Narcissa would likely name her daughter Lyra or Carina, which are names after other constellations.

** Femmeslash. There aren't enough lesbian fem!Harrys.

I'm kidding. :) The main problem with a lot of fem!Harry stories is that they just retell the canon story with a few changed pronouns and chancing of prospective love interests... or they're just an excuse to write Harry/Draco or Harry/one-of-the-Weasley-twins without actually writing slash.

For me, fem!Harry is most interesting if she actually changes the way the story is told in some way... and not just in the "oh, she's cooler than canon Harry so things go easier for her" way.

At the moment I'm writing a fem!Harry story that's a very big AU; essentially I've turned not only Harry but 90% of the magical world female, and pretty much restructured magical society and tried to explore what it would be like if only one in ten magical births was male. The goal is essentially to tell a different story... oh, fine, there'll be femmeslash along the line too. :)

**** No, it's published, even if it's not that far along yet. Six chapters up on AO3 so far, though I've started to post it on FF.Net as well because people kept nagging me to. (I'm still not convinced I /like/ FF.Net as a place to post stories... )

Anyway, here are the links. Only three chapters up on FF.Net so far because I was advised to not release the entire story all at once.

** For me it's the fact that Harry's female version often enough turns out to be girly (into fashion, accessories, jewelry and what have you)...damned, write a compelling TOMBOY-Girl-Harry and I'll read that fanfiction in a heartbeat (unless it's Female-Harry/Ron or Draco or Snape!)

The other point is actually the pairings I've seen so far (Female-Harry/Draco or Snape or even Lucius)...damned, no!

ps: Then again I also don't like Slash, Hermione/Draco, Hermione/Ron (unless it's only minor and in the background...hell, I am not a Hermione fan by any stretch, but: She can do better than Ron, Ron the useless, Ron the jealous etc.), Harry/Ginny an a lot of other things, so I guess what I wanted to add was:

I AM VERY PICKY when it comes to what I read :)
