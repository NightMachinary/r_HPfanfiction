I'm trying to find this story I read years ago, it was maybe absolutely terrible but I'd like to take a look for nostalgia. I remember there was also a sequel and both were fairly long.

Harry defeats Voldemort early and gets adopted by Snape and family - Snape already has two children and Draco is his god son. I believe his wife was Dumbledores daughter. Harry uses a spell to hide abuse (?) and gets caught. I believe he also ended up in hospital for a long time at some point and took an inhaler. Narcissa Malfoy marries Remus Lupin and they also have a child. Draco and Harry eventually become friends. Harry becomes really interested in potions too. I also remember that the author didn't have English as their first language so I thought parts were clunky.

Pretty vague I know, does anyone know what fic this is?
