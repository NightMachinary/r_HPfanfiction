** "You can keep my sandwich"

Harry Potter, 'A Black Comedy' by Nonjon. It's such a simple line but it is both the beginning and the ending of arguably the best story on fanfiction.net .

Otherwise I'll go with this

“Refresh my memory, I think I've played the obliviate game before but I'm kind of fuzzy on the rules.”

James, Jimmy, Potter. 'A Black Comedy' by nonjon.

*** Ha! Remember in the first chapter when he goes to the ministry, he overhears an old witch say to her friend about him, "I'd gobble him right up" - Harry gets into the elevator and his mind wonders about the benefits and drawbacks of a turkey animagus form. Then later when he's in the Veil room, the unspeakable Vargas suggests going for lunch - Harry begs off, but instead asks if she could bring him a sandwich (+1 just for that) and when she asks what kind, Harry says absently, "Whatever looks freshest. Turkey, maybe."

It's stuff like that makes me love Nonjon.

Also, Jimmy, Sarah, Lily and Albus being in the hospital wing and everyong is ganging up on Jimmy. Albus is trying to subtly influence him into revealing that Harry is really Harry Potter. So Jimmy turns to Albus and says, "Hey Headmaster, don't you think Harry and Sarah would make a cute couple?".

** I'm gonna go a more serious route and quote one of my favorite stories, which is a Snape mentors Harry fic with horcrux consequences as well as Snape helping Harry deal with all the shit fate throws at him.

linkffn(5878880)

"A bit barmy." Snape repeated, giving Harry his "you haven't understood a word I've said all day" look.

"You've had the horcrux since you were fifteen months old. By extension, it was there while you learned to talk, learned to feed yourself, learned how to use the toilet, learned to write, read, count, fly, dress yourself, cook, clean, do magic, and play. Any of these activities could be affected or lost when the horcrux is destroyed."

Harry stared at Snape as he swallowed his mouthful of food. Fifteen months was not that high up on the evolutionary scale, and even though Harry knew that the horcrux inside of him had to go, the challenge he faced doing it quite frankly scared him. Not knowing the most likely outcome at all would almost better than this guessing game at what would be lost.

"You'd teach me all these things again, if I forget how to do them?" Harry asked, trying not to sound hopeful that no matter what happened, Snape would stick around.

"Yes, Elliot." Snape sighed, sounding put out and very sarcastic. "I will help you learn to read again, eat properly without dribbling food on yourself, make sure you don't break your neck the next time you hop on a broom. I will even potty train you, as embarrassing as that will be for the both of us."

Snape rolled his eyes and took another sip of beer.

** In all fanfiction? Doctor Dire of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/][Dire Worm!]] easily takes the cake, then. There's many great quotes, but one of the best, and one that can be understood without knowing what's going on:

"TUITION PAYMENT IS HEREBY WAIVED, YOUR APPLICATION IS ACCEPTED, AND YOU ARE NOW OFFICIALLY ENROLLED IN PAIN UNIVERSITY, ON TRACK TO GRADUATE MAGNA CUM LAUDE WITH A MAJOR IN GETTING YOUR ASS KICKED! AND NOW YOU SHALL BE WELCOMED TO YOUR DORMITORY OF SHAME WITH MANDATORY BEATINGS!"

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore was now a woman as he had healed his wound and converted it into a woman part. He and Olivander were going to make wonderful babies he thought with a grin. Just then a sick looking Barnes came in no doubt a little queasy from drinking his man hood. Dumbledore was just about to command him to make love to him when there was a crash outside his office that awoke him with a startle. It was Olivander clutching his nose only his nose was gone and replaced by a lobster. "No the lobsternasalus hex" he shrieked. He tried to run but his leg was slow as he had cut off his real leg as punishment for being pure blood. Just then a large man it was Hagrid began attacking Olivander "yer a liar Dumbledore you could have gotten me a wand again after I was expelled" he said as he picked Olivander up like a baby and snapped his spine over his knee and launched him into orbit Olivander exploded in a shower of gore as he connected with the hard wall outside the ministry showering the muggles. "Hagrid you will forget this and make love to me"Dumbledore ordered throwing off his greasy cloak "Over me dead body" Hagrid roared as he saw Dumbledores new addition. He grabbed Dumbledore by the nose and twisted until he ripped the cartilage off his nose and pocketed it. Dumbledoe fainted and Hagrid threw him into an empty sack and beat the ground a few times breaking all his bones and making sure to feed Dumbleforks nose to Fluffy and Fang.

  Dumbledore is different than what he would like you to believe. This shows a slightly different old coot.
