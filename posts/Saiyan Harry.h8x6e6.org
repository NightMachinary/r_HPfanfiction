I have read harry potter: Saiyan wizard and the legacy of a Saiyan fanfics. And I really like the idea of a Saiyan Harry Potter in the magic world. Do you know any other fanfics were Harry is a Saiyan. (I don't care why). It would be better if is a long fanfic, but I would accept everything.


** Harry tossed Voldemort a senzu bean, "I will defeat you at your strongest!"

Everyone else facepalms.

  After falling off a carriage on the way to an event Harry is nearly killed by wolves and is recused and sent to a new home. 4 years later he gets a letter from Hogwarts and returns to the wizarding world. Harry's parents are alive. Wrong BWL.

  DBZ Crossover. Wizarding world is at war and all hope is lost. Harry Potter has been missing for years. Then he is found... and he has no magic. Completely different chain of events.
