Not sure if this is a product of an overactive imagination or if this is something I've read and then forgot about, but is there a fic where Hagrid goes back in time and decides to adopt/raise Tom Riddle to prevent/change what is going to happen?


** I doubt that would work out too greatly. I love Hagrid as much as the next guy but Tom is far too intelligent to not run circles around him.

I've always had problems with these "fixing Tom" fics. I think people disregard the fact that psychopaths aren't always made far too easily. There's a lot more to the nature vs nurture debate of course, but afaik it's generally believed that a lot of psychopaths are born with a lack of empathy, which is not something easily fixed just by giving an orphan a parental figure.

With that you just made this idea more appealing to me. I imagine a bumbling but kind hearted Hagrid arguing "No, little Tommy is a nice boy, he's just a bit misunderstood. He's no budding Dark Lord! Right Tommy!" "Of course not 'Daddy.'"

*** Agreed, but I still like the idea a lot . I have had issues with the fixing Tom tropes, but I believe in nature vs nurture with nurture winning out.

*** Well, there is time travel involved, but it /would/ be really weird since they went to school together.

*** Yes, but Hagrid survives the war and goes back in time and then finds himself in a situation to do some good.

  Time travel is a quirky and dangerous thing. Tom Marvolo Riddle is a dangerous and quirky person. Quirky and dangerous are hard to control. It's a good thing that Hagrid has experience in controlling both.

*** Me too. I seem to remember reading this. Hagrid also plans and sets up Minerva with Tom? Not sure again if this is something I want to read or I've read already
