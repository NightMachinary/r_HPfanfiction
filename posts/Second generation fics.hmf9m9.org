Hey guys! It's been quite a while since the last time I've read a HP fanfic, and this quarantine we're living is making me feel nostalgic. I would love to read some creative story! Could you please recommend me one about the second generation? It can be centered on Teddy or Scorpius or Albus during Hogwarts. I'd like it to be good (you know, well written, plots well developed, problems and difficulties are dealt with accordingly etc) and preferable complete. No specific plot needed. If it could have a Teddy/Victoire or Scorpius/Rose pairing, it would be awesome.

Thank you very much!


** The best ones I know are: * linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox) ... whole seven years Albus/Scorpius/Rose story. A lot of good music (one of then ends up as a professional musician) * Series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] ... by far the best (and different from all others) Dudley-has-magical-daughter series.
