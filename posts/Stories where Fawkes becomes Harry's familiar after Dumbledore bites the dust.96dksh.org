I'd love to read a fic where, after singing his mourning song, Fawkes disappears in a burst of flame to land on Harry's shoulder. It always seemed kind of odd to me that Fawkes wouldn't align himself with Harry, who by all estimates made Dumbledore look like a stick in the mud by the time he was in 6th year.

What? How so? Dumbledore as Riddle were geniuses during their school year. Floating above common mortals and bored by them. The O.W.L. examinator Griselda Marchbanks said

#+begin_quote
  "Examined [Dumbledore] personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did N.E.W.T.s... Did things with a wand I'd never seen before."
#+end_quote

and while there is nothing officially confirmed it would be not too far fetched to think that Dumbledore aced all his O.W.L exams. In the 7th book it was said that even in his first year he was considered the best amongst his peers.

Harry is at the very best a good student but except in DADA I think he is mostly average if not under average and a bit lazy. He can apply himself if he wants and needs it but he doesn't seek excellence. In this regard Hermione would be more fit to inherit Fawkes attention and only if we look at competences. Even so I think Dumbledore was more intuitive and creative than Hermione who, even if she can find solution to problem quite intelligently, lack the creativity Dumbledore surely had. She follows too much textbooks and teachings (as seen in HPB with the potion book fiasco) to seek to improve things as she doesn't automatically believe it could be done. Hell even Riddle on the amazing/powerful/academic side of the argument would be a better fit.

I think that Fawkes followed Dumbledore because despite almost falling for the Dark side (unfortunately they had cookies and no lemon drops) he resisted, opposed it quite vehemently and then applied all his life to be as good and at the same time neutral as possible (maybe too much neutral? Too optimistic and nice? But that's a question for another day).

Harry is good but I don't think he had such a existential crisis. He wouldn't have become dark as it embodied all he (maybe subconsciously too) hated. The reason why his parents were dead, his placement (even if the responsibility was shared wi AD) at the Dursley's, the attempts on his life, ... all was in his mind because of the dark and as good as he was he didn't need Fawkes.

Dumbledore after almost falling for the other side maybe needed a reminder that his choice had been the right one. To keep him from falling back or to reward him for his resolve on such a hard choice.

We don't know lot (more like nothing) about his bonding with Dumbledore so maybe his travels or some past action endeared Fawkes to him.

Aside from this, Harry had already Hedwig at the time and for the plot, the struggle clearly wouldn't have been the same with an OP, game-breaking glorified giant flamed bird with him. HP is also about the fight of an average boy against overwhelming odds and the power of friendship and love. Fawkes clearly would have been too much and if you think about it. So much of book 7 would have been solved in "and then Fawkes appeared and saved the day"; Fleur and Bill's wedding, the Trio ministry escapade, the Trio escape, the Godric's Hollow fiasco, the Malfoy imprisonment, the Gringotts heist, the Poudlard heist, the Poudlard Battle... you get the idea.

So yeah in conclusion there are really few reason in my opinion for Harry to get Fawkes. At least not if you want to have the same story or if you want to follow the established facts.

[EDIT]: Sorry for the mini-rant I got carried away.

*** Yeah, the message of HP is:

You may be average and maybe even lazy, but you will step up to the plate when the time comes and as long as you are willing to die for your friends then everything will be ok!

Frankly:

A shitty message, especially since so many people died because Harry didn't train (or at the very least: Try his best in school! Seriously, his on his feet thinking paired with Hermione's dedication to learning? Yeah, Harry would have been something, but canon Harry? Seriously, he's not great! Frankly he's shitty at planning (they lacked basic items on the 'crux-hunt, like enough (non-perishable) food to feed a small army! They didn't know how long it would take, but the only person doing a little bit of planning was Hermione! Seriously, Harry was like: "I bring this wand and some clothes, that'll work right?"...bah!) and has to rely on unforgiveables to get shit done in fights against deatheaters (Dumbledore got by without those spells and he was still nigh unstopable!))

Hermione (and I am not even a Hermione-Fanboy!) would have made a much better hero than canon Harry :(

** What does Dumbledore being a powerful wizard have to do with having a Phoenix? A Phoenix is a symbol of the light. Dumbledore wanted to rule over muggleborns when he was a kid.. Harry laid does his life for the wizarding world.

*** If you read what I wrote about it, Harry doesn't need a phoenix. Either for the plot, because he already has Hedwig or because as you said he is (and I don't really like this formulation) a light wizard through and through. He doesn't need more light. To me Dumbledore having a phoenix was a confirmation for him that his choice was the correct one while opposing Grindelwald, a reminder and a "reward" for being able to reject his darker side despite all. In a sense he sacrificed his love (Grindelwald) for the "Greater Good".

Harry never was even tempted. Even Dumbledore said so and for that he doesn't need anything to keep him grounded.

I'll add that nothing textual was written in cannon stating that Phoenix were attracted to "light" wizards (the idea that they'll follow *only* light wizard is (if I'm not mistaken) purely fanon). Yes they have positive abilities like healing tears and uplifting chants but what is said about them above all is that they are loyal. So if someone was to bound with one they'll stay til death of the "owner". It's also said on the wiki that, on the "owner" 's (why couldn't a phoenix bind with a centaur or a goblin?) death it will prefer to go alone than to find a new partner. Maybe they'll find one but the fact that it's precised in cannon that they are loyal makes me think that someone must do something to earn this loyalty. Maybe something personal for the phoenix more than just a good deed. Or a good deed in front of the said bird but I don't think phoenixes live their life witnessing and spying humans in wait of such a person.

Also as said and cannon, a phoenix named Sparky is the mascot of a New Zealand Quidditch team. May not be "dark" but I don't think Quidditch would be qualified as "light" either.

Well your formulation that

#+begin_quote
  Harry, who by all estimates made Dumbledore look like a stick in the mud by the time he was in 6th year.
#+end_quote

really sound like Harry would be stronger than Dumbledore. It may not be what you meant but it's what it sound like and what everyone seems to have understood (me included)

*** Dumbledore wanted to rule over muggles, not muggleborns. That was also when he was young. Nearly a century after the events of the books take place.

That bit about phoenixes and "the light" is also nonsense. A Quidditch owns a phoenix.

** Harry is nowhere near Dumbledore's level. Not sure why you think that. I'm honestly fairly certain a 5th year Dumbledore would surpass Harry by the end of the war.

*** Indeed, he'd transfigure rings around Harry! Hell, Dumbledore would probably beat most professors without even using any other magic than transfiguration (and a stunner to knock them out without hurting them!)...if you give him access to everything (Charms, Defense, Dark Arts and Transfiguration, not to mention potions (like liquid luck - Felix Felicis!) etc.)? Yeah, you beat mate! The entire staff and school (including the DA!) could probably not touch a Dumbledore that is going all out! They might have a chance if he hasn't passed the NEWTS, but he would still take a ton of them with him and stand a chance to win!

** I don't know any where Harry /inherits/ a phoenix.

IIRC, for all its flaws, HPMOR had an interesting mechanism for "summoning" a phoenix: a phoenix is called when a worthy wizard or witch is at a crossroads, deciding whether to embark on a worthy quest that they do not expect to survive. If they choose to go ahead, the phoenix joins them; if not, the phoenix leaves. This opportunity is offered at most once in a lifetime. Dumbledore's phoenix came when he was deciding whether to confront Grindelwald---who, you might recall, was in possession of the unbeatable Elder Wand. He accepted, and managed to win by outlasting Grindelwald with the phoenix's help. Harry's phoenix came when he was debating whether to go to Azkaban and attempt to destroy all the Dementors. He rejected it.

How so? Harry is not Dumbledore.

Eh, by whose estimates? He hadn't even gotten the hang of nonverbal casting at that point. Harry a brilliant athlete, a fairly talented wizard, and a real hero, but there isn't anyone in his generation that's even close to Dumbledore's and Voldemort's tier by any meaningful measure.

** While I agree (might even inspire Harry to get off his lazy ass! I doubt it for canon Harry because frankly: He should have woken up at the latest after CoS, if not after Sorcerer's Stone...hell, he got a wake up call every year, but he heeded none of them! Not even after Cedric was killed and not even after the closest thing to a father that he has - Sirius - was killed!...seriously, how can you have a homicidal terrorist after you and not beg to be everybody to teach you stuff, from older students to teachers and even aurors etc. (and if you aren't: trying to learn yourself!) how to defend yourself?) that Fawkes should have stuck around (he could have gotten the trio out of a lot of sticky situations!), I totally disagree that Harry made Dumbledore look bad!

Seriously, Harry still worshipped the man (despite the fact that allmost all the bad things in Harry's life can be traced back to three people! One of them is Dumbledore! The other two would be Snape and Voldemort! Harry should IMHO have hated Dumbledore instead of naming a child after him! Same for Snape! Hell, if Rowling were consistent one of the kids would be called Tom Sirius Potter or something, so that Voldemort also gets a kid named after him!) and Dumbledore was above normal wizards (he was ahead miles in the "race"! He could have probably gotten the NEWTs in fifth year, if not earlier! He surprised the examiners when he took them after all!)
