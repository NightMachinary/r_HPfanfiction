Preferably post war. I feel like Harry would have bad anxiety after the battle of Hogwarts, but I haven't seen many fics with a decent portrayal of it.


** Linkffn(To Reach Without) is very inner monolog heavy and features a harry potter who suffers from anxiety, panic attacks and catastrophizing thought patterns.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)
