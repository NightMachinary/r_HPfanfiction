Hello I'm looking for a fic where Harry scares the ever-living crap out of Dumbledore, Voldemort, and quite a few others after Dumbles does/says something to Harry that sets him off. It'd be even funnier if Moldyshorts did everything in his power to confront Dumbles over the issue and why he had to set Harry of like that.

** 1) Quo Vadis? by Ruskbyte Summary: It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5614134/1/Quo-Vadis]]

2) The Eyes by Shadenight123

"They do not blink," Harry continued. "They do not breathe, drink, eat, properly talk or walk. They walk, but not well enough. They are not real. They are more than real. I see them," he whispered. "I see their shadows at night dance under the pale light of death's candle, and I'm afraid. Afraid..."

A sixteen year old would have been able to speak in such a way. At eleven with his shoddy and gaunt appearance, the words that Harry Potter, the saviour of the wizardry world, spoke were starting to make the back of Dumbledore's beard rise.

If that part right there didn't make you shit bricks I wouldn't know what would.

**** Glad you like it! I wish there were more scary fics out there. But somewhere along the line authors who try to write horror make it more comedic than scary. It's like they don't know how to create that ambiguity so that the reader can hold that suspension of disbelief. Does that make sense?

***** It does - well written horror seems to be confined to one-shot style stories. There seems to be a trend of over explanation in fanfic in general, and when you're writing horror that's a big nono.

****** Omg yes exactly! You explained everything so eloquently. Now I get why I hate MOD stories were the avatar of death exists and is very anthropocentric in nature. Immediately all the tension just cuts out. Because when the anthropocentric avatar of death is just used for exposition in those fanfics then where is the mystery ? That's why I love Lovecraftian cosmic horror it transcends the limited bounds of our understanding and it's legitimately terrifying.

*** It's a good-ish story but yes it is a bit odd that Harry gets less evil over time. He's never a /good/ person, but he does start limiting who he murders. also a bit odd that he justifies sparing young Harry but not destroying Voldemort
