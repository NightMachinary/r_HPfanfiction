I need a story where Dumbledore is as funny in canon but also kind of mean/snarky. Like He just gives backhand compliments and just insults everyone in a very polite and proper way and sometimes people don't realize he's insulting them. This kind of happens in canon but I want a story where he's more over the top.

*** I wasn't thinking about that when I wrote it but yeah I'd like those. Dumbledore really loves to troll I mean the House Cup Fake Out of 1991? Classic.

Somebody write Punk'd but hosted by Dumbledore not Ashrton Kutcher

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  What would you do if suddenly you found yourself in Dumbledore's body? Crying is definitely in the plan. Changing into a four year old? Not so much. Pretending to be the son of Severus Snape? Never!When you've nothing better to do, you write crack. Enjoy!

** There's a scene in linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay) where he absolutely /rips/ into Umbridge, all the while sounding perfectly pleasant in the chapter "The Dragons Clause."

Dumbledore's the best character of the fic.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
