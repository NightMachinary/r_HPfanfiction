Daphne's parents taught her to act as a perfect pureblood princess from a young age, but she's sick of it. She decides to become a rebel... Except she only has a vague idea of what that involves.

For her first act of defiance, when doing up her house tie before the mirror in the morning, she intentionally leaves it askew /by whole ten degrees/. Her heart is racing as she leaves for breakfast, but no one seems to notice.

Finally, when she's seated, a housemate glances at her with surprise and says, "Your tie's crooked." Daphne does her best to keep her voice level as she replies, "I don't /care/." The housemate shrugs, "Alright, then," and goes back to their food. Inwardly, Daphne can barely contain herself. /She's rebelling/!

At some point, she tries to swear - because that's what rebels do - but she only knows the mildest of oaths and misuses them at that.

It could be turned into Harry/Daphne because dating Harry Potter is clearly the ultimate act of rebellion.


** This, is an interesting idea. Is there a story for this? If not, somebody please make a story about this!!

It's Harry, and everyone assumes that they're dating from that moment on.

******* Daphne has a furious internal dialogue where she cannot remember which hand is proper to pass it with, then smiles wickedly (already zooted) as she realizes the delicious irony is in her freedom of rebellious indifference for tradition... Harry is utterly horrified by the look on face when he accepts it from her.

** Her parents learn that she is dating Harry Potter, and a little wary because of what the Prophet said , ask about him to their other daughter, Astoria, they end up horrified :

"Harry Potter? I don't really know him but Draco said he cheated his way into the Quidditch team first year even if he isn't even good. And that The teachers always favours him except Snape, and that he is always breaking rule like being out of bed at night or going into the Forbiden Forest. Also I heard he was responsible for the disparation of Professor Umbridge, and even Professor Lockart before and Professor Quirrel before that. Draco says he is really dangerous and that he should be interned for our own security."

*** Astoria could say completely horrible true things about him:

“I heard he melted Professor Quirrell's face off using only his hands.”

“Him and Ron Weasley made Professor Lockhart lose his mind and now he's in the crazy ward at St Mungo's.”

“He stunned Professor Snape so Sirius Black could escape.”

“He is very close with a werewolf.”

“He was the last person to see Barty Crouch before he died.”

“Him and Hermione Granger led Professor Umbridge out to the Forbidden Forest to have her gang-raped by a herd of centaurs.”
