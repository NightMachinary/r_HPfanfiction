I want a lengthy fanfiction where James ignores Lily. Thanks guys!


** This is an interesting request! The only story/series I can think of is the linkffn(tears on the balcony by byebyebirdie), /but/ I can't remember /when/ James ignores her. Because it starts out with him all gooey over her, then trying to get over her. Maybe if someone has read the first one more recently they can tell you, I just know it's somewhere. It's fairly long, as are the sequels, and the 3rd one is updating pretty regularly.

** linkffn(All Over Again by Lili Evans dotcom)

It's quite AU and James hates Lily because of something that happened when they dated previously? I'm not sure exactly cause I read it a long time ago
