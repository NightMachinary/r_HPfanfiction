I was a huge fan of Checkmated.com, a popular R/Hr site for years. Unfortunately it's been down, so myself and a few others in our Checkmated LJ community are looking for Allison, otherwise known online as alli-chan. She's the founder and owner of Checkmated and we are wanting to get a hold of her to figure out how to get it back up and running so we can access the stories! If you have any info, please share. THANKS! :)


** If you know of a still-working HP fanfic site that isn't ffnet, ao3, or the DLP forums, please let me know so I can mirror it. I'll backup the site and, should the original site become unreachable, publish it elsewhere.

I am currently mirroring:

- [[https://fictionalley.ikeran.org/authors/][Fictionalley]]

I am in the process of backing up:

- [[http://siye.co.uk][Sink Into Your Eyes]]
- [[http://www.ssf-moonshadow.com/archive/][Moonshadow]]
- [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/index.php][Petulant Poetess]]

- [[http://sugarquill.net/][Sugarquill]]
- [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/][Walking the Plank]]
- [[http://www.themasque.net/wiktt/efiction/][WIKTT]]

I can't back anything up after it's dead, so ask early.

*** This reminds me so much of creating horcruxes.

I think in a few decades, Muggle technology will be able to back up a person's memory.

** Please, if you are running an archive or know someone who is, tell them about the [[http://opendoors.transformativeworks.org/faq/][Open Doors Project of AO3]]

It's a fantastic service that can save the smaller archives from oblivion.

** There you go. Another fanfic site is down. This is why you back up your stories and don't just depend on a random person to keep a server online.

*** Well, no shit. Most of us aren't even trying to access our own stories, it's just being able to browse through the 1200 stories in the library. More reading material.
