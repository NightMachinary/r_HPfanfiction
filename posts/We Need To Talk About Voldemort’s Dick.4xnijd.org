** But what if it was actually the other way around? What if Bellatrix was the one who heterosexually m-pregged Voldemort?

** Okay, I know it's a running gag and all, but Voldemort /did/ have a nose--it was just a /snake-like/ nose rather than humanoid. So, presumably, he was also snake-like in other departments. (Not that I knowing anything about snake genitalia.)

** No, we do not need to talk about Voldemort's penis. You see, if I were allowed to change just one thing about CC, I would remove the fact that Voldemort and Bellatrix had a kid. Which would remove Delphi, which would remove all the rest of CC too. Wishful thinking.

*** I could tolerate Delphi...if she was batshit insane and /believed/ that she was the offspring of Voldemort and Bellatrix. But that would mean putting up with the rest of CC.
