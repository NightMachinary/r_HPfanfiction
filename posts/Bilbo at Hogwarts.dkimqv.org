Ok I'm looking for a fanfic where Bilbo ends up at Hogwarts by some fluke, because I recently read two of them and they were really entertaining~~ Those were ‘Short and Unique, but not Magical' and ‘The Small, Mysterious Creature at Hogwarts'.

If you know any other ‘Bilbo goes to Hogwarts' fanfics, please comment!

Here are the links btw: Short and Unique, but not Magical- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13127182/1/]]

The Small, Mysterious Creature at Hogwarts- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12752798/1/]]


** My view of Bilbo is that he's a very intelligent and pleasant person. The kind of person who Dumbledore could go to for discussing non-magical matters. The kind of person whose perspective and insight could turn someone like McGonnagal into a person who actually listens to people. I can't imagine him 'at Hogwarts' like that.

How do these fics characterize him?

*** He falls into a ravine in one and goes to sleep and wakes up at Hogwarts in the other, so he ended up there completely by accident.

In ‘Short and Unique, but not Magical', he's grateful for the hospitality and everything, but quickly gets homesick and desperate to return to Middle Earth. He spends most of his time in the library researching ways to get home and how and why he was there in the first place.

‘The Small, Mysterious Creature at Hogwarts' is only 3 chapters long and for the majority of the fic Bilbo is panicking about going back.

I have no idea if this answers your question, hopefully it's good enough.
