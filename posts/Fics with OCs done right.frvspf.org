So, this sub seems to dislike OCs because they're hard to do well - so, what fics have OCs that are? Done well, I mean. I've found two that I see as done well - Kitty from Behind Blue Eyes (warning, the plot is bleak as fuck - not dark, IMO, just bleak) and, of course, Abby from Grow Young With Me (exquisite fic, I truly adore it). Feel free to offer your opinion if you disagree, I'm certainly curious. :)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

** frombluetored's It's TeaTime series has some great OC's, most are next gen friends of the Potter kids. Caden, Nora, Iset, Ben and Evie, I have to stop or i can keep going forever and still miss one out. (plus there are Harry and Ginny's grandkids! - wait till you meet the twins!). Jenorama has a great OC amongst her Potterverse series, Ben, a a gay muggle who is Ginny's best friend. And I am currently reading an older fic, St Margaret's The New Zealand Chronicles and it has some great OC's as Harry is training for a Search and Rescue gig. And Hedwig's romance with a native owl is so cute! Continuing with my OTP Hinny, Annerb's The Changeling and the Armistice series has the Parlour girls and (again)Ginny';s best friend, Tobias. Floreatcastellum's current WIP is a James Sirius story with an OC Hazel. Shall I stop now? LOL

And from there my list went on and on lol. Please let me know what you think of the TeaTime series, the last one is not complete, the author was trolled and chose to start writing in the GoT fandom. I follow her on twitter and she is in lockdown due to Covid, and said she is bored, so i asked her to please consider finishing SFTOH. No reply, but i remain hopeful. Anyway, happy reading!!

***** Cool. It looks interesting - and there certainly is a lot of it, so that's good too. Do the relationships with Snape and Draco have some growth to them so the Werewolf and the Half-Blood aren't immediately dating people who are members of a group that would favour their deaths? Or is it just "We're in close proximity, you're hot, I'm hot, let's bang?" or Snape/Draco were good people all along and just forced to be the twats they were in canon?

No complaints either way, some fics have them grow into it and some do not, I just like to set my expectations when reading about Death Eaters shipped with their targets.

** The Durmstrang Chronicles by Loup Noir

This is about a group of teachers at Durmstrang, and only one HP character appears in a short section (Remus Lupin). It's interesting and has complex, grownup, flawed original characters. Mostly gen with some het relationships adding a bit of interpersonal drama, but it's not a romance series.

Not overly sure about Fate is a Four Letter Word after the first chapter. And does the pairing actually have character growth and development behind it, or is it the usual "They're in close proximity and we bend them into OOC until they fuck" type fic?

**** Which pairing in Fate? If it is the main one, yes, it does.

Normally threesomes are written bc the author could without considering whether they should, thus they tend to be an utter disaster. Not in this case.

It actually helps push the plot along, it gives a valid reason for Kingsley to be there and explains some changes in Snape. Snape is simply not the person he was at the Battle of Hogwarts, he had time, reason and opportunity to change. In this regard you could call him a bit OOC bc he is not the hateful bastard, but it works.

Regarding the pairings for the original characters of Andy Boniface and Nanette Odont, those work beautifully too.

It is really good writing and if you don't care for the smut, just skip those parts.

*** I'd say yes, but mostly because I imagine most authors here aren't introspective enough about themselves to make a wholly accurate character of themselves, so it's basically an OC inspired by themselves anyway.
