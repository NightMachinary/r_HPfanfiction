So, for the 3 or 4 years I've been reading fanfiction I've always kept myself away from romance stories or anything with romance in them. Now, I'm trying to find some stories with romance, though preferably not with romance as the main plot. I've just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12104185/1/The-Life-He-Leads][The Life He Leads]] which was amazing (And made me cry a lot) so anything in the same vein would be awesome. Harry/Tonks is always appreciated.


** Hey!

I'm really glad you enjoyed my fic.

So, I'd heavily recommend linkffn(Grow Young With Me). I think it's probably the best romance fic out there, and the characters feel fleshed out and real, though it's Harry/OC so make of that what you will.

There's also linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) which is fem!Harry/Tonks, though it's tonally quite different to my fic, it's got a lot of cool magic that I really enjoyed.

And finally, there's linkffn(Hogsmeade In The Rain) which is a one-shot, though it's incredibly sweet and it's one of my favourite stories. It's Harry/Parvati.

I hope you enjoy them, and that you continue to enjoy my fic. The next update is coming in the next few days.

I don't think my heart can take it! I may need to take a break.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** It's kind of a wasteland unfortunately when it comes to completed Harry/Tonks fics that aren't trashy harem ones where Fleur is added to make a threesome, but the Two I can think of are below:

linkffn(4714715) linkffn(6166553)

There are some decent abandoned ones and a couple from the Indy!harry era which are alright but didn't age all that well

  To avoid the unjust prosecution of his friends in the days following the end of the war, Harry Potter signed a magical contract in blood. Years later, Harry struggles with the balance of his latest Auror case involving a wizard ritualistically murdering Muggles, periodic contract renewals, and both the developing and deteriorating relationships with those closest to him.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

** While I can't say that it is similar to The Life He Leads, my story "Dawn of Darkness" has a Harry/Tonks romance which is aimed to be more realistic than your average romance movie. In the published chapters it is the main focus, although the next few will definitely be more plot-driven and less fluffy.

** if youre willing to look past romance as main plot, chelseyb is basically the bar for H/T romances. although be aware her stuff is no longer on ffn, and HP and the Half Blood Auror, while great, has an awful cliffhanger before it was abandoned
