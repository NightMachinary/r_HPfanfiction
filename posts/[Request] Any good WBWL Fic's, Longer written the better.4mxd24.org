  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

***** It's really the bit in chapter 2 where it says

#+begin_quote
  [[/spoiler][And while the three adults marveled over the child who would soon by [sic] known as "The Boy-Who-Lived," they ignored the other child sleeping peacefully in the stroller wearoing identical pajamas save for the name "Harry" instead of "Jim." And on his brow, a rune of power pulsed with magical energies invisible to those who lacked the wit to see it.]]
#+end_quote

that implies to me that this is definitely a WBWL fic. Some ambiguity is created in [[/spoiler][chapter 30, when Quirrell's body is grabbing both Jim and Harry, Harry hears a sizzling sound and smells burning flesh, but it is not said if it is the Jim-grabbing hand or the Harry-grabbing hand doing it]] which just reinforces my conclusion.

And I'd also like to second the claim that this is a great fic. Though it pisses me off. Because this is the perfect example of what HPMoR could have been, yet wasn't.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
