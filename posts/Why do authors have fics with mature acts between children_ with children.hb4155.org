I've seen it quite a bit. I'm just scrolling through ao3 and suddenly there is a fic about Harry going to school but wondering how he'll engage in some lewd act. Harry's 11 in these fics! This is straight up kid porn.

I also see fics with like 12 year old Hogwarts kids in mature relationships. When I was twelve I was worry about my next girl scout meeting not of I was going to get into someone's pants. What gets me is there are comments saying that it's a great fic or whatever. If you point it out they go "Don't like, don't read ". What? You're writing explicit material involving kids, you're engaged in pedo behavior and are being enabled!

I don't know, it just makes my skin crawl. I actively avoid writing anything explicit because of it.


** Those sort of fics are probably written by minors most of the time, tbh. Or I hope so anyway. You ultimately just have to either accept it or report it if it happens to be against the site's terms of service. Either way nope on out of there.

** My best guess is it's wish fullfillment of some kind by minors who want to dabble or dive into /mature smut/ because that's so /mature/ but they also don't want to write about older characters because they want to be able to insert themselves into that scenario (in the same way that YA novels never use anyone above 17 because anything older turns off teenage readers).

This is hopefully whats going on because if an a full grown adult is writing this stuff then that's sketchy.

** I thought a lot about the ages of my characters, and tried to remember my own feelings towards the opposite sex when i was a pre-teen/teenager. And I think that although you may have been attending girl scout meetings, that is not necessarily the universal experience.

The first "crush" on a girl i had was before I was 10. When I was 12, I had kissed and had 'girlfriends'. By 13, I was making out. I lost my virginity a few weeks after my 15th birthday.

So 12 year olds declaring love seems silly, as does any sort of comfort with intimacy towards the opposite sex, but puberty is pretty crazy. I didn't know how or where to get sex when I was 12, but I was a ball of hormones who thought about it all the time.

My point is that I don't find it unrealistic for 2nd/3rd years in HP fics to be interested in or curious about physical intimacy. It's squicky to us, the readers, because we're adults.

None of that is to say I ever have or ever will write smutty fiction where kids are going at it. I just wanted to illustrate that some people were very aware of/interested in the opposite sex at a younger age than is typically depicted, and that the canon Hogwarts we're shown is absurdly chaste.

** Not condoning it at all and I think it just weird when you realise that a human is writing it for some reason or another, but in some cases, it can be fairly accurate to a relationship.

I'm not talking about the explicit parts but I used to know lots of people in high school (I'm British btw) that were already in a serious relationship by the time they were 12-13. In fics where the writer is clearly British or in some cases just a good researcher, they would know that a relationship in very early teens or even at 11 is fairly common, especially now-a-days in the UK.

For explicit smut/lemons/etc, I again do not condone them, but the age of consent is lower than in many other countries (mainly referring to America). It doesn't make it right, but the view on sex outside of marriage isn't as most people would assume it to be if they aren't a Brit. We don't all talk with cockney accents and say “Ello' governor” to people. The same standard applies to attitudes. The 60's and onward through to the 90's were a major turning point for attitudes to drugs/sex/marriage etc, so it makes sense to have children be more open to it, given the time setting of the Harry Potter books.

Not saying it's right or defending it, but in some cases and stories my reasoning could apply. For others, shame on you. Paedophilic scenes are wrong and convey the wrong message to people. Even worse are the young girl/older man trope. Some people were not meant to be together *cough Snape and Hermione *cough.

*** That's really interesting I guess I didn't realize the views on young relationships were so vastly different. I agree there is no reason for a Snape and Hermione relationship for varying reasons. But I have read a few fics that start off innocent and then turn pedophilic and it makes me so uncomfortable.

**** Seen a few of those myself and they just give me the most disgusting feeling. I don't bother reading anything that remotely resembles an older/younger relationship, especially in the Potterverse with the shortage of lots of ‘old people' meaning there's either the Hogwarts staff, racist death eaters or Voldemort, the last of which is vomit-worthy.

** I totally totally agree.

Reading through the comments though, can I just say that for some reason I used to think everyone using AO3 was an adult and FFnet for younger people and only quite recently realised there are some very young writers (12 years old!) and users on AO3.

Like you said, I too can't read those types of fics and now I realised it might be written by minors, ....that's just nope nope nope. At the same time, I wonder if young writers put pressure on themselves to write explicit contents just to seem mature, I hope they realised they don't have to, explicit scenes it isn't the be all and end all for writing fics. But I digress.

But I agree, these types of fics are a hard no from me, especially if it is written by adults, it just seems like there's some aspect of "grooming" going on, especially if it is in a fandom that has so many kids active in it like HP.
