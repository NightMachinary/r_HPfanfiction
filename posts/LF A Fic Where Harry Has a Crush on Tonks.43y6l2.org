Other than when he fell for Ginny Harry only really crushed on Cho. I think that most male teenagers crush on an girl a couple years older than them in their lives so I'm looking for a fic where he really likes Tonks, being a cooler, older, attractive auror, after meeting her. Even better if her Remus start to have a relationship or something and Harry thinks he is not treating her well enough (sort of like their confrontation in DH). I always had this idea too that I might put on my own story but one day where Harry, Tonks, Remus go over to the Tonks's for dinner and we find out eventually that Andromeda thinks like harry does about Remus/Tonks and realises that Harry has feelings for her daughter during the dinner. If anyone knows any stories similar to that let me know.

I got this idea the other day when I read a post-war Harry/Daphne story. Harry is an alcoholic and surprisingly Draci finds him and decides to help him sober up. Harry always makes time for Teddy though so Andromeda gets dragged into the mix. We find lit later in the story when Andromeda was talking to someone that Harry told her after Remus/Tonks died that he always had feelings for Tonks. Ever since he met her but never told her and that's why he reacted so violently to Remus in DH. Andrkmeda even said though she liked Remus she would have rathered Harry as a son-in-law. Idk, the way it was written was really good and made me want to read a story about that.


** Your best bet would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1824855/chelseyb][chelseyb]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6740130/1/The-Rebel-and-The-Chosen][The Rebel and the Chosen]] sounds fairly close, but all her stuff is good. She's the Gold Standard of Harry/Tonks

*** Jesus Christ I thought you might be exaggerating calling ChelseyB the HPNT Gold Standard. Up until now I've never shipped anybody canon more than HPLL (thank you Contemplating Clouds) but holy crap.

** The fic you are remembering with Daphne and Draco is "A Fine Spot of Trouble"

It's a great story, highly recommend it!

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

*** Yes that's it! I loved the story but after reading it I wanted to read a story that focused on when Harry developed those feelings for Tonks while feeling conflicting emotions about Remus (eg. Last connection to his parents, sort of uncle, jealousy for having Tonks's affections, anger how he was stringing Tonks along when she liked him / deciding to leave her out of fear during Deathly Hallows). Idk I think it would make a good story. Especially if some kind of conflict happens with Remus/Tonks (eg. He leaves) and then Andromeda points out to her that there is someone else she knows who is already in love with her.

**** Would work best post-DH I think. Could expand on the relationship during Ootp+ but the rest would need to be after if you want a plausible relationship.

***** I could see that working. Post Deathly Hallows. Maybe Remus died but tonks didn't. Then he could be there to help her with Teddy a lot and eventually form their own relationship. The story could also feature flashbacks to show when Harry first developed feelings for tonks and as well as his thoughts on Remus back then and that dinner scene idea I had.

*** Its an okay story. The premise is great but the execution isn't what it could be. Purposeless bashing, Malfoy's whitewashing, contrived dialog, poor characterization, Lucious not in prison?, also the story was really unbelievable in a few ways that could be fixed rather easily.

** I know a couple of fics that are Harry/Tonks but they don't have the conflict /plot that you are asking about. The first one is Harry takes control of his life and trains as an unspeakable with Tonks. The other is long trilogy where Tonk and Harry have a brief fling in... but it's not a relationship centric story. I'll find and link if Op or anyone wants.
