Okay, I have been googling and searching this subreddit for this fic.

Harry is sent back in time, I believe by Salazar himself. He meets past Salazar, becomes friends with him and is eventually blood-bound as a brother. He is essentially a fifth founder, he teaches at Hogwarts. He ends up being purposefully trapped in a painting as an adult so he can go back(or really just wait for centuries) to his original timeline and help fight Voldemort.

He makes friend with Snape when Snape goes to Hogwarts, as his painting is stuck in the corner of the Slytherin Common Room. At some point, when Snape is a professor, Harry falls out of the paining and is, well, real again. He becomes, I think, the DADA professor, etc.

Salazar has been in the future as well the whole time, working underground to fight Voldemort, blah blah.

Anyway....I can't find it! I can't remember what Harry's name is as Salazar's brother either which I'm sure isn't helping my search.


** I'm pretty confident you're thinking of "Of a Linear Circle"
