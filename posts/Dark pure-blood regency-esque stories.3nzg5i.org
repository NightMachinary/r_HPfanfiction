I wonder if there are stories that focus on a pureblood girl/woman's life. In particular from one of the darker families. The idea came from thinking about Narcissa's life and thinking of how it could very well be a good tragedy.

Imagine her being brought up as the younger girl in a family that considers itself royalty. One of her older sisters is cast out for defying her family's views and the other wholeheartedly supports them. With no real support on what to do she goes with the safe route, and goes through with a marriage to her betrothed (fanon, I know).

Her husband is a harsh man but eventually some happiness comes into her life in the form of a son. He starts out as her boy but as he nears his teens becomes more and more like his father. When her husband is arrested and she and her son punished in his stead all seems lost, until she sees an option to protect her family during a battle when the dark lord she's been fated to follow so far tasks her to ensure his enemy is dead at a crucial point.

I think mostly I'm looking for regency-esque stories with bethrothals and lots of tradition, lots of high teas with lots of dialogue. The main character not really being in control of her life from her perspective most of the time. It doesn't have to be Narcissa (or even an actual canon character), but that's the main character I can see it work well with that we actually know some things about.

I'd prefer it if the main character wasn't evil, just more focused on trying to live a life amidst the social expectations than what is good.

So if you know of any stories that might fit this... please tell :)


** linkffn(In Bad Faith by Slayer Anderson) has some of what you're looking for, the OC in question being an SI born as Draco's younger sister. No betrothals though.

There are a couple of fics about Andromeda too. Try this one.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/anotherdreamer/D21_01a.html][December 21st 1997]]: /There were five of you, the heirs to all that was Black. You were to become the next generation of power-wizards. Born into privilege and taught to wield power, people noticed when you entered a room. Your clothes were impeccable, your language flawless. Your friends were handpicked. Your house at Hogwarts and life afterward predestined. What went wrong? How did you all fall apart?/

Just a oneshot though. There was a longer fic about andromeda, but I can't remember the name at the moment.

  I never pretended to know what I was doing in my last life. Why should I pretend to know anything about this one? Well, the other option is a horrific and bloody death, so...I better start learning how to be a witch. OC Self-Insert/Draco's Younger Sister. [DEAD]

** These are just general regency recs, not Narcissa specific, sorry!\\
[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6776][A Most Advantageous Match]] (HG/HP) and linkffn(Of Muggles and Magic) (HG/SS).

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/29rlux/looking_for_good_victorianstyle_pureblood_fics/][Another request thread here]].

There are also some regency-esque ficlets(in the heaving bosoms, bursting corsets fashion) written by Ell Roche [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7231737/1][archived at fictionhunt]].

Jeconais wrote a sort of sequel, [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Pureblood_Princess/Pureblood_Princess/][Pureblood Princess]] to one of those [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1318&chapter=1][ficlets]].

  A witch struggles to conform in a society that restricts her. A wizard thinks he has nothing to offer anyone but his duty and, ultimately, his life. An SS/HG Regency Tale. As AU as you get. M for later chapters.

*** I know 'Of Muggles and Magic', I liked that story but I'm looking for a more higher class main character at the moment. I'll check the other ones but I'd prefer stories that are not too AU, just trying to show a different side of the world we already know.

Thank you for the links :)

**** Sorry, most of what I have listed seems to be extremely AU-pureblood customs and the like, and the closest to canon pureblood fic I can think of is extremely far from your criteria, being a post war fic about Andromeda but even that is really about political chicanery and watching the world burn. :(

** It's a crossover and not /exactly/ what you're looking for, but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727911/1/Black-Sky]]) fits many of the themes you're talking about.

Warning: Contains femHarry.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

*** Thank you, I'll check it out.

I do have to admit I dislike anime, so I have no knowledge of the other universe, is that problematic for reading this fic?

**** No real knowledge of the anime is required, though a quick google search of The Varia might help you understand the anime characters as they are introduced (not necessary until Chapter 42 and later, from what I recall).

Plus, the cross doesn't even technically happen until Chapter 42 (though the flame/soul colors are an aspect of the crossover, but are adequately explained within the story to not need external knowledge), so that's nearly half of a 363,195 word story to get into it and see if you'll end up liking it enough to tolerate the anime aspect.

***** I know it's been a month, but I thought I'd respond now I've finally taken the time to read it.

I absolutely *loved* the first 41 chapters. unfortunately now, only a few chapters later, I've lost pretty much all interest. Between the guns, 'red eyes', agreeing to at least 'ten pregnancies' and a few other things, I have not decided to read any further (I read up to chapter 46).

Thank you for the recommendation though, as the first 41 chapters were /very/ enjoyable.

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.

** Another idea: a Ravenclaw student that's a member of the DA leaves Hogwarts after her fifth year as she's married to her betrothed, who is a Slytherin, I would love to see a scene where she talks to Hermione about prejudice and how from her point of view, most of the prejudice against muggle-borns and blood traitors is based in envy of the freedom they hold.
