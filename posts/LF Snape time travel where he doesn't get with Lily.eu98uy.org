I always find it super predatory when snape goes back in time and is immediately in love with perfect Lily. I'd love it if he goes back and realized she is just a kid the same age as his students and is just a friend at most. No bashing please


** The idea of a mental time traveler romance always seemed creepy to me, given the mental age gaps involved. Whether it's 17 year old Harry getting thrown back and hooking up with 12 year old Ginny or Hermione, or 30something Snape getting with 17 year old Lily it just feels predatory.

*** I think it depends a bit on the form of time travel it takes - you're definitely right if it transports Harry's personality and memories back all the way unchanged, and keep him the same. There are some others I've seen, where the memories kind of meld in with his child self and he ends up more as a changed character - but still with the similar mental age. In the former, you're definitely right - and it's /weird/ to think of it (plus, some fics can turn it into what 100% comes across as grooming/predatory - like Dodging Prison and Stealing Wenches >< ). In the latter, I think it's /tentatively/ ok, depending on how the fic handles it.

One angle I saw in another fandom that I'd be interested in seeing with Harry is one where the memories came up as nightmares/visions - eg, where he'd see someone he had strong memories of (say, Snape) and would immediately get hammered with a vision of a strong memory with that character from his previous life (for Snape, maybe seeing him dying) - or showing flashes of the immediate future (eg, perhaps getting flashes of how each person would get sorted). It was an interesting take.

A general aspect that I don't see examined enough is the disconnect that a Harry who retained all his memories would/should have with his previous friends. Usually there's a bit of that, but he easily befriends them again and it's all fine. But an 17+ year old with /those/ memories, is it really possible for him to be that fine or happy or content with how 12 years olds act? It seems a lot tougher.

**** I struggled with this question in my own time travel fic and thus had the 14 year old mc who is in love with his 13 year old wife also struggle with it. He had an easy time befriending those kids around him and one of his best friends who knows about the time travel then tells him that if he can befriend children and talk to them for hours without being bored, if he plays pranks on others, if he eats like a trash can and has temper tantrums, then he is a teenager, no matter what his mind knows of the future.

***** I don't really like this answer. Following that logic an immature person would fit as well in the same way.

*** I think it depends on how you define age and what precisely you find wrong about being with someone who is significantly younger/underage. If age is just defined by how old your mind is then it's a problem. But if you take the body and hormones and everything into account, those time traveling back into their younger bodies might not be as old as they think they are. I think what makes everything even more complicated is that in literature, 12 year olds don't act like 12 year olds. They are usually just as mature as the author.

*** It's good that they don't end up together, but I still rather dislike how perfect Lily is in this fic. Her emotional and moral compass is the fic's emotional and moral compass, and Severus seemingly must validate and agree with her decisions at every turn.

  'I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--?' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all?'

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

Largely, a Snape focused story since he travels back further in time than Harry and Hermione. He earns his redemption too.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Pre Cursed Child & Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

*** Doesn't that fic have a LESS endgame? Did a quick look through it recently, and it seemed to at least hint towards something (I didn't read closely -- I typically avoid fanfics inspired by other fanfics). The Apprentice was a Snily fic.

** ‘No Strings' by PaintedRoman in archive of our own is good read.

([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21473827/chapters/51176326]])

Severus Snape waited for death to claim him as Nagini's venom solidified the remaining blood in his veins. Except he woke in a bed...in the Slytherin dorm...at the age of sixteen... Inspired by: The Apprentice by Deborah Peters.

NO Sev x Lily NO James x Lily

Lily is slightly confronted when she broaches the topic of all slytherins being evil or not but it's later on. Her flaws aren't capitalised on but she's not placed on a pedestal and depicted as perfect or as a saint.
