I hope someone can help here. I vaguely remember a story where Harry and Hermione got together at Grimauld Place and kept meeting in Buckbeak's attic to keep it a secret from everyone else.

For some reason that scene and one of them saying they can't keep doing this keeps going through my brain. Please help!


** Linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) had a secret romance but not the scene you described

#+begin_quote
  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

** Was that the one where they were boxing or something? I can remember something like that... Edit: Just went and searched through all possible entries at ffn with the word 'Grimmauld', but I couldn't find the one I'm thinking of.
