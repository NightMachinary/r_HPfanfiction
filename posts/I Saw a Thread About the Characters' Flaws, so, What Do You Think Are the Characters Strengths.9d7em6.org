Harry -- very brave, courageous, loyal, trusting,\\
Hermione ---very intelligent, passionate, ambitious, idealistic

Ron --also brave, great with strategy and tactics (chess),


** I'm choosing to ignore the [[/r/askreddit]] level of back and forth threadding, plus your weird capitalisation.

Ginny is loyal (see her turning down Harry because she'd already said yes to shy, clumsy Neville), which is admirable, but she really shines through her mental strength. In short: she developed throughout the series from the typical damsel in distress at the end of CoS, into a strong, confident young woman.

So, mental strengh: she bounced back from the happenings of CoS, which should really cause serious PTSD, mistrust in humanity and a whole host of other anxieties. Although I don't doubt that she spent a lot of time recovering, and perhaps hasn't recovered completely from it (see her "lucky you" comment in the argument with Harry in OotP), she still didn't let it rule her.

Another point where she shines: when Harry broke up with her, she still came up to him at his birthday and kissed him like she never did before, just in case he runs into any Veela. That's confidence, right there.

And lastly, even though she and Harry broke up, she refused to just sit on the sidelines, and became one of the underground resistance leaders at a Hogwarts ruled by Death Eaters. That shows a lot of strength, and that's what makes me like her so much as a character.

*** You make a lot of good points about Ginny, one of which I hadn't really thought about--that being her mental strength. Although, wizards in general seem to be more sturdy, and we don't see many examples of possession from a horcrux to compare the way she recovered.

Ginny is awesome, though!

*** To be honest I don't think Rowling even thought all that much about the effect of CoS on Ginny. It seems like trauma is just ignored for everyone in canon.

The only example that comes to my mind is Prof. Quirrell faking it.

** Harry - Ridiculously brave. Like to the point that you want to call it reckless if it weren't so often necessary to survive or save his friends. A pretty natural leader, though this is somewhat muted by the brooding brought on by being the constant target of Magical Hitler-Einstein. Can be extraordinary and focused when the task ahead requires it, but JKR annoyingly started to downplay this after GoF.

​

Hermione - Has a moral throughline which is very strong, willing to fight against social assumptions even if it makes others think she's crazy. Also incomparably loyal to Harry, to the degree that it puts nearly any other example of loyalty (even outside the series) to shame. Gave up love so she could continue helping him (with the very real possibility that Ron might be killed without her), went through literal torture and back to keep Bella from finding out they were after Riddle's Horcruxes, went to the Ministry with the belief that Voldemort was there, etc. Loyalty aside, well, her other strengths are pretty well known.

​

Ron - OK, I struggle with this a bit because Ron is definitely brave (see PoA) and has a good sense of humor, they aren't explored very much and also have repeated instances where they become flaws (making fun of Hermione mean spiritedly, for instance). It's probably why I'm not a fan of his, he just wasn't developed as much after the first couple books.

*** Yeah, I get what you mean about some of your points, specifically Harry and Ron. Harry's abilities seem to depend on the book and plot in question.

I remembered being super excited about Ron earlier in the series (like YR 1 and YR 2). He was this wicked chess player, and he was also the magic culture expert (compared to Harry and Hermione), having grown up in it. I definitely think he got his good traits eclipsed a bit compared to his two friends in later books, although there's no denying that he's brave and funny.

Also--good summary of Hermione's strengths!

**** No problem! The main issue with Ron is because Hermione is a veritable encyclopedia of knowledge of all kinds, she quickly absorbed most of what Ron could uniquely contribute as a character. JKR's failure to push him into his own niche led to him stagnating and so we get things like him running out on the hunt as a sort of darker version of his ditching Harry in GoF. Had Arthur died like JKR considered doing, it would have given him another role: an MC who also understands what it's like to lose a parent. Perfect means for him to bond with Harry on the deep level Hermione is shown to.

Instead we got HBP with its horrid "romance" subplot.

** are we just doing the trio? It's so much more fun do the bad guys...

​

Tom Marvolo Riddle Jr: At the end of his reign, he may have ruled by blatant fear. And we may not agree with his war tactics during the second war that we see during the seven books. HOWEVER, our opinions of his person does not change the fact that Riddle started off as in impoverished half-blood orphan. Despite this, he managed to convince a bunch of prejudiced, arrogant, aristocratic purebloods to follow him and basically do his bidding. Dumbledore loves to point out how Riddle lacks people skills. However, Riddle must have had outstanding people skills at one point in order to achieve this type of following. So, strengths? Ambitious and has what it takes to achieve them. Intelligent. Likely charismatic. and charming (Hepzibah Smith lays further evidence for this). Leader.

** Harry is, I think, the most introspective of all three. However, it's still not enough to eclipse his terrible case of Protagonist Morality.

Hermione is capable of a considerable amount of empathy when she's not too obsessed about being Right.

I think Ron is pretty good at looking after his own (and by extension his friends') mental health, insecurity aside. If the books are set in the muggle world I'm pretty sure either Harry or Hermione would have to see the psychologist at least once in canon -- their level of obsession is insane!
