** Just posted a one-shot (with potential to continue) about Dudley meeting a witch and falling in love with her. Cue awkward family dinner with the Dursleys full of revelations.

I seriously had so much fun writing this and wanted to share!

Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30903362]]

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  Dudley meets a woman.

  /Iris./

  She's beautiful, smart, witty, and neat. And, despite all odds, she seems to like him. /Really/ like him.

  But there's this strange niggling at the back of his head that appears whenever she misses his frequent pop culture references (really, who /hasn't/ at least heard of Indiana Jones?) or when she mispronounces simple words (although he thinks her saying 'left-testicle' instead of 'electrical' was meant to be a joke).

  He likes her quirkiness, though. It's endearing. And /god/ does he love her.

  So naturally, he decides to introduce her to his parents.

  What could go wrong?

** I've been working on a long canon compliant prequel that focuses on the wizarding world outside of Hogwarts, and on Charlie's class. It provides a lot more build up to the second war and gets more into why it happened. At 250k, it is really starting to feel like I've got something with a lot of substance, and I fully expect to hit another 100k before it's over. Whoever commented that my story had “the sort of world building to envy” made my week and possibly my year, so thanks lol.

Let's see if the bot will work for me today . . .

#+begin_quote
  Charlie Weasley's classmate Aaron disappeared in 1991; vanishing while the magical world was locked in turmoil. Aaron is presumed dead - or worse - until 1994, when he arrives at The Burrow through a blood-soaked tear in space. His sudden return - and a series of terrorist attacks that have the signatures of the Death Eaters all over them - has gotten Alastor Moody's attention, and he has some questions for his former protégé.But, what happened to Aaron isn't straightforward. Ten years earlier, a certain dragon-obsessed redhead, a hand magic prodigy, a jokester metamorphmagus, and a kid who can't even use magic - or so he thinks - arrive at Hogwarts as a controversial act threatens muggle-born autonomy. Within months of its conception, muggle-borns across the UK are being found dead. The class of 1984 soon find themselves involved in a series of interconnected events that lead to the killers, Aaron's disappearance, and the Second Wizarding War.

** Lately I've been working on two fics:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13862912/1/A-Malignant-Ruse]])

A Haphne fic, based off a prompt from this subreddit. In order to cure the terminal illness her sister suffers from, Daphne must get Harry Potter to fall in love with her. This Daphne, though, is not so much an 'ice queen' as she is a 'mean girl'; her and Pansy are BFFs at the start of the story, and she has to come to terms with the fact that her own prior bad acts are the biggest hurdle she faces. 5th year, largely canon compliant.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13854544/1/Pity-Those-Without-Love]])

This one is harder to explain without spoiling the story. It is heavily AU, a dystopian world, soul bonds like you've never seen before.

The Prophecy never existed and Dumbledore didn't waste 20 years waiting to figure out Tom Riddle's backstory. Voldemort is defeated with the help of an ambitious Unspeakable, who is then promptly swept into office after the war. The new Minister, Ava Greengrass, sets in motion firm policies to ensure that another Tom Riddle - a monster incapable of love - will never be born again, announcing that not only do soul-bonds exist, but that the DoM has magics that can identify a wizard or witch's mate. Society is rebuilt around 'meant to be'. Harry/Astoria fic. Romance, suspense, thriller.

** I just posted the 5th chapter of the sixth year sequel to my alternate version of Harry's fifth year! I'm honestly having so much fun working on this story. I'm basically just indulging myself by writing all the things I wanted to see in a fic. It features a ton of godfather Sirius, Spell-Crafting, supportive friends, and acknowledgment that Harry has been through a lot of trauma. It's also a Harry/George fic (though it's a VERY slow burn) because they are my OTP.

** So I'm the latest fool to try my hand at a /HP and Fate// crossover that I titled /Medusa's Kid/.

Following the /"Harry gets adopted by Fate/ characters and derails the canon events"/ trope, Harry winds up in the care of Medusa and Waver Velvet, and becomes a part-Gorgon girl named Iris due to blood adoption shenanigans. Waver handles magical education while Medusa bonds with her daughter over learning to throw knives, enrolling Iris to Hogwarts under alias to keep her away from the Clock Tower magi that might want to dissect her.

I'm fully intending to have Magi and the Clock Tower coexist in the same world as close to their canon rendition as possible, meaning secrecy from the Wizarding World too and all the mechanics of Mystery based magecraft Lord El-Melloi II Case Files style, plus characters like Reines El-Melloi Archisorte and Melvin Weins.

Will feature /actual/ magecraft, mild Dumbledore bashing, 4Head Horcrux turned into younger sibling, Hermione and Daphne being too smart for their own good, and eventual F/F pairings. Still working it out.

** I've finally been making quite a bit of headway on the latest chapter of my fic linkffn(A Champion of The Light)

I haven't updated since november (sorry to any of my readers, if you see this!), because of real life, my other hobbies and a general lack of inspiration.

What mostly gave me trouble was one Mineeva McGonagall. I wanted to give that woman a more active role in the story and flesh out my characterisation of her, and it wasn't easy. I also make certain revelations about her I'm not sure how people will take, but we'll see.

I'm diving quite deeply into Norse mythology, but I've also been watching the Marvel films, and I hate how they butcher my language in those films, so to get my revenge, every single Old Norse/Icelandic name is written in Icelandic. Good luck with that, everyone.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** Yesterday I posted the second fic I've written about Harry Potter and I liked the result. This is the first time that I write responding to a usual "what if" and I think that I interpreted it in a different way than usual, since I changed one thing that, if I develop it, could turn this one shot into a long fanfic, which I don't want to write now.

This is the first time that I promote a fanfic (by the way, it's in Spanish). So if you want to read this I hope you like it.

** I finished writing a one-shot and posted it this week. It's a part of my AU where Sirius and Severus become friends in their sixth year at Hogwarts after a duel goes wrong in Hogsmeade. In this one-shot, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30562946][Cats and Dogs]], Severus becomes an Animagus. The summary is:

"As a safeguard, Sirius convinces Severus to become an Animagus. Sirius can't say he's surprised by his friend's form in the end."

I also posted the second chapter of my latest multi-chapter in my Severus has a sister AU series, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30270945/chapters/75749045#workskin][Old Gemini]]. The summary for this story is:

"After Edie's 49th birthday, Eileen decided she would give her mother a painting of Lottie to celebrate her 50th. Over the next year, Eileen found creating the portrait was only one of several challenges she would have to handle in her life."

** - Working title: New Blood, New Magic
- Expected rating: Canon-esque levels of cursing, snogging, and violence
- Relation to canon: Original Characters, canon compliant setting, but not epilogue compliant.

Working summary: It has been four months since the Battle of Hogwarts, and everything is looking up for a young 12-year-old Muggleborn just starting his first year of wizarding school. But rumor has it the strange runes appearing around the school might point to a treasure left by the Founders. But rumor also has it that the school was cursed by You-Know-Who in his final moments, and that the Astronomy Tower is still closed after the Battle of Hogwarts because the repairs won't stick. And if that's true, then the school's days are numbered. Either way, it's just another year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Update: I've polished up a bit of the Prologue and Chapter 1 to smooth over some clunky bits, and I've got chapter 2 written with a whole Sorting Song and everything! Linkalink [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Rb3qJ_h61HDwUofGWLFapq4oDU5_8dhsxY786zGiMY/edit?usp=sharing][here]].

Summary:

Aisha Sow was born into chaos. With part-time Auror, part-time genius parents, the world expected great things from her. She dedicated her childhood to training and studying, hoping one day to end up in the hall of fame and make her parents proud. But when her name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, her metaphorical battles become a lot more real. As she navigates ancient magic that should put her on top and complicated relationships with a certain redhead, she'll soon find that the type of power that she's after is often forged in fire.

Aisha Sow is an American witch attending Hogwarts. She was fully prepared to spend her Hogwarts years on studying and relationship drama. She was always close with Hermione, Harry, and Ron but her course changes when ancient magic thrusts her into the ring with Harry Potter. She is quickly swept into his world, not the Wizarding World, but rather Harry's world - the world of unlikely heroes. Harry Potter may be the 'Chosen One,' but he is far from in this fight alone.

It has the same title on AO3

  Wherein Harry Potter and Theodore Nott are Auror partners three years after the Battle of Hogwarts, and during an investigation of a criminal coven of witches and wizards, are sent back in time to their eleven-year-old bodies by an old Egyptian ritual. They decide to try and save as many people as possible while researching the ritual that sent them back in time and they change things up along the way; starting with Harry being Sorted in Slytherin.

  AU. The Wizarding World might have forgotten their mudblood Girl Who Lived and left her in an orphanage for 10 years without any knowledge of magic, but Hermione is determined to succeed, to show them what she is capable of. Of course, being sorted into Slytherin doesn't help matters much.\\

** My most recently finished work is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30854654][Where the Wild Weeds Grow Unknown]], a one-shot (1,887 words) about Kahina Sulieman (original character) going through mourning after giving her son (another original character) up. It's set during the first war with Voldemort.

As for WIPs, I'm currently debating on which story I should devote attention to. I want to finish /all/ of them at some point but I know if I keep dividing my attention like this, nothing will get done.

I could get started on a true series set sometime after Where the Wild Weeds Grow Unknown or I could finish one of my numerous unfinished WIPs such as [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15870690/chapters/36974610][Ashes]].

*** IMO, the best way to write the accents is not to write them. Maybe the occasional use of a common French or Bulgarian word in a sentence, as is normal with bilingual people, but personally nothing more.

(Okay.. maybe just " 'Arry " from Fleur, but just because I'm partial to it in a Flowerpot pairing.)

**** Agreed! It is always a struggle to read accents when authors get too into it. I would just change around tenses to match each persons origin language. The French, they talk like this, no?

You know highlight the fact that they are clearly translating whole sentences over in their heads and through in some for exclamations or words to drive it home. Tres bein!

***** Oh yes! 100% about the sentence structure. I'm not a writer personally, but I've read many fics where Fleur's english sentence structure slowly becomes better through the fic as she speaks english on a more regular basis after she spends more time with Harry and gang. U don't know if its intentional or if the writers just didn't want to continue writing in the different sentence structures, but I've found it a brilliant way to subtly add just a touch of character growth and show the development of a character as a product of their current environments.
