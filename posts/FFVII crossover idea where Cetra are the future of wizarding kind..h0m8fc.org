Title. There are lots of fics where Midgar and the entire ffvii idea is in the past, but what about a fic where it's the future of wizarding. Maybe wizards become the cetra race? Free idea for anyone who wants it from someone who can't really write but has a ton of ideas.


** And utterly wiped out by the time of FFVII o.O

**** Powerful? Arguably. Versatile? Not so much. You can conjure Ifrit to incinerate your enemies, but you can't conjure a chair to sit in, or transfigure one.

***** It could perhaps be a lost art or something, or perhaps by the time Materia came about, wizardry magic was considered archaic? There's so many ways a fix writer could take it to be honest, and it's fasinatic to imagine how it would play out

Side note - could mako and or mako injections awaken forgotten knowledge because of fanfic bullshittery and or plot reasons?
