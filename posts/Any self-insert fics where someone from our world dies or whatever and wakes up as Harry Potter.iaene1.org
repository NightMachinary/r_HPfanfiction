  I am a 18 year old fanfiction writer, schoolkid and computer nerd. I also just woke up in the body of 8 year old Harry Potter. How did I get here? No idea. What am I going to do? Priority one, survive. Priority two, drag this world into the 21st century.

Though fair warning, this fic does a 180, half way through.

*** What do you mean by a 180 half way through? Does he suddenly turn evil? Was it 'all a dream'? Is Dumbledore secretly a manipulative!dumbledore?

**** Oh, that's someone inserted into the HP-verse, but not as Harry Potter. Don't know what I was thinking, linking that...

But, No, he changes to many things to quickly and the timeline implodes, and the world ends. And then the devil, that's suddenly there, takes him to a new world that's in 4th year, via a TARDIS, and he gets to change more things.

It's a real blindside. It may as well be a different story from that point on. In fact, it would be much better if the first one ended and a new story started and that particular chapter didn't exist. That's my opinion, anyways.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI-ish. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.
