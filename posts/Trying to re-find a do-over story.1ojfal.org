In this story, instead of meeting Dumbledore at King's Cross (when he dies), Harry meets Lily and she is really pissed. He goes back in time to when he was born and they have events unfold in an entirely different manner. Merge diary with Quirrell and Voldemort reverts back to Tom. Dumbledore is not good. Tom decides he would like to be just Quirrell. At the end, Quirrell becomes headmaster.

  When Harry is killed by Voldemort in book 7 he wakes up at Kings Cross Station and meets Lily instead of Dumbledore, and she's really angry with him.
