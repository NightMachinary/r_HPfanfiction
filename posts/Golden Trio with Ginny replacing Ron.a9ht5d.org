Wondering if there are any good fics out there where Ron does not exist, and instead, it is (a year older) Ginny who slots into that role. So the golden Trio becomes Harry, Hermione, and Ginny. I don't care if they end up in a relationship or not, whether the fic is a smut fic or not, or if the fic diverges drastically from canon or not. I was simply curious if anyone has come across any.

For context... I have never been a huge Ron Weasley fan, and to be honest I am not a fan of Harry/Ginny, mainly because I felt Ginny was never properly developed as a character and so she just did not fit all that well with Harry in my personal opinion. But place her in Ron's position, and things get a bit more interesting. The development of Ginny would hopefully be much deeper and connection with the Weasleys somehow more impactful, and Harry/Ginny/Hermione would compliment each other much better in a lot of ways in my view, whether that's in a pure friendship aspect or a poly relationship aspect. Again, just my personal opinion.


** Not /quite/ Ginny, but there's linkffn(Weasley Girl), where the Weasleys had a second girl instead of Ron. I can't actually recall much about how it altered the story, but I recall it being readable.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** Do you care about the difference between 1) female!Ron, called Ginny (Weasley name for first girl) and Ginny not existing because they were trying for a girl vs 2) Ron not existing and Ginny being born a year early.

*** Yes. So basically the idea is that instead of having Ron, they have Ginny, and then stop having kids (as they do after having Ginny in Canon), so Ron never comes to exist.

So basically NOT a female!Ron, but simply Ginny in place of Ron. So, for the most part, Ginny's personality. That said, I was not remotely picky on staying true to her canon personality, but mainly avoiding Ron's or the idea of Ron entirely (so not similar to him).

**** Ok, I don't have any offhand for you, but you might want to check the alwaysAGirl!Ron fics, as any of them on the nurture side of nature vs nurture will fit what you want pretty well.

(A female Ron would have most of the environmental factors of Ginny, being last child, spoilt, taught to daydream about Harry, older brothers, female). Thus depending on how the author feels about nature vs nurture will decide if the character reads more like Ginny or Ron.

Although it does seem fanfic prefers the nature side of the coin. Probably to keep the characters recognizable for fans...

Yea and I think that's my main concern with a female!Ron. I don't WANT the character to be recognizable to the original character beyond simply being a Weasley and even then that aspect is not that critical part, but NOT being Ron is.

****** Sensible, I just see the story you want likely being labeled like that (ie, "what if the sixth Weasley was born a girl" is likely to be labeled fem!Ron regardless of if the personality fits or not.)

Another idea to check for is the "What if all the Weasley children we're one year older". Changing the Golden Trio dynamic without changing the Weasley dynamic

***** Perhaps its been underdone because it sounds like such a simple premise, but its more complex than folks think. I mean, its literally taking Ginny Weasley and sticking her where Ron was, but because of personality differences and the idea of Ron never existing, it leads to some interesting possibilities, pairings, and ripple effects. Especially if Ginny's character is better developed than she was in Canon. Rowling never did her justice and it hurt folks views of her, including mine, which is unfortunate.

It's actually a premise I had considered for some time writing myself. A few years ago I started writing fan fiction, and it was something I had planned to do. Sadly just after I started posting on FF.net I had some health troubles and had to stop writing. These days I read a lot from hospital beds, so I am often looking for stories that are similar to ideas I wish I could write myself. Living vicariously in a way haha!

So I would love if folks would explore this since it certainly does seem like few have done it.

** Let's take her personality from the 1st and 2nd books and place her in the same year as Harry.

​

Ginny opened the compartment door, saw THE Harry Potter, deeply blushed and then without any word spoken loudly closed the door and ran away. The end.

​

For her it took a long time to grow up enough in order to have just a talk with Harry. In order to make them friends at that time you'll have to change her personality a lot and she won't be the Ginny from the books.

*** You have simplified the situation FAR too much, to be honest. First off, you are taking a Ginny who was younger and not going to Hogwarts and transferred her personality onto one who was. Arguably there would be quite a major difference between a girl preparing to go to Hogwarts and see Harry Potter, and one who was seeing her older brother off and fully aware Harry Potter was "older" than her, even if by just a year.

In addition, you are assuming she ends up exactly the same person if there was no Ron in the picture. No Ron for the Twins to torment when he was younger, no Ron to alter the dynamic within the household. Ginny would not be the "same" because the Weasley household would not be the same. Might she still grow up worshiping Harry Potter? Sure. But the point I am making is you are taking the exact same personality from canon and transcribing it on someone who would arguably be a bit different in some ways.

Also, a big point I make is that her personality was never done justice by JK Rowling due to her "rushing" her in later as a pairing for Harry. So I never claimed it needed to be exactly Ginny, but simply that she would be replacing Ron. Her personality might be completely different and I would be Ok with that.

** "Hermione," Harry breathed through the glass, "You're brilliant. Absolutely brilliant."

The usually crimped haired, speckled faced woman who was often referred to as the cleverest witch of her time beamed back at Harry. The boy who lived, who once slept under the creaky stairs of a dusty cupboard in number 4 Privet Drive of old Whinging. He who once knew nothing of the greatness laid out before him, who had lost and suffered more than most, who in seven short years in this world would brave the most dangerous dark wizard of all time and emerge the victor, the boy, had now become a man. The man whose words bore into Hermione, and weighed on her, but she was unable to answer.

"I would have figured your animagus form would've be an owl?" He quickly inputted, "But the otter, it's brilliant. Really," he finished. Harry placed a hand on the glass and met the swimming Hermione at eye level. She planted a delicate fin and pressed it against his palm. Harry looked into her eyes and his lips broke into a smile.

"Harry," came a call from outside of the classroom. "Harry?" The fiery red locks that bounced on the athletically lean figure of a woman in full Quidditch dressing signaled the arrival of Ginny Weasley. "Harry, there you are. The match is about to start," she exclaimed while fingering the silver whistle that hung around her neck. "Oh wow, Hermione, is that you?"

The sleek ebony figure in the enclosure pulled away from the glass and somersaulted.

"Brilliant! How did you do it? Wait, never mind. You've got to show us more later, knowing you, you have every single detail written down somewhere and I want to know everything!" She pulled on Harry's arm, "Come on, we're late."

"We'll see you out at the game then Hermione?"

"Of course we're going to see her out at the game, she's the Head of Gryffindor after all. But we have got to be out on the field, oh damnit, that was almost 5 minutes ago," Ginny reeled. "Even this crowd's not going to wait for the first game!"

"We'll see you soon then Hermione?"

She nodded as Harry was dragged into the hall, their voices could still be heard talking about Kingsley Shacklebolt making an appearance, Harry being habitually late, even for his honorary opening of the new Quidditch field, flight plans on his new Nimbus, all hurriedly and excitedly until the room was once again quiet.

Hermione rose to the top of the tank, the once sleek fins melted away into her girlish fingers, a shrug of her shoulders as her face transformed back to normal, and her legs parted as she stepped out into the open. She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror, the dark color of the otter had barely left her arms - covering her skin smooth and black, beads of water running along her figure as the last traces of her transfiguration disappeared. And without the same enthusiasm she had just moment earlier, she solemnly dressed and left the classroom to join the others at the Quidditch grounds.

"Oi," came the stark call of Ronald Weasley. "Have you seen my sister?"

Hermione turned around and faced the rather lanky Weasley, recognizable by their signature red mane, "She's with Harry."

"Figures," Ron said. "Wait, how come you're not with them?"

"I'm meeting with them right now, but Harry's going to open the new field by taking a few laps..."

"...and Ginny's going to fill in for Madam Pomfrey. Right. I suppose I'll walk you then, wouldn't want a lady going off on her own."

"I can take care of myself thank you very much Mr. Weasley."

"Tis not what I meant. I was just..."

"I know very well what you were just implying."

"Still as stuck up as ever eh Hermione?"

Hermione laughed, "Still as thick as ever?"

The two laughed and hugged.

"It's good to see you again," Ron said.

"It's good to see everyone again," Hermione corrected. "After all that has happened."

"You're right," he said.

Hermione noticed the sudden seriousness that fell across his face. It was a look she rather admired, from the usual antics that's often strewn across that mug of his, the little boy that always tailed his twin brothers as the trio caused mayhem and mischief all through the years.

"How are things? I heard you opened a store in Diagon Alley?"

"Zonkos, it was Fred and George's idea, but yeah, we finally saved up enough money for Gringott's to give us a loan. We just opened a few days ago, started with some stuff we've been cooking up since my fourth year."

"Glad to hear that our Hogwarts alumni are out there helping."

"Everyone except the Slytherins."

"That's not entirely true, Malfoy..."

"That git," Ron hissed angrily. "Did you hear him at the trial? He came in all high and mighty, killing Dumbledore, raiding the castle, putting a roof over Voldemort's head. I can't believe they just let him walk."

"Well, Harry said that..."

"Harry," Ron said incredulously. "He was the absolute worst, defending that little maggot, getting that slime off on a free ride. The-boy-who-lived sure went above the law on that one, thinks he's some sort of God now. Blimey, he practically is, isn't he? Oh look who I'm telling that to, you probably worship him."

"I do not worship him," Hermione replied rather defensively.

Ron tilted his head out to the field, "She sure does," he grumbled at Harry and Ginny who were locked at the waist, waving their arms out at the crowds. "You better go join 'em," Ron said before disappearing into the banisters.

"Look there's Hermione," Ginny shouted in elation.

"What," Harry said dumbly as the sounds of the cheering crowd thundered around them.

"I said..." but at that moment the deep luminous voice of Lee Jordan overtook the crowd.

"Wizards and Witches of Hogwarts and beyond! Welcome to the grand reopening of the Hogwarts Quidditch field!"

The crowd roared in approval.

"Before we begin," Lee continued, "Harry Potter would like a moment of your time! Go get 'em Harry," he egged on.

Harry turned to Ginny, but their conversation was inaudible, the crowd leaned at the edge of their seats straining to catch even a word.

"Sorry everyone, it looks like we're having some magical difficulties," Lee professed.

Harry got onto one knee, his heart thumped in his chest, his wand hand reached into his robe, and for the first time in his life they felt weak as it gripped the small black box. "Ginny," Harry began. The entire stadium was dead silent but Harry's words were lost on their ears. "This belonged to my mother. She had left it in the vault in Gringott's with a note, saying that it was my muggle grandmother's, that she wanted me to one day give it to the person that was most important to me in the entire world. For the person that I would move earth and sky for, to the one who would make my life magical even when all the magic in the world disappeared."

"And we're back!" Lee Jordan shouted as his wand hand was outstretched, acting as a boom mic for the couple in the center of the field.

"Would you be with me, forever?"

"Yes!" Ginny cried as she threw herself around Harry, "Yes! Yes, yes!"

"She said Yass Witches!" Put a ring on it. Trust me, you guys will get that one in a few years, and now thanks to my friends at Zonkos!" Lee signaled to Ron who was waiting at the tallest stands, who barely withheld himself from rolling his eyes before shooting sparks from his wand in the air that set off a coverage of shooting stars that danced across the sky before exploding into a large congratulatory ambiguation.

"To the future Mr. and Mrs. Potter!"

Speaking for myself, I can appreciate Ginny just fine without hating on Ron. The reverse is also true. Both characters have good points and bad points.

You in particular seem to spend a lot of time hating on the Weasleys in general. That can't be a very enjoyable way to spend your time interacting with the series.
