These are surprisingly uncommon. Even Hermione, who is a main character in almost as many fics as Harry, doesn't star in too many non-romance fics.

The romance should not be an important aspect of the story. Stories where the romance is secondary (like /Not From Others/) are fine.

No bashing. Stories over 10k words preferred.

Abandoned fics are fine as long as there is something substantial in there.

Feel free to dig deep into your favorites lists and rec some relatively unknown stories, as I've probably read most of the commonly rec'd ones (Applied Cultural Anthropology, The Arithmancer, Alexandra Quick etc).

**** Three O'Clock in the Morning is on the whole a really well-written fic, but I have to mention that the ending of it is...controversial. A proposed sequel which may have resolved that never materialised. If downer endings aren't your thing, you may wish to skip the last two chapters.

** "Lovers and Liars" linkffn(11301003) There is some romance going on in this fic, but there's a whole lot of non-romance stuff going down too.

His latest fic, "The Things We Do For Love" linkffn(12070491) is a pretty good murder-mystery with very little romance going on.

"Hard Wrought Joy" linkffn(11197165) is a neat AU about Molly Weasley becoming a mother after losing the ability to have children of her own.

"Things That Go Bump in the Night" linkffn(9078784) is a fun story, another murder-mystery sort of thing, though, it does end in Hermione/Severus.

  They were happy. They were whole. They should have known it was too good to be true. It began with a murder of one, and it culminated in the rise of one of the most notorious serial killers to walk the streets of England since Jack the Ripper was at large. To think, though, that it all began with a bitter heart, a bottle of bourbon, and a very, very sharp knife. [Murder Mystery]

  The war ended, but life didn't end with it, even though it sometimes felt like it had. It isn't an easy road for the survivors as they seek to heal their world. Despite everything they persevere, trying to find closure and happiness, but it's a tightrope that they walk - one that spans the gap between being a lover, or a liar.

** I suppose I can mention a few recs of my own:

A Carnival of Dark and Dangerous Creatures: Remus Lupin is captured by a carnival owner who puts him on display as a dangerous werewolf. A story of Remus rising above werewolf prejudice. Features Moody in an important role. linkffn(4412736)

Invisible Circus: Ron spies on the pro-blood purity faction. Displays the very un-glamorous side of spying; your best friends think you've betrayed them and no one trusts you. Plays with the 'Ron the Death Eater' trope. linkffn(2056512)

Percy Weasley: Rogue Demon Hunter: Written pre-HBP. Fudge is fired post-OotP, and with him most of his staff. Percy finds himself without a job. Has pretty great characterisations of Ginny and Shacklebolt. linkffn(1458013)

Dudley Dursley and the New Normal: Another werewolf fanfic. Post DH, the Dursleys' safe house was attacked by werewolves. Vernon and Petunia died, Dudley survived as a werewolf. [[http://www.fanfics.me/read2.php?id=81213&chapter=0][link]]

Knives: Written pre-DH. Ginny captures Lucius in the final battle. Her revenge against him does not go quite the way she planned. linkao3(982121)

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
