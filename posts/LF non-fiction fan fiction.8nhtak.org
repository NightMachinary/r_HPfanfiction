Okay, so I don't know what else to call it, but like how the fantastic beasts textbook released in 2001 was a fictional book in the non-fiction style, are there any fanfics like that?

Also interested in expanded head-canons and fics that are articles or similar.

I know this is obscure and probably doesn't exist.

TIA


** So, like, stuff like SCP entries, letters written to a muggle friend, muggle news reports on strange events, or just Daily Prophet articles?

...Speaking of the latter, I think I have one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9910838/1/You-Know-Who]]

Are you, like, looking for worldbuilding stuff that's written in an in-universe style?

*** Yes to all of that. Anything that isn't a typical story, really. I just think it's really interesting.

I'll look at that one, thanks!

  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  Remus is seventeen. Of course he thinks about sex while writing essays.
