Preferably ones that don't turn into huge political Black family reunions. I'd prefer more along the style of everyone thinks Harry's being adopted by a death eater. Alternatively, fics where Sirius isn't cleared but publicly send Harry things under his own name and does other godfatherly things, and attempting a relationship that looks rather disturbing from an outside perspective with the whole everyone thinks Sirius is the Dark Lord's right hand.


** I'm not sure I'll be able to find it, because that's not the kind of information I keep on a story, but I read one in which Sirius managed to appear in front of the Wizengamot, which had to release him because he'd been imprisoned too long without a trial. They didn't provide him a trial, or any kind of exoneration, it was just "we screwed up and now have to let him go."
