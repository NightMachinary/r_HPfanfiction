Looking for a h/hr fic that takes place after the final battle, preferably directly after.


** This one is pretty good: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4605681/1/The-Real-Us][The Real Us]]

  Everyone "knows" what happened during Harry's seven years at Hogwarts... right? Er... no. Find out the truth about Harry and Hermione.

*** Grandpappy Firebird, Grantabby, the Batman...

The story was pretty good, and those nicknames are just awesome. Thanks for the story!

*** God damn it, 18 hours later, here I am finished. Thanks for that. Pretty good, little too much smut for my taste, and the beginning was a little child porny.

***** I looked at it again, and noticed that only when they are under 13 does the author include rather graphic description of things like public hair or the sexual organs. Made me think that I was going to join the author on a list.

** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/9002][Living Past the End]] is a good one.

  The War was over and they were safe-- but that wasn't the end. The Trio transitions from war to peace-time and in the process, Harry and Hermione draw closer, finding comfort and understanding-- and maybe something more...

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3675262/1/Stupid]] This is probably my favorite such story. It is sad and while not very long in word count, I think it does a great job in exploring their relationship slowly.

** Alright, this is shameless self promotion and only narrowly fits into the story type you requested. I wrote this a while ago and I think it hints enough at Harry/Hermione to qualify.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10946431/1/The-Elder-Wand-s-Call]] (edited after link) They can't all have happy endings. And can't all explore the relationship completely. I enjoyed writing this and hope some people enjoy reading it. Sorry, if it is too far off topic.
