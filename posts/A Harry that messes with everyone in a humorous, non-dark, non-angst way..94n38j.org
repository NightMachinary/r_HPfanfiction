Basically a light hearted story in a sense. For example instead of doing something to Vernon to hurt him, just make it so all meat, chocolate, chips, etc... that he eats taste like fruit, and vegetables. With Petunia have it something like the house is now a bright orange, or something that freaks her out, but doesn't actually harm her. With Dumbledore, maybe all the lemon drops are now sentient, or just send hima mountain of thick wollen socks. Snape, act like James Potter down to the T. Actual harmless pranks/jokes just to help him relieve some stress that doesn't make him some dark brooding angsty idiot.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** This doesn't fit exactly, but it's a light-hearted crack fic where Harry is pretty much pulling pranks from everyone in Grimmauld Place from the comfort of Privet Drive. It's a sixth-year fic (I think?), and there's absolutely no angst in this weird little fic.

** linkffn(Flying Without a Broom) is one of my all time favorite light hearted Harry fics. Unfortunately it is unfinished but I reread it often as it consistently can make me laugh and smile.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** My personal fave is linkffn(Saying No) but mind you, the fun only starts in chap 5 or so.

Edit: Oops, now that I reread that, there are couple of deaths there, treated rather humorously, but it works. Also, chap 7 is were the fic truly deserves the M rating, so you'll wanna read cautiously there.
