I was reading the thread about the difference between the 1990s and 990s and it got me thinking about language and transportation.

In particular, that Hogwarts is built in the Scottish Highlands yet almost every wizarding family in the books lives in the South West (England).

If we take into account that travel options were more difficult then, it seems reasonable that more wizards should have settled in Scotland. I'd argue that it's most likely wizards would have settled along the East Coast.

If this is was true, then many of the pupils would have spoken Gaelic rather than Old English. Most pupils coming in were likely illiterate. (Perhaps Ancient Runes was chosen as a written language because it favoured none of the spoken languages.)

Although there could be a number of places they'd settle, it seems JKR quite liked Angus (Arboarth and Montrose) and we know the Knight Bus stopped off at Aberdeen so potentially Aberdeenshire too. (Perhaps in 'modern' days, Aberdeen is the wizarding capital of Scotland.)

Duff Town is on the East side of the Cairngorms and not far from Hogwarts.

In my view, a London-centric focus (Ministry, St Mungos, Diagon Alley) occurred when better transportation was in place and, of course, plenty of 'muggle borns' with generations of wizardry who might have preferred to loiter need family. Pottermore says Diagon Alley was built in the 1500s.

(Potentially, the South West simply was a hub of wizardry before London, I don't know.)

---

When you factor in the Floo Network, Apparation, Porkeys and the Night Bus - getting to Kings Cross isn't that problematic.

Before the train, wizard's would have needed an alternative method of travel. It seems unlikely Apparation and Porkeys would have been around. (The Knight Bus, obviously not.)

We also know that on modern brooms it would take hours to fly from Hogwarts to London (hence Thestrals being necessary). Broomsticks in the 990s were uncomfortable/caused pain (even on short flights, slow and unreliable at high altitudes. (Quiddich through the Ages).

Interestingly, one of the sources for this was a Scottish wizard flying from Montrose to Arbroath (12 miles by car).

Flying Carpets would have been more suitable, but unlikely much more reliable (perhaps, unless we're arguing that the richest imported ones from more developed magical systems).

So, either Wizards move closer to Hogwarts or they take a few weeks off work on a pilgrimage north, at least twice a year.

---

Presumably, language was part of the Hogwarts curriculum to enable the wizarding community to speak to each other. In addition, there could have been some friction between purebloods and muggleborns a few centuries later if high numbers of pureblood pupils were coming from the highlands/Scotland, but (due to population) most muggleborns were coming from England. That's before Wales and Scotland have entered.

Potentially, at some point rather than muggleborns returning to England to live with their own families, greater strain on relations means they start moving into existing areas like Aberdeen which in turn pushes out the purebloods we know. Or, many of the English high density wizarding areas were formed by people returning post-Hogwarts. Or both or neither.

Objection. First of all, we are biased due to the Weasleys in terms of places we visit in person. Second, most /people/ live in the South of England, period. And third, taking that into account, it's very clear e.g. the names in Harry's year are /very/ carefully chosen by Rowling and evenly (and easily!) placed geographically ([[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2006/01/28/secrets-of-the-classlist/][see also link]]). Look up the names and where they are common -- Greengrasses basically exclusively live in East Anglia, Parkinson is a name common to Lancashire, Longbottom from Yorkshire (where Upper Flagley is), and so on. Another indicator is the presence of Quidditch teams all across Britain and Ireland, which were founded in the middle ages.

So that kinda removes the premise of your post. However, in terms of settling near Hogwarts -- well, Hogsmeade. In a world where only a few thousand wizards exists, even a small village of e.g. 500 is a quite substantial fraction. And as regards travelling -- if you go by Rowling's wizard cards, floo powder was invented in the 13th century. So until then, it probably was a bit of a pain to travel longer distances -- but then again, there is a reason Hogwarts is a boarding school, and not a day school ...

.

All of which isn't to say that won't make for a potentially interesting AU, naturally.

*** I'm not saying it was canon (I'm not sure JKR thought that much about that time period), but rather that it could have happened. Thank you for the article, I found it very interesting.

*What Quiddich teams tell us about wizarding population*

I'd like to be contrary and argue that the Quiddich pitch distribution in England supports a population skewed towards the South West, rather than demonstrating equivalent muggle population distribution.

Now, as you note most people live in the South of England. Specifically, most people live in the South East. This is closely followed by London. If you check [[https://www.statista.com/statistics/294681/population-england-united-kingdom-uk-regional/][this website,]] you'll notice none of the Quiddich Teams are based in the most populous muggle regions.

In fact, of the 6 English Quiddich teams - 5 of them are in the South West.

/South West/

Chudley Canons -- West Country, South West (Chudleigh, pop. 6,125)

Falmouth Falcons -- Falmouth, South West (pop. 21,797)

Puddlemere United -- Dorset, South West.

Wimbourne Wasps -- Dorset, South West

Tutshill Tornadoes -- Tidenham, Forest of Dean, Gloustershire, South West nearest town in Wales. (Tutshill, pop. ? In 2000, the combined population was 3000. In 1655, it constituted one farm house -- potentially previously an all wizarding area?) (Founded, 1520).

Quiddich pitch set up in Exmoor. (Exmoor is in the South West with 1/3 in Devon and 2/3rd in Somerset).

/Other/

Appleby Arrows -- Lincolnshire, East Midlands. ( Founded 1292)

â€‹

So, not only can we see that Quiddich Teams favour the South West, but also that they were formed around small towns and villages rather than city locations. This suggests that wizards never needed to flock towards cities during the Industrial Revolution.

Potentially, there were a small number of excellent broom makers in the South West at a time when people primarily bought locally. This would explain why Yorkshire has no team.

*So who lived in the South West?*

Families we know lived in the South West are the Dumbledores, Potters, Wealseys, Lovegoods, Fawcetts, Bagshotts and the Malfoys. (Diana described the Malfoys as living in central south England but Wiltshire is in the South West.)

If we add in Diana's guesses the we also have the Crabbes and the Notts.

This could potentially suggest that some areas are more heavily populated by purebloods than others.

*What about Scotland?*

Scotland actually shows more of a demographic spread, however it mirrors England's avoidance of large towns and cities. Specifically, muggles in Scotland live in the central belt. The central belt includes Glasgow and the West and Edinburgh on the East with a number of commuter towns in between. A train trip between the two will take you about an hour.

In addition, we can see there are 4 Quidditch teams to England's 6 teams. For comparison, the South West has a larger population than Scotland. Perhaps easier to understand - London has an additional 2 million people.

/Scottish Teams/

Banchory Bangers (disbanded 1814) -- Aberdeenshire

Montrose Magpies -- Angus (date, unknown -- before 1942)

Pride of Portree -- Hebrideans (Isle of Skye, pop. 12,000; Portree pop.-- 4,500, likely made with wizards from a number of islands)

Wigtown Wanderers -- Dumfries and Galloway (Founded 1422)

It's a little difficult to interpret the teams without knowing the founding date of the Montrose Magpies as it could potentially be drawing players from a similar area to the Banchory Bangers.

If we assumed both the Banchory Bangers and Montrose Magpies coexisted, then it supports the idea that Aberdeenshire and Angus could be/have been wizarding hubs of where population has spread from Hogsmeade outwards.

Presumably, the Hebrideans has or had a thriving dragon taming community. Whilst Dumfries and Galloway is our only Lowlands community.

Like with England, no major city has a connected Quidditch team. Perhaps this is in part due to wizard space being a later inventions.

*Why are important places based in London?*

Honestly, I'm not sure. I suspect JKR simply put it there because it's a) she was there at the time she thought it up and b) such a well known place.

JKR tells us that wizards began to barter services in the 12th century. So precisely what they were doing before then is unclear, but I imagine they were far more integrated with muggle communities and so may have traded goods through local ports and London.

It's fair to assume that once travel to work places became easy, plenty of muggleborns would have preferred to return to city life and not found themselves suited to country living. Being so long ago, these families are likely considered pureblood - although perhaps not sacred 28.

Also, I expect muggle relations would have drawn people there - at least for work purposes, there would have been many people to sell cures to. Certainly, there must have been a reason the Black family owned a house there.

*What do surnames tell us?*

Mostly, they tell us that JKR probably world built Harry's class names and the placement of Quidditch teams separately.

The author (Diana) themselves says they think they likely put more thought the regional meanings of surnames compared with JKR and even guesses some characters into locations. Nonetheless, we do know that JKR was quite fanciful with name meanings.

Although Parkinson is a name common to Lancashire, in 1422 the Wigtown Wanderers (Dumfries and Galloway) was founded by the children of Walter Parkin. Four sons and three daughters were on the team but it's not too much of a stretch to say that (at some point) the sons of the Parkins because the Parkinsons. (Mc/Mac for son was more common in the highlands. Ferguson is a common Scottish surname.)

I think one of her most interesting arguments was that the Weasleys would have had Gaelic ancestry prior to marriages to families in England and across Britain. I'm not so certain I agree with this point, but it could support a case where the Weasleys ancestors were from a Scottish community (Or Irish.) Or long enough for the recessive trait to be sustained.

The difficulty with names relating to places is almost all young people - perhaps far fewer before Hogwarts had a reputation - are attending one school. So they're not necessarily staying in the region they were born in. Assuming that there was some degree of flexibility in partner provided their status was suitable.

An additional issue with the surnames is that Hogwarts was built about 150 years before surnames took off, but they weren't widespread until the 5th century. If we assume that wizards primarily returned to take over the family business, then witches would likely move from town to town at the very least. At what point it would become more balanced towards canon, I am unsure.

In conclusion, I suspect that some of Diana's analysis is correct but she potentially relies too much on the most common area, rather than allowing for spread of names. Consequently, her guesses put several characters where she wants to see them, rather than where they might have been.

Also, she's working hundreds of years later than my suggestion!

*The true conclusion*

JKR either felt broomstick making was very much a demographic skill or she chose very scenic places for her Quidditch teams and consequently forgot how carefully she'd placed Harry's classmates to achieve accurate demographic representation.

*** Haha - so true. I've drawn together some details for the other person who commented and the most simple solution is simply that JKR didn't connect all the dots.
