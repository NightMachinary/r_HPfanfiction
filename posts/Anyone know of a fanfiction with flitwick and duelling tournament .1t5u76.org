Its mentioned that Flitwick is a duelist champion but somehow I think his character was not used properly in the original books.I remember reading a fanfiction where Harry is being taught with flitwick but as far as I can remember it was not completed. Do you know of any good fanfiction with flitwick teaching Harry duelling skills ? (it could be that harry is really small and an AU fiction but would prefer if its completed)


** Welll... I couldn't remember any story fitting your criteria by title so I don't really know to which extent this carries the stories, but i fired up the fulltext search on my library, filtered for complete fics and came up with these for you:

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years
