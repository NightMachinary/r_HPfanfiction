I read it at least 5 years ago. It was very long (I'm not sure I completed it) but possibly not 'novel-length'. It was based around Hermione as if she had to defeat Voldemort instead of Harry. It also had a Severus/Hermione romance and was considered alternate universe. I remember that it wasn't on a main fan fiction website, but a site hosted by the author.

Any help would be appreciated!


** Do you remember anything else? I can think of one that reminds me off that.... Roman Holiday, which is hosted on witchfics.org. Hermione traps voldemort into crystal I believe... She also has a relationship with Draco... And Salazar Slytherin makes an appearance! I have read a fair amount of SS/HG, so if you can give me any other details I might be able to help you out.

*** I read this comic over 5 years ago, so this is what I can remember: -There was a female OC that came to Hogwarts from NYC -It was Hermione-centric and she was the one to defeat Voldemort... Harry was a very minor character. -It also had a strong Hermine/Snape romance... which I think started with them running into each other in a church in an old European city (maybe) Rome

I know it sounds weird, but I remember it being really good. It was not on a main/popular fanfiction website, so it might not even be online anymore.

****** I hope you like it! There is one scene in the beginning that really squicks me, but I like the rest of it a lot

** I dunno, but that sounds great.

This isn't what you described, but it's about Hermione as a spy for the Order (basically doing Snape's job), and it's very long, and it's also eventually SSHG... It's one of my favorites, and I'd suggest it in addition to whatever you're looking for!: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/][When A Lioness Fights]]
