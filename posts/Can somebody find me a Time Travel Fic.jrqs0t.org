I read a while ago a time travel fic, where a young Bellatrix, only a recruit not yet a death eater, attacks a muggle pub only to be faced with a Time Travelling Harry Potter, who kills everyone else, leaving Bellatrix to go back to the death eaters, who she leaves. She later shares the memory with Arcturus, who shares it with a 10/11 year old Sirius who he is grooming to be the future Lord Black.

​

If anybody remembers that, please help me

​

Many Thanks

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
