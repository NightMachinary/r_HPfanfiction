** First year, meaningless play fight: Neville goes down fast because the poor kid is that uncoordinated, inexperienced, and lacking in self-confidence. Dean, who grew up with little sisters and has an artistic hobby, isn't quite up to it and gets knocked out next. Harry is used to dodging Dudley's fists but not adept at hitting back, and he‘s smaller than the others, so he loses. It comes down to Ron (grew up fighting with brothers) and Seamus (grew up fighting with cousins). Ron is bigger, but Seamus is crazier, so Seamus takes it.

First year, fight to the death for noble reasons: Harry wins because he just doesn't crack under pressure and doesn't have a child's mindset.

Seventh year, meaningless play fight: Ron, Harry, and Dean are all used to running rather than fighting, so it comes down to Seamus and Neville who are more in practice. Now that they're older, Seamus' crazy can't carry the day and Neville wins.

Seventh year, fight to the death for noble reasons: Still Harry, because this stuff is Harry's thing.

**** Fair point, but we don't really get a good picture of Dudley's physique later on book wise. I may be wrong and can't remember but if we take the outtake where Dudley sort of reconciles with Harry while leaving no.4 Privet drive, he appears to be fairly over wait (borderline obese imo). Coming from experience it means probably doesn't have amazing balance and possibly ponderous in his movements. Also Harry would be extremely reluctant to fight back against Dudley due to how Vernon and Petunia would punish him for it. There is also the fact Dudley always had his gang of NED's to help him.

Edit I just remembered the dementor scene or before the dementor scene I should say that sort of reinforces the idea Dudley being overweight with out the lasting effects the dementor obviously had on him given how I remember him dragging his feet and looking depressed in the outtake from deathly hallows p1 tainting opinions

NED is a Scottish slang/ acronym for None Educated Delinquent (delinquents for plural) normally used to describe young adults and teenagers partaking in anti-social behaviour often in the form of bullying and gang violence often associated with binge drinking of minors and use of illegal substances

In wrestling or boxing, Neville would be a potential contender because of weight. Can't say for sure about Dean or Seamus as not much is elaborated on their backgrounds and physical abilities before Hogwarts.

** Harry, Ron or Dean. Ron had 5 brothers and by her personality (in books) it looks like Ginny wasn't really out in their brawls either. Dean is a muggle born so even if he didn't fight in school, he did get some PE, even if he wasn't in any martial arts club. not so sure about wizard in that. from the looks of it, wizards ever only play Quidditch, so flying on a broom and that wouldn't help in a fight. Harry the same, plus he did have to escape Dudley and co. regularly. so he is quick, can dodge and even though he couldn't ever hurt Dudley, I think he would throw quick punches as well. the downside is only his size. that's why it's between those three. Harry is savvy, but Dean and Ron are bigger than him. we could also assume with Dean being black in that times, that he didn't escape bullying either. he didn't have a father (not sure if his mother remarried), so maybe he was even poor, living in poor neighborhood or such which could make him pretty street savvy as well.

I think we all know though, that Hermione would win with any of them.

** Personally I think we should assess this year by year as boys start out very small and scrawny then some, but not all, grow to be bigger.

1st year - Harry wins. Let's assume the boys are all roughly similar size (at the end of the year when harry has had time to not be emaciated by the dursley's). Harry killed someone that year, he has the mindset over the others.

2nd year - Dean wins. They're still roughly the same size, but Dean and Ron have a growth spurt. Dean wins just because he watches the brawl play out first and Ron gets tired from going in head first.

3rd year - Ron wins. Everyone has hit a growth spurt and is getting bigger. Ron is described in the books as very tall and growing more muscle, but not stoutly. He also has a ton of pent up rage about Scabbers.

4th year - Harry wins. No one dares go up against a tri-wizard champion, and if we keep to the end of the year thing no one is gonna be more aggressive and angry than Harry after Cedric's death.

5th year - Seamus wins. He has apologized to Harry for his actions early in the year, but still feels he has a lot to prove. His Irish fighting ancestors come out and he absolutely annihilates the competition. Now, with my fourth year logic you'd think Harry wins out of anger, but he took that out on Dumbledore's office and is now depressed.

6th year - Ron wins. Harry is too distracted by the whole Draco thing, maybe if it's before the Battle of the Astronomy Tower (but still at the end of the year) he even gets knocked out because he sees movement on the map and gets off focus. At this point all the boys are getting as big and tall and they will be, Ron and Dean are the biggest, but Ron has bulked up as Keeper and wants to win to impress Hermione/Lavender.

7th year - Neville wins. Ron and Harry are gone, but even if they were there Neville would rock their shit. It's his time to shine. He almost won the 2nd year and 5th year fight, but never really got there. He's been beaten and knows his capabilities now. He isn't the widest or tallest, but he's above average and has nothing to lose. Go get em, Neville.

As adults - probably Harry or Ron because they were part of the Auror group and would do a lot of physical training. Neville is physically out of practice as a professor. Seamus and Dean we don't know what they do, but lets assume they get out of shape with age, maybe Dean plays quidditch, but Harry and Ron were still aurors. My money is on Harry winning, as head auror and husband of Ginny he's likely to not be as tamed as Ron, especially if Ron worked at WWW for a while.
