A few years ago I played with the backup that [[/u/nerdguy1138]] kindly created/repacked.

With internet speeds going all wonky, I checked my backups and found that I still had it, but though I should share with you guys

magnet:?xt=urn:btih:cc53d0317116c7483bce68249f275bd14e2d84f0&dn=Fanfiction_Harry_Potter.zip

is a torrent I made for Fanfiction_Harry_Potter.zip I'm seeding it from a pretty quick VPS that should be up for at least a few months.

The zip if I recall correctly is filled with a bunch of flat text files, it'll be up to you to come up with a way to read them.

These are stories 1-1,000,000 on fanfiction.net as they were in 2015.
