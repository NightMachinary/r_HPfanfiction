As the title says, I'm looking for two different types of fics.

1. Fics where Harry is summoned to a different universe, except he's Dark/on Voldemorts' side, or he's just generally against fight their war for them. Example- linkffn(On a Pale Horse)

2. Fics where Harry has gone back in time to when he starts school at Hogwarts, except he's in a different body (aka there's normal Harry and time traveled Harry in the same room, not where he's become an already known character like Draco for instance. He can change his looks and stuff but he's still Harry). He can be in the same year or a different year, and he can be Light/Neutral/Dark. Example- linkao3(The Dead Master)

Please comment if you have any suggestions, I'm always looking for more! :)

  Dumbledore's schemes took everything from him, including the man he loved, but now Harry has devised a means with which to travel back in time to his younger body before he started Hogwarts. He's going to get another chance at his life, and this time Dumbledore won't be getting in his way.An unconventional approach to a Do Over story.WARNING: This story is a W.I.P. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** For 1, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero][0800-Rent-A-Hero]] is great.

For 2, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8479548/1/George-Weasley-and-the-Computational-Error][George Weasley and the Computational Error]] is also good. However, (as the title suggests) it is about George Weasley, not Harry Potter. He also has the ability to possess an already known character, but he still exists as himself.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

  Part 1 of The Computational Error Series. George Weasley may be 40 years old now, but he still misses his twin dearly. And when he has the chance to go back to 1989 and see Fred alive again and stop everything from happening, he can't resist. George's relationship with everyone he loves, however, will change in the process. Time Travel. NoSlash. COMPLETE
