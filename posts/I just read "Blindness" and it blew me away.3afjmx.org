[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness]["Blindness"]] takes place is an AU where rather than simply receiving a scar on his forehead, Harry is stripped of his sight by Voldemort's attempt on his life.

It focuses on a more scientific Harry, the ramifications of a disability in the magical world, and how Harry adapts to the disability.

For those that care it has a [[/s][pairing]], but it is really, really well done in my opinion.

** Well.. Theoretically it's well written, but something about the writing style just doesn't sit well with me. It's tedious to read at times, because it always has the same pace(?) - I mean even when there are action scenes it's not really exciting. The writing is very passive. Most of the things are told rather than shown, dialogues are rare. (Though this is getting better in the later chapters.)

I also don't like Harry and Hermione's holier-than-thou attitude. Nearly every observation they make about the wizarding world has them looking down on it.

Further, Dumbledore is completely OOC (just so that the Wizarding World looks like an even worse place, I guess), wizards can run out of magic, and Harry and Hermione are of the opinion that muggle science is nearly on par and soon better than magic.

This fic really takes the wonder out of magic by over-explaining it and trying to make it somehow fit into muggle science. So, while I acknowledge that the writing is theoretically good, I just can't understand the enthusiasm.

*** It's reader preference. I love this story /because/ of all of the "faults" you've just deacribed.

The stable writing pace is something that allows me to casually read through entire chapters in one sitting, something I love doing, and despite not being th most stimulating at times, I still get heavily invested in the plot and characters.

The wizarding world is far from a perfect place, and I like when story's use this as a plot device. Again, this is pretty much a preference thing.

Dumbledore is somewhat out of character, but it's fanfiction. All the characters are somewhat out of character. Where in the story did it imply wizards could run out of magic? They can get tired from expending a lot of it, pretty sure that's true HP canon.

I would argue muggle science is on par/better than magic, in many aspects. Place a wizard with a wand and a muggle with an assualt rifle in a room and tell them to fight to the death. The muggle wins. Magic is much better from a medical standpoint. Alternatively, there isn't any magical "explanation of the universe" like muggles have with the Big Bang and quantum mechanics. Both sides have their strong points.

As for trying to fit magic in with muggle science, I absolutely love it. I'm the type of person who looks at a rainbow and questions how and why it exists before admiring its beauty.

Every opinion has its antithesis.

**** Yeah, I agree, it's reader's preference. I too think it can be interesting when the less than perfect parts of the wizarding world (corruption in the Ministry etc.) are addressed in a fic, but I think there should be a balance, and here nearly, if not all of the experiences Harry and Hermione have with the wizarding world are negative, while the muggle world is portrayed in an overly positive light. (Dumbledore casts the blind Harry aside without a second thought while Petunia suddenly is the nicest person around - things like that are just a complete canon reversal and make me think the author just did it to make the muggle world a better and the wizarding world a worse place; or when Hermione says that in the wizarding world human experiments are permitted, while in the muggle world they aren't. The author makes this additional stuff up just to make the Wizarding World look bad - or at least I can't think of another reason for things like that).

Edit: And not to forget about the part where the author makes up that Harry is a Lord and has seats on the Wizengamot, for seemingly no other reason than that Hermione can rant about it and say how out-dated the wizarding world is and how far better the muggle-system.

So my problem isn't really that the author is critising the Wizarding World, but that she is making it far worse only to show how superior muggles are in every way. I prefer it when authors work with shades of grey, instead of painting everything black and white.

I'd argue that the muggle wouldn't win. The wizard can cast a protego and non of the bullets will hit, while the muggle has no way to shield himself from a spell. So technically a wizard only has to use a shield charm until the muggle has run out of bullets and then finish him off... (it is canon that protego can shield from physical objects, and fanon that it can't). The wizard could also apparate to stand behind the muggle, imperio him, confund him... All a muggle can do is try to shoot before the wizard acts.

Edit: In canon wizards don't get tired from using magic. They get tired from running and jumping around while using it, but casting spells and curses by itself never tires them. Otherwise they would complain about being tired/weaker after classes etc. Here this happens a lot. E.g. Chapter 11, the Dementor scene: "His lungs burned; his magic was weakening from the constant stream of levitation around him." Or generally in the later chapters, when Harry has this ability to kind of really see, he can never use it long because it takes too much of his magic.

The wizarding world rejected Harry outright. Even in cannon Hermione has a great dislike for parts of the wizarding world, it is easy to see that she is more disenfranchised with what happens to her in the story.

This doesn't make it any less annoying. And is a problem I adressed in the post above (about how the author makes the wizarding world look worse and the muggle world look better, just so that the main characters can rant.)

Yeah, Harry says that at /one point/, and a lot of other things about muggle science and magic at /other points/. Though it's been a while since I read the story and I really can't be bothered to look through it again to find the relevant quotes. I vaguely remember something about cars being superior to magical transportation or whatever. This discussion is more than two weeks old.

***** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past]]

It's an AU where the sorting hat was an eighth horcruxe, and a Mary Sue. A damaged, ptsd Harry finally defeats voldemort at 28-30 years old. All his friends and family are dead and he manages to go back in time. Not everyone likes it because of some of the ideas and themes, but that's partially because it was the precedent for a lot of tropes in fanfiction.

But no one can really disagree that the writing isn't top notch.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

*** At the moment the fic has 94 000 words. The author structured it in 4 parts, three of which have been released. She also posted an updating schedule for the fourth part on her profile page. If everything goes according to plan, she'll publish another long - and I mean long, like 25k-75k long - chapter each month and the Epilogue in September.

** Harry is ridiculously overpowered. What is the point of giving him a disability if the disability is little to no handicap. What is the story trying to say -- that Harry would have turned to Super!Harry in canon had he plucked his eyes out?

It is pretty well written though. Gotta give it that.

*** Ehhh... while I totally agree he's op, I gotta say it isn't written in without pretty elaborate exposition and explanation.

I mean the premise is that he's A: Capable of literally seeing life and magic, and B: No one else can, and thus no one else can really comprehend how magic /works/ like he can. And C: That lead him to being vastly underestimated.

If the author keeps writing I'm sure any future antagonists will not.

Edit: And I'm pretty sure that this sight only works the way it does because of how he was blinded. In the story the author informs us that there are very few blind witches or wizards and all of them blinded later on in life. The first few chapters are really good about the discrimination and difficulties of the disability, but that isn't really the point of the entire story. I mean while it may be interesting I would be significantly less interested in a blind Harry who can do basically zero magic.
