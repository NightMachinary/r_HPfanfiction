** James and Sirius both are more traditional pure-bloods, who will seek to marry fellow pure-bloods, but do not mind if they are considered blood-traitors. Sirius has a better relationship with his parents because he partially tows the Black Family line and will not ''sully'' it with a Half-Breed or Mudblood, even if his choice of friends is questionable.

James however, is a bit less happy at home, with parents that disagree somewhat with his sorting and his pure-blood beliefs.

These are some thoughts I had.

*** Some other ideas:

James could be rather cunning or ambitious as well. Becoming an illegal Animagus to help Remus out? It's incredibly ambitious, when it's incredibly difficult to do without guidance, or outside help.

Sirius came from a family of Muggleborn, Muggle, Squib (et cetra) haters. His hatred of his family, might not be enough to get away from what his parents had always taught him and his brother, in an AU. (Also became an illegal Animagus to help Remus out)

Remus was a Werewolf, bitten young, he'd realize the hardships that his family was put through, because of him. Perhaps he could get ambition through that, and cunning, and anything else that might help him survive more.

Peter was the one who brought back Voldemort. I'm sure that Bellatrix would have absolutely loved to do it as well, but Peter also tricked James, Sirius, Remus, Lily and everyone else, making them think that he was on their side. That's rather cunning/brilliant (In a horrible way of course).

You can always play with canon a little bit, while also doing the best as a way to explain why all 4 of them are in Slytherin, instead of Gryffindor.

**** Honestly, they are super brave

but in this timeline, they are slightly more cunning and ambitious so they are sorted into slytherin instead

Sirius gets sorted first and is worried he will be alone in a place he does not want to be and then lupin get sorted and sits next to him and then Potter and pettigrew

they still grow close, Sirius because he hates the rest of what slytherin represents and so do James and lupin peter does not care about that stuff, he sat with them on the train and they seem cool plus they seem willing to stick up for him

James wants to make a name for himself as an auror ironically telling his parents he will be the one who brings down voldemort when he is a kid Sirius wants to stand apart from the rest of the blacks and leave his mark on history in a way that spits on them Lupin, his ambition is too improve the standing of werewolfs and Peter just wants to be recognized as someone great

** James is annoyed at being in slytherin and so is sirius but at least they have friends,\\
james is worried about how his parents will react but they are supportive as they know he has a kind heart and is too headstrong to listen to his fellow slytherins. Peter sticks with his friends as the other slytherins pick on him and they defend him

the snape rivalry is even worse in this timeline. Slytherin starts to fracture, as the marauders present a different path

Sirus falls out with his parents, and moves into the potters who accept him as family

Sirus no longer regrets being sorted into slytherin because at least he has James, peter and remus with him

the marauders, still play pranks, but they lose less points as they are even better at not getting caught

Peter comes into his own within the group and finally feels like an equal

the elder potters are murdered, James is forced to grow and mature he gets chosen as headboy, a anti voldemort slytherin being made headboy sends a strong message dumbledore thinks. James and lilly fall in love James and the marauders join the order, James and sirius decide to join the ministry as well Peter who is more confident and secure in his friendship and himself he tells dumbledore its a good idea if the order has a spy in the death eaters, he tells dumbledore him or sirius would be the best pick, he tells dumbledore he will not let sirius go through that

the prophecy is made, sirius still suggests peter, peter suggests he tells voldemort and they lay a trap.

the trap failed voldemort, still kills James and Lilly and 'dies' to harry

Sirius goes after peter beliving he betrayed them and ruined the trap, he finds peter broken down and crying,

Sirius suggest they should find remus together and apologise for beliving him to have turned as well

they find remus and go to dumbledore, and demand custody of harry

Dumbledore relents, Harry is raised with love and affection Lupin worries that harry has no friends his own age and only hangs out with adults Sirius suggests they introduce him to arthur weasleys young boy ron Ron and harry become thick as thiefs.

Harry and ron hang out every day, with harry sitting in with lessons at the borrow with ron or ron sitting in on lessons with harry at sirius house.

molly does not mind, as lupin is a great teacher and she thinks its great that ron has a friend his own age.

Ron in this timeline grows more confident in himself and more ambitious

Ron gets sorted into slytherin, Harry goes to Gryffindor Harry and ron still sit together anyway at dinner, what do they care about housepoints

snape is still a git
