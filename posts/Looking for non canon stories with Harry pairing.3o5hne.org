Hi! I'm new here and decided to sign up cause I'm looking for new stories to read. I'm very picky about what I read. It has to be good writing, have a believable plot and be at least 100k. I didn't like the typical pairings other seems to love, like Harry with either Ginny, Draco, Hermione, Snape or Ron. Maybe because they're over done. There's hundred thousands of those. I like stories where he's paired with someone you don't see a lot of stories of, like Tonks, Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, Fleur, Hannah Abbott, etc.

I've become quite fond of stories where he discovers that he is Lord Potter and/or Lord Black and Dumbledore kept it from him, also stories where he is a heir to one or more of the founders and takes over the control of the school. Stories where he is betrothed are storylines I love. I love stories where Dumbledore is manipulative, I've read so many now that when he's not it's become quite boring. Also some Weasley bashing, but not to over the top. Ron may be stupid sometimes, jealous and acts before he thinks but have him for example throw a dark curse at Harry or claiming he's going dark is not believable. The same goes for the others, they're just sheep. Except the twins. Stories where Harry has more of a backbone than in the books, he has more knowledge and can think for him self. I've read or tried to read all the stories on ff.net with the search words heir, betrothed or lord potter in them with the pairings I like and looking for new ones. I also read one called 'white knight, grey queen' with pansy Parkinson and I loved it. Not to over the top. One of my favorite stories are 'Harry and the angry seven' and others like that. I'm also not opposed to Harry with two girls, just as long as there is good writing and no more than two girls. I thought the whole Harry/Pansy/Ginny triangle in 'white knight, grey queen' was beautifully done, even if it didn't touch upon it as much as I would have liked.

Like I said, I'm very picky about what I read and don't know where else but ff.net and searching on Google to find stories. I'm hoping you can give me some. It doesn't have to be sigh the storylines I listed, but they have to be good and not contain any of the pairings I said I don't like.

Thank you thank you thank you!

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

Sadly some of the best/most promising stories in this pairing are incomplete and unlikely to ever be completed.

  When Tonks & Harry meet, they quickly become friends. When tragedy brings them together again, it develops into more. Age, school, & war are only some of the obstacles in their way. Mix of canon & A/U. Rating mostly for language.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer prior to fifth year, Andromeda Tonks finds out her daughter Nymphadora has set her sights on Remus Lupin. She's not happy with this, and tricks Tonks into going for Harry Potter instead. What starts out as a way to "get back" at her parents, turns into an uncommon romance... Canon until the start of Book 5 'Order of the Phoenix', mild lemons.

  Having vanished from his home life at a young age Harry Potter has been declared dead. On a field assignment for her training Tonks finds a unusual partner and friend while in the field and maybe a even someone more. Honks fic with maybe a few other pairings in the background but mainly Harry and Tonks. Enjoy and leave Reviews.
