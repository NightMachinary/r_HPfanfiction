So there was this Harry/Hermione fanfic I read a couple of years ago that I've been trying to find again. It starts during the horcrux hunt, after Ron leaves them. They dance together in the tent, get together, and actually end up getting married. One scene has them making love on the hill at Ottery St. Catchpole. When Harry goes to fight Voldemort, Hermione stays at Shell Cottage as she is pregnant. I remember near the end, there's a scene where Ginny slips into Hermione's room and basically asks her how this could have happened and that she didn't even see Hermione as a threat until Hermione had already stolen him.

The prose in general was great in this fic, and it was pretty short- 5 to 10 chapters I think?

Would appreciate any help I can get.
