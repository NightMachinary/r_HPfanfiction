Dark!Harry, Voldemort with Harry following to stop him, one of the death eaters hoping to keep Voldemort alive, whatever. With or without Harry, a bad guy goes back in time to cause trouble, and doesn't become good in the process. Preferably causing the plot to go massively AU, but I'll take what I can get.

Dark!characters, crossovers, bashing and slash are fine. Please no harems, romance/smut-centric plots, mpreg, genderbending or pottercest. Thanks!


** linkao3(1113639) fun one shot.

  What he hated most about his perfect plan going wrong, is how much his nemesis enjoyed being brought along for the ride.

** A Very Potter Sequel is a musical that can be found on a YouTube that has Lucius going back in time. It's very very AU

** linkao3(The Time of Love and Rogues) might fit your bill.

Major!AU, but also explicit incestual(sorta) sex (not centric, but still a point in the story worth mentionning), TMR/HP. It is, however, an absolute delight to read, very well written.

  After fools have meddled with time and unintentionally created a more powerful and immortal Dark Lord than the Wizarding World already knew, Lord Voldemort gives himself a gift in his past, a little brother named Harry Potter so that he can learn and weild the Love Magic the infant boy had been blessed with and become the most powerful wizard in the world.
