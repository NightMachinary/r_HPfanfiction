I am entertaining an idea in my head, where Hermione travels back in time, and she wants to change things for the better. She wants Harry to grow up knowing his parents and be a normal boy. But Dumbledore interferes and saying that she can't to persevere the timeline. Hermione got mad and sends a Howler to him. I would love to write something like that; it could a one chapter thing or a whole long fiction. I suck at being mean though, so any help?


** Just have her channel Molly Weasley and you'll be set lol. Also, it might help if you look up angry/ powerful monologues, either written or from film, I find that can give a lot of inspo
