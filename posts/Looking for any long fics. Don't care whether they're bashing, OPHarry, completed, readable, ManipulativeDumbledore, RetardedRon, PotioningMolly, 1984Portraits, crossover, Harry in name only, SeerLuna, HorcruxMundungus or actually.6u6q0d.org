** You want long and don't care about quality? Oh you sweet summer child... Has anyone told you of the saga of MegaMatt09? Rather infamous for massive harem smutfics. His longest story is currently nearly 2.2 */million/* words and is still actively updating. It is a sequel. The proceeding book is a wimpy 500k words.

The inexplicable hatred of people for it may also have turned you off linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) if you /have/ read it, then you might be interested in three of its wildly different fanfanfics: the gigantic epic of [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html][Signficiant Digits]], the fun but not really rational [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11127426/1/Revival][Revival]], and the completely different alternate ending [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix][Following the Phoenix]].

** I like slash so, if it doesn't bother you, you can try "A nick in time" by TiraNog - almost no real slash in it, beautifully writen, Harry/Snape, but with really nice characterisation of Hermione and Ron. I really hate fanfics that are bashing these two.

The sequel "Growing Pains" is equally beautiful :) Has more slash scenes though.

Those are the only stories I read that really sticked to me.

You can find both stories here:
