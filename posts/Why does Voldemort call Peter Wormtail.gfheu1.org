Something that confuses me. It was a nickname given to him by his friends--why would Voldemort care? Maybe he's mocking him?


** He was mocking him constantly reminding him that he betrayed the only friends he ever had.

** it's probably one part mocking, two parts reminding old Pety that he betrayed his childhood friends and thus, by extension, the entire Order. Thus, he's literally reminding the rat of the fact that he /literally/ has no other option than Voldemort

** Voldemort believes in the right to put one's birth name behind one.

He probably doesn't understand the dynamic of Wormtail being a maruader name, meaningful within a group of friends. He just sees that Wormtail rejected being named "Peter" -- and who wouldn't? It's almost as common a name as "Tom"!

** I've wondered that myself. It's his Marauder nickname, and not a flattering one at that. Then again, maybe that's the point: Voldemort is a malicious person. I assume that he pulled the name out of Peter's head through legilimency, since Peter isn't likely to go around telling people about the name. Maybe it's an unsubtle way to constantly remind him that, having betrayed his (only?) friends, he has no other place to turn. We know that Peter doesn't serve out of loyalty, but fear.

** IMO, it's a combination of mocking him and being smart. "Peter Pettigrew" is "dead". You can't go around shouting a dead man's name.

And a weird thought: Maybe there is some Chuuni-ism to it too. Voldemort senses a comrade.

Seriously... "Lord Voldemort"... It wouldn't surprise me if his arm started hurting because of the demon sealed withi- Oh shit... The silver arm! The Dark Mark! The masks... This explains so much...

Holy shit, JKR was a chuuni...

** My headcanon has always been that Wormtail was a muggleborn who betrayed the Potters to save his own skin. The rest of the Death Eaters treat him like trash despite his being an invaluable member of the group who played a crucial role in the Dark Lord's return.

Plus supposedly Voldemort tried to recruit Lily so its not as if the original DEs were completely opposed to such recruitments.
