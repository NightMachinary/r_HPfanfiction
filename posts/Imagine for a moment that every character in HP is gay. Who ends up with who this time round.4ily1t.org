This should be a very interesting one. Try to pair off as many characters as you can, ideally without using the same character twice or including any characters that don't have established personalities.

** Harry/Cedric definitely

Fairly certain I've seen this pairing before: Trelawney/Mrs Figg

Petunia/Marge Dursley (why not)

Lily/Alice (Longbottom, but she wouldn't be called that)

Andromeda/Luna's mother

Ginny/Cho Chang

Narcissa/Blaise Zabini's mother - one of the few ambitious, ruthless women we hear of

Bellatrix/Alecto

Hermione/Luna (especially a Ravenclaw!Hermione who would first encounter Luna as someone being bullied, which would remind her of herself, not through Ginny) or Hermione/Penelope Clearwater

Ron/Seamus maybe, I also love the idea of Ron/Draco

Remus/Charlie Weasley (if we're sticking with the cross-generational thing)

Neville/Colin Creevey, maybe. Colin would settle for Neville, the 'other' boy who lived (!)

Ollivander/Dumbledore

Minerva/Ariana Dumbledore who lived

Sprout/Pomfrey or Sprout/Molly Weasley

Marietta/Lavender or Romilda Vane/Lavender

Padma/Susan (I'd really like to see this one, just due to fanon interpretations of the characters)

Dobby/Kreacher (?)

James/Sirius or James/Severus

Oliver Wood/Percy or Oliver Wood/Flint

Ms Pince/Ms Hooch

** Righty ho then:

- Arthur/Lucius - the sexual tension between them is obvious

- Pettigrew <3's Snape, but it's unrequited. Peter joined the DE's to try catch his attention. Failed.

- Harry/Colin - he's basically a male Ginny, so it works

- Ron/Roger Davies

- Hermione does a Remus, spends years pursueing a career/life before thinking about settling down, marries a divorced Fleur, who'd married some random girl

- Ginny/Romilda

- Pansy/Astoria Greengrass

- Millicent/Luna - Millicent looks after tiny bullied Luna, Luna befriends lonely half-blood plain jane Millicent - eventually friendship flourishes into luuurve

- Penelope/Tonks

- Remus/Snape - took til after the war, when they both made their peace with the evil beings that they both are, that they finally were ready to date people. Turned out to be each other.

- Miverva/Amelia Bones. You know it's meant to be.

- Bane/Firenze. Bane got really mad when Harry rode Firenze, but that was just because HE wanted to ride him. Yanno. wink wink.

- Hagrid/Vernon. Clearly.

- Lavender spends years trying to get Hermione's attention. Eventually decides to move on, and tried asking Fleur out. Heartbroken when both OoD married each other, and kinda turned on too. Eventually finds happiness with Daphne, who sadly turns out to be a second Mrs Zabini, and Lavender was #8. Oops, I didn't mean to make her life a tragedy...

- Parvati/Susan

- Padma/Hannah

- Neville/Seamus - Seamus was devoted right from Neville's first potions explosions.

- Draco/Zacharius Smith

- Lee Jordan/Oliver Wood

- Fred and George both date unseriously for years, never settle down

- Percy eventually finds himself somehow in a relationship with Cedric. He's never entirely sure how it happened, but he's very happy.

- Cho Chang - Daphne prize #12 - after she got super rich and successful in her Quidditch career, and provided Daphne with lots of money and social opportunities. Prior to that, Cho had had a tempestuous, on and off again relationship with Marietta for years, before Marietta made a very advantageous marriage to Gwenog Jones, who'd retired from Quidditch and did something very important and prestigious. Oops, didn't mean to make her life sad either...

- Gwenog Jones ends up heart broken by Marietta, and dies during a Triwizard Tournament she was judging/running/something

- Molly/Emmeline
