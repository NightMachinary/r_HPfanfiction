  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

*** Yeah I thought it was mostly good. I'm happy to recommend it if the general description you saw appeals to you. It had a few cringe moments but so does everything. It did some things very nicely, like explaining and handling the DADA Instructor Curse, which coincidentally just came up in another subreddit.

It's 110k words which is (omg) fairly short by Potterfic standards. So many HP fics are 500k+ and I'm terrified as soon as I see the length. This one is much more (no pun intended) digestible.

*** I liked it as what i call a 'snackfic'. A Nice lighthearted fic to Read in-between the more seriously good ones with more dark undertones who need some time to update. I have a big weakness for fics who expand on parselmagic and this one was different (if anyone knows any good parselmagic fics trow them my way). The writing and building was ok√© and I enjoyed it.

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way- by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that seeks to either protect or destroy him.

** It's the Venom Peddler. The beginning is awesome but as it goes on, the quality is not as good. Around 4th year it starts becoming bad and the ending is, compared to the beginning not that great. Still would recommend it though.
