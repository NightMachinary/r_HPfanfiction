In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, he and his friends, Ron and Hermione, become suspicious when one of their year mates, a Slytherin Harry Potter, begins to do "shady stuff" and act more covertly.

Harry is pretty unremarkable and quiet: he rarely brings attention to himself, and he's generally kept his distance from people inside of his own House.

Convinced that he's up to no good or, as a greater worry, thinking he's in league with Voldemort or at least Malfoy's plans, they decide to follow him.

Their suspicions are "confirmed" when he holds a gathering in one of the unused classrooms, replete with potions of various types, snacks, et cetera.

At first, a few Slytherins arrive --such as Hestia and Flora Carrow-- but more begin to trickle in from other Houses, including Gryffindors: to their shock, they see Katie Bell and a few others they never would have expected among the group.

The group's members begin to speak: the penny drops, and Neville and co are mortified.

Yeah, it turns out it's not some clandestine group meeting for some nefarious purpose or design -- it's a support group assembled by Harry for fellow students that are neglected, are abused, or have suffered severe emotional and mental trauma n their lives.

They lend a sympathetic ear to each other, offer healing solutions for physical abuse, support one another for emotional abuse, ad-hoc therapy sessions, et cetera.

As you can imagine, the three feel awful about gate-crashing something so personal and precious, and they try to leave unnoticed.

Unfortunately, they're spotted. Harry and his fellow support group members are rightfully not amused.

Edit: holy... I did not expect this to blow up! I'll get to answering people's replies/questions and thanking them for the awards ASAP. Thanks, everyone!

***** Peter and Remus don't really have any "claim" from the start. Being friendly to a family does not give someone any right to take care of their child (no matter how willing he might be), and in Remus case, being a werewolf probably automatically makes him an unfit guardian (not to mention the fact the he would probably be too afraid to infect Harry and refuse to be too close to him just like in Canon).

As his godfather, Sirius probably has a better claim, but it's not like it automatically makes him guardian of Harry. Godparents are more of a cultural/ religious thing than a legal one, so Sirius may, or may not get Harry depending of what the author wants to do.

In the end, the 2 more obvious choices are either to let Sirius raise Harry (with or without his friends help), or to remove Sirius from the picture so Harry has to go to the Dursleys (his closest family). Once again, it depends of what the author wants to do, the onec ould probably use the same plot than Canon to frame Sirius for Peter betrayal and send him to Azkaban. I also remember an Neville!BWL story where Sirius and Peter dueled each other to the death after Sirius learnt of Peter betrayal.

******* Well, the Potters don't /have/ to get a back-up guardian. There is a lot of possible way to justify their lack of planing (they were so young, refused to think about it, didn't think they would both die . . .) just like a lot of pay die in the real world without planing how to deal with what they will leave behind, though the only thing that truly matters is what the author want.

If the author want Harry to have a happy childhood, he can have the Potters prepare a suitable guardian for Harry. And if the author wants Harry to have a sad childhood (to be closer to canon, to create more drama or any other reason one might think), he can have the Potters not preparing anything and either place Harry with the Dursleys or /in the system/ (Magical Orphanage, Muggle Orphanage, Foster House . . .).

Also, the Dursleys are still an "acceptable" placement for Harry even without the blood protection. Sure they are pretty crapy guardians, but they are Harry closest family, and Dumbledore might think that it would be better for Harry to be raised far from the Magical World, where he may grow in the shadow of parents unable to recognize him despite being "alive".\\
There are probably better places for Harry, but it's not like Dumbledore chose the Dursley just for the Blood Protection.

***** Since the prophecy could refer to either of 2 babies, could the Longbottoms have also been in hiding under a fidelius charm? If so, they may have come out of hiding after Voldemort was seemingly killed on Halloween thinking it was now safe. IIRC, none of the specifics are mentioned in canon.

If we use these assumptions, then the reverse scenario would work. The Potters location could have still been betrayed by their secret keeper and the revenge/false imprisonment plot could have still occurred.

***** There are a lot of ways to go with Neville. Maybe Augusta died with her family making Neville an orphan. Maybe she survived and took care of it. Maybe Neville's mother did the same thing than Lily and he has to live with someone of his mother blood to be protected (though Canon Neville doesn't seem to have anyone outside of his grandmother and the Grand Uncle Archie, so either the Uncle is not a Longbottom or OC needed). Maybe Augusta decided that he already did enough by killing Voldemort and doesn't push him too much during his childhood (unlikely), or maybe she has even more expectations (if its possible), making Neville even more of a wreak when he reach school.

But in these kind of story, it's not like Neville is the main character. Most of the time, the focus isn't on Neville!BWL, but on Normal!Harry. How did Harry grow up without the Dursley, how does he deal with the usual troubles of Hogwarts when he is not in the center of events? Would he still want to avenge his parents or join the blood purists? . . .

****** Butterfly effects and the simple changes made by having other people stand-in the roles another person would've taken means all sorts of changes.

Were a series of events aborted entirely? Did another take their place, instead? If events did happen, the characters acting differently (such as Lily not acting like Alice would've and vice-versa) would've changed everything, from their just dying instead of being tortured to one dying, one being tortured but possibly alive/in ill health than insane, to Lily and James fighting them all off successfully to their killing them all, with Lily killing Bellatrix or their mutually killing one another.

Anything is possible, really. That's the great thing about butterfly effects, so long as the reader is given enough information in passing about the logical chain of progression of events for them to understand it.

James dying saving Lily and Harry after killing Bellatrix and her band, only with Lily surviving but being crippled/maimed? Her raising Harry? Interesting set of knock-on effects, from the Malfoy's hating them for Bellatrix's death (or even feeling remorseful, if Narcissa believed her sister had gone too far, or something), to Snape... well, that'd be a whole kettle of fish by itself, if Snape isn't written as being two-dimensional.

***** It's possible they may divorce --anything is possible, but I honestly don't see it.

James was a bit of an asshole while he was a teenager, but in his last year, he basically grew up. It happens. But having immature moments doesn't equate to being an immature person anymore.

We also never hear of any of Lily's faults -- it's possible she was just as bad in her own way in her Hogwarts years, but mellowed out in her last year, like James did.

It's obvious they were happy and in love enough to have a long-term relationship and be married, and we see/hear no signs of any domestic issues while they were married or in hiding (though, given what little we know, it's possible, but personally I think highly unlikely).

Would Harry take after a James that is more mellowed and fun-loving compared to being a cruel joker/asshole that he was in Hogwarts (since "That James" is what he was exposed to growing up, not the Asshole James in his Hogwarts years)? Maybe. But it's equally as possible he'd take more from whatever Lily was in personality.

Personally, I take more after my mother in personality than my father, eve though I look a lot more like him physically (except for the weirdly high cheekbones, heh).

As for divorce? Perhaps, but only in the way that "anything is possible" in such a butterfly effected timeline/"we don't know" way... but I'm personally not seeing it, just as you can personally see them divorcing. I think they'd probably end up with 2.5 kids and a stable, if not happy than just content, marriage.

He hexed Snape behind Lily's back, he nearly got two muggles killed because he and Sirius were fucking around, and he didn't trust Lupin on the grounds that he was a werewolf.

As for them being in love, I think it's much closer to dumbass 17 year olds rushing into a hasty decision. They were kids and, speaking as a 17 year old, I am not ready for that level of commitment and neither is anyone in my class at school. High school relationships are almost always sentenced to die and part of the reason is because teenagers are hormonal as hell and just stupid. Their entire marriage was spent in war. I don't see them staying married if they live and personally I see Harry taking after James more because that's who he took after without the influence of either.

******* He did grow up: in his last year, while he was head boy, he stopped being the complete asshole he was in prior years. Was he still a bit of an asshole? Yeah, but he pretty much matured down to the level of a normal person who's an asshole, if that makes sense. It was this change that actually had Lily consider him more than... well, an annoyance.

I hate to break it to you, but up until your mid-twenties, people still act like assholes from high-school: age and life-experiences mellow/tempers these attitudes over time. but I have no doubt that had James lived until his thirties and Sirius hadn't been incarcerated (basically preventing him from developing emotionally), they'd continue to mature like normal people -- and it's over this time-frame that Harry would have grown up in. Thus, I couldn't see Harry becoming a copy of James as he grew up.

Snape and James hexing one another was pretty much the norm: they hated each other for various reasons, and as they became older, those reasons became less high-school drama and more "opposing sides of a civil-war". I suspect that each had a near-pathological level of hatred for the other at that point, too.

Their being reckless? Yeah, James was always a bit reckless and arrogant, but everyone has their flaws -- point is that those flaws didn't define him like they did in his younger years after he... well, grew up.

James being suspicious of Remus was, unfortunately, a sign of the times: they should have known better than Remus would've never joined Voldemort, but the paranoia and suspicion were affecting everybody -- they also suspected a traitor. Ironically, it's because Peter was Peter that they suspected Remus than Peter, even though it would have been obvious in hindsight.

Sirius was still a bit of a dick, yeah. His post-Azkaban characterization is a bit of crazed representation of his twenty-one year old self because he didn't develop correctly emotionally. It's... kinda sad, really. Also, it's kinda strange that people who write AUs where he didn't go to Azkaban write him as though he were canon-Sirius. I mean, I'm certainly not the same person I was at 16, 21, or even 25, and I'm 33 this year!

We have a direct counterpoint in canon to their marriage being certainly doomed to fail: Molly and Arthur. They eloped when they were seventeen, have been happily married for decades, and have seven children. High-school sweethearts is a stereotype for a reason, even if a lot of the marriages do fail.

My parents, for example, were dating when they were young, and they've been together for over forty years.

As for Harry taking more after James... yeah, I can see it, but I also it being the more mellowed with age James than High-School Asshole James. Even then, he'd have his parents basically stopping him from going down James' path. But, again, it's equally as possible he'd take after Lily more, for all her good and ill points.

Anyway, maturing character and character flaws =/= marriage failures and shit child-rearing.

**** JK Rowling stated in an interview that it was only because of the horcrux that the Hat considered him for Slytherin.

***** Which is kinda bullshit by her own standards. The way Harry acted at home, that had more Slytherin leaning. He wanted to be Harry, just Harry, to prove himself worthy of his life (which echoes Severus a bit). Gryffindor made Harry much more reckless than he was under the Dursleys.

***** I personally take literally /everything/ Rowling's said post-DH with a planet-sized grain of salt. I highly doubt she had thought up the concept of Horcruxes that early in the story, and merely retconned it later on.

*** If Voldemort attacked the Longbottom's instead, it's likely the Potter's would come out of hiding just like the Longbottom's did. Or Peter could just tell Bella where the Potter's are, and kill/torture them. Which could mean that Lily and James (and perhaps Sirius as well) are killed or tortured to insanity by the Lestrange's, just like Neville's parents were.

Either option could be pinned on Sirius if he survives, so he can't take care of Harry.

Laws and guilt would prevent Remus from taking care of Harry.

Peter would either disappear as he did in canon or he would refuse guardianship because he's a coward and wouldn't be able to take looking at Harry after what he'd done.

So, Harry would still grow up with the Dursleys, neglected and abused. Perhaps even harsher than he was in canon if Lily and James were still alive at Mungo's. Because using Dursley logic "At least they had the excuse of being dead." (not an actual quote, it just sounds like something they would say.)

*** It depends how things developed in his home-life, and the circumstances surrounding said home-life: did Lily and James die? Did they fight Bellatrix and her band, and instead of tortured, were instead killed? Were they tortured like Neville's parents, with one dying and one becoming insane or both or did Lily or James manage to off them all before dying themselves? "Go missing"? Did his time living where he did cause him to become more ambitious and underhanded, traits the Sorting Hat would've seen him as an option for Slytherin?

A butterfly effect can have so many ripples and alterations, it could ultimately change everything from that point of divergence -- heck, if the theory is correct, a character in the background a thousand miles away sneezing to create a branched timeline could lead to a chain of events that cause many characters we know at Hogwarts to not be born or have replacements, such as Malfoy having a twin, not being born at all, his parents having a child that isn't him a year earlier or later, et cetera. And you can apply that logic to /everyone/.

Butterfly effects, realistically, are crazy, yo.
