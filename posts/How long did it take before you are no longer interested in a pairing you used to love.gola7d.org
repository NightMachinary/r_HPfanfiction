As someone who ships no pairing,it only happens when I am no longer interested in this fandom.

No pairing is a fabulous and enduring pairing,truth to be told.


** linkffn(Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass) made me really interested in the NTHP ship. But after countless fics that are simply just... cliché ("oh you're the first guy who asked for my true form!" etc), I eventually tired of it. I still theoretically like the idea of the ship, but I no longer bother with looking for any fics with the ship.

  Both Dumbledore and Voldemort underestimated just how powerful Lily's sacrifice for Harry really was. There was nothing she wouldn't do to ensure her son had a life full of the love and happiness he deserves. She'd make sure of it. "The power of love is a great thing. Terrifying. But great." Harry!Harem Harry/Multi, Genderbent!Voldemort, and lemons.

** Used to love Harmony and now im meh on it. Most of the stories are pretty much the same with only a few outliers like Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift linkffn(13405869). It took about a year for that to happen though and i still think the two should have been the main couple at the end of the series

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

** I'm boring and like the canon pairings and have pretty much for the last decade+, though I've gone months or years at a time without reading any fanfiction.

The type of stories I like has changed though, I now prefer fics that start a good bit after the war rather than at Hogwarts or immediately post war. I find pretty much all the Hogwarts era AUs have very cringey, unrealistic dialogue. And the immediately post war fics can be very repetitive. At this point I've read some very good ones, so reading the meh ones with basically the same plot is boring. I've also recently started getting a bit more into the Marauders ear fics after having avoided them for awhile.

** There was a time where I really liked Harry/Daphne, but I got sick of them after some time because I have always read the same kind of romance.

I wont go into detail because most can probably think of at least 10 similarities every story with such a pairing share.\\
(Ice Queen Persona, Pureblood-Girl-Problems, marriage contracts, I-want-to-become-a-strong-and-independent-woman, falls in love with Harry on the first sight because he is /interesting/, etc.)\\
Its always kinda the same stuff. Rarely I am confronted with something new.

** For me the process is like this -- when I just enter fandom I either ship no pairings or one or two that I picked up from the canon myself. Then I discover all the various pairings other people thought up and start to ship/read many, many different ones. With time a handful of favorites emerges and they stay with me for as long as I stay in fandom, some even after that.

With Harry Potter I really disliked or was not at all infested in the majority of canon pairings ever since first reading the books and this fact didn't change. I really envy your ‘no pairing' pairing though. Bcs after favorite pairings develop, it's becomes somewhat hard for me to get into a story that ruins/contradicts them, well you catch my drift here

** I stopped reading specific pairings around the same time I stopped reading bashing fics. Too often they involve the same type of combative writing style in which the author is raging against either Canon or Fanon for its crimes against their preferred ship/character/plot point.

I'm not interested in reading a story where the author tries to convince me that Harry and Hermione should have been together in canon. I'm more than happy however to read a story where the author writes in a way that Harry and Hermione should be together within the fic.

A preference in writing style rather than a preference in pairings, but I found that looking for specific pairings turned up more results of the first kind than the second. Now i just look for interesting plots with quality writing and enjoy whatever paring or lack thereof is involved.

** I used to love Hermione/Snape fics when I was in high school and college, but now that I am an adult and have children, I can't read them anymore. Too much an abuse of power and dubious consent. Same goes for any adult/teen relationship. The only time I'm ok with it now is if it's a 10 year later kind of thing and they meet again as adults.

** I think my biggest problem with Harry/Hermione is I ended up reading so many fics where it was just super feel good heroes are the best no flaws whatsoever with incompetent enemies but no they actually are super scary and bad.

Honestly it happened with pretty much every pairing where the bad stories outweighed the good to the point I started disliking the pairings except Harry/Katie due to the lack of fics with them in it.

** I'm not sure there are any pairings that I used to love that I won't still read. I think the only ones I no longer seek out are the canon pairings that initially started reading with. But I'm not nearly as focused on any one pairing anymore, I'm willing to read most things if it interests me. But I'm still more likely to want to read something that has one of the (many) pairings that I like instead of a pairing that I don't generally seek out. (Except for rare pairs, because those are often so incredibly different that they are fascinating in and of themselves and how an author can get them to work).

** I went through a lot of ships when I first started reading HP fanfiction, usually once I read most of the fics from a popular ship I moved on tired of it.

** I don't know how long it took because I didn't notice when it happened. It was a gradual thing... At first I binged on the pairing, but then it tapered off. At first it was "that summary doesn't sound interesting." Then I decided I "wanted to read something different." Then I just "didn't feel like" reading that pairing. Now I find I have no interest in the pairing at all, to the point that if it's a side pairing in a story I'm reading, I skip over any scenes they have together.

ETA: the pairing in question is Wolfstar.

** I used to really like Harry/Ginny stories. Honestly, the real reason that I stopped reading them is because it just became harder and harder to find new good stories. The point where I stopped reading Hinny was when I stumbled upon Harry Potter and Future's Past by Driftwood1965, which is Harmony. I was originally a bit unnerved by the whole thing, as I was not used to thinking of Harry and Hermione as a couple, seeing as I'd always imagined them as best friends, but by the time I finished with that story, I was very interested the ship. Another big part of my change of ships was re-watching Deathly Hallows and seeing the dance scene in the tent again. I was like, whoa. That's some chemistry.

** Remus/Tonks were my first OTP and really the OTP I have to credit for the start of what would be my fanfic obsession. I truthfully couldn't find any new things with them outside stories that tracked their relationship within canon. Which is understandable. It's a little harder to go outside the box with them, especially since they didn't get a lot of time as a couple in the books and/or movies. So that might've been a few months?

I used to also like the other canon pairings that showed up in the Remus/Tonks stories but also stopped reading when I realized I didn't like the canon pairings. That was probably around when Deathly Hallows Part 2 came out. I wasn't happy with the epilogue.

Nowadays, for the most part, the pair doesn't matter as much as the story. I'll give anything a try as long as it's not the canon pairings and the story is interesting.

Either Harry saves her at the world cup, is immune to the allure and they fall in love to tge disapproval of all his friends because they believe she is taking advantage if him OR Bill was actually under the allure the entire time, they divorce and Harry saves the day with a Holiday in France.

That little ten percent with some original thought in between is amazing though
