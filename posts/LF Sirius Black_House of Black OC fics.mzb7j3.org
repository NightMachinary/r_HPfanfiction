*I messed up the title, but I'm hoping for Sirius Black daughter fic or daughter of the Black family fic.

I'll take any and all recs! (Just not ones that have been abandoned for years tho...)

Summary- In a post Wizarding War world families are torn to shreds and in the middle of piecing themselves back together the Black Family, notoriously wicked for generations, is the target of Minister Fudge's wrath for a scapegoat to make it all go away. Only what he never expected was the uproar the youngest assumed dead member of the clan would unleash on him to ensure he rights all he has done against her family. Though soon enough she learns Fudge is only the tip of the iceberg, much bigger wicked fish are circling in those waters waiting for her to slip.

337k words. And it's in 2nd POV (some people have been put off by that dk why) not a copy and paste of the books it adds more and does some world building and included a third Wizarding War after Voldy dies. :)

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.
