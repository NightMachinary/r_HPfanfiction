Let me explain. I recently discovered Sink Into Your Eyes and I love it. This made me consider writing my own english fanfiction. I am not a native speaker, I have written a lot in italian but I'd like to start writing in english because Harry Potter is written in english and the story loses something if translated in other languages imho. Anyway what do you think is the best way to avoid embarassing mistakes? I read about beta reader but how exactly does that work? keep in mind I'm a total noob regarding the fanfiction world. I don't want to spam what I write to anybody, but I'd like to publish something that doesn't makes the eyes of the reader bleed. I just wnat to hit their heart until they fall asleep crying.


** Beta readers can be kind of finicky. In my own experience, you can convince someone to edit a chapter or two before they fall off the face of the earth. What works best for me is putting up some of your fic (getting your readers invested) and then asking your readers if they'd be interested in helping out. Someone might bite. You could also reach out to italian hp fic writers and see if they'd be interested (you can sort fanfics on ffnet by language).

Otherwise, there's no harm in just putting up whatever it is you write. Your writing is coherent -- which is more than I can say for a lot of fics out there. There are also word editors (e.g. prowritingaid.com) which can act as a beta, but use them with a hefty mound of salt. They're nowhere near perfect.

Honestly, if you really can't find someone to look over your work I'd be happy to edit your first chapter or two. Just shoot me a pm.

*** Thanks but I'm not quite ready to share what I've written so far. I guess I'll gut put something up Fanfiction.net when I feel I have something worth reading and we'll see!

** Italian fic writer here, and I write mostly in English, so let me give you my two cents on the subject.

First of all: I absolutely recommend taking the step from writing in Italian to writing in English for two major reasons:

One: you'll find that the international fandom is obviously way bigger and more 'alive' than the Italian one and you'll get more reviews, kudos, comments. Your fics will reach more people and that's always a gratifying thing!

Two: you learn by trial and error, you learn by doing stuff, and you'll find that after a while, your English has improved immensely! Writing fics (not only HP related) in English has been really great for my writing abilities: learning how to play with words in a language that's not your native one is fun, challenging and can give you a whole new perspective on writing.

That said, let's get down to some little advice. First of all, maybe it's obvious but I'll say it anyway: your browser has the option to select spellchecking in English (even differentiating between British, American, Australian...). Do that. It's very useful and it saves a lot of time. Even native speakers sometimes need a little help with spellcheck, and although it is not a foolproof tool, you'll save a lot of trips form page to dictionary and back.

Wordreference is a lifesaver, not only as an online dictionary, but also, with the forums, as an invaluable tool to understand and translate idioms and finding the right expression. But try to stay away from the dictionary as much as you can: use the words you know! Try and squeeze all the English you know by heart, don't go to the dictionary for every single term you're not sure about: go with a synonym you know better! find a different turn of phrase, experiment with what you know and what you already use without help. With time, with reading and with practice, your /language baggage/ will grow, I promise!

You can try translating some of your work in English, at first, I started that way. You'll see how harder that is than actually writing in English from the start and you'll find yourself re-writing paragraphs directly in English, changing stuff, adapting to the new syntax. Geek out on idioms and grammar: it's tremendous fun!

Read in English: fanfic, for fun and profit, since you'll be able to pick up all the tools you'll need for that particular job, but also to learn what you like and what you want to avoid when you sit down and write your own. But also read novels, plays, poetry, in English. It helps a lot to broaden your vocabulary and style and it's also really enjoyable.

Don't fret and try. As soon as inspiration strikes, open a new page and get down to writing! See what comes out, and how it comes out, and don't worry too much about being perfect, 'cause nobody is. I've seen tons of grammar mistakes and spelling horrors in fics by native English speakers, I've seen poor use of the same old metaphors and cliches, I've seen bad writing all around, regardless of language barriers: the only way you'll improve is by trying, getting your work out there, eventually, and then see what happens.

Before I gave up and decided to publish my first fic in English, I looked for betas far and wide, but it was never a successful relationship. If you want someone to proofread your work, just to be sure everything is ok and nothing truly horrible as been overlooked, try and find someone you already know - even if just from fandom chats - and trust a little. If you find a beta, but then you realize despite their good faith, they don't like the same stuff you do or are not actually that strong with their grammar and spelling... well, the purpose of the whole thing gets defeated, doesn't it?

If you can't find a beta, go on anyway! There is no rule that says that you /have/ to beta a fic before you publish. Ask for suggestions and pointers in the AN, if you want, and be certain that, if the plot is interesting, the characters captivating, if the story is any good, your readers will overlook small linguistic snafus and will be glad to help you correct them!

** Outside of using spellcheck from your favorite text processor, maybe using something like [[https://www.grammarly.com][Grammarly]] might be useful for you. I'm no native speaker either, and having this as an addition to the built-in spellchecker is very useful.

***** It really prettily useful. I found out that the major problem with my writing is punctuation, and I didn't expect that. There's also an add on for Word which works quite well

** Don't worry about it as long as you put a disclaimer in the intro about not being fluent in English and are willing to improve on feedback.

To get more of the said feedback you can thank those commentators in the A\N who point out your mistakes --- and fix the mistakes themselves, of course.

** go ahead and do it. if it matters, write a disclaimer 'not an English speaker, if you have a better word or phrasing send it to me, so I can learn" And then don't be offended at the idiot flamers, there will be a lot of people out there who will be glad to help you. start small, do a one shot or two, write something. When I wrote sme stories I needed proper Swiss names and phrases, and the readers came through, another valuable source is there are a lot of Brit-pickers who will help you phrase something into appropriate English, or Scots as need be. Have fun. Share with us what you write!

** My advice as a fellow non-native speaker is to listen a lot, read a lot and learn a lot. Just read a couple of the better fanfics or better, read some of the books. This way you train yourself in reading (and writing) proper English.

*** I actually read a lot in english. I just didn't care much about trying to learn something (until now), I was just following the story. I mean, when I read or listen something I'm like "cool ok I understood everything!!" but when it comes to "Would I be able to use the same style/grammar /structure to write something myself?" sometimes I don't even know where to begin.
