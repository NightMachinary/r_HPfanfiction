** Have you heard of Rise of the Drackens? Its over a hundred chapters long. Harry is a dragon like creature and there is some good world building.

Harry's soulmate is a centaur, Bane's son. They have a very sweet and interesting relationship. It's platonic, I guess. The series is wonderful and fascinating and I love it a lot.

  The centaur tilted his head. ‚ÄúAnd what is a human boy doing riding a thestral into the Forest?‚Äù‚ÄúI'm going to visit a friend. Well, a friend of a friend. Sort of. It's a snake in the castle.‚ÄùIn which Harry meets a garden snake, discovers magic, and sets off for a better life.
