I've seen in a few fanfics that I have read that Sirius Black is sometimes paired with Marlene McKinnon during the later time-frame of their Hogwarts years and up until either Marlene is killed in a battle, or Sirius is sent to Azkaban.

Does anybody have knowledge of any fanfics with the two as the main characters?

EDIT: To my knowledge, this is also not canon and seems to be a fan trend.


** While the relationship isn't the sole focus of the fic, linkffn(9469064) and it's sequels seem to fit the bill.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Lily Evans in no way fancied James Potter, that was a fact. The pair becoming friends was shock enough but Lily having an actual crush on him? Hell would have to freeze over first...at least that's what she thought.
