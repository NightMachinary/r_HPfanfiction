:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
What I remember most clearly is that Harry tells McGonagall in the career discussion that he wants to be a librarian? and this entails looking for artifacts and curating them or something like that. It may have been an !IndyHarry and I'm pretty sure it was also Smart!Harry (It has come to be one and the same lately, hasn't it?).

So yes, I remember that he wanted to be some sort of wizard Indiana Jones and it was implied that Madam Pince was that level of badass.


** That's definitely a more literal take on the concept of Indy!Harry...

** It's kinda abandoned but the setting is neat.

Regulus didn't die, closing the "oh wait Kreacher can apparate him out too" plothole. But he still ends up in a coma until summer before fifth year. While catching up on things he decides that if Sirius isn't doing his job as Harry's godfather by looking out for him and teaching him what he needs to know, then his secretly not dead brother should step in.

Magical tomes tend to become sentient over time, magical librarians have to be competent cursebreakers more or less as a prerequisite plus archeology needed to hunt up books from tombs and dead cities, plus all the various research and magical knowledge and such needed to catalog all the books and help people find what they need.

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

*** That's the one!!\\
It's not surprising it's from cywscross given that everything I've read from them, completed or not, has left me wanting for more.\\
Shame we don't get more on this story, it was shaping up nicely.

** I never understood why Harry would make a career out of taking orders from the same ministry that abused him so badly. It's like Harry has Stockholm Syndrome.

*** Well, when you stick close to canon (I usually don't) he had only three options as I see it.

One being an Auror, he was very good at defense and he had previous experience in "hunting dark wizards" and life-threatening situations.

Two being a DADA teacher, again very good at defense and previous experience, this time the DA.

And three professional quidditch, not much else to say here.

So yes, he was very talented at flying and defense and not much else. Added to that the not so healthy state of mind a child/teen with his life and no support system would have and it's pretty accurate that he would go for a career in law enforcement or the military (children that suffered abuse and other forms of trauma sometimes end in those careers for the rigid structure they tend to provide them with)

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
