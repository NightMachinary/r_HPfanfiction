I am considering writing a fic which incorporates sympathetic magic as a major plot point, but I am having issues with specific examples. Stuff like the protean charm and voodoo dolls are all well and good, but anything else like breaking a mirror with Voldemort's face on it to give him bad luck feels too abstract for the story in general. Can you guys think of a middle ground? Not too concrete, but not too abstract?


** My advice would not to make it an independent branch of magic but rather incorporate sympathetic elements into specific Charms and Curses within the pre-existing body of magical knowledge. Canon already has some pretty wacky and interesting spell mechanics, from hiding secrets inside souls to using happy memories to conjure spiritual guardians. A bit of sympathy here and there for specific spells would not feel out of place - but creating an entire new branch of magic would.

It's similar to "elemental magic", really. There's plenty of magic in HP which is based around the traditional elements, but making elemental magic its own separate branch feels jarring.

As for specific ideas, potions might be an interesting direction to go here. I've felt for a while now that the fanfic community has got potions all wrong with the comparison to cooking. I much prefer to think of a potion as just a different way to cast a spell - you have ingredients instead of a wand, and a preparation method instead of an incantation and wand movements, but it's still the wizard casting magic, using external tools and representa to symbolise the complex combination of concepts and powers involved in the final result. The way fanfic introduces "ritual magic" is kinda redundant, because it already exists and is called "potions".

So... basically the Potions theory of Shadow of Angmar? I can dig that.

And the cooking comparison has always been bad. Chemistry is much closer, I would say. But that may be my inherent bias peeking through.

*** Though a big part of the "ritual magic" I read about goes away from the occult and into the divine and sacred, which is a big difference in terms of "where" the magic comes from.

So instead of incantation and the combination of concepts, you have prayer and sacrifice to cast magic (or in this case, ask for magic to be cast). Even though your comparison isn't wrong, I wouldn't chunk both of these in the same boat simply because of the sacred character that kind of swings along with the word and concept "ritual".

Not really, maybe there are a couple charms that produce the elements, but they do not help control the element, decrease and increase its size, or make it 'special' like FiendFyre. Dumbledore's fire rope spell only further proves that elemental magic is likely its own field (as does Grindelwald's display against Newt in the subway).

Not too sure about this either. Ritual Magic is more about channeling ambient magical energies, or magic from certain things/beings (hence most rituals involved are seen as evocation rituals etc...) Potions is just mixing ingredients to make a potion, it's like Chemistry or Cooking, more than it is like Spell Casting. There's also the fact that the preparation method for a potion can be changed, but if you change anything in a spell it's unlikely to work (remember when Flitwick told the story about the wizard that got the incantation wrong and conjured a buffalo onto his chest).

** In "Patron" I just used sympathetic magic as an alternative form of targetting spells, not a new school of magic or such.

** Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches has a pretty good exploration of sympathetic magic.

** I feel like Sympathetic Magic is just that though, it's niche, why would anyone use it rather than general rituals or the practical magic we see in canon? I guess that the first step would be giving it a use that no other field of magic can provide.

** The Name Of The Wind by Patrick Rothfuss has a system that should inspire. It is also a fantastic bit of fiction
