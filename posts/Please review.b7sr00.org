I recently made my First work and would like some feedback and input. There is a google form, but if you want to answer blind, It's here.

Summary: Harry Potter was imprisoned for 40 years following the death of Cedric Diggory. Neville Longbottom finally managed to eradicate all of the Horcruxes save the one in Harry's scar. After negotiations, Harry removes the shard from his scar. Escaping Azkaban, Harry acquires the Deathly Hallows and rids himself of the many compulsions and blocks on him. Ending Chapter 2, Harry gets an idea.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
