Was listening to Mugglecast and their recap of Half Blood Prince. They are on “The Secret Riddle” chapter and asked the question: “Where did Dumbledore get the mouth organ that he showed Harry from?” They suggested that he tracked down Billy Stubbs from the orphanage and discovered that Stubbs was a famous blues musician who played a mouth harp. My head canon now is that when Dumbledore talked to Billy and asked him about Tom that he said:

“Tom Riddle? Yeah I know him. Haven't thought about him in years though. We were in the orphanage together and that kid was bad news. Killed my rabbit....now I couldn't prove it, mind you, but I suspected it. Y'know come to think of it I kind of owe my musical success to him I. A twisted way. See.....not only did he kill my rabbit he stole my mouth organ. That was one of the few things I had at the orphanage so I was really ticked off. When he left I finally got it back....burnt up and broken all to hell but darned if I didn't teach myself to play that thing clear as a bell. Practiced my butt off but because of that I could darn near play about any song on any mouth harp...so.. I guess you could say....Thanks Tom Riddle youbrotten piece of garbage.”


** The best part about this is you're unlikely to read anything that gets near conflicting with this because it remains unaddressed. So, your head canon applies universally.

** As a kid I always thought a "mouth organ" was a retainer, for some reason.
