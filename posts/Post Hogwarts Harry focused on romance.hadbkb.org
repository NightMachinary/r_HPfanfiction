I've recently read a fic with Pansy and loved it, so I'm looking for new fics.

I'd prefer it if it's not Hermione or Ginny. I read slash too but not with age difference (no Snape etc)

Please no bashing.


** linkffn(Grow Young With Me)

In which Harry is the dadliest dad who ever dadded. Also smooches. Definitely 100% no Ginny on account of reasons.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  After the final battle. A walk through the castle will shift the destiny of several people. Harry once again leaps without looking trying to save the life of a Slytherin witch he barely knows even after six years of school. The aftermath of his decision will have significant ramifications for those involved. EWE - please be aware that this Fic will go to some dark places.
