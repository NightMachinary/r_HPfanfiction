[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11923164/1/I-Know-Not-and-I-Cannot-Know-Yet-I-Live-and-I-Love][I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love]] is one of the best fanfiction I've ever come across and probably has the most canonical characterization of Snape. It's about the friendship that develops between Severus Snape and Luna Lovegood through the Hogwarts years. And I know that this description sounds offputting but it's presented believably and poignantly.

This really goes into the essence of Snape and Luna's characters and why they behave the way they do. It does not apologize for Snape's behaviour and he is still nasty and cruel without taking away the tragedy in his character. Luna is very hard to get right in fanfiction but here you can really see her uniqueness, compassion and empathy shine through.

More importantly, it's a story about two characters whom you cannot ever imagine interacting amicably forming a beautiful friendship, and how that bond affects both of them.

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.
