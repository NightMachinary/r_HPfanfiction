** Haha, for me, the Cassandra Clare Draco trilogy. It was one of the first things if read in the fandom and thought it was great and basically got me into fanfiction. It opened my eyes to the possibility of canon divergence, AU and longfic. I tried re-reading it about 7 years later or more as I had good memories of it but had forgotten the story but it was so cringey I couldn't get that far into even the first story. As someone who routinely reads all sorts of fic and has low standards, I was genuinely surprised that it felt that cringey. I think it's probably just the dissonance between what I remember vs the evidence in front of me. I spoke to a friend of mine, who independently did the same thing and tried to reread the series, and she reported the exact same thing. Bad times! This spurred me on to read things I had favorited from the early 2000s on ffn and lj etc and while some are a little too melodramatic for my currently tastes a decent number of the stories still totally held up so alls well that ends well!

*** The dissonance is real, but not in the way you think.

Cassie Claire had a system where she would place quotes in her work, from popular fantasy books and TV shows (esp. Buffy) of the time. Readers would point out the quotes and where they originated and earn points!

Then one reader noticed that a passage in the Draco Trilogy reminded him of another fantasy book he had recently read. And after some investigation he found out that it was not just a single passage; whole paragraphs, and in some cases whole pages, had been ripped from fantasy literature and mangled into fitting into her Harry Potter fanfiction. In short, plagiarism.

This is why some parts of her work seemed so awesome - I remember especially Harry and Draco infiltrating some castle - and other parts were terribly bland. And this is why the Draco triology slowly disappeared from the internet, it used to be posted in a thousand different sites.

I won't deny that I enjoyed her stories (plagiarised mess that they were), but the record should be set straight, for posterity.

** The Denarian series. It still has some good stuff like the Dumbledore characterisation, but too many negatives. I enjoyed Harry's characterisation a few years back, but I find it cringe-y now, and the lack of much needed character development is off-putting. Also, the action scenes are too long and too frequent. It feels like the author is jerking himself off. Finally, the writing is somewhat rough, especially in the early parts.

*** The action was too much. There was a real chance for much more interesting character development: the Harry-Amaris awkward parent relationship, a possible Harry/Amanda pairing or friendship without the turn-her-evil stuff, the creepy Harry-Mavis lust/hate relationship, and of course more in-depth development between Meciel and Harry.

But instead we got more fight scenes and a refusal from the author to let Harry reform/see the light. I think DLP was pushing too hard for a Dark Harry without realizing that Harry developing a conscience would be far more complex and rewarding than silly magical battles.

The whole Amaris arc was amazing.

** Harry Crow by Robst. I am embarrassed to say that I read all 700k words or so of it when I first started reading fanfiction a few years ago. I tried to read it again a few weeks ago and I couldn't stop laughing at how it seemed to hit every clich√© right from the get go. The sad thing is that I wish I was so easily entertained now.

** Oh HPMOR... I loved it when I read it, blindly, fresh into fanfiction. It subverted so many canon things for the first time, and I slogged through the mangled philosophy as if it were real. I still have fond emotions for it. I was crushed when it ended; I can still visualize the final epilogue in my mind.

And then I read a bit more of the fandom. And I realized and learned how bad it really was. The obvious self-insert, the cringy Patronus stuff, the lack of a real scientific method, very little character development, having the bad guy spew the author's own philosophy, time-turner exhaustion...

But I still remember how much excitement I had while plowing through the huge word count. It was so /cool/.

There's something to be said for reading something without cynicism. I took everything at face value and was completely immersed. It's a bad fic, yes, but I understand utterly why it has a dedicated fan base and gets recommended so often (outside of this sub) to new readers.

Maybe someday some author will take a stab at a better version.

** /Dagger and Rose/ by Perspicacity. (No link because I don't think anyone should read it.)

I'm not kidding, either.

Same goes for most everything else I've ever written. While I'm sure I loved the stories at the time, in a couple years, after the new-ink smell has faded and the beer goggles are gone, I find the stuff utterly cringe-worthy. (I suspect I'm not alone in this, though would be interested in hearing if others feel similarly.)

Absolutely amazing when it was written especially since Joe was fairly young when he started it. I wanted to re-read it a few years back and could only make a few chapters as I really can't stand all of the angst. The magic was phenomenal as was the over arcing plot.
