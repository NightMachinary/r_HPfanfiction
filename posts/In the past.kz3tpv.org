:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's a fic from tom riddle POV, he was still in hogwarts and harry attacks him but Dumbledore saved him, we never see Harry's perspective and I think harry was dating a foreign witch, tom hits him with a death curse at the end but am not sure he dies, anyone knows?

#+begin_quote
  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
