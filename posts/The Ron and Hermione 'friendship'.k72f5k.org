I've read ALOT of stories with Harry not associated with Ron and Hermione but somehow the pair almost always manage to pair up, whether friendly or romantically. It's odd though. Without Harry there would be no /them/. Either Hermione would have died/seriously injured or because of Ron snapping at her, Hermione would probably have avoided him like the plague. Without Harry i honestly believe the two would have remained housemates but nothing more... what do you think?


** The thing about Ron and Hermione is that they don't run in the same circles. They don't have anything in common, and their personalities conflicted often enough that they probably wouldn't have been friends on their own. What Harry did was give them something in common until such point that they get past their own differences.

While the friendship is unlikely, there are other Harry-like circumstances that can happen without Harry. For example, Malfoy can give them a common enemy, Neville is a mutual friend. It can even be mission-related like bonding over stuff from the Voldemort missions. The key is to make them spend enough time together that they get over their initial dislike and find the mutual respect.

I agree that they probably wouldn't have been as close as they were with Harry banding them together, but there are ways where they could end up as friends.

**** It is unlikely that they had found a similar situation to get pass their differences without the troll. But even if unlikely, those circumstances exist, as pointed out by previous commenter. And you make it sound as all of those events required Harry. They did not. Other events without Harry could have happened to pull them together.

Also, the notion that the girl who considered being expelled a fate worse then death is so pathetic that she would leave just because The Great Harry Potter Sir is not around is practically bashing.

Dude even if only Ron appeared there and did the same stuff that he made, Hermione would have still taken the responsibility with McGonagall. Harry is not this open person who talks to someone and makes them open up, that's fandom. What made Hermione open up was the troll incident in itself, not Harry. It was her decision to give these boys a chance after what she saw. If she hadn't done that, Harry and Ron exchange polite nods with Hermione and they keep their separate ways.

***** Without Harry?? Ron was the one who chased her away. Quirrelmort would still have let the troll in. The troll went to the bathroom independent of Harry. She'd have met the troll. She'd still freeze. Unless Ron realizes where she is and decides to rescue her on his own, she'd die/be beaten unconscious. And whatever /she/ would think of leaving, her parents sure as hell wouldn't stand for it. I find your suggestions that if she left it'd be because of a lack of Harry and not because her parents care enough not to let her die almost offensive

********** Does it?

Pretty much every time Hermione and Ron fight pre-Troll, Hermione is also fighting Harry. It's Ron and Harry sneaking out after curfew. It's Harry and Ron breaking rules. It's Harry getting a broom and on the quidditch team, after disobeying madam Hooch.

Without Harry, Hermione looses a lot of her reasons to attack Ron. Without Harry, there's not much reason for her and Ron to interact. She certainly doesn't have as many reasons to stick her nose in Ron'a business. Without their previously established animosity, why would they fight in charms?

************ Two things:

- Ron lashing out was a culmination of two months of Hermione's hectoring, which, as the grandparents point out, was largely due to Harry.

- Hermione actually thought they were friends---because lecturing others and offering unsolicited advice is how early-canon Hermione expresses friendship. (If you don't believe me, consider that she actually thought that giving them silent treatment would be some kind of punishment: that only makes sense if she assumed they cared about her.) Ron's words disabused her of that notion.

  Now, get rid of those preexisting notions, and Ron's words don't have nearly the same impact.

************ I am not sure where our disagreement is at this point. I don't think a friendship between Ron and Hermione is particularly likely. Heck, maybe they'll experience physical attraction towards each other sooner if they don't think of each other as friends.

Heck, how about:

- Hermione, without any friends in Gryffindor, focuses on her studies, particularly Trasnfiguration as she was originally most interested in that, constantly pestering McGonagall for additional lessons. She sometimes studies with some Ravenclaws, to mutual benefit, but she is generally a loner.
- Ron, lacking an outlet for his ambitions (as seen in the Mirror of Erised), ends up parlaying his easygoing nature and keen strategic mind into becoming a wheeler-and-dealer---a younger Slughorn, if Gryffindor.
- A few years later, Hermione, the antisocial Transfiguration mistress, and Ron, the Merchant of Gryffindor, find themselves confronting a growing Death Eater Youth presence coming out of Slytherin. In their originally reluctant collaboration, they begin to develop feelings for each other.

Look, I do pretty of time travels and have wondered about stuff that can and should go different all the time. Almost everything can happened differently at some point. However, there are things more likely to occur than others.

Ron talking bad about Hermione after being paired with her is one of them.

Ron is comfortable complaining to almost anyone. He would complain to Seamus and Dean or even Neville in a state of being annoyed as he was (which, if I recall correctly, at least one of them was around when he said this in cannon actually). He would complain to the twins, Lee, any housemate, even Ernie or some other boy he was in speaking terms with about Malfoy or Snape in general. Ron is a guy who is not afraid of talking about others, especially when he thinks the others can't hear him (as he thought in this case).

In this particular scene, he wasn't looking for his best friend, he was looking for support. Someone who would agree with him about this girl being unbearable.

It is way more likely to have Ron react like this without Harry than Harry getting picked seeker. Now that was really a chain of coincidences.

*** First year, before the drama of the books, Ron and Hermione's interaction can leave a lasting impression - after all Ron did make her cry. To Hermione he could be a bully, she's probably dealt with teasing before, Ron probably wouldn't have bothered to apologize and just avoid Hermione since he did make her cry and probably either is uncomfortable or doesn't care. Hermione could possibly ignore him right after. Have a good cry and promise to never deal with that 'Dumb Weasley' ever again. Of course this is if Harry wasn't around or hadn't tried to save her. Without the troll she would have been left in the bathroom. I can totally see Hermione avoiding Ron and Ron probably not caring or realizing he's being snubbed.

**** The reason Hermione had the reaction she did to Ron's words was precisely because he /wasn't/ bullying her.

As of the Charms class, Hermione actually thinks that after their shared experiences they are friends. Lecturing and offering unsolicited advice is how early-canon Hermione expresses goodwill and friendship, after all. This isn't just speculation: notice that she actually thinks that giving them the silent treatment is some kind of punishment, and that only makes sense if she assumes that they care about her opinion and desire company.

Now, Ron's words and Harry's tacit agreement rapidly disabuse her of the notion that they are friends. She realises that actually, all this time, she has been antagonising them.

Now, she has no idea exactly what she did wrong (because all this time she thought she was being a good friend) and, worse yet, she doesn't know how to even begin fixing the problem---which for someone like her would be intolerable. /That's/ something to cry all day about.

Now, of course, some of this is speculation, particularly the precise details in the last paragraph, but I think the big picture is about right.

*** Just to elaborate on my previous comment.

Ron and Hermione, as written, have a lot of romantic chemistry to them. Call it sexual tension if you like. Even people who are intense shippers of alternate pairings recognize it and use the "Romione had a lot of youthful chemistry but didn't work in the long run" approach.

Now the thing is that they are oil and water. They are attracted to each other but their first impressions are pretty much what the other wants to stay clear of. So yes, in a world without soulmates, chance encounters and circumstances are not a given, and there are many ways Ron and Hermione didn't end up with each other.

Now the catalyst wasn't Harry but the troll fight and what it meant as single point of merging these 2 characters. For one, Ron isn't polite not he appears to value knowledge, which is totally against Hermione. Hermione gives an impression of being bossy and boring, which Ron is not interested on, because of Percy. The troll let's each other see another part of them that combines just the things needed for them to give each other a chance to get to know the other more deeply.

The troll fight starts with Ron being impolite. But it puts him in a complicated spot of regret. He is not the kind to apologize easily or be mindful of others feelings, but he is put in a position where he clearly sees that his actions caused suffering and that he was the one to cause it. Then the plot makes him realize that because of him the other party is in danger. So the plot puts 2 parts of Ron against each other the impolite and childish against the courage. Because he totally gets to the point where not owning up for his acts would mean that he is a coward (leaving Hermione to her own). And, at the end, Ron is rough and impolite, but he is more noble and brave than impolite. So yes, the situation for him to decide between rude coward and mindful brave had to happen for him to make this step. Especially at this immature age.

Hermione is a consequence of Ron's actions. She is put in a position where Ron's actions make her see something she is not used to in her nature. To being wrong. Hermione had already made her judgement of who Ron was and how he wasn't worth it. He was all what she was against. Then he appears there. Risks his life for her. And, driven by guilt or not, Ron still appeared. He proves her that she had not figured him out yet. Then he even takes blame. Maybe being in trouble was not that big of a deal for Ron, but it was for Hermione. She can't stand the idea of being in trouble with a professor, and here was Ron, putting himself in trouble for her. That's what makes her take the blame. Her own regret and realizing what these two boys were doing for her.

It just spins from there. Hermione is able to see the benet to Ron's lay back attitude, even if she doesn't share it. Ron can see the benefits of knowledge, even if he is not willing to sacrifice other things to get it. Hermione appreciates the humor and impulsiveness, different from hers. Ron appreciates Hermione's resolve, compassion and hardwork, different from him. Hermione sees Ron craving for the spotlight, which she shares, but is less afraid to seize. Ron sees Hermione's courage, which he shares and comes easier we to him in first instance (in his feeling of not being indispensable).

So yeah. These two already complemented each other. Only needed to get pass the first impression. If there is another event or person capable of giving each other the chance, I don't see why they couldn't be together there as well.

They don't need a long friend to keep them together. They needed an event to allow each other to see beyond first impressions in the other.

They didn't need Harry. They needed something that let them see more of the other.

** I think they kinda ‘need' Harry to be friends, and Harry needs Hermione at one point, because both would be too stubborn to make up on their own in GoF. Meanwhile, Harry and Hermione don't really go well on their own either; Harry seems frequently more annoyed about her anxieties (mostly about exams) and general stuff than understanding, and Ron manages to get her out of her own head sometimes. And really, Harry and Ron tend to encourage each other's worst tendencies; with Ron Harry barely does his homework, they both charge into situations and both of them are very very stubborn and prideful. Hermione mags them to do their homework every once in a while, researches the monsters they're up against, and in seventh year probably saves their lives with her spellwork and strategy - something Harry nor Ron seem to bother with, considering Harry doesn't recognize most of the spells. When Ron's gone, though, while Harry and Hermione are of course still friendly, he cannot comfort her or anything like that (don't blame him, really, since he probably didn't learn that with the Dursley's), showing why they kinda need Ron (apart from saving Harry's life and all that)
