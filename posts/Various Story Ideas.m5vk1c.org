I come up with a lot of ideas randomly, but have trouble putting them to text. So here's some prompts for whoever wants them.

-during the shrieking shack scene in DH, all of the Hallows are there. So are Riddle, Snape and Potter. These three gain the memories of the Peverell brothers, following the Dumbledore is death/they are a metaphor theory.

-Turns out surviving a killing curse purges you of everything. Vaccines, Blocks, binding, potions. The first time it wasnt much, just a common block found in small children-that when released had the entire nursery levitating. The second time however, reveals a lot more.

-Stories of various paintings/ghosts---fat lady is gryffindors wife, HoH quarters are guarded by that founders spouse, etc

-"the bat and the toad, a hogwarts love story" crack snape/umbridge

If course, if you know stories with these ideas, I'd gladly take suggestions
