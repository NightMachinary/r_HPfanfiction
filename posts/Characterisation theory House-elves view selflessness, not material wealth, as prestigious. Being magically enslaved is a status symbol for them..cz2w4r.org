Think about money for a second. It's important, right? You need it for food, for petrol, for utilities, to buy new stuff, pay for whatever.\\
So, the more money you have, the better. People who are really rich are considered 'successful', even if they didn't earn their money fairly. And rich people will spend their money on stuff like fancy cars and fancy houses and fancy jewellery and fancy restaurants and whatnot, paying far more than they need to because the expensive option is a sign of prestige.

But with house-elves, they can cast a variety of wandless magic, teleport wherever, apparently hear their name from anywhere (speak of the devil?), and otherwise do a lot of things that Super!Harry is jealous of. So, they don't really need money or other material wealth nearly as much as humans do.\\
So, what if (most) house-elves have a culture where the prestigious thing isn't to be wealthy, but to be selfless? In a 'give all you have to the poor' or ascetic way, considering working towards the welfare of others not just a good deed, but the kind of distinction that makes elves upper-class and cool and popular?

Following that thought, it might be that house-elves choose to forego clothing and possessions, and forego their freedom in favour of magically-bound slavery, because doing so is considered a status symbol amongst them. So that other elves can take one look and go 'that guy's really dedicated to providing for others, I'm jealous'.

This could explain the Hogwarts house-elves' frightened reaction to Hermione when she suggests that they should be taking money and holidays and clothing; from the perspective that their commitment to slavery and such are status symbols, what Hermione is saying to them would roughly translate to "You rich people should trash everything you own and live in the street! It's your right to be poor!"\\
Dobby is obviously an exception with his insistence on receiving (a little) pay and hoarding clothes, but considering his abuse at the hands of the Malfoys, that he'd value freedom and material wealth and the right to choose for himself over helping others is pretty understandable.

If you're happy being a slave, maybe you're just THAT selfless. Makes sense. But that's trying to explain it post-factum.

But if you're THAT selfless, there are better way to sacrifice yourself and help others than enslaving yourself to bigots. Maybe you would go enslave yourself to Hogwarts or St Mungo's, or some other cause. But why to old families? I'd bet the old families had some hand in that decision.

Who knows, though we don't see it in canon, maybe when the world was less civilised, house-elves went out to fight dangerous magical creatures to protect innocents (assuming they had the ascetic-selflessness culture back then, they might not have).\\
Or maybe, the house-elves in Hogwarts are there for the same reason as the students; to learn magic and skilled jobs so that they can go out and do things more world-changing than housekeeping. Like, they might become ninja doctors!

When she's 14 and starting to get really enthusiastic about SPEW, this is quite possibly the first time she's ever had to think about a (very) non-human life form that's nevertheless both as sentient and as sapient as humans are. *Of course* she's going to bring a lot of her own existing preconceptions to how she thinks about that, both the good/useful ones AND the flawed ones.

Plus...even if she DID read up, what are the chances that a text written by a wizard author could tell her what she needed to know about house elf status symbols or the things that elves valued? Wizards are *incredibly bad* at considering the point of view of any of the other intelligent species. They infuriate the goblins with their ignorance twice before breakfast. The centaurs as well. And the merfolk. A wizarding author, comfortably convinced of his own superiority, would bring a set of assumptions that were just as flawed.

It would take a very thoughtful, very thorough and extremely open minded wizard to start to write such a book.

Can house-elves write? Can they use something like a Quick-Quotes Quill (without the Skeeter flourishes, obviously) to take dictation as they speak? The only way for house elf cultural mores to be discussed respectfully might be for it to come from an elf directly - an unusually outspoken one, or one with a REALLY trusting relationship with the humans of the household, so they could trust that they wouldn't be punished or otherwise suffer if the text was released.

There's also the part where house elves are not human. They may not always think or behave in the same way humans do, and humans aren't always going to understand why that is or how they got to that point.

If a *wizard* interprets the relationship as “my house elf is happy to be a slave”, and the *house elf* interprets it as “I'm responsible for a whole tribe of weird hairless monkey pets, I have to look after them now”...who's right?

Your cat would think you were his slave, and happy to be so. You feed him, you clean up after him, you make a fuss of him when he complains. He scratches you or bites you occasionally, and yet you keep coming back. You'll even show off the worst injuries he gives you, or the biggest bills he racks up, as though they're impressive.

There's a lot your cat doesn't understand about how you work or why you do what you do. He'd also never think to ask about it, but just accept it as his due.

That's something to think about. Different species have different standards and probably an entire history to go with it, too bad people are bad at researching in the HP world.( and irl too) Also I might have something to do with the species instincts within its self. Think of Aragog for example, he's seems sentient and he probably is. But at the end of the day he's still a giant fucking spider. He told Harry and Ron first hand(leg?) that he would not let his young eat Hagrid(he raised him and probably but imprinted at some level) but when children (read: food) walk right up to them he will not deny them.

I'm sorry, but I don't seem to remember hearing that house elves are brainwashed anywhere in the seven canon books. I know the Hogwarts elves, Winky and literally every house elf not named Dobby appear to be Uncle Toms, but we are looking at a separate species of sapient living beings, not humans. I like Rowling, but we seriously do not know enough about house elves, their internal thoughts and their culture to make any kind of assumption about their species without sloppily using our own species to form preconceived notions.

****** So far I haven't seen a fic that properly makes house elves employees rather than slaves. To have a relationship that's not slavery or indentured servitude, it's not enough that house elves receive some form of pay (sustenance). They also need to be able to leave their master and find a new one. Ideally, they should be protected from abuse, and have equal rights to the extent possible.

Clearly, the house elf bond in HP doesn't allow the elf to break it end enforces absolute servitude. So there needs to be some legal mechanism to give them freedoms - i.e. their master is obliged to give them clothes if they request, and a somewhat effective enforcement mechanism. Ideally, active effort in society to develop a less restrictive version of the bond that still allows them to feed.

Finally, I'd argue house elves should receive more than just sustenance for the service they provide (unless their sustenance is actually burdensome for wizards, but that's never the case in fics). To compare, if a live-in maid is only paid with room and board, that'd be heavy exploitation if not outright slavery.

All in all, in a world where you need to be magically bound to servitude to survive, a society that doesn't approve of slavery should take steps to mitigate that. In none of the fics I've read such steps are shown.

This point really cuts to the heart of the issue. What trouble would there be if a house elf wanted to leave terrible wizards like the Malloy's? Legally and magically requiring the option to separate and find new options like other wizards or places like Hogwarts is ideal in this situation, as it provides a sapient species at least some degree of free will. Further points about working around the need for house elves to be tied down to wizards and some governing body to protect them provide the nuance that fics realistically dealing with the conundrum of house elves require to not be merely explaining away the iffy slave-like nature present in canon and fanon.

Really wish there were fics that discussed these matters, because house elves are really sketchy in canon. It's weird how Hermione and SPEW are treated as a joke by everyone despite fighting what in the seven books is visibly straight-up slavery. Would kill for Rowling to have either painted Hermione starkly in the right or have written in the nuance you have in your post.

******** Well, honestly canon's response to SPEW is not right, but it's realistic. In a society where slavery of house elves is obviously accepted, a 14 (15?) year old girl that decides to fight it alone wouldn't be very successful. Most of her peers would think her silly, because they've grown up with house elves. Those who haven't - Muggleborns, are a minority, and many would fall to peer pressure. Especially school children. Thus, the elf storyline is humorous not because Hermione's goals are ridiculed, but because she simply isn't very good at achieving them while still 14.

Maybe the acronym SPEW is in bad taste - I used to find it hard to believe that Hermione would choose such a name - and so though JKR forced it just to make fun of it.

********* *Society for Promoting the Employment of Women*

The Society for Promoting the Employment of Women (SPEW) was one of the earliest British women's organisations.

The society was established in 1859 by Jessie Boucherett, Barbara Bodichon and Adelaide Anne Proctor to promote the training and employment of women. The Dictionary of Canadian Biography says Maria Rye was also a founding member. In its early years it was affiliated to the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, though formal connections between them were severed in 1889.

******** There's also the minor point that we don't know how a house elf would GET to those terrible wizards. They may be bought and sold, as human slaves were, but there's nothing in the books to suggest the existence of such an organised framework - no slave market, no ads in the Prophet saying “house elf for sale, enquire within”.

In the original folklore, the brownies that house elves are based on would often just *appear* in a household and start work, staying there until they were offended somehow/banished with clothes.

If this is what house elves do, then in a sense they do get to choose their people; they choose when and where to show up and the dodgy side of it where they're then stuck serving the terrible descendents of their original chosen humans indefinitely happens a bit later.

If this is NOT what house elves do...what's happening instead?

Beings that have been bred to behave in a certain way, presumably selective breeding on horrific criteria.

** Prestige based on "how much can you give away" rather than "how much do you have" is a thing. Consider how a host can show off to the guests by the lavishness of their meal and service.

However, I don't think it can be properly applied to the compulsory nature of house elf bonds. Surely, the most selfless act of all, and therefore most prestigious in this system, would be to provide a family with all the same services while /not/ being magically compelled to do so.

*** True enough, the notion I'm going with here though is that house-elves following this culture willingly embrace magical bondage as a kind of statement.\\
They don't have to be enslaved in order to work, so trading in their personal freedom for essentially zero gain is a way of saying 'look at how committed I am to making the lives of others better'.

** Yeah no. Sorry, but no attempts to rationalize slavery is ever going to be good. Because slavery is, itself, fucking horrible. Get it? You sound like a white guy trying to rationalize black slavery back in the day. It's just never going to work.

*** Well, yeah. /Taking/ someone's freedom away from them and making them work /by force/ is wrong.\\
And even if someone gives away their personal freedom for whatever reason, it's wrong to abuse or exploit them just because the opportunity exists.

Or, in more specific terms, even if house-elves in general seek to be magically bound because it raises their status in the eyes of other elves, it's still wrong to forcibly enslave one.\\
And if you do have a house-elf, it's definitely not okay to mistreat him/her like the Malfoys did to Dobby.
