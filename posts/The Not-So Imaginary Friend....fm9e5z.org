I'll freely admit the inspiration for this came from Ella and Azrael, from Lucifer.

For as long as he could remember, Harry has had an imaginary friend that 'grew up' with him. No-one else seemed to be able to see her however, and his mentioning of it to his Aunt had him scolded at best.

Unbeknownst to Harry, however, Arabella Figg's kneazles refused to go anywhere near the boy and she herself felt as though she were being watched by something, as she often 'babysat' him. That any snacks she left out or gave to the boy often had two sets of teeth-marks often unnerved her, too.

When he was 9, an 'imperiused' Death Eater 'victim' saw Harry in public and tried to abduct him... only to come down with a Final Destination-style case of broken neck and a wand-to-the-brain as he tried to hone in on him.

When Harry's Letter comes, he unintentionally terrifies the goblins in Gringotts, who can sense /something/ is there with them, and they practically throw money at him to get him to leave.

He arrives at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore is relieved that he's a happy, chatty child, if a bit eccentric.

And then he sees the looming, raven-winged girl next to him, that no-one else can apparently see, and he almost has a heart-attack right there and then.

Yeah, turns out only those who are about to die or who owns one of the Hallows can see the goddamn /Angel of Death/... who's best buds with the Boy-Who-Lived.

Surprisingly enough to his colleagues, Quirrel looks utterly petrified, too -- not sure if were just mutilating one's soul, possessing a person, or owning a Hallow that was partially desecrated into a horcrux or all of the above that causes them both to see her.

Despite the oddities around Harry, he's fairly level-headed and popular... though he often does complain of annoying 'twinges' in his shoulder-blades, which causes 'Azzy' to just smile at him oddly...


** I'd love to read this.

I remember another story on AO3, I think, where the fallen angel /Lash/, a character from the /Dresden Files/, is appointed as Harry's guardian angel.

** There's a few dresden files fics where he becomes a Denarian, and there's one fic that... inspired by The Grimm Adventures of Billy and Mandy, where Harry and Samantha have this sort of... aura that follows them around and kills people for them.

  Harry had never had friends, so he imagined one: a red-haired girl he kept forgetting to name. Ginny imagined a shy boy with untidy hair and bright eyes, a boy who knew nothing of magic, so she told him. He dreamt of a world of magic and of a girl who wanted to be his friend. She dreamt of a boy who loved to hear her voice, no matter what. Then dreams became a reality when Harry met Ginny.(on indefinite hiatus.)

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
