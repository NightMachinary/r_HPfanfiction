  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

** Anything by Carnivorous Muffin, as he focuses on the character development, and takes the OPness as a given, and doesn't circlejerk over it.

linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) is a great example.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** Denarian Trilogy. The trick is that Harry needs a foil that is just as OP, otherwise it turns into a curbstomp with no real purpose.

** Usually those that focus on humor, politics or romance can have an OP Harry since it doesn't matter much and is not the focus of the story. Having an OP MC will make any fighting boring to read, and that is if they don't nerf him for some battles just for plot sake, or buff enemies for the same reason.

Actually 'One Punch Man' (the anime) handled it well.

**** The main reason one punch man works is because one saitama isnt at the fights right off the bat. Giving the side characters like Genos and Mumen rider a chance to develop before he comes in and bodies the enemy. The second is the show can still convey an amazing fight especislly because we the audience can see the struggle the villain has against saitama and we know how it will end but us knowing how the fight ends allows us to be excited for how the villain MIGHT pull a victory off.

kinda goes off the rails at some points, but still fairly enjoyable. Also probably the only OP!Harry/Ginny pairing I've ever seen above a few dozen favs.
