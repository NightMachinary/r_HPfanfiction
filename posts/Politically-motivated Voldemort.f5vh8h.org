Does anyone know of any fics where Voldemort is politically motivated and works his way up in the ministry? It could still be him trying to take over the Wizarding world from the inside out, but the way he goes about it is completely different.


** There are many fics with this premise... /The Pureblood Pretense/ is one example. linkfnn(7613196)

** linkffn(Benefits of Old Laws) has Voldemort regain a portion of his sanity and reinvent his approach after he's resurrected in the graveyard.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
