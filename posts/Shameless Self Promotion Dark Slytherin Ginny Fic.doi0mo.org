*** If I had to guess it's because of Ginny interacts with the diary so having her be indoctrinated by it makes sense. But I'm doing something different that's going to subvert your expectations.

*** It's not that I don't agree with you, but this really isn't very encouraging for the author. Sometimes they just wanna write what they wanna write, and that's okay. If you're not a fan of the tropes, then that's ok too, but making people feel bad about it isn't very nice.

**** "The story sucks and the author should feel bad about it."

If a comment like this stops you from writing what you want to write you really should not publish stuff online.

... Anyway, why did Ginny and Luna not know each other while growing up in the same village?

***** As a beta for that story, I see the immense potential the writer has and I have to say, either you're blind, or you're talking about something you know nothing about. Keep in mind that this is also the author's first foray into writing Harry Potter Fanfiction.

If a comment like this exists at all, it shows just how far the human race has fallen. Humans are innately emotional creatures. In fact, they're the most self-conscious of all creatures on this Earth. Now think about why this kind of review can hurt their drive to write, leading to yet another story added to the unfortunately /huge/ cache of abandoned stories.

As for your question, with Molly being as overprotective as she is, you can't rule it out. Plus, where I live, I have five houses directly next to mine. Of the residents of all those, I only knew one of the children growing up and she and I were never really friends. And they're technically not /in/ the village, but on the hills around it.

****** The first two lines of my comment were directed towards [[/u/espionage_is_whatido]] and how "... making people feel bad about it isn't very nice". This is the internet and people are not only "innately emotional creatures" they are also innately assholes, especially when anonymous.

Fallen from what? At what point of human history would a mean comment have been the most inhumane thing going on?

If they are +-1 years of you that is kinda weird. No playgrounds in the vicinity? I live close to several small villages and as far as I know in those pretty much everyone knew each other growing up. And sure, wizards keep to themselves, but that makes it even more likely for the Weasley, Lovegood and Diggroy children to, at least, know each other.

I don't mean it was the most inhumane thing going on, there's a lot worse than one comment on the web. I was referring to the fact that there was likely a time when people who shared their works were told how to make it better. Not ridiculed for being sensitive.

I think this is where I really disagree with you. Yes, we learn to deal with it, but over time. You can't expect a child to grow up before its time, and in the same way, a writer needs experience before they understand this.

I live in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and there aren't many playgrounds or parks around here. What made it worse is that my Swahili wasn't, in fact, still isn't, very good (despite being born in Kenya, which is a Swahili speaking country, and growing up in the birthplace of Swahili, Tanzania) and most of the children that I did meet didn't know English yet. Plus, my ancestry is a mix of Indian, American and British and I was brought up in a mix of Eastern and Western cultures as well. It's clear in how I look and act, which means the ones who did speak English often thought of me as 'mean' for not understanding how they were brought up at the time. All this added up to me not knowing a lot of people my age.

I did see the comment you left in reply to [[/u/WorldlyDear][u/WorldlyDear]] and I agree that some of those could be taken as flaws in the story. This also made me realise that I might have overreacted a little. I apologise if that's the case and thank you for your review. Now I shall stop sounding like a 17th Century Lord.

***** Thanks for the comment. This will really help me grow what issues do you have with the story?

As for ginny and luna. In my head canon luna's childhood was entirely alone exploring while ginny spent her time playing with her brothers.

****** I edited the comment and put the first line in quotation marks, maybe that makes it clearer what I was trying to say. I don't feel very strongly about the story one way or another.

Aside from Luna, all interactions that Ginny had until now were with adults and older students. All those were super supportive and addressing problems that aren't even there yet.

I think it would have been better to have her housemates actually bully her for being a poorblood (hehe) traitor and then introduce Cedrella to the story / Snape offering help. The way you wrote so far feels a bit like foreshadowing on steroids. Ron: "bad slimy snake sister" and Mollys howler incoming when? :P

There are a few smaller issues I guess (Cedrella being like: "Everbodys waching you and expecting greatness and stuff -- but no pressure just have fun and learn lol"), but nothing too bad.

Mhm I don't know, with how small the wizarding population is and everybody knows everybody, I really think 3 magical families living close together would at least somewhat know each other. They don't have to be the biggest friends but being completely ignorant of the others existence seems really unlikely.

******* I think I might have subverted your expectations. I wasn't really foreshadowing bullying. The school stuff and the kids all take a back seat at the heart of the story it's Ginny and Tom. The early chapters pretty much have set up her motivation and biggest character flaw.

In chapter one, I set up Ginny's character flaw that is her ego. She looked at Luna and saw an odd girl wearing radishes reading a book upside down; it wasn't until Luna impressed her with her perceptiveness that she decided to stay. In chapter two, I set up Ginny hates people pitying her. This ties in dangerously with what we learn in chapter three. Ginny's motivation is living up to the expectations placed on her by her grandmother. A lot of her troubles come from her wanting to be this big thing.

*** I'm reading black ink, red rose too.

I am inspired by all the stories I read, but this story started because of things in common by colubrina I thought that we never really saw Ginny really become that dark.

The biggest similarity between these two stories are that both have a ginny motivated death and lose who over time becomes darker and darker. My Ginny loses more people, so she fears failure more and will turn to the dark arts when all else fails.

I hope you give it a shot this is gonna get dark.
