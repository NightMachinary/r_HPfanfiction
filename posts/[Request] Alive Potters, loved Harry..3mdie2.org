I'd really like a fic where Lily and James live, for any reason, I don't care. It could be that they weren't targeted, and Neville became BWL, or Harry's twin brother is the WBWL, but Harry still grows up loved. Lily and James could die halfway through Harry's time at Hogwarts. Preferably no slash, but if it's a truly superb fic, I can deal with it. I don't have a preference for pairings, if any.


** Well, linkffn(Oblivion by ChaosEmperorNex) has alive Potters. I'd say give it a go even if it seems to not be what you're looking for at first.

It's a crossover with elder scrolls, which I didn't actually realise for like five chapters, but definitely worth a read.

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** But doesn't everybody hate him?

I've for sure read a story of his, but I can't think of it by name. I'll check it out though.

Edit: turns out, I've read this one, but I didn't like it enough to remember the name.

** linkao3(Fighting The Green by FireFleshAndBlood) is a big favourite. Alive!Potters, Slytherin!Harry. The characterisations are tremendously exciting -- Harry's a snotty brat, and yet I love him. Author adds a lot of effort into world-building as well.

  Harry Potter is a Slytherin. Neville is the Boy Who Lived. Both will have to face Voldemort to survive.

  #+begin_example
      Hello and welcome to another 'Harry Potter is a Slytherin' story\. This story was once posted a million years ago on fanfiction\.net\. Unfortunately, my account there is mysteriously unusable and so, I'm finally finishing this fanfic on AO3\. I started this fanfic years ago and at first it was a slightly awful drabble but due to mysterious reasons it became something of a phenomenon\. I hope the rewrite will eventually bring this story again to people's memories\. It was a lot of fun and I hope you'll have as much fun reading as I have writing it, especially since I'm finally finishing it\.To anyone just starting this story, the pairings show up around fourth year and will be added to the tags as I write them\. I'm also slowly editing this beast myself so please forgive any minor mess ups but if something particularly bothers you, feel free to comment on it\.For those curious about me or when an update will appear leave a comment on my dreamwidth\. Thank\-you and enjoy\.
