Not that I don't like how the house elves speech patterns are made it's just refreshing to have the elves speak plain non broken English.


** Honestly I feel like most authors really mess with Dobby's speech patterns. The only odd aspects of his speech pattern in canon were that he referred to himself as 'Dobby' rather than use a pronoun and him saying 'sir' every other clause.

Anyhow, in Inspected by No 13, Harry gets to use the power of bureaucracy to get through the Triwizard tournament. When he becomes an Inspector, all of the Elves drop their 'Elfish' speech patterns.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

** What's really refreshing for me is when the author gets the house elves' speech correct as per canon. Dobby speaks almost 100% in third person, but other than that his English is fine. Winky is a bit better at using first and second person, but says things like 'youses' and 'elveses'. And then Kreacher's kind of like Dobby but mutters to himself and doesn't overdo the titles.
