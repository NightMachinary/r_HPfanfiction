Like I do occasionally, I have a minor plot idea I can't figure out how to work into a story. So one of you can take a crack at it.

Colin Creevy is fed up with how passive his hero, Harry Potter, is being about the inevitable war (In my ideas, this dissatisfaction is made worse with the death of Dennis and his parents in a death eater raid over the summer of 6th year, but you don't need to include that). He watches as Harry does nothing to prepare himself or others, not even keeping the DA going. So he decides to take things into his own hands and be his own hero, no matter the cost.


** I doubt you'll find many writers here. Maybe [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]] would be a better place.
