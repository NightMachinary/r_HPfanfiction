I know it probably has been done, and said once, but I was thinking of beginning to write some HP fanfiction, but I need to know what to stay away from.

So what should I stay clear of, and what do you absolutely *HATE* in HP fanfictions? Couple of tropes? Mary Sues? What else?


** Soapboxing. I remember an old fic where Harry's Magic created a body to actively protect him. It was a sentient being of pure logic... Until it claimed that the christian god was the only logical explanation for the universe... Like no ?

Or when a character is always right at the end, even when they're wrong.

*** On the other hand, abnormally mature and intelligent 11 year olds do make better characters. I think a lot of the problem is that Philosopher's Stone was written for 11 year olds, where as most of the readers, and more importantly writers, of fanfic are in late teens and twenties. The insistence of so many authors to marry off all their characters while still in school does disgust me.

Sorry, I know this is a bit of an old comment, but I wonder why writers don't write more complex questions at a time when the characters have already graduated and are adults?

​

The only explanation I can think of is that they want to do an AU reinterpretation of the entire series and then it starts at the time of the Philosophical Stone (For example, the Method of Rationality). But the problem is that they want to include a lot of concepts that even adults have a hard time discussing, so that's why there are a lot of 11 characters that talk like "adults" (in some cases, it looks more like spoiled brats playing a lot of infodump).

And interestingly, the canon has a more gradual development. Harry didn't even know about the Death Eaters until he was 13/14 and even in the last book, he still had some things explained to him.

***** I think that comes down to a question of 'why are you writing this fanfic?'. Often it is to explore the potential of the wizarding world that Rowling created without being stifled by the limitations of a first person PoV of a child, and to be frank her own laziness and inconsistencies.

There are many, many stories where the adult characters are dealing with the psychological/social fallout from the war and can get very deep and nuanced (or just an excuse for smut). But the thing is:

a) this is a lot of work given you have to build your plots, characterisation and world yourself as this is all outside of the scope of the original.

b) This arguably isn't really fanfiction. Switch out the names and it is just a generic urban fantasy setting. Many people write/read fanfic to get a new interpretation of a story they like, and so it sort of has to take place at the same time. Maybe you feel a Harry Potter fanfic needs to deal with the Chamber of Secrets and the Triwizard Tournament because that is what makes Harry Potter Harry Potter, if you see what I mean.

There are ways of getting around it, such as time travel or getting adults far more engaged in the plot and using their PoVs, but these have quite drastic implications for the plot.

It is one of those things that I am pretty happy to ignore for the sake of more depth in the story (unless it is just an excuse for smut), but that is just personal preference.

** I hate a loooot of things, but two examples:

1) When someone writes a plot that I really like in theory, like for example time travel, or some kind of cool inheritance (yes I know, it's super cliché and I'm not ashamed!), but they ONLY use it as a vehicle to get to their preferred romance pairing. Omg, Harry is secretly half centaur! What is going to happen now, what will he do, how will others react... oh wait, he is super cool with it and immediately goes and bangs Malfoy because Malfoy is secretly a really nice guy and also his Fated Fuckbuddy, and now all his friends and allies are mad at him but it doesn't matter because looove is all he neeeds and they were bad friends anyway because now all his former enemies are suddenly his New and Improved Friends!

2) People wanting to write a badass Harry, for example, but they don't want to put in any work to actually get there. Whoa, Harry got angry after Sirius died, started questioning Dumbledore, and now all of a sudden he's a whole different person who gets aaaaall the ladies and/or dudes because he's suddenly super suave and knows all the right things to say and do. Or wait, actually Harry has been this totally different person all along, he was just faking his entire personality up until now because reasons. Basically, anything that means that the author gets to immediately and with no repercussions write their own character that they thought up, instead of actually writing the character it's supposed to be.

** 1. “Gred and Forge” as anything other than a one-off joke the twins make. I've genuinely seen whole fics that only ever refer to them as Gred and Forge.

2. Twinspeak, where the twins finish each other's sentences. It's annoying to read, and isn't how twins speak. They're two people on the same wavelength, not one consciousness across two bodies.

3. Wordcounts of over 300,000 for a fic that covers Harry's first year. Does your first year really need to be three times as long as the first three books combined?

4. Americanisms like ‘write you,' ‘mom,' ‘asshole,' etc. Okay in prose, very distracting in dialogue.

**** The twin speak is them being on the same wavelength but completing their own sentences and thoughts. Someone did a good job pointing out the examples of the two, much better than what I can.

But canon is something like;

"Brilliant my handsome brother."

"We'll just have to sneak out tonight."

"No make that tomorrow night, easier to avoid everyone after the Quidditch game."

"Ah yes, then we'll have a clear path to the Hogsmeade tunnels."

"Merlin bless those Mauraders."

"You said it."

Not: "Brilliant-"

"-my handsome brother."

"Let's-"

"-do it tomorrow."

Etc. etc. etc.

There's a clear difference and the problem is most fics have the latter not the former.

** In terms of actual writing, the thing I dislike most is random tonal or characterisation changes without plot reasons or forewarning/foreshadowing. Like, when characters are suddenly bigots, or suddenly Christian, or suddenly express something completely counter to their character prior to that. It's weird and disconcerting (which can be useful if you have plot reasons for making your reader feel that way - has that character been hiding something, or been replaced?) and usually comes off as Author Soapboxing and that's just not good writing and won't ever convince anyone of anything ever anyway (If you're writing something that you want someone to agree with, convince them through the narrative - it's so much more effective; that's why they pointlessly tell us so many narrative details on the news "the killers history was this and their neighbours had this to say" etc.)

And personal-preference-wise, overly dark stuff. Like A Veela's Worth level dark, to be specific. It's just not to my taste at all. If I wanted to read about murder and torture and bad decisions, I'd read the news.

** Outside of a lot of things already mentioned : Harem.

While it will never be my favorite trope, Harem can go well in some settings (like stories in an Ancient Asian setting where Polygamy was pretty common for the powerfull), I do not thing Harry Potter is one of them.

But I especially hate how Harry has to get ALL the girls (leaving all the other boys in the school fighting for the 10% remaining ones)., and how Harry is somehow the only want who gets to have an Harem. If Harem is so commong among Purebloods, show it. I want to see Draco (or any other boys for all I care) flexing with his 3/4 fiancees. I want to see a Pureblood trying to pass a bill with the Wizengamot to make Flying Carpets legal because he needs it to move with all his wives. Without this, it just looks like tome wish fulfilling fic (which it is more often than not I guess).

​

PS: same thing with all the Nobility fics (even though I hate this trope). If Harry has somehow 50 votes because he is the Lords of a looooot of families, there must be some Lord Yourface that has around the same number of votes. It really annoying when Harry is the only one able to use what is really an obvious loophole in a governing system.

** One thing that I've come across way too many times is that when I find a story that i fall in love with, that gives me goosebumps and that sucks me in so I need to read and read and read and make me not care about sleep or my social life or anything else, they always have this nasty habit of ending.

This isn't anything that you could really fix, because all good things must end, just, try not to make it a rushed ending. Try to plan your story out from start to finnish, so that you know what will come when it comes and not leave me with a hole in my heart and with plotholes that will keep me up at night trying (and failing) to fill in the gaps.

Another thing that I've seen many times is that stories often don't have a proper sense of time. The one I'm reading at the moment is really good at confusing me timewise, the story makes it seem like much more time passes between the scenes, with the characters interacting and things happening, but isn't explicit written, just mentioned, so by chapter 5 I was ready for Winter to come knocking and it almost to be Christmas, but then a Hogwarts student says something about how there's a week left till Halloween and I'm sitting there like a question mark utterly confused.

So when you plan your story, try to also paste it out timewise. As the reader, I don't need to know what date it is, but you as the writer should try to keep it in mind so that the time-flow becomes logical and not confusing when you write.

​

So yeah, know what your writing and know when your writing before you do.

** 1.  Bad grammar and spelling and, idk how to explain this, but using words wrong. I read one once that mentioned "the Black sisters, Narcissa Black nee Malfoy and Bellatrix Black nee Lestrange." No. "Nee" means was her maiden name, not is her married name. Check it means what you think it means!

2.  Random Americanisms. No one in England, literally no one, eats pancakes for breakfast. We don't call sweets "candy." Most British children do not know the rules of baseball, and it's absolutely not played in schools here. It's "primary school" not "grade school." Most adults here in the 80s/90s drank tea, and no one really had a home coffee machine until quite recently. And tea, for the love of god, /is not served with cream under any circumstances./ Just look up a wiki of British food or the British school system or whatever.

3.  The Head Boy/Girl of each house - no, head boy and head girl is a school wide appointment, the houses themselves have senior prefects. This isn't something JKR made up, this is a staple of UK private and grammar schools. Again, have a look on the internet if you aren't sure.

4.  The random and unnecessary sexualisation of children. I read one fic that had Hermione and Harry paired from before Hogwarts and Petunia and Mrs Granger were telling them that "maybe when they are twelve" they'd be ready for sex, and then there was a whole scene where they looked at and touched each other. No, stop it, they are eleven this is not ok. I stopped reading at that point. Another one had a whole paragraph about how Luna, aged ten in this fic, didn't like to wear knickers because she liked the tingle of a breeze on her vagina. I don't want to read about a ten year olds tingling vagina, why would you even write that? Why would you even think about if a pre pubescent girl was wearing underwear or not unless you're a sicko?

5.  Snakes that turn up at Privet Drive and know all about the wizarding world, including how Harry needs to go to Gringotts. Which brings me to...

6.  Lordships. I did a whole post on this a while ago, but just for the basics: Lord isn't a title, it's a form of address for someone who has a title. Heir is not a title or form of address, it is a status within the family much like being a daughter or a cousin or whatever. You don't address someone by it. Anyone who is a heir apparent (and probably a heir presumptive tbh) will have their own courtesy title. Harry, specifically, is not the heir, either apparent or presumptive, to the Potter line. He's the head of the Potter line, he's the oldest surviving male family member, so he would have whichever title you've decided the Potters have for your fic. He may still need a Regent (who wouldn't be addressed as Regent Potter, he or she would likely have a title in their own right or just be Mr Whoever, Regent of the Potter House when signing letters) as he's under age, but he's still the title holder, not the heir. Neville is probably also the title holder as Frank is disqualified due to not being compus mentis. Neville is the oldest surviving male of the direct line who is capable of taking on the role. Augusta Longbottom would absolutely be his regent, but she would not be "Regent Longbottom," she's the Dowager Lady Longbottom. She has a title in her own right.

7.  Currency exchange. A galleon is worth about five pounds. If you're not sure what you can buy for a fiver, have a look on some UK shopping sites. I saw a fic recently that said "a book is about £25" - an expensive hardback maybe, but generally speaking books in the UK cost anywhere between £8-£15. In 1991, when Harry first enters the wizarding world, a book was about £5 - so a galleon. If you vaugely know what something is in dollars, take about a third off it to get the pound price - something that's worth $10 is worth about £7. The pound is slightly stronger, even now.

8.  Shopping montages. Stop it for god's sake just stop it! I don't care how many t-shirts Harry buys. His t-shirts do not further the plot!

9.  Muggle or wizard wank. Both cultures have good and bad, and people like Hermione and Harry want the Wizards to see that.

10. House elf slavery apologism. Fucking stop it. Yes the characters in canon generally accepted it but, well, /they are wrong./ Plus, Hermione (author avatar) and Dumbledore (moral centre) think it's wrong. So the message of the canon books is that /slavery is wrong./ All of this "it's symbiotic", "how do we know they don't like being enslaved" is gross. House elves are canonically sufferers of false consciousness and brainwashed - and we "know this" because no free sapient being likes to be enslaved. And that's the point - it's not like a farm animal. They aren't just sentient, like a donkey is, they're sapient. They aren't human, but they damn well are /people./ They may like to work, that's one thing, but a being can work without being a slave. And it's not symbiotic, Dobby didn't die from having no master, nor did he lose his magic. If anything, he became more badass.

** I hate most age gap fics (especially student/professor fics) because the author treats the age gap and difference in power/status as nothing.

Don't get me wrong, these relationships are not impossible. I know people IRL who have gotten together, who have been Professor/student and who have big age gaps and made it work, but it's actually a big issue that needs to be addressed, and not something that can just be swept under the rug.

I think most of the fics fail at this quite profoundly because to portray them realistically, you have to have enough life experience to even begin to realize all the issues. However, many fanfic writers are younger, either students or those who have just gotten out of school, who just think that love should conquer all, and they ignore all the problems.

** I haven't really seen this talked about much in these kinds of posts, but I hate when authors pretend like House-Elf culture is a good thing.

You know the fics I'm talking about - Lord Potter, Black, etc. etc. shuts down Hermione when the latter says "hey, maybe we shouldn't enslave an entire sentient race." Far too many authors seem to be comfortable with literal slavery for my liking.

They usually justify it by saying "the Elves like being enslaved." It's almost like they've never considered that House-Elves, which are implied to basically be indentured since birth to death, have been brainwashed, have never known anything except a life of slavery and be told from older Elves that it's for the best, and have been dehumanized by the other sentient races to preventing anyone from helping them.

When I see an author trying to justify the existence of literal slavery by using the MC as a mouthpiece, I immediately conclude the author is a trash author and the fic is a trash fic.

I always thought the whole S.P.E.W. thing was a terrible idea. Hermione's heart is clearly in the same place, and there is too much similarities between House Elves and slavery for confort, but the way she went about it was just wrong.

She first annoyed people to joing her group (even Harry and Ron mainly bought their badge so Hermione stopped bothering them), then tried to forcibly free the House Elves by hiding clothes into the Gryffindor tower (ignoring the fact that it doesn't work like that, or that House Elves didn't want to be freed). Hell she worked on S.P.E.W several month before even meeting a House Elf.

I wish Hermione was often attacked about the unpracticability of her project (in its current form), with a possibility of being helped than people rather than the whole "/Slavery is right, you just know nothing you stupid Mudblood/" tirade you mostly see in fics).

** 1. *Bashing* - especially to make Dumbledore evil. The man was not perfect, far from it. But then, nobody is. Dumbledore always tried his best. Sure, he made mistakes, but so did every one else. The moment I read Dumbledore unironicly saying: "For the greater good" I don't read the fic. Seriously. That's like WW2 resistance fighters quoting "Mein Kampf".
2. *Hypocrits* - so often we see Harry "stand up for himself" against his bullies. Well good for him in theory. But in many fanfics this leads to Harry becoming a bully to this people himself. And everybody is okay with it. I mean - I really don't like Draco in the first 5 years or the Dursleys for the whole series. I don't want to pity them because Harry is such an horrible bully to them. Hell, one time Harry got so bad that I had pity for Umbridge! So yes to standing up against bullys, no to becoming a bully yourself.
3. *Erasing character flaws* - Mary Sues aren't only a problem for OCs. Many times Harry, Hermione or Draco become one themselves. Suddenly everything they do is great - they can't do anything wrong.
4. *Studying is the solution for world peace* - Harry starts studying and suddenly he is on par with Dumbledore and Voldemort who have decades more experience. That's bullshit. And Harry can't study that much more - he is already an above average student. He does all of his homework and studys for exams in time. Thats more than at least 3/4 of my students do!\\
   I believe that Harry is one of the most powerful wizards in the series. Everyone agrees that Harrys Patronus and his resistence against the Imperius are incredible. Even Dumbledore calls him powerful more than once. He isn't a genius like Dumbledore, Voldemort or even Hermione, but he is powerful enough to pull everything of he is taught. But he is also a kid. He can't outstudy Voldemort because Voldemort had 50 years more time AND is a genius.
5. *Ron is lazy* - often happens together with point 4. Calling Ron lazy is ignoring the source material. He can even be pretty hard working when interested - for example for his OWLs when he wants to become an auror or for his position in the Quidditch-Team. Ron isn't a Hermione, but most students aren't like Hermione. Ron is, all in all, a little bit above the average, which doesn't make him lazy.

**** Do you even know what above average means? It means that he does better than most of the people in his age group but isn't on the top. That's exactly how you would describe Harry. You see that during the school years and in his scores.

About Hermione: she isn't a Dumbledore-Level genius, that's why I have written /"or even Hermione"/. But you aren't only a genius if you are as smart as Steven Hawkins or Albert Einstein. There are different levels of genius and you still are a genius if you are far above your age class - which Hermione is. Hermione is more than often referenced as "the smartest witch in their year". And for learning all of your school books before school starts you have to be not only hard working but also very intelligent.

If you put something like a great amount to titles explain how he got them, please? Say he has the "Ravenclaw lordship" or whatever, explain that he got this because his mother was actually a magical in a squib family descended from Roweena Ravenclaw.

I have read so many that bash characters that I stay away because I'm so tired of it. I may only be almost 18 but I don't understand the idea of putting 11 or 12-year-olds together, yes I have seen people in this age range kissing, I also lived in a bad neighborhood at that time. I don't want to read a fic about it because it grosses me out. if you really want this pairing age them up, start your story closer to when most people get a relationship or have it as an after Hogwarts and he finally understands his strong feelings towards the other character.

American English in something set in Europe i don't care where you start the fic, in Hogwarts, the Dursleys, etc. use the wording these people would in real life i might not understand some terminology that they use but i look then up so you end up with a bunch of tabs and google is your friend, your readers feel like they are there in Hogwarts because of how they talk. it's fine if you have the characters go to America (within reason of course) and have the American English be there in the background characters just don't forget that the main whoever that was in the group won't talk like that unless they learn the American words for things like how biscuit and cookie mean the same thing but Americans think of actual biscuits, not cookies. i saw that in a crossover and was soooooo happy.

** I can agree with most things here. Some pet hates of mine:

Fred and George not acting like real people (eg taking it in turns to say words in a sentence). Even something I really like such as NOFP is guilty of this in places.

Bashing of Ron and/or Dumbledore. Neither character is perfect in canon, but some poor writers shove away all good qualities and over emphasise the negatives.

Americanisms. British people, especially at the time, do not say "upperclassmen", "heck", "mom", "daddy" when the speaker is a teenager, do not call each other "honey" un-ironically, "sweater" instead of "jumper", "pants" instead of "trousers", and would probably never refer to their house sports team as "Gryffindor Lions". The name of the first book in the series is not Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

Most non-canon pairings. I can forgive this if there was at least some friendly feeling towards each other in canon, eg Harry/Luna, but trying to imagine any situation where, for example, Malfoy and Hermione suddenly realised they've been madly in love all along and their twu wuv transcends all of their previous character development, making Malfoy instantly abandon his deeply-ingrained prejudice and Hermione instantly forgive all if his past racism, is just plainly unrealistic to me. The characters despise each other in canon. This is a plain fact. The love of a good woman cannot rescue any man.

I'm sure there's some others, but I'll have to read more bad fanfic first. :)
