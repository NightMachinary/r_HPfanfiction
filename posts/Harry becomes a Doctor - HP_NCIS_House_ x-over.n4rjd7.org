:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic I remember reading but didn't save.

Basically Lily and James were alive. Harry's brother got all the attention. He ran away. Went to the US and became a doctor under the name James (or Jamie???). Ended up having to go back to Hogwarts.

I remember there being a lot of characters from the popular medical soaps like NCIS and House.

Thanks for helping!
