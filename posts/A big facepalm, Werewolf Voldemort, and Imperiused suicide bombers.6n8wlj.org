Yup, three requests in one because I don't feel like making three posts.

1. Something comedic; any fics that have a moment where everyone in the general vicinity does a collective facepalm? [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZxzJGgox_E][Naked Gun style?]]

2. Something dramatic; any fics where someone uses the Imperius Curse on someone, gives them a big bomb, and then sends them somewhere (the Ministry of Magic foyer, Hogwarts Entrance Hall, Gringotts, Diagon Alley, etc...) to blow themselves up?

3. Something Super!Harry-ish; any fics where when Voldemort uses the Flesh, Blood and Bone ritual to restore his body, the 'flesh' he uses is from a werewolf? /And/, the lycanthropy curse present in the flesh battles it out with the body-reconstructing potion, turning Voldemort into something radically different and dangerous?


** Voldemort extensively used Imperiused suicide bombers in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][The Bonds of Blood]], linkffn(5435295)

Imperiused bombers or memory charmed saboteurs were a common tactic in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185).

Ron and Hermione used this tactic a few times in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005).

Imperiused suicide attackers were not too effective in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divide and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), because of various countermeasures taken (Thief's Downfall in all strategic important locations, checkpoints, disillusioned Broom sentries). But both sides nevertheless used them.

*** Mm, I read Divided and Entwined. Is gewd.

I don't like the Marriage Law Revolution one so much, though. Hermione manages to aggravate me within the first few chapters.

**** Hermione and Harry are not likable in that story, but then again, even the author calls them "fucked up child soldiers". What they ranted at McGonagall and Dumbledore's portrait is not necessarily correct, merely a progression of their character developments.

But once you get past the first 3 chapters, the story takes a turn for the better, and by chapter 9, it's getting really interesting.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
