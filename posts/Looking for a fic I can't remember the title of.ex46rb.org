:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi, I am looking for a fic I read a while ago. Basically, a Harry gets sent into a different dimension, where Tom Riddle is the Minister of Magic and actually good. He goes to an old place where the Ministry was before they were below London to look up some I think genealogies?. There, he meets the granddaughter of Tom, who calls himself Slytherin instead of Riddle, and some of the local Death Eater-ish people in red robes. Also, Tom thinks he is part of the family maybe because Harry accidentally revealed he can speak Parseltongue.

  Harry sacrificed everything to kill the Dark Lord. He sacrificed more to kill the next one. And the next. And the next. By the end, he had nothing left to give, and nothing left to win. Burdened by failure, he's thrown into a new world with familiar faces and unfamiliar personalities, and must fight to survive. AU, Dimension Travel, Graphic Violence.
