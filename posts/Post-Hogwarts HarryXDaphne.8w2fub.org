I'm looking for any fics which are obviously harry/daphne. Any is appreciated but I would prefer if there are any which immediately post-Hogwarts either a few hours after Voldermorts death or a few months. I'm mainly looking for this after reading a one-shot of a Haphne meeting in the great hall after the battle and reading a few of Dorothea Greengrass' fics. Thanks


** There are quite a few of these, and it may be easier for you to just type "Daphne" in the search bar.

But here are some fics worth mentioning that are mostly post-Hogwarts (quality is not necessarily guaranteed, best in bold):

- *Days to Come linkffn(Days to Come)*
- *Unatoned linkffn(Unatoned)*
- *Contractual Invalidation linkffn(Contractual Invalidation)*
- A Fateful Walk linkffn(A Fateful Walk)
- The Amalgamation Agreement linkffn(The Amalgamation Agreement)
- A Fine Spot of Trouble linkffn(A Fine Spot of Trouble)
- Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts linkffn(Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts)
- Game of Style and Brutality linkffn(Game of Style and Brutality)

A number of [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] users who write H/D fics have quite a few similar fics in their follow/favorite list. This may be easier for you than asking here.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG

*** Currently reading my way few a through of these, figured I'd say a bit more about them than you have. Give my opinion, and such.

The Amalgamation Agreement is really interesting, it takes a lot of cliches and fanon stuff relating to Daphne and just burns it. That said, it ends before it really gets good. Entirely possible it's abandoned and won't ever get to the good part, too. But oh well.

Harry Potter and The Marriage Contracts is pretty firmly 'okay'. Really not bad at all, but it also doesn't have any huge mix ups or anything to make it particularly interesting. It's a pretty straightforward fic, no huge surprises(barring one), and the writing, while perfectly fine, isn't impressive really. Definitely not bad, but also not really good.

A Fateful Walk was really good, another interesting characterization of Daphne. The summary is /not/ lying. This fic has gone to dark places, and I really dread that it's going to go darker. If it does, I'm not entirely sure how well I'll handle that. That said, it's very well written, and while one specific character annoys me for reasons I can't pin down.. it's pretty good, considering the number of 'not actually but basically OCs' that are in that fic. Also pay attention to the fics the author suggests in every chapter. A lot of them are HP/DG and some of them look really good. Tempted to mix up my read order.

I'll edit this as I read more of'em. I plan to read +A Fateful Walk+, Days To Come, and A Fine Spot Of Trouble next.

I did end up changing the order around, adding some of Shygui's suggestions (The Grass Is Always Greener, by kb0, Harry Potter And The Betrothal Contract, by James Spookie, Marry you, and Trapped In a Broom Closet, both by Dorothea Greengrass) not sure if I want to toss those fics on here too, complete with like.. mini-review/summary thoughts like I have been doing. Is this helping anyone out, or nah?

***** My only complaint with them is that they're a little fast paced, relationship-wise, and she needs a beta. It's nothing horrible, but definitely enough to be noticed. Afaik, English isn't their first language, which gives them a /lot/ of leeway to me.

I've only read Trapped In a Broom Closet and Marry You. Not sure if there's more from her, but I found both to be pretty good. Preferred Marry You. Bit less serious, it being postwar and all.

I don't mind authors with multiple fics going, so long as they're actually all being updated, even if they're rare for some fics. Which means I find it a bit annoying, too.

***** I have not read Wind Shear. Is that an outright bad thing, or did you just not care for it because you had read something similar before?

I'm not holding my breath on any of it, though. I try to come in with low/no expectations when it comes to fanfiction. Less disappointment that way. :D Plus the surprise is /way/ more pleasant when you find an absolute gem.

That said, I'm pretty easy when it comes to fanfiction. As long as the grammar is reasonable I'll probably be at least okay with the fic.
