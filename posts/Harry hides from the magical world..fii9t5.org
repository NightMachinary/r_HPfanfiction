Looking for a fic I've read before but can't remember the name.

Harry disappears from the magical world after the war and changes his name. The story is based around his daughter, name forgotten. Writing letters to Harry Potter, unknowing that he is her father. His wife ends up dying in Hogwarts and Harry reveals himself to the community angry pissed and upset.
