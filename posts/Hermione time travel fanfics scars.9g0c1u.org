I love hermione timetravel fanfics especially tomione and snamione mostly tomione haha, but what i dont see often is hermione going into the past and having her scars from bellatrix, dolohov, umbridge and the war. If theres any good fanfics out there that hermione love interests or main pairing asks about them? Because it shows hermiones strength and loyalty as a true griffindor and hermiones character is truly amazing. Thanks


** i think the scars are mentioned in linkffn(Oblivion by Nautical Paramour)

  Kreacher sends Hermione back in time with the hopes that she will save Regulus an destroy the locket. Hermione figures she will have an ally to help her destroy the other horcruxes, too. But, Regulus Black doesn't turn out to be anything like she expected he would. Regulus x Hermione. Time Travel. COMPLETE!

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. *Art by Freya Ishtar*
