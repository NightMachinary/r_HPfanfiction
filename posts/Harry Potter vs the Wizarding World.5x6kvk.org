I am looking for fics where Harry fights the wizarding World/ the establishment. You know those guys that let off Death Eaters simply by saying (and bribing) the Imperius-defence, those that never really changed anything after the first or second blood war.

And now Harry takes to them.

This can either be Lord Harry Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Emrys going at it or Harry finding help from the muggle side. Or anything else.

Harry can be light, dark or anything in between.

Pairings do not matter, just please no slash.


** Sorry, wrong fanfic earlier

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
