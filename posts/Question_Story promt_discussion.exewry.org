As Magical leylines are huge part of Fanon, from powering words to giving rituals that extra oomph, I would assume that Stonehenge would have several of those as congregation in one point(don't know if I'm using the right words) have you encountered/read/written a fanfic that makes use of Stonehenge or Magic Leylines in general? If yes, plis rec!


** linkffn(The Omnipotence Paradox by RedTideZero) has this at the beginning i think. It may be a little bit ridiculous at some points, but an interesting read nonetheless.

  What is a God? A singular omnipotent being that can do anything, be anything, and who rules over all; But can a God really do anything? Be anything? Can a God be created? Can a God be stopped?
