I read this some time ago and would like to do so again. Harry is an auror and is investigating some interesting murders. I think that the murders had something to do with numbers. Harry also has 'seals' on something and he's trying to maintain them. If not seals then he's fulfilling some contract that he made when he defeated Voldemort.

Any help or direction would be awesome.

Thanks!
