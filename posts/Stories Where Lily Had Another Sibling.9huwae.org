So, I've been bouncing the idea that Lily & Petunia had another sibling off the wall for my own story, and I realized I'm kind of intrigued to see other stories where authors have done the same.

More importantly, though, stories where Harry only finds out about his long lost uncle/aunt AFTER he goes to Hogwarts for whatever reason (i.e. the sibling was a wizard/witch that fled Britain during the First Wizarding War, the sibling was in St. Mungo's for some reason, etc.).

I don't really care about the gender of the sibling, how important they are to the story, or the pairings in the story for the most part. I just want to see Harry get the aunt or uncle that he deserves.


** Guilty pleasure of mine is Bobmin's /Mutant Storm/ (an X-men crossover), wherein Jean Grey is Lily's long lost sister. Sounds silly, I know, but I thought it was a fun way to pass the time (and I usually dislike crossovers). The relationship between Jean, Scott, and Harry is rather sweet. Some bashing, but not /ridiculous/ bashing. Ron's a bad guy at first, but comes around. Harry/Ginny, Harry is both mutant and wizard. linkffn(7404056).

** The only good Lily's sibling story I know is linkffn(A Fresh Bouquet by Tsume Yuki), but it's set in 1979.

The whole blood protection issue makes the existence of another Evans rather problematic tho. Nobody that was incapable or unwilling to be in any way involved with Harry for 10 years would be very easy to write as "the guardian that Harry deserves". Unless you go the manipulative!Dumbledore route, but that's basically a guarantee of bad quality.

  Reborn into the world of Harry Potter, Poppy Evans has only one goal; make sure she's not the only magical Evans alive by 1982. And maybe save that smug Potter while she's at it. Regulus Black didn't fit into the equation; he wasn't suppose to be so distracting.

** Linkffn(The Other Evans Girl) Linkffn(yesterday and tomorrow (everything is connected))

Part of the weird “Hermione performs a ritual to become Lily's sister and fix the timeline” genre that I can't get enough of

But there are tons of OC Lily sister fics too if that's more your thing.

Edit: I just read your request more throughly and I'm sorry neither of these meet the description. They're Marauder era fics but I think they'll span long term.

  The war was lost and the Order eradicated - all except one. The one that Voldemort really should have killed first. Hermione Granger rips apart space and time to make the impossible happen. January 30 1960, Lily Evans enters the world and so does her twin sister, Hermione. Marauders Era. EWE. Sirimione.

  James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.
