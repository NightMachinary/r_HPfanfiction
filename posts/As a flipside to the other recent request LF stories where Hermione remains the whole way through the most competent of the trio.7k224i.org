*** Eh, Hermione has a general competency paired with attention to detail that gives her a lot of standard solutions and some clever tricks. These things escape Harry because he doesn't have a studious nature.

However, with knowledge that he already knows Harry is far more competent at application. He's also better at decision-making under pressure and courage under fire. I'd also argue that he's a better teacher, but that can't be proven one way or another.

Also, flying.

** linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) followed by (Lady Archimedes by White Squirrel).

List of things she does (which she doesn't in canon): [[/spoiler][Discover the house elf's common room, hex Voldemort in the face, publish many scholarly articles, find a way to look a basilisk in the eye and remain conscious, get Sirius freed by stopping Pettigrew, invent a way to beat a dragon, find Gamp's sixth law, create a better marauder's map, become friends with Slytherins, make diamonds from charcoal, teach Harry Occumency, knock out Lucius and Bellatrix, curse Dolohov, find out Harry is a Horcrux, help Dumbledore find horcruxes, kill hundreds of Inferi with a spell and not to forget the hundreds of spells she creates to fight off death eaters.]] The best part is that through none of this does the author make her look overpowered, but simply being more logical or manipulating the rules of science and maths with magic.
