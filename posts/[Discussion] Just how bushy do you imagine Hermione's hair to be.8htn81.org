Is it like Medusa's hair, if Medusa had hair instead of snakes? What happens when it gets extremely humid? This is very important to know.


** I imagine her hair as ridiculously curly and unmanageable. I've read a fanfiction where her bending her head over the cauldron fumes causes it to poof out and I thought it was hilarious and probably accurate. I think as she got older she probably learned how to manage it, as most girls do, but that it remained a difficult task.

*** LOL. A cute image. I also think she probably made the mistake of yanking a brush through already-curly hair, this making it frizzy and hard to control.\\
I made this mistake when I was 11-13 or so.

** I imagine it to be like my own naturally curly hair---frizzy in some spots, curly in others and a general mess. Oh how I longed to be like the girls that had effortlessly easy to manage spiral curls, but it was not for me. Instead I learned flat-iron fu and retain the services of a very talented stylist.

I identified with Hermione a lot as a kid and I think this picture adequately explains why. EDIT because I hit enter too soon: I picture Hermione with hair a lot like mine - a mix of of 3A/3B curls that can and do explode into gigantic shapeless frizz the minute humidity comes anywhere near it. I also picture Hermione as being someone who doesn't know/doesn't care how to make it settle down, so she just brushes it and hopes for the best. This makes it bigger.

This phrase made me laugh, and I think you have beautiful hair by the way. Mine's stuck between "afro", "we curl when it rains" and "We're straight the day after washing and we don't know why".

**** Thanks :) I feel the inexplicable transformations. My hair is anywhere between "Hello, I am Emma Watson's wig from the first movie" to "8 different curl patterns" to "vaguely lumpy attempts at curls a day after washing" and there's no real consistency.

I imagine that her mom has straight hair and she gets her curls from her dad - so her mother has no idea how to deal with curls and just brushes them out and it becomes a poof ball - kind of like this.

** My headcanon has her as jewish on her dad's side and african descent on her mom's side but like my ex and our daughter: my ex has light cafe au lait skin and naturally straight hair and our daughter looks completely caucasian. Few people realize they're related at first sight. So basically my hermione jhas jewfro and afro recessive genes meet up and go "hell yeah!" amd hermione looks like a prototype muppet.
