Since the story will begin updating again I'm sure there's more than a few of us rereading or reading for the first time and I wanted to have a discussion about it.

So what are your guys favorite books, arcs, scenes, lines, etc... and the inverse or anything else you want to discuss.

For me my favorite book is four. It's where the world really starts expanding and we get a glimpse at what lays beyond the scope of Hogwarts and Britain. It also introduces us to Victor and Fleur who are both fantastic. Plus it's just fun for the most part.

My least favorite is probably the werewolf arc with Harry spiraling into addiction and getting possessed. The storyline hits a lot of great notes and ideas but it always feels like a slog to get through for me.

According to whom? This is the first I've heard of it, and there's nothing about it in the summary or the author's bio that I could find.
