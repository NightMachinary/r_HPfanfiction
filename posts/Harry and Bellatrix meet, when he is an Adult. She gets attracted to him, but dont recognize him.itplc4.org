I would say, there is some tension between Harry and Bella. Maybe they get even intim with each other, but they wouldnt really be considered a Pair for this fic. I dont mind, if the Fic has them as a Pair, but im uncertain, what i would do with this idea.

I just thought that maybe Bellatrix gets resurrected after Years and she meets the older Harry, but she doesnt recognize him. Maybe an AU and a Canon Bella/Harry encounter (Bella is still evil) or a "Good" Bella and Harry do meet.


** Delenda est is a fix you might like
