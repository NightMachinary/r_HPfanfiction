Hi,

I am looking for old madcow fics, such as "Winds of Change", and "Twisted Underbelly of the Wizarding World". As far as I can tell, it has been mostly deleted from the major fanfic archives, but was curious if anyone had a link or archived copy of them.


** You can try [[http://fictionhunt.com/]] if you remember some of the fic details.

[[/u/TheBlueMenace]] is right to mention rule #6 but unless the author has explicitly stated they don't want their works shared anymore it is invalid.

**** Did he/she say the reason before they left? It could just as easily be that someone found or guessed a password that was used for multiple fanfic sites.

Once something is the on the internet, it is out their permanently. You can't take it back and IMO shouldn't unless you are at risk of it bleeding into your private life and having negative impact.

****** Found this:

"The MadCow is currently in the process of doing some spring cleaning. Some old, abandoned stories have to go as they are either going nowhere, or look really bad now that it had the time to look back and reminiscent about old times of fanfiction."

From - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5985581/MadCow77]]

So basically he/she took them down because they didn't meet new standards for fanfic, which is understandable. People change as they gain experience with writing. I get no impression that private sharing of fics would be a problem however, just that the author doesn't think they belong on the same fanfic.net profile as the rest.
