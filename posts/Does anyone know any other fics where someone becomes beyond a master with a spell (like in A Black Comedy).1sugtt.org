To elaborate, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/]["A Black Comedy]] (An excellent fic by the way), Harry goes beyond mastering the summoning and banishing charms, so much so that he eventually gains extra invisible hands to manipulate anything and everything without using a wand, and they're always there and ready to act on a moment's thought.

I was wondering if any other fics shared this premise with different spells, mastering one or more spells to come up with a unique ability such as that? (Not counting becoming such a master Legilimenst that you can see another's surface thoughts just by looking them in the eye, without a spell, considering that's cannon and almost in every fic with Dumbles.)


** In this story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8776626/1/Patronus-Totalus]]

It's Hermione who goes beyond mastering the patronus charm, effectively becoming a patronus herself. (The story is complete.)

Seems to fit what you're looking for, but it's not a super!fic like I believe a Black Comedie is, if I'm not mistaken.

*** Thanks, sounds good. No wonder I haven't heard of it, I typically stick to Harry/OC/Other series/show/movie character centric fics, but I'll be sure to give it a shot.

Thanks. As for super fic, I'd say black comedy is sort of, , but the backstory is pretty much the same as the cannon series.

To be fair, even cannon Harry after the final battle might be considered super Harry, as with the you know what from his scar gone, many fics theorize that he would be more powerful as it is somewhat likely it screws up his abilities possibly even siphoning some of his magic. Sound logic I'd say, though we don't get any proof in cannon as the final battle wasn't about spellpower but about wand loyalty.

** That seems like a very generic SuperHarry sort of thing and not that hard to find. Excuses vary, but the basics remain the same. You might be able to do a search for "master" or "super!Harry" and find tons on FFN.

Unless you mean non-spell magical abilities in general? Because Harry just being awesome at magic for no reason resulting in non-canon effects is really common, mostly some set of spells he's "mastered" and can now +use+ abuse the effects of to wandlessly spank a useless Dumbledore in a cringe-inducing "climactic" scene.

I would be interested to see more people writing /new/ magic systems that have "realistic" and balanced things to bring to the HP 'verse, /especially/ if Harry doesn't instantly master them for no goddamn reason. Instead of inventing new spells, it would be nice to see more authors coming up with something that isn't simply Runes/Gift of a questionable god/Wandless magic/Animagus nonsense/Bloodline of a generic magical creature.

The few times I've seen the rare truly original and well thought-out idea, its almost always worked quite well. Tellingly, in those stories Harry usually /doesn't/ master those new magics. Sometimes, and in some of the BEST fics, the new magical ideas are used simply to /totally/ screw him over, which really seems more true to canon themes.

Speaking of, JKR wrote almost nothing about magic itself, so that seems like a really wide open area to explore without just saying over and over again how awesome Harry is now that he has "mastered" a charm that is usually taught to 14-year-olds in school over perhaps a week's study time, or how he can now somehow shoot lasers from his arse without even trying for no clearly explained reason.

But people look for different things in fics, and that sort of power fantasy just isn't my thing. Obviously.

As a final thought, if you like the invisible hands thing, it might just be a straight ripoff of [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/226/Elfen_Lied]["Elfen Lied"]]. I was never able to slog through the first five chapters or so of /A Black Comedy/, so I'm not aware of this exact ability. In any case, that anime is okay and the manga is quite good, if you happen to be looking for more invisible hands action (though that certainly wasn't exactly what you said you were looking for in your post).

Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose][Dagger and Rose]] brings an extended system of magic to Harry Potter and explains within the context of that system much of the difference between ordinary wizards and the likes of Voldemort and Dumbledore. Also, Harry's becoming Dumbledore's apprentice and learning this magical system makes him the target of a secret society who seeks to protect such magic. This leads to his life being screwed over pretty badly.

Miranda Flairgold's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/][A Second Chance at Life]] and sequels also vastly extend the Harry Potter magical system with other parallel systems of magic. While Harry is over-the-top (his defeat of Voldemort is an afterthought compared with the more serious threats), there are plenty of others far more buff than he.

You might be able to appreciate another of nonjon's stories, the novella [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7395979/1/Whatever-Happened-to-the-Likely-Lad][Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad]], where another magical system is developed alongside the canon HP one.

Actually, it was homage to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Octopus][Doc Ock]] from Spiderman. (nonjon is not much of an anime/manga fan.)

**** Good suggestions, I'll check those out. I think I started reading Dagger and Rose, don't remember if I (or the author) finished it or not (just checked, I did, they sort of didn't -- it just ends "artistically").

Doc Ock makes sense, though his extra arms (usually) aren't invisible.

***** It's also a riff off of 'The Long Arm of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Hamilton][Gil Hamilton]]', a classic collection of sci-fi short stories from Larry Niven about a detective who has an invisible telekinetic arm.

*** Well, thanks for the recommendation of manga.

As for the powers being too powerful, I'd of course prefer balance unlike in the Black Comedy (While it was stated that people got mastery of spells on occasion like Harry, Harry was the sole modern person with an ability of that level. It wasn't really all powerful, it had limits of distance, and the invisible hands didn't save him from the veil of death despite his best efforts. In essence, all it did for the most part was allow him to use rubble and such to block curses, and allow him easy victory in very close combat which isn't the norm for wizards duels; since typically they're far longer ranged than he'd be able to use the hands offensively)

I wouldn't mind seeing Voldie having an mastery as well as Harry, such as being able to rip out the souls/magic of people and ingest their magic adding it to their own for instance (Which happens in the Bearers of the Light duology ) (And while it isn't said in the duology, I'm theorizing it's his vast experience, knowledge and such with the Avada Kedavra spell allowed him to do so), I'm all for a semi-fair fight.
