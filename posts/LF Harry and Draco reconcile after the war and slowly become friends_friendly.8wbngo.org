I'm not looking for something where Harry and Draco are just magically super nice to each other for no real reason; ideally, it should start off with them still not liking each other at all, but having a slight understanding with each other (sort of like the end of DH).

Perhaps Draco gets a job at the Ministry so he has to see Harry often, or Harry is assigned to monitor Draco's probation terms. Something that introduces a nice set up for how they could begin to interact more and slowly become friendlier with each other.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

  Why did Harry Potter nod in greeting to Draco Malfoy when he saw the man on the platform 19 years later? Ron and Hermione were clearly not on such terms with the man. What secret did the two men share from even their own families?

** The Redemption Series by FarenMaddox starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3662420/1/Save-Me][Save Me]]. The sequels and companion stories can be found in the author's profile. I don't remember very much since it's been awhile since I read them, but I really enjoyed them. I remember being skeptical at first because I don't usually read Harry and Draco friendship stories (I prefer slash) but these were so well done that I didn't care that it wasn't slash.

** This is an adorable and hilarious oneshot that results in slash (HP/DM), but it definitely fits your criteria. It takes both of them a while to realize each other is an interesting person when given a chance, not just an annoyance. Regarding the slash, if you want to skip it stop when spoiler they first kiss, you only miss the last 3 paragraphs of the story

  Memories of the war are still fresh, which is all the excuse Decent People need to do appalling things. In this quietly waged conflict, Draco Malfoy is happy to be on the right side of things for once, and even happier to find he's not alone.

** They /hated/ each other at Hogwarts. /Hated./ What would make them suddenly become friends? It was Draco' house where they were captured, Draco let Death Eaters into /freaking Hogwarts/. He has the Dark Mark. There is no way to reconcile these things a friendship is just not feasible.

Furthermore Draco should either be in Azkaban or thrown through the veil not working at the ministry. Justice must be done; Draco is not exempt from this. He willingly joined a group of Nazis that committed horrific crimes, one cannot forget or overlook this.

#+end_quote

That's the entire point of this post. They aren't supposed to be all buddy-buddy overnight, it should be a slow-burn where their past history is brought up. You're exactly right that Draco did bad things, but he's a victim as well in many ways, and one of the nice things about fanfiction is that we can explore this.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

While this may bring up bad memories for Harry, this really isn't Draco's fault.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It is hinted upon/stated that Draco doesn't have much of a choice regarding Death Eater activities. Narcissa outright states that Voldemort doesn't /really/ expect Draco to succeed at his task, it's a way of punishing Lucius (and by extension, Narcissa) for Lucius' repeated failures. If Draco dies in his task, the Malfoys have received their punishment; if Draco succeeds, well that's just a stroke of good luck for Voldemort. Doesn't Draco also outright tell Dumbledore in the astronomy tower that if he doesn't do as he's told, then Voldemort will kill him? If Draco were truly as malicious in his actions as you say, he would have sold out Harry and Co. at Malfoy Manor in a heartbeat, not cover for them.

This doesn't excuse his actions, and most fics (that I've read, at least) acknowledge this in some form. While Draco may not be sitting in Azkaban, most writers seem to agree that the Malfoys who won't be sent to Azkaban (because really, Lucius is definitely going) should be placed under house arrest, pay asinine fines, restrict their usage/ownage of a wand, etc. This leads to another interesting point.

Wizarding Britain would seem to have some systemic issues relating to the Voldemort wars, and blood status in general. There are those in the ministry who, while not literal Death Eaters, definitely hold blood-supremacist views and aren't particularly shy about it. Dolores Umbridge comes to mind. It's not unreasonable to assume that not everyone involved with the Death Eaters is told: "Azkaban or Veil, flip a coin." Draco's crimes are comparatively minor to other Death Eaters such as his father, Bellatrix, or Greyback (technically not a Death Eater, but may as well be for the purpose of this post). What if Draco was able to escape heavy punishment, and instead receive only moderate punishment? There are many ways to explain why Draco is a "free" man after the war.

*** All the same, DM/HP is a pretty mainstream pairing. Most of the time people just focus on either hp/dm before Draco did any bad stuff, or Draco was forced to bring death eaters in hogwarts. If you really think that this can't be overlooked then just include a fanfic that doesn't have Draco bring death eaters into Hogwarts and join them. Its Fanfiction for a reason, doesn't have to be exact same as canon

**** I agree. There is a chance for redemption before these things occur. The OP wants fics that take place after the war. There is no feasible scenario where Draco is not imprisoned after the 2nd Wizarding War.

TLDR: OP wanted post war fics which by then Draco cannot be redeemed.

****** Somehow the Malfoys get off scot free; Lucius, Draco, and Narcissa have nothing happen to them. This is a plot hole. You cannot tell me that they are not at least imprisoned for their actions in the war, that makes zero sense.

The epilogue is canon but the Malfoys escaping justice is for sure an oversight.
