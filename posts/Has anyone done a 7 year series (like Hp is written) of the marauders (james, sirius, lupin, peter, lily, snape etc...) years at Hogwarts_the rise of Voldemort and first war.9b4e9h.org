** linkao3(all the young dudes)

If you don't mind Sirius/Remus, this is a fantastic AU that has been going through all seven years of Hogwarts from Remus' perspective. And now beyond! /But/ it's AU in that Remus grew up in an orphanage. It doesn't change Sirius/James/etc. backstory. Just Remus', so it changes his character arc. He's still somewhat the Remus we know and love. But with lots of internal angst.

Implying canon!Remus lacks internal angst?! Are you on crack?

I shudder at the thought that someone thinks "Yeah, what this character needs is even more angst."

**** Well he has /even more angst/ because "I'm a werewolf" wasn't enough. "I'm homeless, parentless, moneyless" and "I'm gay in the 1970s" are also added bonus angsts.

To be fair, it's all dealt with very well.

  VERY LONG fic charting the Marauder's time at Hogwarts from Remus' POV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges.Eventual wolfstar, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! On the plus side, I do update very often (sometimes twice a week, sometimes daily).HOGWARTS YEARS COMPLETE! - Will be starting on the War Years next :)***WINNER of the 2017 Marauder Medal, 'Best Work in Progress' by the Shrieking Shack Society!***

** linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi) is amazing. It goes through all of Snape's school years, exploring his character and what drove him to be a Death Eater. The writing is very well done, and I've re-read it several times.

  This is the story of four boys. This is the story of how these four boys came to know each other, of how they became friends. This is the story of their unbreakable bond that could survive any test. This is a story that will ultimately end in tragedy.
