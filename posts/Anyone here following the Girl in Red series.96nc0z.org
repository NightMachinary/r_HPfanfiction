Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Girl in Red). I liked this when I first started it, thinking it was a light hearted crackish fic along the lines of natural 20. But shits gotten dark, and damn, I hate Rose. She's actually a really, horrible person. She's a compulsive liar, and....is actually a grown-up in a child's body. No, she's not a vampire, she just apparently chooses not to age and to act like a kid. Including going to school with and befriending a bunch of 11 year olds.....if she were a guy, that would seem so much creepier. It still is creepy as fuck.

Not to mention what she's done to those kids. She's nearly killed most if not all of them....multiple times. She nearly fried Hermione's brain, and almost ruined her magic. She traumatized Neville on an unbelievable scale. She's turned Sally-Anne into a)a horrible little prig who has mind reading and manipulation powers, and abuses the heck out of them, and b)someone who feels obliged to fix everyone's social problems. At age 15, she feels she, and she alone, is responsible for /everyone's/ emotional wellbeing.

Lets not even mention the really fucking raw deal Ron got. I'm still following this story, but goddamn, I understand why future Hermione hates her. It's now a tragedy instead of a comedy.

Anyway, I just had to vent a little bit about just how messed-up a person the main character is.


** I do read it, and I love it. Rose is sort of mad, and it's true she's arguably more dangerous than beneficial to her friends, but I don't see anything creepy about her as such. It's clear there's nothing sexual about her befriending the kids, so between the fact that she's more a kid than a grown-up psychologically anyway, and that I don't see the problem with a grown-up/child friendship anyway if it works out for everyone involved...

And I don't find Sally-Anne insufferable at all. Yes, if she were real she'd probably annoy me for being such a busybody, but within the prism of fiction I don't find her to be an unlikable protagonist; she's just a mostly-good character with deep-running personality flaws, which is usually considered a /good/ thing to have in a story.

  Thrust into a world that makes no sense, Rose must earn the trust of the professors, keep her friends out of danger, and have fun doing it.
