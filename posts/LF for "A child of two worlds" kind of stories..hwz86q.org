Are there any good stories where Harry has a child with someone from an entirely different fandom?( Marvel universe, DC comics, other books from different authors, etc.)

Thank you in advance!


** Linkffn(13508654) might suit your criteria. It isn't great but a decent if flat time waster.

  Elia Martell expected to die in King's Landing. Harry Potter had died in his war. Two strangers are thrown together through some force. Raising three kids is hard, raising two of them to eventually rule a kingdom even harder, especially when you're trying to find a way to Westeros. Cross-posted on AO3.
