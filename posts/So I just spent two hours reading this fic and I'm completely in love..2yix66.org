It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11084039/1/History-in-the-Making][History in the Making]] and it's on ff.net which I know a lot of people on Tumblr hate because most of the stories on there are pure crack but I was going through the marauder era fics and clicked on this. I was a bit unsure of it at first because it has OCs paired with Remus and Sirius and Snape, but it's actually pretty awesome!


** What people on Tumblr think is totally irrelevant. When I think of a HP fanfic community, they don't even make the list. Not to mention the whole site is filled with what I frankly consider a waste of digital storage to the point where its blacklisted on my work and personal firewalls.

** Wait I'm confused, people on Tumblr hate ff.net because of the large amounts of crack? On what fucking planet is having 90% of stories be arbitrarily slash or gender bend the lesser of two amounts of crack? Fuck Tumblr anyway the majority of them couldn't write a solid plot for a babbys first story let alone a whole hpff novel.

**** Tumblr mostly does links to other sites, although occasionally you will see drabbles (stories with a short word count). Some are okay, but if you go looking for them all you'll find is garbage. It's got to come out of the blue.

**** Pronouns and trigger warnings. "Oh no it talks about crowds of people and might trigger agorophobes, better put a tw! Oh no it talks about a race of slaves better put a tw for pocs! Oh no all the main characters are white might trigger SJWS better put a tw!" It's fucking moronic.

***** The thing is, I've never seen a trigger warning for agoraphobes. The fanfictions I've seen that /do/ have trigger warnings usually have them for rape or child abuse - which I imagine could very well be triggering for survivors of such things (let's not forget that a lot of child abuse survivors display symptoms of PTSD). So I'm not entirely sure what your problem with trigger warnings is, to be honest.

** Tumblr mostly likes AO3, I think. I've only read one story on there, and it was a modern-day Wolfstar where Remus and Sirius met after texting a wrong number. It was actually a really beautiful love story, but so far AU that it can hardly be considered Harry Potter. Still, my heart melted.

I might check this one out. Thanks.

** Oh wow, I didn't know there would be a huge debate about tumblr here, ha. I just know the people that I follow specifically are like, "ew no ff.net" and they love AO3. I prefer fanfic.net because I can simplify searches better.

BUT ANYWAY.

I came here to say that the story was updated this evening, and of all days for the writer to throw a curveball for Remus Lupin, she HAD TO DO IT ON HIS BIRTHDAY. UGH. I was already having Remus feels but this is just...I can't.

** There are 700,000+ HP fanfics on ff.net. I figure we can cut them a little slack just for the utility that provides.
