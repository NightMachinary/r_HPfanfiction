Looking for any fics of the Harry Potter school years from Snape's point of view.

Failing that anything from his point of view during the Marauder years or any other part of his life is totally fine too :-) But I'm particularly interested in his P.O.V. of the Harry Potter years.

Any pairing, rating etc is totally fine. If I don't like something I'll just move on to something else, no worries.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]] is my favorite fanfic. The Harry Potter years start at around chapter 32 if I remember correctly, but it covers all of Snape's life. It's a heavier read than most, but is rewarding.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] by Arsinoe de Blassenville is excellent, an AU with many segments told from Snapes POV. 213k words, complete. The sequel is 109k words, also complete.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva.
