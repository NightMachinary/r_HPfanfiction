** It's not a bad little short, though it seems to read more as a teaser than as a complete story. You mix technology and magic, which also seems like an interesting teaser since it feels like it is missing the world building behind it.

My only real complaint about it is the speaking at the end, mostly because it makes me twitch when that type of english gets mixed up. Without knowing exactly what you wanted to say, I'd rewrite it like this:

=As death looms upon thee, and the abyss stares back, know that he that truly wills shall succeed in any mission. Thou shalt not falter, thou wilt try, even though thou shalt cry, and thou shalt die.=
