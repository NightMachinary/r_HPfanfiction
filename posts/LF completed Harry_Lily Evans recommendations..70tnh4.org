Best if fics focuses on the pairing instead of turning it to a harem fic.


** I was thinking of writing a Harry/Lily time-travel fic where Lily and Harry are in their sixth or seventh year (before Lily cares about James), but I feel like a ton of people would judge me.

#+begin_quote
  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in 'subject to entanglement').

**** I can't remember all of them off the top of my head, but the ones that do stand out to me are: linkffa(Harry Potter and the Future Remapped by Shezza88) linkffn(12628886) Dragon Lily and Future Remapped are two that I enjoyed because of the length of the fics. The quality varied, but there was enough for me to become somewhat attached.

Throwing Out the Script linkffn(9762328) I liked the amusing interactions and the setup, but it ended before it got into the meat of anything really. Hair of the Grim linkffn(9504137) I was really looking forward to this one because it was such an interesting premise and the writing was pretty good. Unfortunately it too stopped way too early.

Basically I enjoyed what I read of the two shorter ones enough that they still hang out in my mind. I wish there was more written for them :(

  One year into Voldemort's rein, a confrontation with the Dark Lord catapults the Boy-Who-Lived into 1975. Will he be content to sit around and let the past repeat itself? Absolutely not.

  They say there are many things a wizard shouldn't do while ridiculously drunk; flying, apparition, and testing unknown spells just to name a few. But as the BWL just learned, listening to one of your equally as drunk godfather's 'brilliant ideas' is another one of the things you just shouldn't do. DISCONTINUED
