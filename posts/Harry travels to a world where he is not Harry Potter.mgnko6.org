:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading this fic where Harry travels to a world where he is not HP, the Potters are alive and Lily teaches at Hogwarts. Sirius and Remus are together and have a kid. The Harry Potter of this world is a bully, who forces Sirius and Remus's son to help him with pranks. Neville is the BWL, and is flanked by Hermione and Ron. Our traveler Harry is a Runes prodigy, and takes his exams early to become an apprentice to Professor Babbling. He soon befriends Siri-Rem's kid, and meets James, Sirius and Remus in the Ministry.

Anyone read it before?

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
