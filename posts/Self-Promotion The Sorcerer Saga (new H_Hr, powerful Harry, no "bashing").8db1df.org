** What's Hermione's role in this? I don't really care about yet another "damsel in distress" "Love interest" "moral support" Hermione paired with an OP Harry. What about Ron? Does he play a role at all?

*** me neither, Hermione will be a powerhouse of her own rigth, however, in my story Harry's enviroment force him to grow up faster and he learns to look after himself, at the startpoint of the fic Hermione is "canon Hermione" or at least as close as I can imagine her, so yes she will have her "damsel in distress" moment with the troll (even though there will be a clear difference in how it happens and how it affects her)

If everything goes according to plan, Hermione will be having quite the bite by year 3 and will be perfectly capable in figthing side by side with Harry by year 4, just understand that it will be gradual. In fact, as far as character grows goes, I think it will be more marked in her than Harry

**** You may want to rethink your stance on the Troll Incident somewhat. I'm not bothered by it, but some people /hate/ repeats of the Troll Incident in fics and might be turned away from your (otherwise, apparently, quite good!) fic. May I suggest you think of some other monster Quirrell and Riddle might bring in, to bring in some variety?

***** you know, that's a damn good idea, I really wan't there to be an incident that day, I was so focused of imagining a diferent scenario with the same "actors" that it didn't even occur to me that the essential is not the troll but a "mosnter", I'll have to research some mythology... It has to be a slow and big monster though, otherwise the scenario simply won't hold

*** O.o lol this is..., I've a lot of work to do it seems.

I won't deny that "For the Love of Magic" have been a huge influence for me, after all, I consider it to be the most entretaining fic out there, but it will not be a copy of that.

thx for the tips, english is not my first language and I know that I have to improve

Movie Hermione does not have any flaws, because she is absolutely perfect from the beginning.

***** /Grows up/ prettier. My impression has always been that in /Philosopher's Stone/ young, bushy-haired, thick-eyebrowed Emma Watson was spot-on (except if you subscribe to the Black!Hermione theory, which is another can of worms entirely), but she physically grew out of it quickly.

****** Well, Hermione's pretty in the books as well - she simply doesn't care that much about her appearance, usually. But the whole Yule Ball stairs scene wouldn't work if she couldn't be stunning with some effort.

******* I don't think she's described as pretty in the books with the sole exception of the Yule Ball. Is she? I think I read somewhere, I could be wrong about this, that JK Rowling /initially/ didn't want to cast Emma Watson as Hermione Granger because she didn't want someone pretty for the role.

********* She's not, you're right about that, but I was always under the impression that Hermione was average looking. Someone who wouldn't stand out in a crowd, whereas a pretty person /might/. She's pretty, beautiful even, when she takes care of her appearance, like the Yule Ball, but throughout the series, we are told that she usually doesn't care much for it, only under special circumstances.

******** I actually agree with Starfox5, you woulnd't believe how an usually "average" face can change with a little bit of care,

but anyway in my fic, Hermione will be "cute" at the begining (13 years old) and will grow to be atractive in a badass kinda way
