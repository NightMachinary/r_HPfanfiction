And considering that they didn't take their Divination homework seriously at all and mostly came up with either jokes or tragedies, that could make a good crackfic.

*** Exactly, but considering the predictions require them to be alive to the end of the month (& other months), they would just narrowly survive. And they get so tired of it that finally they're all like: "Oh my Merlin, there's a wild gryphon in the Great Hall and he's searching for you two!" "Oh, well, didn't that happen on Saturday?" "I think it was harpy then" "Ah."

** That's not even a crack fic. It's canon. Pretty much everything that Ron and Harry ever predicted in class while they were trying to take the subject seriously came true. Pretty much everything TRELAWNY predicted came true as well. The first lesson in Divination spoiled what would happen at the end of the book

They do tea leaves. Harry gets a blob like a bowler hat: the Ministry interfering at Hogwarts with the Dementors, or possibly Harry meeting the Minister at the beginning of the year, establishing a timeline. The hat turns into an acorn, a windfall, unexpected gold in his near future. Harry gets sent a Firebolt anonymously later in the year. Next Harry gets the falcon, a mortal enemy is nearby. Hermione guesses Voldemort, but we know in hindsight this must be Peter. Then Harry gets the club, danger is approaching. He's attacked by Dementors in the very next Quidditch match. The club then becomes the skull, mortal danger. The Dementors swarming at the end of the book, and Remus transforming. Then finally the grim. Sirius Black.

The tea leaves in their very first lesson not only spoiled the entire events of the coming year, but arguably did it in correct sequential order, or at least roughly the correct order. In theory, the acorn should have come after the club, because he got the Firebolt after his broom was wrecked, but Sirius would have needed to start arranging the purchase and shipment of it sooner, particularly since he needed to do so anonymously, so the cup may have actually called out the "true" order of events, which is that Sirius was in the process of buying the broom for Harry before his Nimbus was ever destroyed.

Divination is absolutely not a hoax. It works just fine. Both Harry AND Ron have "the gift," they have it in canon. That is 100% real and absolutely true. Harry, Ron, and even Trelawny all have the gift of true sight. Only Hermione seems not to.

*** I don't think that it's a hoax in itself but it's too general to be reliable. Kind of like if you listen to the horoscope or go to a tarot reader, some things will match in reality if you force your mind enough to make the connections.

**** No tarot reader in real life does anything like what divination can do in Harry Potter. Almost everything that was said in Trelawny's class that wasn't Ron and Harry faking their work came true, often in the exact order and timeline it was mentioned in. The two people who know the MOST about magic in-universe, Dumbledore and Voldemort, acknowledge it. Voldemort, who obsessed about learning obscure magic and becoming greater than anyone else, had seen things in his life that made him */absolutely certain/* that divination was legitimate: Voldemort's faith in divination and prophecy is the crux of the entire plot of the story.

Likewise, Dumbledore was on the verge of discontinuing the subject at Hogwarts, yes, but in his own words, that's only because he does not believe it is something that can truly /be taught./ Dumbledore canonically didn't put any stock in the prophecy between Harry and Voldemort, he said himself that he felt it was a self-fulfilling prophecy. But he never stated the opinion that the art of divination was wrong or even unreliable. It is McGonagall who argued that, not Dumbledore.

Our own experiences with the art support both Dumbledore and Voldemort's opinions simultaneously: McGonagall is simply wrong. One way or another, the prophecy Trelawny gave came true. It was a real prophecy, and it accurately predicted a sequence of events that literally NO ONE saw coming: that Voldemort would be defeated, but not destroyed, by an infant. Voldemort was right to fear and respect the creation of a prophecy regarding him. Likewise, Dumbledore seems quite correct to suppose that the art cannot be taught. You either have the talent or you don't. Harry and Ron picked up tea cups on their very first lesson without having the foggiest idea what they were doing, and */accurately predicted the events for the entire next year, in the order they would occur./* All either of them needed was a single book with pictures of symbols and lists of meanings next to them, to effectively decrypt what they were seeing, and they were set. That's it. A person with the talent needs nothing more than a reference encyclopedia to accurately make forecasts and divinations of the future: someone without the talent, like Hermione and presumably McGonagall, simply cannot be helped. Likewise, true prophecies like what Trelawny occasionally gives are random and cannot be taught, either. You either give them or you don't.

Voldemort is right about prophecy. It should be treated cautiously, because it can be a serious danger to yourself and others. Dumbledore, too, is right about prophecy; it is not something that can truly be taught, like transfiguration or potioneering, and while we don't know if all true prophecies are self-fulling ones, the one that is central to the series most certainly is. Both of them are correct, their opinions are not mutually exclusive. It is McGonagall that is wrong. And that's the humor of it. Her opinion is the most prevalent and common one, but it is also the one that's wrong. Divination was giving answers to serious questions and spoiling the plot from the very start, but only the readers were really in any sort of position to appreciate that or notice it happening.

***** I agree and disagree. There definitely is true Divination that cannot be taught and it manifests in the form of prophecies recorded in the Hall of Prophecies. IIRC Dumbledore himself points out that Trelawney's not aware of the two accurate prophecies she made. All the other things require a very open mind because those symbols could mean anything that you could correlate with a real event in retrospective. Quite like tarot cards or horoscope in real life. I would say that Hermione and McGonagall who are pragmatic and only care about clear information were bad at it because they refused to open their mind towards it. Dumbledore is more open minded than most characters but even he treats some of that stuff with a grain of salt. Like when Trelawney predicts that Lupin won't be with them anymore for long, Dumbledore just dismisses it, even though it's ironically true because of the curse on the DADA position.

What if Fudge didn't wear bowler hats? What would the tea show then, the British equivalent of a DMV form? Or if it still showed the same shape, would it still mean the same thing?

These kind of interpretations are always funny to me, it's all just really arbitrary pattern-seeking - but that's not even so much in reference to the books but life in general

*** not just that, a ton of what Ron says ends up being true one way or another.

While it was a joke from Fred and Geogre, he did mention wrestling a troll before they got sorted.

He joked that Tom Riddle got his special award for killing Myrtle.

fourth book: *"'She wants a new angle, Hagrid,' said Ron, wisely as he shelled salamander eggs. 'You were supposed to say Harry's a mad delinquent!'"*\\
Look at what came about in the fifth book.

fourth book: he offered that it was Crouch who attacked Krum near the forbidden forest. He was right, just the wrong Crouch in mind.

Seriously. I am 100 % convinced Ron is a secret seer.
