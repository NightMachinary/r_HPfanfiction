I have read linkffn(The Sum of their parts) and was left wanting more. I would prefer fics with similar themes that Harry is just standing up for what is right rather than wanting power or revenge Well written fics only pls no fem Harry And if the fic has slash or any romance it has to be well written most of what I have read makes me cringe and ruins the fic

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** I read an interesting one before about Harry becoming a dark lord postwar! No pairings. But I don't think it fits into the criteria of his motivation being that he wants to stand up for what is right... The premise was that Harry, after being AK'ed in the final battle, felt that he lost a part of himself when he lost the horcrux (which, after having it for his whole life, was sorta seen as a part of him).

He was slowly going mentally unhinged postwar (but hid it well), and (if I remember correctly), felt better the more he used Dark spells - but nothing could fill the void in him after his own soul was damaged.

It also had an MoD premise in it where he realised he couldn't age. The road to being a Dark Lord was taken in secret at first, and only after years was found out in the most heartbreaking manner by Hermione.

It was a one-shot (or least within only a few chapters, and I think there was a sequel where Hermione tried to solve his MoD-undead problem?), but I'm having trouble recalling it cos I don't save fics I read lol. Anyone who remembers it, please link it for OP!

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
