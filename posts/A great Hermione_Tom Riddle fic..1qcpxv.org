  This fic needs trigger warnings for a few reasons. Violence, mainly. Abuse (happens, when your male lead is a psychopath).
#+end_quote

Does Tom dominate over Hermione in their relations or they are equal in their powers?

**** My quote was from the same A/N, so I've read it.

There can be abusive relations where both sides (including the abuser) try to overcome it and there can be such where one side assigns a victim mentality to him-/ herself and the abuser just enjoys the overall situation.

*** They're actually pretty equal in their abilities especially in intelligence.
