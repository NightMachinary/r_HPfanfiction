** First off, you're right - places like Arizona and Africa and the Carribean have awful summers that are so hot that us ordinary English folk would just melt into a puddle on the ground.

But all of these places have something that Britain doesn't: relief from the heat.

Britain is literally never prepared for a hot summer, so when it invariably arrives, we're left stranded with absolutely no way to cope. In the US, for instance, you can go into any building and 99/100 times it'll have AC. The only comparable relief in Britain is find a supermarket and go to the fridge/freezer aisles.

Furthermore, Britain just isn't used to heat. Part of the reason that we don't have AC is that, for the vast majority of the year, most of us are using heating instead. We're far more accustomed to the cold and rain that we are for the 3/4 weeks of the year which are hot.

So, yeah, you're right that you get it worse than we do - but as a country, and as a culture, we have no coping infrastructure for heat, and even less acclimitisation to it.

**** The vast majority of people in Britain don't have AC, nope. It puts a different spin on living with heat when there's no respite from it.

***** I will retract my comment about the bitching. I thought this was like people in Washington (state) complaining about the heat to Arizonans where we all have ac. That's fucking brutal

****** The thing you've got to consider is that it's only really hot here for about 3 weeks, and then it slips back into our norm of chilly to freezing cold weather. As a result, literally everyone has central heating, but no one is ever prepared for the heat when it hits. But yeah, those 3 weeks can be fucking cruel - everyone in Britain complains about the bad weather until the good weather comes, and then everyone enjoys it for a couple of days, until we realise that we were in no way prepared for this /oh god make it cold again/, rinse and repeat every 12 months.

***** The vast majority of people in Europe (perhaps except for Italy, Spain, and similar parts) don't have AC. For most of us, the default problem is too cold, rather than too hot.

Also, not sure why, there is a way less humidity everywhere in Europe, which means that nights are very cool. When living in Boston, Ma. (yes, it has weather nothing like The Deep South; we lived there fore five years while studying) surviving heat waves without AC was a way more difficult than hot summers in Europe, because of humidity ... when you cannot sleep well for many days because it is 33Â°C in 3 a.m. in your bedroom, you get really grumpy.

****** It's not weird, it's just built for a climate that is now changing. My house was built back when people could ice skate on the Thames and they held markets on it. It would never freeze over like that now.
