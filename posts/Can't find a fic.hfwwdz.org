:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was looking for a fic that I've read in the past. It's pretty much hermione, draco and harry become best friends but draco is trans so hermione and harry help with the transition period. They meet on the train and hermione gives draco a set of uniform and harry helps with the hair and makeup. I don't know if I read it on AO3 or [[https://FF.net][FF.net]]. Pls help


** I'm laughing at either Harry or Hermione being able to help anybody with their hair (or makeup).

Do you have old URL? WHo was the author? Would it be on ff2ebook.com?
