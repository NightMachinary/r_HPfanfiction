I just randomly thought this,


** MC's patronus is a dementor and everyone's like "wait, but that doesn't, WHAT?!"

[EDIT] this could end up as an absurd comedy routine or an Edgy IndyDarkHarry Fic Number 42905786 and I would infinitely prefer the comedy routine

  Edgy IndyDarkHarry Fic Number 42905786
#+end_quote

"Ow, the edginess," Harry deadpanned, "This fic is so edgy I cut myself on it."\\
Indeed, as Ron watched, dozens of little cuts and slices appeared on Harry's skin, giving him an appearance as though he had been mauled by a tiger made of sharp-edged paper.\\
"I'm still wondering why there's an Imitation Cuts & Bruises Charm in my cosmetics guide." Hermione muttered.\\
"For emos, probably." Ron muttered back.

***** linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw).

It's an AU time travel WBWL story with lordships, political 11 year olds, and a harem. And somehow all those tropes work well together. Read it, it's actually quite a good story.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

**** Is there a list of potential animagus forms the Pottermore quiz can/could give you? Obviously it wouldn't be exhaustive, but I feel like it's a safe assumption that if a magical animagus form was possible, there would be at least one or two as super-duper-rare possibilities.
