There was a story I read a while ago where Harry and Draco get sent back in time and become death eater spies. Not slash but they become friends. Theyre fighting Voldemort when a spell hits him and Draco, sending them into the past. They then join Voldemort and Kill him after he sends the spell at them in the future..?

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...
