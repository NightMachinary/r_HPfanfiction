I'm looking for anything where the Hogwarts teachers get their act together and don't gloss over student problems. Could be as small as setting up more clubs, actual showing of office hours. Or the teachers realizing Dumbledore is recruiting child soldiers and that's just bad.

I've read a few along those lines ages ago, but it wasn't in the foreground as much.

** This is one of my favorite genres.

I always recommend this, but The Best Revenge linkffn(4912291) is a great example! The professors are reasonable, responsible, and competent adults without being OOC. Snape and McGonagall intervene when Harry's Hogwarts letter is sent and stay involved. People actually communicate with each other, with little to no idiot-ball. Extremely well-written.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

There's more staff, more classes (e.g. Math for 1st and 2nd years) and lots of clubs. And most importantly Snape isn't in charge of teaching the younger years.

Sadly not complete

** Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

In this fic, a lot of the canon problems are prevented by the simple solution of "ask Dumbledore/a teacher for help". For example, the dragon Hagrid gets in his first year? Turns out, Kettleburn has a license to hatch them and Hogwarts could use a mascot if she's properly housebroken.

They're also not afraid to turn this on other teachers (see: Umbridge) - when Harry brings up the targeted detentions she dishes out for things the students can't help, Dumbledore and McGonagall rule-patch until Umbridge runs out of ways to target the unusual-needs students (and when I say unusual-needs, I mean three of them are /a three-headed dog/. It's a crack-premise-treated-somewhat-seriously).

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
