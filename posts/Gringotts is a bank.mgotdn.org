Not a place to buy goblin rituals, secret goblin swords, or watch goblins fight each other to the death. They're a bank. And if they're smart, they wouldn't have inheritance tests that give away money they could keep for themselves. Don't get me started on “Friend of the Goblin Nation” after you compliment the clerk's dress.

** I mostly agree with you but I could really see goblins that are investment advisors. So that they would get hired to do investments or get a certain percentage of profit. Then inheritance tests wouldn't be far fetched. (And they are against thieves, the money would probably only lie in the vault when there is no one to claim it)

*** But neither inheritance, or banking works like that.

You have a vault, and when you dies, it goes either to the person named in your will, and your closest relative, even if he has a different name. Just like the Gaunts were the descendants of the Slytherins, and inherited their fortune at a point. If someone dies without any close relative, there are still some farther relatives, or the Ministry could easily seize the goods.

Also, the Goblins own a bank, they sell Bank Vault. As long as you pay for your vault, they don't give a shit about what's inside. Assuming they could use the money from inside a vault to pay for it, an ownerless vault would be the best kind of vault for them, since it means money without having to either provide a service (just like the Gyms owners love the "New year, New me" clients that buy a yearly subscription and stop showing up after 2 weeks).

​

Also, I hate inheritance tests. I could understand if it was some kind of magical DNA test (/ok, both of you put a drop of blood in the bowl and . . . match, Sir, that's your son/), but every time it's the same drop of blood on a piece of paper that explains that Harry is the Heir of 50 Families with a 2000 words paragraph about how he is so rich and has so many palaces in cool place like Greece.\\
Not to mention the whole "You are related to . . . Ravenclaw". Greeeeat, like most Pureblood since we are all cousins, but it's not like it would bring anything. I am 99% sure I am a descendant of Charlemagne (like pretty much everyone in Western Europe), But even if I made and proved the blood relation, I doubt people would agree to give me the throne of France since :

1. The guys lived 1200 years ago and all of his possessions have already been passed around his descendants
2. Even if the Carolingien throne was still in place, I would probably be around 300 000 000th in the line of succession.

**** Maybe not investment advisors but I go to the bank for more reasons than to get money. But I also could see goblins not going beyond "this is your vault, pay for it and we hold it secure" I just thought that some additional services wouldn't be completely nonsensical.

And I definitely see your point on inheritance tests. Maybe I've read this fics to often... Blood seems to have some significance in the magical world but realistically (if you can even say that in a world with magic) I definitely don't see the -drop blood on parchment and get a detailed biography, every magical power you possess and some weird magic blocks

Another person mentioned curse breaking but I'm really not sure about the goblins that aren't in Gringotts (should there be any in Wizarding Britain) and what their culture looks like.

***** I see you point, and it's true that Gringott could have some additional activites outside of "Selling Vaults".

I am personally not a fan of them being "Financial Advisor" because I think the Magical Economy is too small to support this kind of investing (and I like to keep the Muggle and Magical worlds separated, so no wizard can make a killing by buying Microsoft of Apple shares). I also think that the Goblin "hate" the wizard, and that giving them a direct control over your money present at least a 50% risk of them making the worst possible investment just to ruin you.

If I really had to create some additional activites for Gringott (outside of the vaults and the already presented Curse Breaking/ Tomb Raiding), I think I would make them pretty similar to the medieval banks :

- A change service (even if the Wizarding World seem to have an unified currency, it may be appreciable for people going abroad to not be forced to carry on themselves hundreds or thousands of Galleons)
- An intermediary service (we can put you in contact with someone able to help you . . . for a fee)
- Some "direct" investments (rather than using Wizards money, Goblins use their own money to become owner, or co owner of a company like a mine, or tree farm or maybe even a reserve for magical beasts, anything able to bring them money).

Even ignoring that goblins have a different idea of ownership (goblin items are only loaned, so they'd love to snatch up anything that might be passed down) and that we /see/ who and what handles inheritances (Scrimgeour and the Ministry in HBP), banks have nothing to do with wills. They aren't lawyers.

It's one of the many strange FF tropes that I have no idea how they started, and how anyone thinking about it even for five seconds can consider this to make sense and use it in their story.

Now assuming that goblin bank works the same way as an American bank they would make more money off an active vault with transfer fees, yearly vault tax, oh you wanna and and second name to the account here's a service fee, etc. Now if a vault is unclaimed then it can produce no more Revenue which makes it useless to the bank, but using an inheritance test the goblins could make that wizard pay more fees for having two vaults.

****** The difference is that Gringotts physically stores gold. So if they do take a yearly fee for the storage and protection (which would be very reasonable), then there is nothing stopping them from just taking it from the vault directly -- until there is nothing left. At which point it's closed.They don't need to know or care about the owner for that.

And that is only if they don't have stipulations in their agreements that if there is no claim for a century, all the items inside belong to them. Which I could easily see, given the character and behaviour of Canon!goblins.

** Gringotts is a bank but goblins are not 'just bankers'. And seemingly, Gringotts is the representative front of goblins. So they can offer some side businesses for a hefty profit (not as part of the bank but as a third party negotiator).

To be honest, I like fics where goblins provide these extra services. And I totally love fics in which goblins take an active role (albeit in shadows) regarding the wizarding world. They are smart, proud and warrior minded.

** The Knight's Templar were also a bank, or at least as close to one as could exist in the high middle ages: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Knights_Templar]]

They also, you may be surprised to know, did a LOT of things other than banking.

Like with many things, JKR really did not include enough information for us to be certain on anything. I don't really remember the goblins being mentioned outside their connection to Gringotts, so you could argue its the public front for the race/nation as a whole, in which case it would be a sort of part bank, part embassy. And you could do a lot of things, both officially and unofficially, at an embassy.

But even if we take it at face value and say that Gringotts is just a bank and nothing else, modern banks over a lot more services than just banking. Of course there is stuff like credit and loans, but also investment and holding, retirement plans, currency creation and exchange, and, most relevant to fanfiction, they can be executors of wills. Its completely reasonable that in a magical society this could expand to other services, especially if they are viewed as being a neutral or uncorrupt third party.

** In my headcanon, Goblins have been providing banking service for sentient(magical) races because they have the right kind of mentality. I don't have a specific kind of it but something like this: Greedy but never outright steal, Rebel but never steal(seize) opponents' property, etc.

​

Sirius Black was able to extract a large sum of gold to buy Firebolt even though he was an escaped convict. Since the Gringott has been always the third party to the feud for thousands of years, they don't care whether Wizarding Government convicted someone or not. Others can do their own work, and Gringott just minds their own business.

​

Wizards use Gringott because they are largely free from Wizarding Governments' influence, and theft.

​

Gringott is producing Wizarding currency because Wizard magic cannot break their enchantment until now. Galleons are not just gold, but a currency that just happens to made by the gold. Wizards use galleons because they can forge, earn muggle kind of money so easily.

​

Gringott and other Wizards and Witches are largely forbidden to operate the business in the muggle world. It is more like 'don't get caught, but since Statute extortion of muggles are outlawed. This is to stop Wizards or other sentient beings from earn muggle money, buy raw materials, and wreak havoc in the Wizarding economy.

​

The only reason Gringott is granting muggle money to be exchanged at a seemingly crazy rate is because of the treaty. Goblins think forcing the poorly made paper to their beautiful coin is a blatant insult to their race for no good reason. Muggle loving Minister actually forced this after the rebellion because he wanted to insult Goblins and to show muggle parents that they are not actually considered useless... until magical children became an adult and realize reality.

​

Opposite to fanon, no muggle can set their filthy foot on the Gringotts. Muggleborn Minister tried to force the issue and almost induced rebellion. The idea is considered in the same context 'Centaurs can enter here, thus horse can enter here.

** For me I see Gringotts as the place the ministry pushes all the jobs they don't want to do themselves. The Goblins can't have won every war since the can't use wands and the rebellions are a back and forth between the two nations, where every wizarding win the ministry forces the Goblins to take on more of its dull jobs like record keeping ( in exchange for pay) and with every goblin win they push one of those jobs back onto the ministry.

As for the friend of the Gobins thing, I also view Gringotts as the goblin embassy and as such feel that such titles could be given but only for very extreme acts in favour of the Goblins, such as betraying the ministry to help them in a rebellion.

To me the Goblins are a puppet or vassal of the ministry that has been given far too much power and that could now (if it wanted to) collapse the wizards economy to gain its independence, though it currently finds the status quo to be acceptable.

**** Perhaps, but as can be seen throughout the magical world wands are not required for magic and simply act as a focus to aid in casting. I find goblins using it to simply mock magicals as rather strange ( though it is an amusing thought) since even they must see the benefit of easier access to more powerful and easier to cast magic, though it is likely that they don't care as much as the ministry think they do, especially since they have other arms in the form of melee weapons and their own species specific branch of magic.

While the Goblins have since proven to be a force to be reckoned with even without wands the ministry is still reluctant to return the right to them due to fears of how deadly they would be with them. Something the Goblins use to their advantage. During peace negotiations the Goblins always lead with the demand to utilize wands which causes the ministry to grant greater concessions than they would have done otherwise to try and avoid this.

** I like the concept of them doing inheritance tests. Maybe because they would rather the gold was moving and presumably making more, rather than moldering in a forgotten vault--or worse yet, being handed over the government entirely (isn't that what happens in the Muggle world? Abandoned accounts go to the government?).

AFAIK, the Wizarding World doesn't seem to have the myriad forms of advisors and service providers we do and thus it gets thrust on the goblins in a lot of stories. Experts in law (see all those will readings), providing private rooms and mediation services, specialists in everything from wards to rituals, etc, etc.

For the most part, I don't mind that so long as it's explained in-story and consistently used. I mind some of it a lot less if the goblins are charging, TBH. Fine, the concept of a Horcrux offends them? They'll destroy the Cup since it's polluting their vaults, but there will be a small charge for each one brought in--works for me. (I like a lot of the friendly goblins stories, but for a race that is so interested in the accumulation of wealth, I can't see them waiving that much. Lowering fees is more likely.)

In my own WIP, Harry gets lessons in finance from them, but offered to pay when he asked for them; they are charging him a fair (competitive?) price for private tutoring. They handle investments both Muggle and Magical, and he does have an account manager. I am running with a lot of tropes I mentioned above, but not relying on them very much. The goblins are not the only ones who can run an inheritance test, for example, but are considered the most reliable. A lawyer can handle will readings, but the great houses store their wills with Gringotts because the goblins can't be forced or intimidated into ignoring the clauses (and despite their love of gold, it's hard to bribe them). You can hire a private room or a ward expert (fearfully expensive, though) or business advisor. They do have international scope, but are not found in every part of the world, which can occasionally ease things but isn't a guarantee. They don't provide documents unrelated to the bank, so no coming up with fake yet valid Muggle IDs and passports, much less Wizardly ones. Oh, and a goblin healer did look at Harry's scar, but more in confirmation of what the other 2 had said. Not the normal thing, and Dumbledore is amazed upon hearing that, since he can only think of 5x a goblin healer was involved in human affairs, and 3 of them were in his history books.

[Although I toyed with a one shot where Harry was trying to find out what Gringotts could do for him, and it wasn't much. They did provide him with the name of a man who could make a complete set of documents with some interesting updating charms, though.]

** My personal headcanon is that Gringotts is a protection agency/business conglomerate for goblins. Since goblin culture highly values creation as a skill, the blood of master artisans is a vital ingredient in ancestry testing potions. After humans kept abducting and exsanguinating artisans, Gringotts formed as a protection agency and negotiated a deal to provide ancestry testing for a price. Most "goblin wars" consist of goblins hunting down someone "doing things the old way". Gringotts provides scholarships and apprenticeships for goblins in exchange for blood, as well as business connections. The stereotype about goblin greed stems from humans not realizing that the goblin they're meeting with isn't a member of Gringotts proper - they pay the goblin they're doing business with, along with paying the headhunting agency.

The vaults for humans arose when a particularly enterprising goblin realized they already have a fiercely guarded area and inheritance testing. Gringotts later began offering proper banking services, but those are entirely separate from the vault services. Most of the finance department finds the insistence on keeping all your money physically in a vault hilarious. Muggleborn families are read in after the first term of blood supremacy.

2. The very nature of a bank run by a certain race, that is primarily interacted with the world through the bank, that seem to live around the bank and not really elsewhere suggests there is much more to the Bank than just a bank. It kind of implies a lot more going on in the background.

** It might be more accurate to say that goblins like to collect treasures (see the cursebreakers, as was pointed out). The "bank" -- more accurately, the storage & protection service, i.e. offering safe deposit boxes to store precious items -- then follows as a natural, but somewhat afterthought-y consequence.

Of course, this still means they don't do all the other nonsense they do in many FF, yes.

Funnily enough, if they /were/ a regular bank -- i.e., doing, for example, asset management (which they /don't/, no, you can't invest in a magical stock market) -- I'd be more inclined to be lenient, because if I trust some of my more wealthy acquaintances, the poor bankers doing the asset management for sizeable fortunes have a tendency to double as a personal secretary for spoiled bratty clients.
