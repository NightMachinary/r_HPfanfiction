  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** That doesn't seem like such a good idea... It would kill QUirell, but not Voldemort, thus freeing Voldemort's spirit to run away to Albanian and sulk all over again. Much better to subdue Quirrell, thus keeping Voldemort trapped.

*** I have yet to see a story involving using potions in a smart way, and just using canon potions to stop any people from commenting on made up stuff.

Also, every author always tries to kill Voldemort, but what about just trapping the guy forever? Would be a more Evil way to just let him be immortal in a coffin.

As for the lameness that is the Horcrux, present them to a Dementor. They just suck out the soul without doing stupid things to destroy them. Never understood why not a single story uses it.

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, secrets are uncovered, and loopholes are delightfully abused.

**** I'm pretty sure Voldemort isn't forced to stay with his possessed victim until they die. At the very least we see him flee Harry's body after he possesses him in OotP. You could argue that Harry forced him out, but I always interpreted it as Him just running away after experiencing the unfamiliarity with Harry's emotions.

But, please, correct me if I'm wrong. I'm going with memory in this and I've read so much fanon...
