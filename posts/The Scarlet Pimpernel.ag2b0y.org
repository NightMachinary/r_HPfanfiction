Hi so, The Scarlet Pimpernel seems to have been deleted off of fanfiction.net and I wondered if anyone knew if there is another copy somewhere that I'm missing? It is one of my favorite portrayals of Percy, and I would love to read it again.


** You can view/download it from the Red Hen [[http://redhen-publications.com/pimpernel.html][here]], though it does have rather elaborate formatting.

*** Yeah, interesting design choices. It has the story though and that's what matters. Thank you!
