Im aware that HP had a long history of fanfiction. Im wondering if there any good fanfics that havent been posted on the standard archival sites, but still are worth a read this day an age.


** Try Spacebattle

There's a couple of interesting (but usually incomplete) SI fics there that I have read and like

Search by the tag Harry Potter or just do a google search with “spacebattle Harry Potter”

A couple of them subverts things by having the SI expecting canon only to see things subtly or dramatically change in comparison to canon

There was one where they started to realize with horror that the magic system was radically different from canon and that they shouldn't rely too much on their canon knowledge

** DrT is one of my favorite HP authors and their stuff is not on FFN/AO3. My two main sources are [[https://fictionalley.ikeran.org/authors/drt/]] which is not being maintained anymore, I think, and [[https://ficwad.com/a/DrT]] where you need to make a free account to read all the stories. There are some on the first link that are not on the second link; not sure the other way around.

** Try Tightly Knit series on Wattpad. It's a good read, and makes good sense. Also fair warning, it's a Fred Weasley/OFC fanfiction. Highly recommended although I don't know why it's not being mentioned here enough.

** How do you feel about crossovers? Diane Castle has written quite an interesting series that starts with Hermione visiting a bunch of other universes (Buffy, Stargate, Alex Mack, etc) to gather The League of Extraordinary Women for a team-up against a multiversal threat. Then the other books in the series follow up on each of the team members afterward, and what they do with the things they learned (eg checking on the local analogues of their team mates).

Of particular relevance is book 4, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822-1/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], which is a prequel and can stand alone quite well (I read it before any of the rest). It's the local Hermione Granger in the Alex Mack universe. Instead of learning magic, Hermione is sent to "Harworts", which trains the next generation of counter-intelligence agents under Headmaster Dumont Appledore. Canon more or less happens, but with everything being reimagined as James Bond style advanced technology, eg Lord Deathstrike has hidden highly experimental point-in-time copies of his memories, in hopes that if he's ever killed, his followers will be able to clone him. And all the students are more sneaky and cunning than canon, naturally enough.

The largest book in the series focuses on Alex herself, and is the only really substantial Alex Mack fanfic I've been able to find (FFN has a very short list, most of them incomplete and none over 40k words).

Books 6 and 7 are still in progress and actively updating.

** Hinny is by no means my favorite ship, bu there is some good shit on Sink Into Your Eyes. See the story my flair comes from; "[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128876][Win a Date with Ginny Weasley]]" by cwarbeck.
