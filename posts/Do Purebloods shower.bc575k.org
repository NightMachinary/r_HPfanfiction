I was thinking about the whole "vanishing poop" thing when another thought popped into my head: do Pureblood wizards and witches shower, or do they just vanish the dirt and grime off their bodies, then use charms to hide the smell?


** well there would be no need for baths and showers at hogwarts if they didnt

also ignore twitter rowling its better for your health

** If they do clean themselves magically, I would imagine it would be a sweeter, more comfortable variation of /Scourgify/, not just brute-force vanishing of the dirt and grime. If all the dirt and grime /had/ been vanished magically, though, I should point out there /wouldn't/ be any smell left; smell isn't some weird independent quality that remains in the absence of matter, you know, and unlike Muggle soap, there's no reason magic couldn't remove the dirt down to the last molecule.

But more seriously? No. For one thing, do not overestimate most grown wizards' repertoire of spells; there's every reason to think most forget most of what they've learned in Hogwarts, much like few adults in the Muggle world remember most of the maths they were taught back in middle school, if you will --- that's the whole point of Kwikspell. And since they believe themselves superior by nature, one would assume the purebloods would tend to be /particularly/ inept when push comes to shove. See Draco Malfoy and brooms, for example.

Also, Hogwarts has showers and baths, and we are given no reason to think they are an especially modern addition, nor one which caused scandal from the likes of Lucius Malfoy. A culture which regarded baths as a mere Muggle fancy wouldn't have hatched the Prefect's Baths, I think. Remember also that the Potter family got rich thanks to a hair lotion, so there /is/ a market for it in the Wizarding World.

** I like to imagine that a shower potion exists. It causes sweat and skin oils to evaporate and not leave residue behind. Drink one potion a year and you only ever have to shower when you get something on you that your own body didn't produce.

** I would assume they bathe, though considering the possibilities of magic, they many not be as dependent on traditional washing as Muggles are. Flick your wand and you are clean.

As for the vanishing poop, I personally ignore that bs, together with most of the 'reveals' Rowling did after the series ended.

** Even if there was a spell to replace it, they probably would.\\
Wizard separated themselves from Muggle during the XVIIe century, thousands of years after the "invention" of bathes. There is a possibility that they do not "need" to shower, but even without this, there are other advantages to bath (such as relaxation) that would justify its presence in a wizard home.

***** It's not super rare but Arabic numerals are more common. Are you French? I'm pretty sure I've seen it a lot in French literature (because -i√®me is more consistent than -th I assume).

** Yes.

There are showers in either the Quidditch changing rooms or in Gryffindor House because Wood ends up staying in them for long enough that Fred and George think he's trying to drown himself.

Also the Weasleys seem to have one. Since apparently Percy sings in the shower and it sounds awful.

I don't think that those purebloods who fancied themselves upper class would have one. They'd have baths like the one in the prefects bathroom.

** Showers have more uses than just getting clean. It also just feels nice, and baths are famous for being primarily for relaxation.
