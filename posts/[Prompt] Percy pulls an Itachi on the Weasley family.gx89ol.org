It was previously done [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/e27ly5/percy_goes_all_itachinaruto][here]]. I'd also like to see...

Blaise Zabini as Haku.

Ginny as Hinata (optional)

Lavender as Ino.

Scenes to parody.

Ron sacrificing himself in chess

Hermione panicking.

Colin Creevey following Harry

Have fun!


** Oh.my.god. I'm ready for it.
