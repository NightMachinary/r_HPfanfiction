Preferably about the Weasleys. Just read Order of Mercy (WIP) and that is fantastic so far.

  Neville's seventh year at Hogwarts presents many challenges, but he is his parents' son. This was originally written for the springtime gen exchange on livejournal. Thank you to kennahijja for beta-reading.

*** Just a note: the author is a gross scumbag who basically uses fandom to seduce young women & then start cults with them!! And also this story is very gory & violent to the point of reading a bit like torture porn (the sequel in particular).

So, read at your own risk, but please DO NOT engage the author in any way, shape, or form!!

**** Oh gosh, I'm sorry ! It was recommended here on a thread some time ago, it's not usually what I read and that's why I haven't read much of it, but the start looked somewhat promising. Thanks for the info, I'm gonna downvote my own post lol. Thank you very much for the information !

***** Haha no problem!! I try to mention all of it whenever the fic comes up, just cause lots of people don't know. There are arguments for both sides of the read it/don't read it debate, I just want to make sure no one messages him on tumblr, posts about it on tumblr (he tracks the tag and follows everyone - or he used to), or leaves a review somewhere they can be contacted by him. Ive heard he's left the HP fandom, but he has also no real problems taking on a new identity / trying to hide his past, so... better safe than sorry!

(If you want more info about this legitimately crazy story, [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Thanfiction][this]] is probably a good place to start!!)

Edit: there's actually more on [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Victoria_Bitter_Wank][this]] fanlore page!

***** It isn't a bad story. I read it ages ago and it was a decent fic, a bit heavy on the torture and torment etc, but the way Harry and co returning was handled was good. Shitty people are still sometimes decent writers.

*** Even ignoring Thanfiction's pretty disturbing IRL story... I don't really like his fanfics, especially not that one.

Neville is a complete dickhead in that story, and yet everyone fawns over him like he's the greatest person ever. And I get really sick of how all the boys are described as Tough Warrior Men, while the girls are all Nurturing, Delicate Waifs. Who turn into shrieking harpies at the drop of a hat and apparently have some secret unspoken language between them since any girl can instantly tell how any other girl is feeling at any given point.

I'd give it a miss. Plenty other, and much better, stories about the DA during Deathly Hallows, and they even have the advantage of not being written by total creeps.

**** This. I'm always left wondering of I'm taking crazy pills when people say it's a good story. The plot lines are ridiculous amd melodramatic, the characterisation is awful, and it's so clumsy with gender and race that I quite often found myself feeling severe second hand embarrassment. I mean, the sudden need to write Seamus's "oirish" accent phoenetically is bad enough, the portrayal of Neville as every teenage boy's fantasy self insert is terrible.

Edit: I'm accutely aware that this might sound like sour grapes. I promise you it is not. I have a great respect and appreciation for other fics in this sort of genre, particularly A Call To Arms. But this one is just a hot mess...

****** It's not just the violence necessarily, it's the fact that it flat out doesn't make sense. Snape's behaviour doesnt make sense. The whole werewolf thing doesn't make sense in the first place, it especially doesn't make sense that Krum turns up to rescue them. To take an example from the very first chapter, it doesnt make sense that various characters suddenly have super strength ethnic magic they never bothered to mention, and again it feeds into the problem of race I mentioned earlier. To align India with snake charming is just... embarrassing, and the suggestion that this wouldnt have ever come up before particularly in CoS is ludicrous.

This would all be fine if I didnt repeatedly see people saying they regard it as canon compliant.
