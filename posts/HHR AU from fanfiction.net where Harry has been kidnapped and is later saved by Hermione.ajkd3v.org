I am looking for, as the title states, a HHR AU fan fiction from fanfiction.net where Harry has been kidnapped by Death Eaters and is later rescued, or at least placed under the watch of, Hermione. Some other specific details I remember are...

The stories opens with a memory of Harry being kidnapped from Privet Drive. I believe there he saw something in the middle of the street that later turned out to be a portkey?

He eventually meets Hermione later on and is placed under her watch or care, details are fuzzy

At one point Harry wears Hermione's clothes as she has nothing else for him to wear

Any help finding that story would be great!
