I've been thinking about class and wealth in Harry Potter lately, as a somewhat overlooked dimension to their social struggle behind the long shadow of blood purity and racial and intraspecies themes.

It's interesting that HP really embodies the (now somewhat less common) success story of people from poverty going on to success through education and finding fame and fortune.

But the Weasleys are still working-class people. How would they adjust to suddenly occupying a different place in society, rubbing shoulders with different groups, maybe, as a result of their involvement in Dumbledore's Army, gaining new social status and influence, or seeing their views embraced more into the mainstream than being a reason for them to be shunned? How would the parents react to their kids' success and the marriages they make into very different families from the one they grew up in? Suddenly only having to provide for two in place of having 5+ dependents. etc.


** I can see Bill and Fleur arguing over money. She points out that they can afford luxuries, no problem, but he's used to being frugal.

Charlie doesn't care about money as long as he has dragons.

Percy tries to turn the Weasleys into the next Malfoys, using whatever wealth he has to gain influence. He does this as a minor character in my story, The Last Pureblood Malfoy.

George enjoys being a rich eccentric, with absurd, grand publicity stunts.

Ron puts Hermione in charge of the family budget. She makes sensible investments for retirement, gets full tax deductions for their charity contributions, and gives Ron an allowance for fun.

Neither Ginny nor Harry have any clue about how to manage money. The wizarding world showers them with gifts.

Whatever money Arthur and Molly have, they spend on parties and presents for their grandchildren.

*** I more or less agree but I don't think they would take it that mindlessly. I mean after so much time without it I think they would know the value of money.

Fleur isn't shown as a princess but quite a down to earth woman in the 7th book so I don't think she would be too hard about this to the point of argument and at the same time, neither would be Bill against it.

Percy would more likely try to still help his family by guilt over his previous behaviour and I can see him trying to use the money to improve things in the Ministry.

George. Eccentric I can see easily but also helping people with his money.

Arthur and Molly would indeed think of their children/grandchildren and wouldn't over-indulge but I think they also would live less on the edge as they were. Ron may go either buying without thinking because now he has money (not necessarily to show off but more because of what he couldn't have as a child). Or he could be the mature person JKR tried to make him in the end and be conscious about it and not over indulge. Either way, Hermione wouldn't use it recklessly and this could or couldn't make some stress in their relationship depending Ron.

Ginny and Harry. Not knowing what to do about it yes but I can see Harry donating a lot to help people or change things in the Ministry.

** I don't see the situation changing much. Arthur and Molly don't seem to place importance in wealth so they wouldn't be the type to flaunt it if they have it. If anything I see them using anything they have to help others wether it be their kids or friends who are in a tight spot. While bill and fluer's cottage was nice it was still sensible. despite what some fics portray I don't think fleur is the overly pampered rich girl who can't survive on a curse breakers salary. I think they'll live comfortably but nothing grandiose. Charlie is Charlie and unless he can buy a dragon the money won't make a difference to him. After his reconciliation with his family i think Percy will be subdued and try to emulate his father. While I don't think he will work in the same department I think he will find something he is good at and enjoys and not be as power hungry as before and living a humble life style. George will probably be withdrawn and have trouble after losing his twin all his money will probably go into the shop or booze. If hermione doesn't keep Ron in line he'll likely piss any money away very quickly. Harry not caring about wealth will probably reign in any outlandish ness for Ginny.

** The Weasleys are not working class. They are more what you would call impoverished gentry.

*** I don't know if I agree. JK codes them as working-class from their interests I feel, although the whole magical society thing complicates it. Hm. I'll think on where I stand on this.

** Honestly, I dont think much would change for them. They seem to be the kind of poor people who immediately spend all the money they earn and have basically no saving. We see that with how small their vault is and with the way they immediately spend all the money they won. So even though they have less expenses I will assume that their day to day life wont change that much. But I could see their children being able to adapt because they have their partners and probably have less experience with spending money at all.

*** “the kind of poor people who immediately spend all the money they earn and have basically no saving.”

You mean people whose entire income goes to necessities? Because there's some decent research out there showing that when they get more income and know it's a status change, not a one-time windfall, they tend to invest in things that will lead to permanent improvements in their lives, either by creating new revenue streams or by fixing deficiencies in living conditions.

The one-time prize situation is different: They replaced Ron's wand (investment), but as a one-time windfall, they (rationally) prioritized something they would never otherwise be able to do and took the family to see Bill.

Fred and George used the unexpected money from Harry to build a business that generated a fair bit of income, but that's slightly different in that they already were building the business and needed a capital infusion to really launch it at scale.
