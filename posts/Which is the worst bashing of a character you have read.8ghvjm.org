*** Fucking hell. Like what the...

I don't get this (I also mentioned the Ron thing above). There's plenty of canon examples and characterization one could draw on to make Ron or Snape irredeemable to the reader. But rape is just like... really? I think there was one where Ron was a death eater and was trying (or maybe succeeding) to rape very young girls. Need more brain bleach to forget it.

*** Personally I like Snape and would rather not see him bashed, I have nothing against Snape bashing so long as it makes sense with his character, the child predator shit does not. Same opinion of Ron bashing, Dumbledore bashing, and basically every other bashing, if you really wanna do it, make it make sense for the character don't make shit like this up.

** I forget which story, but it was one of those tropey stories where Dumbledore is manipulative as fuck. During a flashback, apparently Ron was trying to rape Hermione while she was petrified (Jesus fuckin christ) and Harry tried to stop him. In comes Dumbles who says something like "Harry, that's his right as a pureblood" and proceeded to Obliviate Harry and Ron into forgetting the attempted rape.

Like fuck people, I don't like Ron as a character, and Dumbledore did a lot of shit that left me scratching my head, but this is absurd.

** That would be hands down, the time Ginny dumped Harry for an evil alternate universe version of himself and asked the evil version to help her write a press release for the breakup. Real Harry was going to find out about it from READING THE DAILY PROPHET. She also didn't want the break up to tarnish her "public image".

Note this wasn't some weird AU where she was an actress or anything.

Though I think you might be misremembering. I'm pretty sure Ginny was somewhat decent about it and told Harry beforehand and also told him that she wanted to do a press release.

Though the mirror universe Potters are wonderfully evil and shallow in that fic.

**** Ginny was decent about it, Prime!Harry was suffering severe PTSD and realized that he was in love with Hermione.

The alternate Potters were explicitly because Harry took Lockhart's advice about fame, and seeing all their plans crumble around them is a treat, since they decided to run roughshod over the person who sacrificed /just about everything/ to stop Voldemort, just because they were too lazy to start from scratch.

My one disappointment with that fic is that Harry never compared his alternate family to the Dursleys.
