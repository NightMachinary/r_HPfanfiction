I've always been under the impression that the dementors where attracted to harry not because of his memories other people have worse memories luna and anyone who lived through the first wizarding war, for instance, anyway my theory is that it was that Harry had more soul than a regular person and then I thought tom riddle has some really nasty memories and harry has part of tom riddles soul also tom riddle wasn't just a psychopath he also lived through WWII thats got to have some nasty stuff


** I mean... Harry heard the night Voldemort got exploded, so maybe he already does.

** Voldemort has a higher resistance than Harry to Dementor, since he is able to make a deal with them (which would be impossible if he was passing out every time they came near). And considering his mentality, I don't think he would have any worse memory than Halloween 1981, the moment when he was vanquised.

Also, we don't know how other children reacted to the Dementor on the train, for all we know, Luna or Neville could have been in a similar state to Harry in their own compartment. Though I don't think they had it worse than Harry (watching your mother being killed in front of you, /and/ having a shitty childhood is difficult to top). Adults like Lupin could potentially see worse, but most adult we see in canon know the Patronus spell, so we never saw them completely defentless in front of a dementor (outside of Sirius I guess).

PS: The worst traumatic experience of WWII (for a civilian) is probably the Blitz, when London was bombarded by German for month. But this blitz happened between September 1940 and May 1941, meaning that Tom Riddle was at Hogwarts when it happened and he should not have been directly affected (and I can't imagine him being bothered by the something like rationing when he can use magic/ steal).\\
Though nothing stop an author to move the dates a bit (especially since Rowling did so herself).

*** Harry definitely had it worse than anyone else, that's why he had to go to the hospital wing. Fainting from dementors us clearly not normal at all.

*** To be fair, while Harry suffered abuse through his childhood and had plenty of life/death situations in Hogwarts I can easily see Voldemort's experience of having his whole body destroyed while being unable to die (and therefore forced to feel the whole experience), plus the fear he would feel since he didn't have a way to be sure that the Horcruxes would work (this would by all intents be the first test, arrogant or not and with great knowledge about magic I can imagine Voldemort being terrified that it hadn't worked and that he would die anyway) being an entire new level of traumatic comparatively to a realistic situation of child-abuse or even how much Harry could have been emotionally affected by his misadventures while keeping the characteristics that prompted him to go on another.
