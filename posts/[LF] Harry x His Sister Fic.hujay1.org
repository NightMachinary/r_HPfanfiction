#+begin_quote
  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).

** Gross, dude. shouldn't have to explain to you that glorifying or romanticising incest is awful

Edit: getting downvoted in this sub for saying that ppl into incest are freaks is too predictable smh

*** You're going to play the morality card in here? In a fanfic community? They won't listen and they will down vote you to oblivion.

***** It's not just fanfiction, it's literature in general. The first time I was introduce to the concept of incest outside of the bible was "Between the stars" by Heinlein. Morally questionable concepts seem to be easy to write about under the pretext of it just being fantasy and words and not reality. I mean seriously we are talking about a genre that has active ships of adults and children and people pretend or ignore it. Anyways, I was just being snarky about your comment. I find most of the sex in HP Fanfic reprehensible anyway, most of the time it's school age children so I avoid it whenever possble.
