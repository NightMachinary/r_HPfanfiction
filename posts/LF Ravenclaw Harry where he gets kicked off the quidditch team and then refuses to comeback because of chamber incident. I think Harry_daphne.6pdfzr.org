It's a competent smart harry one. Ravenclaw team kicks him off (cho is gloating since she gets his spot as seeker). They say it's only temporary because of chamber debacle. Harry says he won't come back and doesn't when they ask after it's resolved. It's a harry/Daphne I think


** The one which I know of is H/Hr. linkffn(3951749).

Quick synopsis for anyone else interested: "Technically" a crossover with quantum leap, this story is filled with quite a few tropes and fairly odd characterisations. It is, to the best of my knowledge, dead and is incomplete. It's a bit of a guilty pleasure/fix everything fic as well.
