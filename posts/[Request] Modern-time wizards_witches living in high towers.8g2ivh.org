I am looking for fics in which at least some modern-time wizards/witches live in high towers.

Bonus points for Ministry invoking height restriction laws for whatever arbitrary reason (protection of low-flying owls etc).


** The Weasleys and the Lovegoods both do. That's about half of the wizarding homes we see in canon.

If that's a problem, wouldn't muggle buildings make it practically impossible for wizards to live in cities?

*** The ministry regulations do not necessarily make a lot of sense.
