Bonus if he comes back once Harry is an adult, but that's not mandatory.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash

NO Weasley Bashing. No stories where the Weasley's are using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.
