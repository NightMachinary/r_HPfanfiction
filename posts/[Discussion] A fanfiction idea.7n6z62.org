I was yes writing in one of my other stories and I got a new idea! :) Okay so when Harry was a baby and Voldemort had a broken soul it was /so/ broken that a piece broke off and went into Harry and gave him his scar and connection and parseltongue and some of Voldemort's skills and other traits. :) So yes if that was all it took to make Harry an accidental Horcrux, what if Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets became a /second one/ when Harry kills the Diary? What if a fragment chipped off that fragment already, and went into Ginny? And then Ginny could see Voldemort's mind, his plans, and also speak parseltongue too! :) Is this a good idea or is it not very plausible? Because I think it could be very interesting!!!


** Personally, I'd like to read a story where much of Ginny's baseline personality gets over written, and she decides to become the next Dark Lady. Realizing she'll need to off Voldemort first (as she still views herself as a separate person) she cleverly seduces Harry and manipulates him into become her champion. They kill Voldemort, then Ginny manages to convince Harry and co that they need to take over to prevent any more Dark Lords from rising. one by one, Ginny and Harry take out all who oppose them, until Harry reins supreme. Ginny happily rules as the power behind the throne, and keeps the Master of Death as her personal executioner.

That was 4 years ago you're probably way better now :O Also I'm not really a SW fan so idk how much I'll like this. 90% of my knowledge of SW is from Darths & Droids and I never got past the start of the second one. Edit: If you don't know, Darths and Droids is SW but a D&D game, and it is probably nothing like SW but I'll never know... Theres something called the Lost Orb of Phanastacoria though which idk if that exists in canon...

** /Could/ be interesting (although re: my advice not to spread yourself too thin between stories, or else you'll never finish any of them!), but I think if the soul-piece broke off Diarymot, it would be a piece /of Diarymort/'s soul, making Ginny a Horcrux not for the main Voldemort, but for Diarymort. The result would be that Ginny's existence would be tethering Diarymort to life even after the destruction of the Diary, and he could pull a Quirrell or something like that and then you could explore the results of having /two/ spectre versions of Voldemort floating around, each trying to get its own body...

***** Maybe that could be a plot point of Horcrux nature? That they are indestructible themselves in a sense, because they will always latch onto something else if driven from a host? And yes the only way to really destroy them would be to do it in a way that there is nothing else nearby for them to jump to? And that would make it more creative and challenging in destroying them? Also yes hunting them would be harder because if a horcrux did get away you would have to spend time searching for and identifying the new host. :)

** Hi OP,

I like this idea. I wrote a 8,000 character response detailing things you'd need to keep an eye on. Then realized it was getting a bit much and that I enjoyed thinking through this story. It doesn't derail canon and I think enhances it in a few places.

I'm going to draft a short story (no more than 30,000 words I think) and will promote it here, linking you when I do :)

I'd like to see your take on this story sometime. I think it's interesting when people with the same premise have their own creative twist on it.

I'll keep my original notes so that when I do upload the story, you'll all see how a premise spawned a reply that turned into a brainstorming session and became a finished story.

Alternative to what? Alternative plot? Have her die. Tom Riddle escapes, finds about his life, hunts down his real self, and becomes Voldemort. Ginny was a silly damsel in distress plot device.
