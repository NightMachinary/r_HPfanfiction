** I wonder how this would work.

My best idea for the story line to somewhat makes sense, as we cannot use "magic" as an explanation, and I like the idea of staying somewhat in the constraints of the Harry Potter world as laid out in the books.

- The kid in question is a pueblood.
- The parents are pretty proud of it, but not quite Black level proud.
- There is an aunt or uncle who likes the kid well enough but does not interfere with the parents "parenting".
- Still, this aunt convinces the parents the kid would be better off to go to a muggle school, she will even pay for it. And, hey, it's a boarding school, so you won't have to worry about having to deal with the child for most of the year.
- Thus the letter from the muggle school.
- From there on you have a fish out of water/ coming of age story where a young person slowly not only learns about or world from their very specific view of reality, but also about their own worth.

**** Lol, yeah.

I think this kid would put their foot in their mouth quite often (if they aren't the super quiet, observant type who barely every opens their mouth on their own accord). At the LEAST they'd be seen as that "overly sheltered kid whose parents don't like most modern technology. "

***** I've seen a couple of those; I was homeschooled. There were some real weirdos in there.

Don't worry though; six months in a boarding school is all that's needed to learn how to blend in. By the time college comes around nobody would even be able to tell the difference.

** Maybe shield goes around secretly recruiting squibs. They can get sorted into Stark House with Gemma Simmons and Leopold Fitz whom they befriend after fighting a rogue janitorial robot. The other three houses being Carter House, Souza House, and Mallick House.

Davious awoke much too early to a loud knocking on his bedroom door.

"Get up! It's time to make breakfast for everyone. If you laze about you'll never hold down a job. You need to learn or you'll die in the street."

It hadn't always been this way. Once Davious Greengrass had been a happy child with a loving mother and father. But over the years as his accidental magic failed to appear relations grew strained. And when his eleventh birthday came and went with no Hogwarts letters his life as he knew it was over. A squib was destined for a life of nothing but servitude, and his parents felt it was their duty to prepare him for it. He was treated little more than a house elf by them now.

Davious grudginly left his room and started making breakfast on the enchanted stove. By now he could make a passing example of a full English. It could be worse he guessed, at least they let him eat a portion.

After he had finished cooking the meal and set it out on the table he went to check if any mail had been dropped off that morning. He thought he had heard an owl flying away earlier.

Sure enough there was one letter. But it was made of a strange thin smooth paper, with a different feel to the parchment he was familiar with. And it was addressed to him.

He opened the letter and read it

Dear Mr. Davious Greengrass,

We are pleased to inform you that you have a place at S.H.I.E.L.D Academy of Technology and Spycraft. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.

Term begins on 1 September. Please visit the website [[http://www.shieldacademy.com/newstudents][www.shieldacademy.com/newstudents]] to register by 31 July.
