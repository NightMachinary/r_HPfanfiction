I'll take any fic with an HHr soulbond


** Here's one where Ginny joins in later, and Voldemort flees from their combined power:

  Harry and Hermione decide to make a soul bond, despite not really knowing what they are doing. Horlarity ensues (portmanteau of "Horror" and "Hilarity"). This short story is not to be taken seriously.

*** Very nice rec, explores a unique take on soul bonds and the effect it would have on a relationship!

** Depressingly unfinished before it gets to the good stuff but linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/Error-of-Soul]])

This one is v. Explicit and tbh I don't think the characters bear enough similarity to HHr but [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Keira Marcos: The Soulmate Bond]]

I'm a big reader of HHr and that's really all I can think of. I'll come back if I think of anything.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

** H J Potter - I consider this is the greatest HHr fic ever written. And it has a great soulbond plot too.

  Who would expect that sharing a simple kiss with his best friend was all it needed to begin a journey far beyond his greatest imagination? Soul-bond fic

** Look up the fanfic author RobSt. He has a very mixed reception to his works but you might find what you're looking for there.

Personally, I'm not a big fan, since I'm Hinny trash, and abhor bashing of any kind. But when I read it, Harry Crow (his most popular work) was somewhat enjoyable, somehow?

I remember that when I skimmed the first few chapters of linkffn(12879819) it had telepathy between Harry and Hermione, so I /think/ it's a Soul Bond.

*** Mixed is an understatement. Were you to believe the words of some, he would be a fanfic Hitler to you. I do not like his works myself, but to slap anyone's works with such disdain is beneath the community in general. Do not like ? Close your tab and read something else. Even if you are the type to write say, Snarry slash, a pairing I personally despise, you are entitled to do so. People can putter around with concepts and pairings all they want.

  Despite how impossible it seemed, Harry was sure his dad had saved the three of them from the dementors. After Hermione's time turner took them both back three hours, he was desperate to discover if who he'd seen casting that patronus was truly his dad. Harry certainly wasn't disappointed when his mum turned up instead, and changed the entire course of his life. Harry/Hermione
