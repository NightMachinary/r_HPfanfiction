** Linkffn(11111990) might work for you. It's not so much about heartbreak, although that is certainly an element but it does a wonderful job depicting Harry's journey onwards.

It's post Hogwarts, Harry/OC muggle and is recommended with some regularity here so if you search for it within the subreddit you'll no doubt come across more in depth reviews and endorsements,

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** But probably worth mentioning that it isn't finished and hasn't updated in over a year.

**** The author still actively posts on Tumblr and says she will update soon. So I guess we'll get one at some point within the next decade.

***** I don't know if it is the norm - I don't tend to read stories until they are marked complete. But I might not notice if it was a recommendation. And if I ploughed through 180k words of a story I was really liking and then discovered it was unfinished and possibly abandoned I think I'd be quite upset. So I do think it's worth a warning.

******* On fanfiction.net you can begin a search and click the 'filters' button and set the Status field to Complete. (This requires that the author has set the status of their story to complete, there are some that are finished but not marked.)

*** Thank you for the recommendation! I actually read this awhile ago, but perhaps I'll give it another try. I stumbled upon Letters by TheEndless7, which I also read while ago, but I saw that it updated so I'm rereading. Pretty much any fanfic that will make me really feel romantic love and all that's involved with that is what I'm looking for
