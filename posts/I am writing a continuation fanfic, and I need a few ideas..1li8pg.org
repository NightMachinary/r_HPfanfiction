I need a few reddit users to post all of the little holes or gaps in the story where you feel that new plots could be spun off of them. Small things, that weren't mentioned much. Like the hall of prophecy's few words caught of the smashed orb, mentioning an eclipse, species equality between human and others. I've also covered spellcrafting, wandlore, necromancy, and the giant squid. anything else? Please, anything that you noticed would help a lot.


** WARNING: SOME SPOILERS MENTIONED. just to avoid an angry mob of people yet to finish reading the books.

It'd be a bit interesting to see exactly what happened to the Dementors after the war. Kingsley disbanded the use of them as guards at Azkaban but it wasn't really clarified as to what happened to them. Obviously the nasty bugger can't just be left to their own devices.

There were also mentions of wizard-goblin relations, giant-wizard relations, and werewolf-wizard relations. The werewolf one would be really interesting, with Fenrir and Lupin gone, what would become of the werewolves. Did they all fight for Voldy or did some separate from the pack? After Fenrir's actions, did the relations worsen or did it push Kingsley to improve them? It could be really interesting.

For prophecies you have: "...and none will come after..." spoken by a young woman "...at the Solstice will come anew..." spoken by an old man. Those are two that I found. Both were smashed ones.

The thing is, you might need to be more specific as to what you're writing about because what you're asking can be very broad. Any little meaningless thing can become a huge plot-device/mover depending on how one interprets it.

Good luck with your writing! Hope I helped a bit.

*** Yes, you've help quite a bit. I had overlooked what would happened to dementors. I've started outlining a way to bring werewolves into the fold, trying not to just force it without saying much. I was planning on making goblin-wizard relations a pivotal plot point in one of my stories. You've also made me think about vampires. they are mentioned in passing a few times, but never elaborated. Should I go for the ultra classic vampire? (garlic, crucifix, fear of the sun). I guess I am just looking for loose ends. The thing is, I am trying to make a continuation fic that stays as canon as possible. JK Rowling has a habit of mentioning something in passing a few times and them WHAM! It's a large plot point. Hell, legilimency had been noted in first book and wasn't elaborated on until OotP.

** A brilliant continuation Fan-fic.

Harry returns to Hogwarts after the war to complete his 7th year, and gradually begins swimming in the Great Lake during the early mornings as a way of getting some exercise. As repeated weeks go past, Derrick begins swimming with him.

Who is this small felshy creature? Why does he only have 4 appendages when Derrick has many? And how can he leave the water. And so begins a romantic comedy brolationship between Harry & the Gigantic Squid (never becoming more than a PG), including Harry stopping first years from throwing stones at him because he's 'scary', the Chosen One gallantly saving The Tentacled One from certain death by choking on a wanton burnt slice of toast that is unchewable, and nobody can ever forget the time that Harry learnt how to surf as Derrick propped him up on a tentacle and glided him through the water.

Come back and tune in again next week True Believers!

*** I don't know whether to laugh at this or be irritated. I'm think I'm just going to enjoy it.

** Well, here's an idea for you-the final battle took place at Hogwarts. What happened at the ministry in the immediate aftermath?

Another covers the months following the event. Harry becomes an auror, Hermione's parents are AWOL in australia, the Dursleys are still in hiding, Luna embarks on an adventurous creature-finding tour etc... What happens during that time?

In the long term, what are the general repercussions of having such a massive shift in the magical world's balance of power? How does it play out in England and elsewhere, with the Dark Lord gone? What happens to the pureblood movement? Do other Dark Lords rise and fall? How do they do so? Why do they do so?

Plus, how does the wizarding world change with the advent of the 21st century?

There are a /lot/ of themes you can play off here-and that's with canon events remaining in play. The only restrictions canon really imposes is that the epilogue details still have to happen. Otherwise, you're free to play.

** The wizarding world has a lot of rebuilding to do.

Everyone in the ministry is either inexperienced or a collaborator. The old death eater families still hold most of the money and prestige. And the ministry was pretty corrupt before this started: even Arthur Weasly was willing to trade pardons for quidditch tickets, and he's one of the more honest ones. They survived that before, but it'll be harder now.

They have a massive list of suspects to deal with, some of whom are guilty as sin, some were imperiused, some were pretending to go along for their safety, etc. And then there are the good guys who still used unforgivable curses and other evil tactics during the war. Though it's not clear they can do anything: their prison system is wandering the countriside eating random people's souls.

A lot of people who suffered under the dark regime will be looking for vengence, and for many of them any slitherin will do. Or any werewolf.

In short, it's looking pretty dark. As bad as the aftermath of most real-world civil wars.

** This idea bounced around in my head after trying to read "Harry Potter and the Secret of the Golden Unicorn". Reading that story I gradually got annoyed that everyone was being very dark with a whole lot of sadistic torture being done by the "good guys" and no repercussions for it. I also read Dresden Files around that time and wondered what if some of the rules of the later applied to Harry Potter verse:

"What makes Unforgivable Curses so special?"

What if: Magic always has a balancing effect with spells having a sort of backlash against that which is used to produce them. Sort of a variation on the natural laws of physics about equal and opposite reaction. With most spells, this backlash is absorbed and dissipated by the wand. Unforgivables are special because they take direct mental and emotional focus - and the backlash is directly against the mind of the caster. Like with many brain injuries, it is not immediate as the brain rearranges and adjusts itself over time(months/years) in response. Back at the time when the laws about Unforgivables were enacted, the effect was known. With time the true reasons for the law became obscure.

What if those spells were declared Unforgivable because every time a wizard casts them, they begin a gradual and subtle process of rewiring their mind/personality to become more psychotic, with variations based on the spell used. Crucio would gradually turn a caster into a sadist. Imperius would bring out desire to control and dominate. The death curse would steer them to serial murder.

Tagline: How would a country that has forgotten the true danger of their most potent weapons survive the aftermath of a war when even their most respected heroes are already being corrupted from inside?
