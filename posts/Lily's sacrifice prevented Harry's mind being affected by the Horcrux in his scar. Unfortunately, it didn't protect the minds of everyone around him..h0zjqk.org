**** It's a story where Harry just casually, accidentally breaks the fundamental laws of magic on a daily basis while trying to tie his shoes, and everyone else is left gaping at the impossible display of magic. The story is just that, over and over, as if the author is engaged in an absurd game of one-upsmanship with himself.

****** Take it in small doses at first. If you like the first few chapters, great. If not, well, you've got the gist of the story anyway so you can drop without issue. The escalation is quick, but fairly linear from "strong" to "probably most OP harry in this fandom."

******* I just recently read the most recent updated chapter to see where it had gone and Harry currently has about millions of magical cores which are basically souls and so can't possibly die. Moreover he has also become king and even more Overpowered.

It was even stated that if Harry let a thousand Voldemorts throw AK's at him at the rate of 1 AK per ten second, it would still take him more than 4 hours to die. I was like What?

But... What?..

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

They would have been cold anyway, but with the horcrux working they became monsters, and those who should have stepped in conveniently forgot about it, or wrote Harry off as the problem.
