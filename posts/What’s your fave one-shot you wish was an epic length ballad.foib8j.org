Mine would probably be: “Harriet Potter is...”, by setepenre_set, a Slytherin, fem!Harry fic that bends and twists those tropes in a hopeful way. I'm on mobile, so I'm not sure how to tag this post correctly.

Harriet Potter is... is poetic and deep and mirrors several literary references. This Harry shows love in a way that I truly believe Rowling missed a chance on. And isn't that what we love about fanfiction? The repetition of some of the phrases “you knew what I was when I picked you up” and “Harriet is” is used not only in a way that provides rhythm, but also portray the chaos of her situation. Of course, if it ever were turned into a long fic, it would lose the poignance that I love so much, but it would still be so interesting to see Harriet's story played out to the fullest. Most fem!Harry stories feature a possessive, unhealthy Tom Riddle, which while I absolutely love that trope, it would be nice to have a genderswap that isn't a romance.

It has to be *dead things* by *eclipsewing* for me. It explores the potential consequenses of Harry death and him coming back in the final battle. It was one of the best and most realistic Dark Harry fics I have ever read.

** My is without a doubt linkffn(Harry gets Motivated by BajaB), of all of what I call the zero-to-hero troop I've ever read this one is hands-down the most well-written, contrary to many others this one actually uses a good source for the change in outlook of Harry and explores in a well-thought way Harry's mentality changes due to the event, much better than the old “he finally decided to get shit done and always could have been this good if he had put his mind to it” Deus Ex Machine.

  Harry finds a way to get motivated, really, really motivated. A super!Harry oneshot. Post HBP, AU, No DH.
