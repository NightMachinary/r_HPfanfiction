E: I think the better title would have been "Which do you think is generally the most recommended fic for your favorite pairing?" Some people are misunderstanding the question and simply linking their favorite stories. Which is cool, but not the point of the thread.

--------------

I know, without having read too much of that pairing, that Isolation is /the/ story in the Draco/Hermione fandom. Not necessarily which I think is the best or the most popular by numbers, but the story most likely to be recommended as the best if one asks a random fan of the pairing.

So, how does this work for the other pairings?

For Harry/Draco, I'm pretty sure this is /Turn/, which is utterly fantastic. A regular reader of this pairing can correct me if I'm wrong about the choice.

For Albus/Gellert, I know this is Letterblade's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7101118][Thirty Five Owls]]. Not my favourite of this pairing - which is Teh Tarik's /Let Perpetual Light/, but still pretty good.

For Ron/Hermione, this is probably MsBinns' /Australia/.

For James/Lily, it is definitely /The Life and the Times/.

For Harry/Fleur, this is JBern's /The Lie I've Lived/.

I don't know whether Harry/Ginny has /the/ fic - it used to be /After the End/ in the fandom's early days, but it became less popular after Sugarquill closed doors. Now - /Nightmares of the Future's Past/ is the most read, certainly. Is it the most recommended? I think /Strangers at Drakeshaugh/, though not the most popular by reviews/favs, has become the most recommended as the best as of late.

For Harry/Hermione, this used to be Cassie Claire's fic, before it was deleted. Which is it now? I hope it isn't /Harry Crow/.

I don't think Draco/Ginny has a definite fic, but /Three Thousand Days of Innocence/ might come the closest.

What is it for other pairings? Sirius/Remus? Snape/Harry? Snape/Lily? Snape/Hermione? Remus/Tonks? Harry/Ron? Harry/Pansy? Harry/Daphne? Harry/Riddle? Hermione/Riddle? Hermione/Fred? Hermione/Ginny?


** For Snape/Hermione it's probably linkffn(Post Tenebrus Lux) but I prefer linkffn(chasing the sun) by the same author. And linkffn(Pride of Time) is the best time-travel Snape/Hermione.

Edit: /These are my personal opinion/ but I don't think they're too off the mark. I mean, there are higher ranked fics based on "favorites" but these are still pretty high up no matter how you sort (favorite/follow/review), high-quality writing, and well edited. Plus, I tried to pick the best from each era, so one time-travel, one book era, and one post DH.

** Harry/Muggle OC: Behind Blue Eyes by Paffy. Linkffn(behind blue eyes by Paffy). Easily the best in the genre. I've rarely encountered such a well written original character that was very flawed, but I️ still could buy the love story. Flawed, but also a character that was written in a way that reflected teenagers in the era. There are some problems with the doc (quite a few spelling errors, too much Tonks/Remus) but otherwise a solid showing. I️ read it once every other year or so. In my opinion, the only fic that competes is Grow Young With Me, which is technically written well and very engaging. If GYWM were complete I️ might have ranked it over BBE, due to it having less errors and the writing tighter.

I love both of those, but The Apprentice is unfinished and the ending of The Long Road Home is weird. I prefer the characterizations and the way the relationship develops in Come Once Again and Love Me though I understand that it's a hit and miss with people. Laventadorn is a really great writer.

**** Ananke lost the plot once she came back to her time with the Dumbledore/James bashing. I liked the Lily characterization in it though. The Peace Not Promised is looking good and hopefully it stays that way.

You should also check out linkffn(The Scarecrow by nascently) if you haven't already. The writing isn't good but the concept is interesting.

***** Yeah I basically like the first half of the story when she goes back in time and then the last chapter only. The second plot wasn't that great but I'm glad the author brought it out of hiatus and finished it. The bashing could have been managed a lot better and I was expecting something more adventurous and dramatic than what actually happened. I just like how Snape got the other Snape's memories at the very end.

The Scarecrow is really interesting. I thought the end was a bit sad though.

The Peace not Promised is like a better version of The Moment it Began.

I'm also glad that she finished it since I was sure it was dead but it could have been a much better story. If only The Apprentice also comes back to life. /Sigh/

I have never heard it described like that but I totally agree. The Moment it Began had too much angst and drama. The Peace not Promised is subverting so many Snape/Lily Time-travel tropes like [[/spoiler][Snape revealing his knowledge to Dumbledore from the start, Lily finding out Snape is from the future AND forgetting it, Lily not immediately being in love with Snape and still having feelings for James]]. It's going really well so far.

***** God.. I read it recently, and it was fantastic.... up until the point it went Christian /with a twist!/ It completely shattered my suspension of disbelief. I ended up finishing it, but it was more of a "I've read so much that it has to be finished" rather than a "couldn't put it down" kind of thing.

SPOILER: [[/spoiler][I mean, Veela literally being /fallen angels/? Harry bonded with Gabrielle so she's now this perfect being? Don't get me wrong, I like a good twist on an idea, but they literally go to church every Sunday, and Harry ends up actually replacing God at the end (after it's made clear he's going to have to imprint on all Veela girls under the age of 12 or something). WTF. The whole story felt like a cosmic deity version of "I'm not like those other girls!"]]

[[/spoiler][Also, Joan of Arc's ghost is in there? No relevance to the story, it doesn't even bring an interesting personality in. She's literally reduced to a whiny little ghost girl, who Deus Ex's (probably not a word in that tense) back in five chapters later for no real reason..

** Linkffn(one hundred sixty nine by Mrs J's soup) is Sirius / Hermione (my personal favorite fic).

Linkffn(turn by Sara's girl) is a close second and is the all time greatest Harry/Draco.

Linkffn(vox corporis) is not a favorite of mine but is the most commonly recommended Harry / Hermione fic (I'm not in love with that pairing, personally).

I'm trying to think of a Harry / Ginny fic I like better than linkffn(the amplitude, frequency and resistance of the soul bond by council) (because it seems like there should be a great completed one) but I can't.

Ron / Hermione: either linkffn(the dark lord never died by starfox5) or a really old (pre HBP) fic where Ron becomes a seer whose name I can't remember. If you want to sift through my post history (or search for it) it was recommended when I asked for Seer Ron fics.

**** I didn't really like MMH because of how AU it is. A big reason why I like the pairing so much is because of all the internal confict the characters face, as well as the pressure from society. In MMH, Bella is sassy, sacrastic and a little crazy, but overall a good person who doesn't mind muggleborns, and nobody really has any problems with the two of them together. It's still good, just not really my cup of tea.

** What about rule 63 (genderbent) pairings?

For fem!Harry/Snape there's The Never-ending Road, sort of?

For fem!Harry/Hermione there's either Yule Ball Panic or The Long Game.

For fem!Harry/Regulus hands down, Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is.

For fem!Harry/Luna, I can't remember anything other than the Black Queen series (Book 1, Princess of the Blacks), and that's not a healthy relationship.

For fem!Harry/Tom Riddle, either Fire Born or perhaps something by Ellory? Or maybe Riddle and the Ancient Contract? That's recommended a lot. I personally like nocturnememory's Ichor series. I don't really read this pairing though.

For fem!Harry/fem!Riddle, it's going to be Descent.

For fem!Riddle/Harry Thunderstorm or Limpieza de Sangre.

*** Turn, as opposed to many if not most of those on the LJ list - which is 10 years old btw, is canon through the epilogue. For me, it brings the Drarry story around full circle. The story shows how Harry's future would have been different had he made a different choice from what he did in the book. The writing and characterizations are spectacular in Turn as well.

I've read many of the other stories on the list in the link (and now have a few more stories to read as well so thanks for that link, btw) and many were good as well, but they just didn't speak to me like Turn.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.

** Snape/Hermione is my favourite (guilty) pleasures

I love the Phoenix trilogy by Grangerous - starts at the end of OOTP

Beyond 84 Charing Cross Road is another wonderful SS/HG fic set after the Battle of Hogwarts

** I think one of the most popular Harry/Tom would be linkffn(Verdict of their Vagaries) even though I have not seen that many rec for the pairing itself.

I'd also argue that linkffn(October) and linkffn(Fate's favorite) are also fairly popular.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, slash
