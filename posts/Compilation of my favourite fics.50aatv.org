Just a list I'm compiling for a friend of mine and I'd thought I'd share it. This list is in no way complete, I just threw whatever came to mind first and shoved it together. You may notice I have Harry/Hermione tendencies.

*Part 1 - Oneshots*

(The Bird Tongue)[[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3100511/1/The-Bird-Tongue):]] Sweet and sad, a oneshot exploring Tom Riddle's past.

*Part 2 - Highly Recommended*

(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationalism)[[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality]:]] I cannot recommend this enough. A hilarious, grand, sweeping work of Harry Potter, completely re-imagined as if written by a hilarious, humanist philosopher and scientist. Brilliantly written, although it can be hard to read. One of my favourite works of all time

(The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks)[[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks]:]] Mysterious, powerful, and well written, this fic is a simple exploration into a little piece of the Harry Potter universe. It's an oddity as it doesn't really explore the Harry Potter plot, but is a little side story to /Prisoner of Azkaban/. But it's short enought to definitely be worth a read.

(A Serpent's Sacrifice)[[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3434782/1/A-Serpent-s-Sacrifice]:]] Written before Deathly Hallows, this ties up the Harry Potter story in some ways (in my opinion) better than canon. It's quite unpolished and not incredibly written, but compelling, even powerful, and ends well. The last few chapters will throw you off, I don't even know what the author was thinking.

(The Darkness Within)[[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5957714/1/The-Darkness-Within-The-Rewrite]:]] The re-written version of the first piece of the Dark Prince trilogy, and the best of the trilogy. (To be honest, the Dark Prince Series is one book and two spinoffs). It's badly written, but gets gradually better as it goes along. Toned very darkly and with a riveting plot, this is definitely worth it.

(Brutal Harry)[[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry]:]] This fic is odd. It's written by a good author who has no filter and obviously has some very disturbed stuff going on in his head. His style is excellent although the writing itself is mediocre. However, comes out strong and heartwarming, the tale of a true hero.

*Part 3 - Honourable Mentions*

(Harry Potter and the Balm of Time)[[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4986849/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Balm-of-Time]:]] My personal time-travel fic. Cute, fluffy and romantic, it's worth a read if you can ignore its faults.

(Nothing to Lose)[[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8662532/1/Nothing-to-Lose]:]] Inspired by a oneshot by another author, this fic has real potential. Written relatively well and with a strong, dark opening, it falls flat if you can't suspend your disbelief for some of the lamer plot devices and the cheesy moment or two.

(Tears of the Phoenix)[[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1269853/2/Tears-of-the-Phoenix]:]] I actually haven't read this fic more than once and it was a long time ago. I brushed up on the first chapter recently, and as far as I can see, it still retains the beautiful poetic style, good writing, tragic romance, and dark weight that I remember of it. The only reason it's not more highly recommended is because I don't remember it well and because the ending falls somewhat disappointingly.

(Quoth the Raven, Nevermore)[[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6652537/1/Quoth-the-Raven-Nevermore]:]] I don't know why this fic jumped out at me so much. It's not great, but worth a read.

I haven't included in this list some of the... nastier, although incredible fics I have read in the past. Authors like Kwan Li ([[/u/KwanLi]]) immediately jump to mind. His fics are excellent quality and are shockingly unpopular compared to most other fics. But they are all definitely for Mature audiences, and sometimes quite nasty. Another one is Ruskbyte, to specifically mention Backwards Compatible and Evil be Thou My Good. If you really want something M to sink your teeth into, both authors are top notch.

*** Hah. Quite.

I had a very inconventional entrance to the HP world and HP fan fiction in general. I stopped reading fanfiction religiously a few years ago and when i come back and read what i thought to be "masterpieces" I find badly written hulks, many of which I stuck on this list because of their sentimental value.

Generally now it turns out that I find it impossible to read fics that don't have good quality writing. Plot I have relatively given up on. So yeah, bad choices. What are your favorites?

**** He means bad. Most of this subreddit doesn't like HPMoR. Personally I think its decent, though not the best thing ever.

However your list in general has several fics that you say the writing is low quality in. Which is weird for a favorite fic compilation when there are a lot of fics with good stories that are also well written.

For some example's see Taure's and Newcomb's lists that are linked later on in this thread, of which almost all the stories from these that I've read are decently written. Though both of those haven't been updated recently, and as such are missing any newer good ones, and obviously some older good ones too since nobody has read everything and people have differing tastes. Neither of these lists have the pureblood pretense, which is one of my favorite series for example.
