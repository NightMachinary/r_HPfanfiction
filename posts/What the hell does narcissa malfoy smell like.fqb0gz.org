** Like something cold or something you'd associate with being rich/a pureblood - fresh mint/gaudy perfume/that icy smell that burns your nose but you can't describe it?

  â€˜How very intrepid of you, Nick. Very do-it-yourself. Do you build your own decks too?' She laughed at the word and opened the door for me. I stared at the hollow of her neck and wondered why she wasn't wearing a noose of pearls. Women like these always have thick strands of pearls to click and clack. I could smell her, though, a female scent, vaginal and strangely lewd.
