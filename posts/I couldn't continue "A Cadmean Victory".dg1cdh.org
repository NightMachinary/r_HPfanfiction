I stopped at Chapter 72. It was becoming too much tragic for me. On the other hand, curiosity is killing this poor cat to finish the fic.

Spoilers Ahead.. The fic was becoming too broody and depressing for me. I literally teared up when Dobby died. Sacrificing Salazar was the final straw and I decided to stop. But, but.. a part of me is hoping things will turn up good :) I don't know and I am unsure whether or not to continue reading.

Help me please! Should I or should I not?


** props to making it that far. i think i only made it to the 30s

** A Cadmean victory is a reference to a victory involving one's own ruin, from Cadmus (Greek)

I mean if you are expecting a Happy ending, the title of the story pretty much points out how it's going to end.

#+end_quote

Let's not split words here, it has /literally every/ fandom cliche. Part of it's charm is that it revels in how many cliches it pushes together. It cringy at time, self-aware cringy at times, and at others seems like it's going off the rails only to pull it together at the last moment.

But what it has going for it most of all is that it's complete, has a story-line that's close cousins to being logical, and has consistent characterization.

#+end_quote

The Katie arc ruined the fic for me because it felt very, very forced. And since her actions are the catalyst to Harry's bigger shift towards isolation, it felt like you were trying to pile too much weight on a straw-thin support beam.

Not even that. I find the actions more off-putting than the fallout. Most notably, the short-term break-up, Katie immediately getting another date she doesn't really want and then not choosing Harry despite having feelings for him and pretty much none for her date.

** I actually finished it. I enjoyed it for what it was. There are some parts that happen that require you to remember from 20-30+ chapters ago to fully understand. The end chapter especially. I wouldn't really read it again. Since a second reading would probably ruin how I feel about the story since I've read better written ones.

** I would say finish reading it.

I liked it because contrary to a lot of fics, Harry doesn't become stronger without consequences and he isn't perfect. From his point of view he's more or less justified but you can also see what the other would think and when he goes a bit too far. But everything he does has a price, sometimes quite heavy.

Like his last interaction with Dumbledore. Dumbledore wasn't perfect and totally innocent but he wasn't an evil overlord either. In the end both made mistakes they would regret and the paranoia and lack of communication and trust was their undoing.

I liked less the twist with Hermione that I thought came a bit out of nowhere (no sign of it before) but it could have happened like this and it's not too far-fetched. Bittersweet ending and a bit confusing to me but overall a good fic.

Harry having more than one relationship (not as in a harem but one after the other) is also a good idea not used enough. It allows character growth and it's rare that the first relationship is the last. It was also well done in "The Life He Leads" which was unfortunately abandoned (even if the author explained what he had in mind for the end).

The thing is, in order to pull that off you need to write convincing relationships and then have them fall apart convincingly, followed by the same all over again. It is doable, but really, really hard to write multiple relationships which get the reader invested into them.

You can't asspull them (eg the alternative ending to Letters), you shouldn't resort to cheating because that feels like cheap drama even if it happens IRL (usually, there are red flags the reader would notice, even if IRL they are hard to tell). Character Deaths are also to be avoided because writing a good "grieving" arc is very difficult and probably enough for a fic on its own. At the same time, you can't make the failing relationships too convincing, because otherwise everyone and their mother will be up in arms that you broke them up.
