I finally got around to reading this fic - it's oft-recommended and been on my list for some time.

It's an /incredible/ fic. There's this sense of foreboding and mystery that made me feel like I was with Harry again, the first time I read the Prisoner of Azkaban or the Chamber of Secrets.

It's /phenomenally/ well-written. If you want to feel like you're reading yet another Harry Potter adventure, right there with Harry and co. as they solve yet another strange mystery, I highly recommend this.

Bonus points if you read it at night, right before going to sleep!

** The fic isn't too bad, but /The Strange Disappearance of Ron Weasley/ would probably have been just as appropriate a title.

*** I agree. I wasn't a fan of the fact that Ron just... disappeared. It seemed out of character that neither Harry nor Hermione would update Ron with their discoveries.

** It's a mystery and the heart of any mystery is the reveal.

The writing is among the best in the community and I like the narrow scope of the story. It doesn't try to draw in other elements from PoA and finds a comfortable place between the one shot and the epics.

The characterisation is largely fantastic, though a few of Dumbledore's actions are contrived, but while I was reading it, I could forgive those rare moments. That's how good the mystery is at drawing you in.

Where the fic completely falls apart is the reveal. It's abrupt, underwhelming and doesn't really change the characters at all. The problem is I think, that the resolution is just Dumbledore explaining stuff to Harry and Hermione, the duo (cause who cares about Ron /s) never really solved the mystery. They just convince Dumbledore to explain it. It lacks agency. What would have happened if Dumbledore simply refused to talk about it? There was never anyway for Harry to solve this.

A fantastic fic otherwise.

** EDIT12: I didn't mean to, but I accidentally made some sort of "live" review in this comment as I was readin this. Oops. Anyway. Dont read this comment if you don't want spoilers. Sorry. Tht was fun though.

Okay well... I'm four chapters in, and this is what I have to say about it

Ron has one line in the first chapter, and after that disapears, as misteriously as Sally-Anne. At least he's not being bashed. Yet.

At several occasions, lines of dialogue begin without the flying commas, making you believe it's still the narrator saying it. That's not actually /too/ bad. You can tell pretty easily if it was a dialogue or not. Still, sloppy.

Reading "McGongall" one time was fine. Everybody makes mistakes. Reading it a second time, shortly after, just demostrated a lack of proofreading. If I read it a third time, I'm just going to assume it's some sort of really unfunny joke.

If it's set during third year and is mostly following canon, why is Dobby working at hogwarts? Not to mention there's a lot of suspenson of dibelief to be had that a house elf would have the records of everyone who had dinner every single night of every single year: Especially if that number is not supposed to change (Although that is a suspension of disbelief I am willing to commit)

Overall.. Can't see the big deal. I wouldn't have even gone past the first chapter if this hadn't been recomended here, and I wouldn't continue past this point if I wasn't genuinely curious as to what the writer think happened to miss Perks - Although the foreshadowing that it's gonna be solved via Hermione's time turner has been as subtle as slap to the face-, and I can't help but feel I'll be disapointed when I find out.

EDIT: I just read this comment back, try to do it wit a super snobby voice. It really fits, I sound like some sort of assholish fan fiction connoseur

EDIT2: Oh, welcome back, Ron. Boy, Am I glad Harry and Hermione are treating you as the inferior intelect you are.

EDIT3: I do hope that Lord of Aramatt thing was relevant for a future chapter somehow, otherwise, that was the most random scene I've ever seen written. Also, Dobby seems to have replaced Ron in the Trio now.

EDIT4: Well, I suppose that if JK can change how time turners workfor her play, we can make up all sort of nonsense too. And what I'm reading certainly does qualify as nonsense.

EDIT5: Oh, Snape gave you that assignment, did he? How convenient that we're only learning about it now, when it's needed for the narrative. Yes, a scene earlier in the story where Snape does it, thus setting up this dialogue is /completely/ unecessary.

Edit6: Boy, the Hogs Head sure is easy to break into. And ah... How about you two questioning what the portrait of Dumbledore's sister is doing on a random bar, hmm? No sudden realization that Aberforth is the bar owner? No, nothing? Okay, moving on then.

Edit7: Oh, okay, the pub was still open then. Nevermind.

Edit8: I mean, Hermione, you're going on quite a long rant to explain why it was Madam Hooch that enchanted the flying keys when that is completely inconsequential to the whole story. Not to mention I'm pretty sure we've established Flitwick did it.

Edit9: "You see Harry, there were two possible solutions to that riddle" Is this actually true? Was Snape's riddle on the first book unsolvable? And perhaps the most important question, /what the hell does that have to do with this story can you just get to the point, please?/

Edit10: Okay, I need to ignore the explanation that I just read for a second to ask /WTF/ , did fawkes just die? Really? One year, that's how much Phoenix's last before they're rebirth?

Edit11: Oh actually, nevermind. That was it. That was the explanation.

Yeah, I did say I was gonna be disapointed by it. Half of the half baked theories Hermione and Harry came up with before learning the truth were probably better than what actually happened.

Oh, and not to mention the passage where Hermione revels that her deepest desire is that Harry's parents come back to life, or all the fantastic wisdom 13 year old Harry possesses. "We are in a space inbetween nowhere and somewhere". Actually, that does sound like somehting an angsty 13 year old would say.

Overall, definetely would not recomend.

EDIT13: And what the fuck was that lord of attarell scene about?!? It was about nothing! Is there some sort of symbolism that I'm missing? Is there to demonstrate that ROn is an idiot that only cares about collecting cards or something? As much as I despise that, at least it would have /a/ purpose if it was for that, instead of just being a random scene

*** I can agree with many of the points here. I didn't really notice the spelling errors, but Ron's disappearance was annoying. It seems the author was trying to make this some H/Hr romance but backtracked. I was hoping Ron would be re-introduced, and the chocolate frog card would have some relevance, but it seemed that was also forgotten.

Still - I don't think many stories could hold up to that level of scrutiny. You'll be able to find plot-holes almost anywhere, and for me, part of reading fanfic is ignoring those plotholes - i.e. accepting that the fic is set in some sort of AU in which the "plotholes" are not really plotholes. Once you change your reference frame, a lot of the things you mention (Dobby working in Hogwarts, Snape's potions) are much easier to accept. Suspension of disbelief, in a sense. If I analyzed every part of the fic to check its plot-relevancy to canon - I don't think I would have been so immersed.

Where this fic excels when compared to other fics - and the reason I recommend it - is the environment, dialogue, and (to some extent) characters. The environment was probably the biggest one for me - it certainly /felt/ like I was exploring the castle with Harry and Hermione. Both environment and dialogue dictate how well I can sink myself into this alternate reality (the whole point of reading fiction, for me), and if both of those are excellent, the fic will usually get a recommendation from me - regardless of if the fic is complete or not.

And so I recommended this fic not based off of the intricacies of the plot, or the nature of the reveal. The strength of this fic, for me, comes from how well the author was able to recreate the feeling of being /in/ PoA, as I was reading. And that's the reason I gave in the OP - /"if you want to feel like you're reading yet another Harry Potter adventure, right there with Harry and co. as they solve yet another strange mystery, I highly recommend this."/

But who knows - I've taken a bit of a break from fanfic, so my standards might not be up to par just yet.

**** I'm gonna be honest, I didn't even scrutinized it all that much. There's a whole lot more about this fic not nitpick, but that's just it. Nitpicks. I only mentioned the stuff that stuck out to me. And, like I said, I'm more than willing to suspend my disbelief for several things. But you have to admit that Hermione calling Dobby specifically because of his work in the kitchens, and a few chapters later not knowing that House Elfs work in Hogwarts can't be fixed by any measure of disbelief.

*** I wanted to love the fic but couldn't read past McGongall. Character name typos (consistent ones) drive me a little bit insane. This is in the same category as Dursely, Weasely, Dumbldore, Pavarti (which autocorrect to Pavarotti, mental picture of Parvati singing opera is great) and all the other ridiculous fails.
