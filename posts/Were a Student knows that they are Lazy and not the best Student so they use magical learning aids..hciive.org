-Like using a compulsion charm on their books to help themselves to memorize them

-Potions to enhance their ability to memorise.(like Wit-Sharpening Potion that we know harrys Class learnt in Fourth year)

-More long term stuff Mild Cheering Charms on their books to help train themself to associate learning with enjoyment.(Cheering Charm that Harry class learnt in third year.)

-Transfiguring their healthy Food into food they want to eat so they can get the benifits of eating healthy while eating whatever they want.( Really in canon there is no reason for a person skilled in transfiguration to not eat healthy).

-Learning magic to make Books read themselves aloud.

Edit: I have already read Linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff)

What way would you have Such a Student use magic to enhance their learning?


** A Love potion but instead of keying it to a person instead Key it to a Subject.

Also Charms similar to the ones on the world cup stadium in fourth year, But instead of remembering the need to do something random have them instead remember they need to study.

** A mild Sonorous spell for students with mild hearing impairment and a dictate quill for those with complete loss of hearing (Would hearing aids even work at Hogwarts?). Having something that writes out perfectly what you cannot hear would be amazing.

I would imagine you'd have to spell the quill to only pick up the teacher's voice, otherwise your work will be filled with random words/conversations/hushed whispers.

*** They wouldn't unless the likes of Arthur Weasley got hold of them. The sonorous wouldn't be very effective, although I suppose similar to how hearing aids in the 80s/very early 90s would have worked.

The problem with hearing loss is that it typically varies by frequently (the most common being a 'ski slope' hearing loss with high frequencies at the bottom of the slope aka, high frequency hearing loss. Less commonly, you can get other types like flat, mid or low.

Anyway, the point of this is - a major issue with hearing loss and amplification is distortion. This is why even relatively mild losses can cause significant difficulties. It you make the sound louder not only do you still have distortion but you now have unpleasantly - painfully even - loud hearing for the frequencies you can hear. Along with disturbing lip patterns, this is one reason that shouting when talking to a deaf person is advised against.

As for painfully - although the sonorous is mild, people with hearing loss counterintuitively are more sensitive to sound. If you want to look it up, the phenomenon is generally called 'recruitment'.

An easy of example of this is the classic (stereotypical) conversation where an elderly person tells you're mumbling, but then suddenly tells you to stop shouting, despite you not shouting. In some rare cases of recruitment, people perceive sound only when it is painful to them.

A quill full of people's whispers, etc would be the dream for most deaf people. I can well imagine someone having one just for notes and another to follow what's happening.

**** I have a bi-lateral hearing impairment, so I understand about the distortions. Perhaps a variant of the Sonorous spell, one that has a focus on vibrations as oppose to projecting the volume of sound. I wouldn't be entirely sure what would be the right spell but I figured it would be something close to that. That would help with saying the words of the spells, (Speech Therapy Spell? Akin to how Mrs. Macy taught Helen Keller, perhaps?). I can't help but wonder if hearing-impaired student's magic would manifest in different way.

As for the quill, it would be great considering the class sizes at Hogwarts (depending on the year). Unless each teacher had quills for such students, per classroom to prevent violation of privacy. Can you imagine having a quill keyed to the teacher's voice during their breaks or sleep talking?

And whispers, it would be great to actually hear someone whispering in my ears without me looking at them like they're a weirdo! I know the language they're speaking but they might as well be speaking in another. Same goes to music, unless I have the words in front of me, there has been many songs I sang (terribly) with the wrong words in place.

I never knew there was a name for that. It sounds similar (I could be really wrong) to the trouble I have when people put their t.v's volume's to 50 which is fine for them, really uncomfortable for me (Not painful exactly but close enough to be driven to tears once). My ideal volume is around 10-15, perfect for me, too quiet for them.

Alas, I seen Arthur in my mind with a small pile of hearing aids and implants, trying to figure out where to plug them in...

***** Ah, my apologies - I'm so used to people needing a bit of a crash course. I think the vibration based spell would only work if it was a conductive loss? If it's the cochlear side of sensorineural then then you run into the same problem as Sonorus. If it's the auditory nerve side then you'd need electrical currents/an analogue to an auditory brain stem implant.

Actually, I think a spell that worked on the auditory nerve would work well in most cases, you'd be sending electrical impulses in the same fashion as a cochlear implant, only spell driven?

/And whispers.../

Haha, yes - so much of this is true. It seems something that audiologists rarely tell their patients, in fact they neglect to tell their patients a number of things. I only found out because I struggle to tolerate hearing aids.

/Can you imagine having a quill keyed to the teacher's voice during their breaks or sleep talking?/

So, when I was young I had a radio aid. The microphone could be turned off both on my end and on the teacher's end. The crucial part of this story (for anyone unfamiliar with them) is that the person with the microphone has no way to check whether it's on by sound alone. Consequently it's very easy for them to forget.

As you might be able to imagine, I overheard a number of conversations to the embarrassment of my teachers. The most popular one among my classmates was when the class teacher's boyfriend had delivered some flowers to the reception. These were brought to the teacher who might otherwise had played off some convoluted story about a 'friend'. I also heard more than one teacher nip off to the loo.

Edit: I accidentally muddled and sent the message too early.

****** No need to apologise, it'll give our fandom a brief intro into how hearing loss works if they're are unaware. The only (Canon) spell I can think of that effects the nerves would be the Cruciatus curse? A very very low level, localised variant, to perhaps better simulate all the nerves in the area and a potion to supplement for the pain if there is any? (I am in no way a certified doctor nor a stern school matron).

It would be all kind of messed up if that was a way to improve hearing loss...

It's amazing what the doctors are not willing to tell you, even though it's your body. Personally, I hate my hearing aid. I know they're designed to help me, yet they just feel really wrong, I can't quite describe it.

/Radio aids... Heheheheheh/

I went to a school that was specialised in hearing loss (With a "mainstream" integration with the school next door) so every student in our small school had one. Our classes with small, with my year group (at the time) being the largest recorded group of 15 students in the school's history.

It was there I discovered I could unjack from my radio and plug it into an mp3 player. Pure bliss and certainly worth the headaches.

Of course, students doing this at school would get into trouble, so they would take their wires and "shoes" home.

Another benefit was being able to /still hear the lessons/ if you needed to go to the cloakroom/bathroom.

Unfortunately, my teachers were all aware of the fact that students would listen in to the staff room and made a habit of leaving their microphones in their classrooms or switching them off, so no stories on that end. However, that didn't stop us from listening in on the other classes...

I can tell everyone now, it was better than watching a t.v drama (So long as you didn't get caught)! We would tease our friends if they got into trouble and vice versa.

There was one "incident" where we could hear some muffled shouting (Probably about homework or something) from the classroom next door. Most of us jumped onto that channel and we could hear the teacher was really annoyed by their behavior. Even our teacher was wondering what was going on (We relayed what we could, there was so much we could hear without lips), before he "told us off and carry on with our work" before going to see if he could help calm things down. That man was a down right clever man, probably one of the best teachers that really can calm things down and has a good understanding of people's emotions.

Then, came an end of an era when the wireless radio aids came and you had to be "synced" to the teacher. Thus, a new era was born, waving our aids in the teacher's presence as we tried to get connected to their radio.

Of course, there was always one student that was "stuck" on the previous channel.

******* Haha, ah - that's fantastic. I bet your teachers were a lot more switched on than mine. I switched to a school with a resource base so a mainstream school but with 26 deaf kids plus a few extra classrooms we visited and CSAs/interpreters.

We also had those radio aids where you had to spin the dials to find your channel. The assembly hall had it's own frequency. When I first arrived I had a modern shoe/aid combo like the type you moved onto, but it overlapped with another frequency and so for nearly 6 months I was forced to listen to a class, in an entirely different year group. This is because the staff didn't believe me for ages until a new ToD came in. After that, I had to wait for new equipment to be issued.

But, yes, my friends and I also got caught trying to flip over onto frequencies to listen to people get into trouble. Luckily, the year after I wasn't the lone deaf child in my class.

On another occasion, I got into dreadful trouble because I'd had my shoes replaced not a week before when a friend jumped onto my back, pulled the wire free and the shoe was never seen again. I kept trying to argue that it wasn't my fault I'd been jumped on but I kept being told I shouldn't have allowed it. Hmm.

Unfortunately, I begged to go to mainstream school for secondary as the school I was lined up for had a knife problem. It had to go to tribunal because nobody, not my teachers, audiologists, other specialists or even the school I wanted thought that mainstream was suitable for me. I did go to the mainstream school but I think my life would have been far better in the other.

I do actually have a modern box-y one and a neck loop as I still hold great distrust for clashing loop systems and loose connections on shoes. I am told it doesn't happen like that these days and in any case where am I expecting all these deafies with radio aids to appear from. So, I have the fm genie. In hindsight, it would have been far less hassle to go with one of those nice modern Phonaks...
