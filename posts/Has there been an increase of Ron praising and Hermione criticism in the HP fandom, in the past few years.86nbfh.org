And if so, why?


** I think it's because of a reaction to the Hermione boost the movies did to her character and the character assassination they performed on Ron, isn't that about when we got a lot of Weasley bashing ? Personally I'm thrilled as Ron is an underappreciated character and I'd like to see Hermione brought down to the fallible, human, and therefore more interesting, person she is. Disservice to both their characters has been done

***** I don't have a particular story in mind, but my favorite characterization of Ron is when he's obviously knowledgeable of Wizarding politics but it only seeps through in moments you wouldn't expect it.

Like Harry and Hermione are discussing a strategy to convince the Wizengamot to listen to their point of view, and Ron just kind of offhandedly says something profound that /makes sense/. Why? Because he's /smart/ - if perhaps not in the same way as Hermione - he's just bogged down by the accomplishments of his family and those he surrounds himself with. He's insightful about and understands /people/, something that Hermione and Harry are both absolute shit at.

A Ron who slowly comes out of his shell of feeling mediocre to show he's a genuine asset to the trio, who can make allies where the other two wouldn't ever be able to, who can be the strategist not because he /plays Chess/, but because he knows the world and its inhabitants in a way that Hermione and Harry couldn't.

I love Neville as much as the next fanfiction reader, but when people shove the "Face" and representative of their movement onto him instead of /Ronald Motherfucking Weasley/ it infuriates me.

That being said, I hate the Hermione/Ron ship. You can love Ron as a character and still think that he and Hermione would never work as a couple.

***** Remember, in DH, he was a key resource in their planning of their infiltration of the ministry. He knows about the day to day things that anyone growing up would, like how the government functions and a bit about they key players. Think of yourself in high school--you knew who was who in the elections, at least for pres and if you were more aware, local and state elections too. Remember, Ron's dad is the sub-head of an entire department and is later promoted to head, and does talk about work at home. If you think of the Wizarding government as being more like the state government of a US state or a ministry in the UK (e.g. Education Ministry), then subheads know the other heads and subheads, and generally attend department and interdepartmental meetings. Ron would know a little bit, at least, of the dynamics involved in politics and the major players and their motivations, as described by his dad, and probably his brothers, growing up. Bill works for Gringotts in, essentially, Acquisitions, so he understands the economic side of things somewhat, so Ron can always send him an owl too. Even given that he's a kid at first, he still knows some of what's going on. As kids, we knew about Bush and Kerry, we knew about the Twin Towers and the WikiLeaks leak about prior warning etc. We knew about Rice (Sec of State), the UN, etc. I know, as an eleven year old, I watched 60 minutes with my dad. The Weasley's listen to the Wireless and their mum and dad mostly decide what they listen to.

This type of politics makes sense, and was a thing in the actual books, e.g. the stuff with the board of governors in chamber of secrets. 11 year olds engaging in some sort of game of thrones on crack littlefinger scheming mixed with weird psuedovictorian etiquette rules is ridiculous however imo.

****** For whatever reason, abandoning your friend not once but /twice/ in the face of peril and death constitutes being loyal to most Harry Potter fans on reddit. Every time I've seen the very idea of Ron being disloyal it's downvoted, and it's always pointed out in his positives. I don't understand it one iota. You judge a friendship on trust and loyalty. Ron has shown multiple times you can't trust him to be loyal when the shit hits the fan. His never stops being jealous and envious of Harry, down to the very last page of the series (longing for the Elder Wand Harry was giving up). Twice in four years he leaves Harry to the wolves while Hermione stands by his side like, yknow, a loyal friend, in the exact same scenarios.

Ron is a fine character, and a lot can be done with him in FF to continue that trend. But I've never seen a good argument for why Ron could ever be thought of as loyal.

******* Arguments for Ron being loyal... that's a tough one. Let's take a crack at it.

In year one he felt bad that Hermione was crying in the bathroom because she heard a (tbh well deserved) comment /she wasn't supposed to hear/ so he and Harry ran to the bathroom to save her with very little hesitation.

Later that year he stands on top of a giant chessboard, looking at massive stone chess pieces just waiting to hurt him, and decides that the best course of action is to sacrifice himself so that his two friends won't get hurt and they can go ahead.

In year two after Harry never returned any of the letters he sent him, he gets frightened for his best friend and gets Fred and George to come with him on a rescue mission, flagrantly disobeying his parents and the Ministry. Just because he thought his friend might be in trouble. Then he stands by him when the rest of the school thinks he's the Heir of Slytherin, even though he has the same fear of Parseltongue that's embedded in British wizarding culture since Slytherin's time. He then follows Harry into the Forbidden Forest, following a trail of spiders, which he's deathly afraid of, only to come face to face with gigantic spiders.

In third year he stands up on a badly broken leg in front of his friends, in front of what he believed to be Voldemort's right hand man, a man who he thought was a sadistic murderer, and said, “If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!”

In fifth year he stands up to peer pressure and tells Seamus that he has Harry's back, and he believes him fully, even though the entirety of the British wizarding world thought Harry and Dumbledore were nuts. Then he joins Harry to fly to London to save Sirius, even though he thought he was flying towards Lord Voldemort.

In seventh year he leaves his family during one of the most trying times of their lives, and joins his friends on a hunt for Horcruxes, braving Death Eaters, dragons, goblins, and everything else with only his faith in Harry and Dumbledore to guide him. Then, for Hermione, he thinks of saving the house elves, beings he was taught were lesser than humans for his entire life.

Yeah, I left out year 4 and year 7 when he left.

Throughout this, Ron is a kid. An average kid, with maybe above average skill in chess, but still just an average kid. All his life he's been in the shadow of quidditch stars, pranksters that get all the attention, perfect-in-every-way Bill, and studious Percy. Then he makes friends with the savior of the wizarding world, and the smartest girl he's ever met.

I'm not excusing what he did in fourth year. What he did was disloyal and the height of jealousy and pettiness. But that's what fourteen year old kids are a lot of the time. He came back, however, and apologized and /meant it/. Because that's what real friends do.

In 7th year he was influenced by the Horcrux. Period. There's no way you can blame it on him, unless you can also blame Ginny for releasing the Basilisk and petrifying all those people. Not only him, but Harry was influenced too. They were both angry, miserable, and every negative emotion was amplified until it boiled over. The second Ron left and the horcrux was off him, he realized what a colossal mistake he made and tried to go back -- but couldn't. To call this being disloyal is putting your own biases ahead of facts.

Which is what Ron hatred is. Ignoring and forgetting every good thing he did and focusing on the one time he did something stupid, and one time he was influenced by outside forces to do something stupid.

Hey look at that, finding evidence for loyalty wasn't that hard at all. ;)

Meanwhile Hermione straight up doesn't give a shit that Crookshanks murdered Scabbers (which all the evidence pointed to) and didn't give a shit about Harry's Firebolt or his feelings, to the extent that without talking to Harry, maneuvers things so that he gets it taken away and then acts the victim when he gets mad at her.

Oh lets not forget her massive inferiority complex in Half Blood Prince when she got so jealous that Harry dared do things better than her in potions. Why is this forgotten, while Ron's isn't? I wonder...

But she's perfect in every way so she's made into some kind of goddess in every fic.

I would add one thing to your list, and perhaps include a footnote: First of all, still in first year, when Harry, Hermione and Neville are all ostracized for losing Gryffindor 150 points, Ron is the only one who stands by them, even though associating with Harry and Hermione means he gets shunned and detested by assosiation.

As for the footnote, I'd add that for the falling-out in fourth year, Harry was in no way innocent here. He got butthurt that Ron didn't believe him, refused to explain anything, and then when Hermione tried to get him to talk he just got angry. The most Ron did during the fight was pull away from Harry and sulk -- Harry hurled insults and threw badges at Ron. And yet fans don't seem to see anything wrong with Harry's behaviour in all of this. Protagonist-centered morality at its finest!

It always irked me that while Ron tried to apologise for his behavior, Harry never did... and never even seemed to consider that he had anything to apologise for. Harry has a lot of admirable qualities and there's no denying that overall he's a compassionate and heroic person... but he can be a bit of a self-centered douche.

Hermione did something rude and annoying, which grated on Ron's nerves. Instead of pushing her around or telling her to her face that she's a know-it-all with no friends, he went to his friend Harry and let his feelings known to him. Everyone has done this. Bullies, victims, nice people, bad people, everyone in between. It's a way of letting some of the frustration and anger go without hurting anybody else. Ron's only mistake was doing it within earshot of Hermione.

*************** Everyone around them was having trouble with that particular spell, but no, leave it to Hermione to snap at Ron for not getting it right yet, just because she has an easier time of getting things right. It's not like she couldn't have been nicer about it, despite what you're pretending. Also, Ron's comment was clearly talking about what happened in the Charms class /and/ the other instances of Hermione's attitude scattered all across the prior two months. And he was correct: you don't get friends by being condescending and rude.

Ron has every right to vent to his friend about someone being rude to them. The reason why you don't want to accept that Hermione was being rude is because it gets in the way of your narrative of "poor little Hermione being bullied by evil Ron". But don't let me spoil that.

******** 1.  Well deserved? No one deserves to be bullied Ron is clearly upset (or embarrassed) that the muggleborn witch is better at magic than him and attacks her after she tried to help him master the spell and only goes along to help her because of Harry. Loyalty to Harry maybe but I think it is more attempting to keep from getting in trouble.
2.  That is a fair point Ron does sacrifice himself in the chess game to let them go forward.
3.  2nd year yep he is a good friend to Harry. The 2nd year examples, however, requires very little personal sacrifice on his part for that loyalty.
4.  Again though given that Sirius is believed to be mass murderer the likelihood of hiding behind Harry would increase the odds of surviving are slim.
5.  I see you leave out book 4 until latter. I will address it here let me just point out that even after knowing what Harry is going to face Ron cannot get over himself enough to tell his 'best mate' about the dragon he is going to face. It certainly seems that Ron chooses his pride over Harry's safety.
6.  Because his family (except of Percy) all believe Dumbledore as well it takes very little personal risk on his part to back Harry especially given his higher social status as a prefect which he uses against Seamus to shut him up. Yes, Ron goes on the London mission, however, so do Ginny, Neville and Luna all of who have not been with Harry as consistently as Ron and Hermione. This was not some unique act of loyalty.
7.  Yes, he joins that hunt but he also abandons them and suffers the worst from the Horcrux. Unlike Hermione who stays by Harry's side throughout (even offering to go with Harry to the Dark Forest so he won't have to go to his death alone).
8.  Except in both cases Hermione stays by his side. That is the problem when given the same out she refuses to move from his side Ron has no problem abandoning Harry in these cases.
9.  Ah yes the 3rd year and 6th year and Hermione's problems. First, she was right that he did not kill Scabbers.
10. Crookshanks is part-kneazle and thus is very intelligent and can detect the trustworthiness of others.
11. Flat out wrong she cares about Harry being safe and alive so much that she willingly risks her friendship with him (likely her first friend ever) to do so. That is very loyal to Harry Hermione could have handled this issue better (tell Harry her suspicions first) but if Ron should get a pass for being 14 Hermione should get the same.
12. You clearly missed why Hermione is upset (so did Ron make of that what you will). Hermione is upset because she works for her results, for example, putting in the extra time in the library doing extra research to better understand the concepts she is learning and practicing the magic they are going to be attempting in class before the lesson. Hermione also clearly benefits from these actions with that ridiculous grade on her first year charms final. in HBP Harry gets better results without putting in the work to understand why that worked which goes against Hermione's core values: doing the work yourself and that hard work paying off. She warns him that using the knowledge of that book without understanding the how it works will hurt him and she is right (sectumsempra scene).

Why is this forgotten (or forgiven?) because she is always right Scabbers was not dead, Sirius did send the firebolt and the potion book was dangerous if not used properly. You don't have to like it but canon always justifies when Hermione betrays Harry's trust but not when Ron. And that is why Hermione gets a pass in fanfiction but Ron does not.

********* I appreciate you took the time to try and rebuff me.

Hermione didn't leave in book 4 because she's not suffering from the same things Ron is suffering from. But she has problems of her own, which I'll get to.

Ron was literally wearing the horcrux when the fight started. He had been wearing it all day. Harry and Hermione had not. That's the difference here. That's why you can't compare him to Hermione staying. Hermione even said:

#+begin_quote
  “Take off the locket, Ron,” Hermione said, her voice unusually high. “Please take it off. You wouldn't be talking like this if you hadn't been wearing it all day.”
#+end_quote

And we know that Hermione is always right, isn't that what you've said?

Let's talk about her. In 3rd year she got a pet. It was an ugly cat, that's all they knew about it. I'm pretty sure it was Sirius who told them it was half kneazle. And the cat had been after Scabbers since before Hermione bought him. And the first thought that goes through people's heads shouldn't be, "Scabbers is untrustworthy!" but rather that cats like to kill and eat smaller animals, as they are a predator species.

When Ron was trying to find out what was wrong with Scabbers, when Crookshanks appeared out of nowhere and tried to catch Scabbers, Ron and Harry had to run outside and go all the way to the Quidditch store to finally get him. Hermione stayed inside the pet store and bought Scabbers. That's a shitty friend. A friend's first instinct is to help a friend in need, and Ron's pet rat had just escaped. But all Hermione could think of was buying the cat that put Ron in the predicament he was in.

And then every time Crookshanks saw Ron, he would attack the pocket Scabbers was in. Hermione, instead of stopping the cat, would tell Ron to get over it and calm down and to not shove Crookshanks away. Again, that's a shitty friend, and a shitty pet owner. Hermione's response to everything was to minimize Ron's feelings and put Crookshanks above everything else.

Then it happened. Ron went to his room to find Scabbers, but only found blood. He also found Crookshanks fur. Hermione refused to believe that Crookshanks killed and ate Scabbers, /despite all the evidence to support Ron/. Crookshanks was always on the prowl for Scabbers, to the point that Harry once had to drag him out of the dorm when the cat tried to sneak in, but because Hermione didn't want to believe it, she didn't.

Hermione's greatest flaw is that she always thinks she's right. And granted, many times she is. But when she thinks she's right, she refuses to back down. In the same book, Lavender's beloved pet rabbit died and she was in tears over the news. Hermione only cared about proving that Trelawney wasn't right, disregarding all social norms and everyone else's feelings -- because she had to prove that she was better than Trelawney. Her being right took priority over everything else, no matter that everyone was glaring at her for being an insensitive asshole.

So she refused to apologize, because that would have made wrong about Crookshanks from the start, and that she was wrong to always come to his defense.

Then she refused to apologize about the Firebolt, and even said I TOLD YOU SO when it turned out that Sirius did send it, because, again, proving she's right is really important to her. My issue with her in this instance is not that she told McGonagall, she was right to do so. My issue was that she didn't even try and convince Harry to go to McGonagall or Dumbledore himself. She took it upon herself to do it, because she was convinced she was right.

The problem is that you're looking at her actions in 20/20 hindsight. You have to look at them as they occur. Yes, Scabbers was Pettigrew and a rat animagus which Crookshanks immediately smelled out, and that was why he was always attacking him. But then -- Hermione scoffed at Ron when Ron said that Crookshanks wasn't a normal cat, that he actually knew what he was saying and that's how he knew where Scabbers was. She was wrong about that, but never cared enough to bring it up.

We only find all this out when we learn Pettigrew is a animagus. Before that point, everything pointed to Scabbers being finally eaten by the cat that had been after him the entire year. Pettigrew staged the scene to make it seem like that's exactly what happened. A friend, a true friend, would suck in their pride and apologize whole heartedly. They would be devastated, horrified, that their pet killed their best friend's pet. They would feel sick to their stomach. Hermione pushed all these feelings aside because she didn't want to be wrong, and told Ron that he had no proof, so Crookshanks was innocent, and never apologized.

Harry did the equivalent of using better and simpler methods to achieve the same or better result in potions than he would by using the standard method taught, the one which Hermione used. He's not cheating. These are actually better ways to do potions, because Snape is a genius who figured these ways out when he was Hermione's age. If, as you say, Hermione was angry because Harry was using shortcuts to do better than her, the non-jealous reaction would be to ask Harry to see the book, see the methods, and try and figure out why they worked better than the standard method, and then start using these methods herself. That's what any good scientist would do. But she refused, and continued using the standard method, and got mad at Harry when he kept beating her, because he was using better methods.

But people are missing the point. It's GOOD that Hermione has flaws. Everyone has flaws. But people ignore these gigantic flaws in order to make her the perfect girl for Harry, and that's why fanon Hermione is such a terrible character.

********* Funny... when GoF was published, I was ten and I thought /Harry/ was being a massive self-centered jerk throughout much of the book. Not saying Ron handled the argument well, but Harry was worse.

I mean, that scene where Ron gets worried about Harry and goes to check on him, and Harry gets so angry when his conversation with Sirius is interrupted that he decides he hated Ron, throws a badge at his head, screams at him, and storms off.

And Ron doesn't even retaliate. He just stands there, totally broken.

That was when I started seriously disliking Harry. A feeling that just got stronger in OOTP, where Harry goes into hyper-angst-mode, spends an awful lot of time screaming at everybody and demands special treatment from everyone, and even when people try to sit him down carefully and explain why something is a bad idea, Harry just explodes in anger and goes and does it anyway, cause he's HARRY POTTER!

When I got older, I ended up having more sympathy for Harry again, even though I still think he's by far the least interesting character in the franchise. I get that he's going through a lot, and most of his douchiest behaviour is born out of frustration with a difficult situation... but I still find it a little irksome that nobody ever call him out on how totally self-centered he is.

*********** I'm just sick and tired of all this bile directed towards Ron, especially this constant harping on about how he isn't a good friend -- when Harry was by far the poorer friend of the two.

Harry's relationship with both Ron and Hermione are definitely NOT one of equals -- both of them are far better friends to him that he is to them. Over the course of the books, you always see Ron and Hermione they go out of their way to be there for Harry, support him, cancel their plans for him, make sure he's included in everything. Harry, however, is far less willing to do the same for them, unless doing so benefits him in some way. In their friendship, Harry tends to take and take, while Ron and Hermione give and give.

Now, there is a reason for this. Often, Harry just needs more support than Ron and Hermione do because his problems are objectively bigger. And it would be wrong to say that Harry never sticks up for other people, or that he wouldn't gladly risk his life for Ron or Hermione if he needed to. If there's an emergency, he's all set to rush to their aid.

But you see time and time again that he tends to ignore their problems, worries and concerns, and focus exclusively on himself and what HE gets out of it. This is most notable in his relationship with Hermione -- most of the time Harry literally could not care less about what she does whenever she isn't there helping him -- but Ron gets a fair bit of it too.

I'm fairly sure that the main reason why Harry isn't a more hated character is because he's the main character. We get to see his reasons for everything and the story is told from his point of view. But being Harry Potter's friend has to be extremely trying, and you see both Ron and Hermione get tired of it at times. The difference is that Hermione will immediately let Harry know when she thinks he's being unreasonable -- which Harry will generally ignore because he doesn't respond well to nagging -- but Ron tends to bottle up until it gets out of hand, which happens twice in the series. And because it does get out of hand, people tend to remember that more, and -- like Harry -- forget how Ron is USUALLY Harry's biggest supporter.

******** One bout of jealousy that lasted months and only came back with a halfhearted apology. Besides giving him a reason behind his disloyalty /does not/ excuse it. And the horcrux effected all of them equally. If you want to argue 'it effected Ron most' it was because he was the weakest and most disloyal one of the bunch. Ron also doesn't stay loyal to Hermione after agreeing to go on a date, instead blowing her off for Lavender at the slightest hint of Ron feeling inferior to someone. And again, you have the perfect counter example to laugh at all of the excuses Ron gets in his disloyalty in Hermione, who stands by him stoutly each time Ron doesn't.

It's a constant theme throughout the entire series. Ron is as loyal as they come until something threatens his terrible sense of self-worth. Then it's 'Ron first, fuck everyone else'.

**** I like Ron. I think he has the capacity to be funny, charming and yes a complete shit and brute, but who doesn't? I've only written a very few stories of the HP characters as teenagers because I find adults much more interesting and versatile. I use him as a foil for Harry. When Harry is too intense, Ron is there to settle him down and when Harry is about to do something ridiculous, Ron is there to talk sense into him. He has no qualms of telling Harry off, but he never hesitates to support him when needed. Ron will be the guy you call when you need to hide a body, no questions asked.

In the books, I kind of think that Ron was the most "teenager-y" of the teenagers. Moody, insecure and a complete shit sometimes because he /could/ be. He had a freedom neither Harry or Hermione had. Harry because ... well ... /Harry/ and Hermione because of all the pressure she put onto herself. Ron was just the last, least exceptional son in a bunch who happened to befriend two extradorinaiy individuals and there's nothing wrong with that. He was our window into what a normal wizarding upbringing could be.

Now, I say all that and right now, he and Hermione are just kind of chilling out in my Potterverse. They're kind of like that couple that are there and super chill and cool to hang with. I like using them as support characters for my Harry/Ginny stories, but I'm having some trouble coming up with ideas for the two of them. Maybe they need a vacation?

Sorry, but I don't see Ron supporting Hermione's ambitions...he might not think of her as a brood-mother like his mom (hell, Ron probably wouldn't want many kids because he thinks growing up with many siblings is kind of crappy because your parents have only so much attention to give etc. especially when some of the kids are away most of the time (Hogwarts and later on because of work, I mean Charlie isn't home often IMHO and Bill isn't either probably!) and get almost all of the attention when they are back home!), but I don't think he'd work well with a wife that is better than him in every regard (it would be a repeat of his childhood all over, being the unremarkable sidekick of a successful and intelligent woman! Hell, he would basically be the "housewife" in that relationship, I don't think he would like that at all!)

ps: I am discarding the crapilogue (canon my ass, even Rowling admits that a lot of it was wish-fulfillment and sticking "to the plan" (Ron/Hermione for example! She admitted that she only did that because that's what she had planned!))

** I feel like when you first get into fanfiction, people are naturally inclined against Ron and favour Hermione. The movies didn't do him justice and the Hermione/Ron ship isn't that popular.

The more time you spend in the fandom, seeing Ron getting bashed, the more you're likely to become bored of it. While you may have at first appreciated seeing it, as you spend more time analysing the characters, Hermione's flaws become more apparent and Ron seems more sympathetic. When I first started reading fanfiction, though I never personally disliked Ron, I exclusively stuck to Harry-centric stories; now I've moved beyond them. The other thing might just be influential stories appearing that have Ron in a likeable role becoming popular which shifted people's opinions, but I'm not sure.

The fandom in general has gotten older I think, including the people in it. I'd be curious to know how long ago the average fanfic reader read the Harry Potter books. It was ~2006 for me. Anyway, that's why I think there might have been an opinion shift over time.

Mostly because the first actual HP fic I've read was "Angry Harry and Seven" which is a horrible fic, but it introduced me to Daphne, which I loved from the get-go. And a lot of Harry/Daph fics have major Ron bash, mostly because she's a slimy snek. But I think the deal breaker was reading that series "Congregation of Asp" or smth like that. Over time, I just became more and more annoyed with Hermione "I S2 Authorities" and all that trope, eventually becoming my most hated character in HP, with a few exceptions, like a battle-veteran Hermione from "Stages of Hope" or an AU Hermione like from "What we're fighting for" from James spookie.

Once during the summer before 5th year, when Dumbledore didn't want her to contact Harry. And the second time during the sixth year when she was jealous of Harry because of the book.

She is loyal to Harry as long as Dumbledore doesn't ask her to abandon him.

******* You are misrepresenting things. Her knowledge alone solved the Basilisk issue which for some reason even Dumbledore hadn't puzzled out, her use of the Time Turner allowed Harry to stop the Dementors, it was almost entirely her work with Harry that let him survive the tournament (she picked out the spell selection and helped Harry and Ron train & learn the spells). And you cannot somehow blame the troll incident on her, she was the victim...

She was there more than Sirius (both before and after he entered the story). None of the Weasleys (save for Ron, who was still there less than Hermione) were there for Harry nearly as often, especially the twins. At least for Arthur and Molly you could say they gave him housing during parts of the summers.

And she didn't abandoned Harry at Dumbledore's request. Dumbledore forbade it, something everyone listened to. I agree it was pretty stupid given the events of 4th year but then everyone becomes equally to blame for that, meaning Hermione can't be singled out (you'll note she also tried to contact him when Dumbledore stopped them).

But realy, the troll incident was her fault???

Harry tried to avoid or ignore Hermione much more than Sirius.

Dumbledore forbade it but it doesn't mean that she should have listened to him. She could have at least tried some hidden message.

And Sirius was nowhere near as good a friend. Hermione was there through everything, even when it seemingly required her to choose between staying with Harry and leaving with her apparent love. Sirius was simply never there for Harry to avoid, and given he was an adult, there was really no situation where avoiding him made sense (and even then, Harry avoided Hermione during part of 1 book, lol).

How would she sneak a message passed experienced wizard's who are well versed in hiding secrets? It's not like she stopped talking to Harry, she just couldn't put what the Order was doing in a letter for obvious security reasons. You'll note that both Sirius and Ron did the same thing.

I give you quotes:

- No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learnt and wondering which one she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. (SS86/115)

- 'No!' shouted Hermione Granger. 'Madam Hooch told us not to move - you'll get us all into trouble.'

Harry ignored her. (SS110/148)

- Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.

'Come on,' he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole. (SS115/155)

- "No!" said Hermione quickly. "Harry isn't supposed to leave the castle, Ron --"

"Yeah, let's go," said Harry, sitting up, "and I can ask him how come he never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents!" (PA160/216)

- "Ron," said Hermione, in an I-don't-think-you're-being-very-sensitive sort of voice, "Harry doesn't want to play Quidditch right now... . He's worried, and he's tired. . . . We all need to go to bed..."

"Yeah, I want to play Quidditch," said Harry suddenly. "Hang on, I'll get my Firebolt." (GF134/150)

- "Harry," Hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice.

"I'm going to bed," said Harry shortly. "See you in the morning." (GF200/227)

- 'Harry, no!' Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at his sleeve, but Harry jerked his arm out of her reach. (OP221/245)

- Harry did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today; he doodled idly on his parchment ignoring Hermione's frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily. (OP316/355)

- It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early, leaving Crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly knitted elf hats lying on a table by the fire. Harry was rather grateful that she was not around, because he did not much want to discuss his scar hurting and have her urge him to go to Dumbledore, too. (OP340/383)

- Harry received two more 'D's in Potions; he was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get the sack; and he couldn't stop himself dwelling on the dream in which he had been Voldemort - though he didn't bring it up with Ron and Hermione again; he didn't want another telling-off from Hermione. (OP519/589)

- For the first time ever, she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore. (OP581/660)

- When the bell rang, he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance, and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him again about using Umbridge's office. (OP582/661)

- This suited Harry very well; he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape, and to his relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency (OP622/706)

Same in the fifth year and during the hunt, where she was the mastermind behind Harry. She even chose him over her supposed love.

******** One of the things that makes me really uncomfortable with Hermione in fandom is that I've read only one fic where someone calls her out on attacking Ron with the birds in HBP. Even highly rated pro-Ron or R/H fics that cover sixth year pretty much universally just let it go. Maybe she internally resolves not to do it again, but that's it. Neither Harry nor Ginny ever give her the colossal ass-chewing she so sorely needs. And again, I've seen McGonagall take it seriously /once/.

In the book, they claw at all his exposed flesh and leave him covered in wounds. What if he didn't get his hands up in front of his face fast enough, and he lost an eye? That's not an unheard of outcome for a serious bird attack. This is a serious crime. Like, expulsion, breaking of her wand, and a jail sentence kind of serious. Assault occasioning actual bodily harm (with a weapon enhancement) or assault with a deadly weapon are not trivial offenses.

And for what? She's jealous that someone she hasn't even expressed interest in is dating someone else. That's pretty nuts. Even if she caught him cheating, a violent weapon attack is unacceptable, but Ron doesn't even know she's interested, let alone owes her fidelity. Like, if I had a crush on a friend and I saw her kissing someone else, and my response was to slash open her arms a lot with my pocketknife or set my dogs on her, I'd be a violent abuser who needs to go away and get some serious therapy before being in public again. And it would be surprising and kinda messed up if her sibling and best friend didn't cut me out.

And I'm someone who /likes/ Hermione. But her vindictive streak is a flaw that even authors that think they're not erasing her flaws still erase or excuse.

Hermione quickly ended up knowing more about the wizarding world than him, and he was never once able to carve out a niche where he mattered or really contributed to developing the narrative. It was a shame, honestly. Hermione's was a know-it-all, sure, but she was a stranger in a new world, brilliant and tended to solve the problems and mysteries vexing Harry.

** Is it, like, double-reverse backlash? Triple? I may have lost count.

Fans weren't happy that it wound up being Ron/Hermione. So they wrote Harry/Hermione and turned Ron into a POS to get rid of him. The movies helped by giving Ron's best material to Hermione, turning him into a kind of hanger-on who's not strictly necessary.

The backlash.

Okay, but then they turned Hermione into, like, the queen of all magic or something so writers began making her into a Dumbledore drone who will betray Harry for books at the drop of a hat.

Reverse backlash.

So now Harry needs another 2nd. They can build up Neville or turn to the Blank Slates (Susan Bones, Daphne Greengrass, etc. mostly) or they can bring Ron back.

Double-reverse backlash.

Mix all of this together and you have Harry, Flawed Hermione (who acknowledges her shortcomings and works to overcome them), and Resurgent Ron with one or two ancillary characters tacked on for completeness (Pureblood Nonsense is passed through families so Hermione's out; Weasleys haven't been down with the Nonsense in generations so Ron's out; Neville or the Blank Slates fill in the details that the others can't.)

If you sort by Faves/Kudos, you generally don't seen any ron bashing in the first few pages of a search or tag search, so again, it looks like there's less of it.

** Character analysis aside, I think as the fandom ages they realize that the pairing of Hermione and Ron wouldn't be ideal given what we know about them. They could fall in love of course, but other pairings might work out better long term. Writers are catering to this too much, and I say this as someone who reads 80% H/Hr. Honestly, Neville and Hermione are better suited than any of the canon pairings. Easily the two most loyal characters and incredibly brave as well, not to mention the +2 sappy romance factor of sitting together on their first trip to Hogwarts,

This unfortunately seems to translate to a need to tear down Ron Weasley instead of evolving him into another role.

** I don't think so, both are praised despite the fact that neither (IMHO!) has much (if any!) character development...if anything they don't get criticised enough, especially Hermione (I mean she doesn't know boundaries and can't accept it if somebody doesn't want to spill all their secrets to her, damned girl leave well enough alone!) the "smartest witch of her age" (yeah right, we don't even know how she stacks up against the Raveclaws or the Slytherins in their year!) who gets to boss Harry around in basically every fanfiction where she plays an important role...same for Ron who's contributions (or lack of contributions!) gets blown out of proportion ("Best friend" - yeah, sorry IMHO that's Hermione, as much as I dislike her sometimes!)

Hermione is basically a plot-device (because Rowling made Harry a dumb idiot who isn't curious in the slightest IMHO...damned, how you can treat magic just like "meh" and not try to study hard? I mean you don't have to be interested in everything, but not displaying any sense of wounder any sense of "I want to learn this" (except when your life is in danger!)?) and Ron is a plot-hindrance often enough IMHO (I mean he was willing to more or less get Harry killed because of jealousy! Gods damned mate, get a grip and pull your head out of your ass!)...then again a lot is emotionally stunted and isolationist (come on: He has two friends and a few acquaintances and isn't even all that interested in girls...Cho doesn't count IMHO) Harry's fault! Someone with more friends would have probably told either to sod off at various points (Hermione after snitching about the Firebolt and Ron after his jealousy in GoF)...

** I honestly struggle to think of what to praise about Ron other than him being the funny one. His utility to the plot completely ended after Philosopher's Stone since Hermione quickly knew almost everything he did and more and was a magic whiz kid who solved nearly every problem that faced the trio.

Like I /want/ to like Ron, but his canon portrayal (in the books too) didn't endear him to me. The idea that it was mostly the movies is a fantasy. Abandoning your friends twice (first from random mistrust and the second from jealousy and anger, not just the Horcrux (a burden the other 2 shared)) is just a bad look.

I'm writing a fanfic currently and my disinterest in Ron made me outline things such that Ron probably will be unimportant and replaced by Neville and Draco. :/

*** Well, firstly, if you're thinking of friends by reference to their utility then you have fundamentally misunderstood friendship (and by extension, one of the most prominent themes of the HP series).

But secondly, the fact that Ron *only* put his own interests above Harry's twice in the space of 7 years is, frankly, superhuman. Very few friends in real life would willingly follow each other into one life-threatening situation, never mind do it again and again.

Seriously, the real life equivalent of DH would be one of your friends, tomorrow, suggesting you travel to Syria in an attempt to track down and kill Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The fact that Ron said "yes" to that without a moment's hesitation speaks to his loyalty. I know for sure I'd laugh in the face of any friend who suggested such a course of action. That Ron later abandoned such an insane mission is looking at it in the wrong way. Going in the first place was an act of friendship far above and beyond normal friendship. Abandoning the mission after several months makes him merely a great friend, rather than literally Jesus.

The standard of friendship you're proposing Ron be judged against is just not reasonable by any degree. You're saying that to be a good friend, you have to be willing to sacrifice all of your interests, up to and including your life, to your friend's interests, and that any lapse in this sacrifice renders one unforgivably disloyal. To me that sounds less like friendship and more like slavery.

**** I absolutely 100% agree with this! Honestly, people act like Ron's entire job as a friend is to be whatever Harry needs, all of the time. Ron faced his greatest fear, walking TOWARDS it, at age 12 for his friend Harry. He, with a broken leg, tells Sirius Black, who he believe to be a deranged mass murderer and Dark wizard, he'd have to kill him to get to Harry. Yea, he fucks up in 4th year, but honestly, once in four YEARS is huge. He was willing to sacrifice himself for Harry, not once, not twice, but every year (chess game in first year), so I think a bit of an argument is honestly nothing. He ALWAYS comes through when it counts. That is a ridiculously amazing friend! People marry other people who will do less for them--Ron is more devoted to Harry and his cause, than most spouses are to one another. 2 fights in 7 years is literal gold when it comes to friendships and relationships of any kind.

No, I was talking about Ron's usefulness as a character. This is a meta issue involving Ron's purpose as a character, I obviously am not Ron's friend nor did I refer to others characters needing to treat Ron simppy as a tool, so this doesn't make any sense.

Not what I said. It had more to do with the fact that it occurred (particularly in DH) in a way that put his friends lives in danger. No one thinks that soldiers in the military are Jesus for repeatedly putting themselves into life threatening situations. They are admired, yes, but those who abandon their comrades in arms in such situations are rightly viewed very negatively. No one goes "Ah well, you know they were great in all these other situations".

****** He was acting as a soldier. The wizarding world doesn't seem to have formal soldiers, but there's an obvious difference in what the trio was doing and what the average witch & wizard were doing.

Or here. They were acting as Aurors, and do you think Aurors who leave their coworkers in the field are praised for being it otherwise good people?

Anywau, this is somewhat tangential to my initial post. I just don't know what Ron's purpose is supposed to be unless it's just to be the everyman wizard.

Anyway, that's entirely irrelevant to my point. The reason I brought up soldiers and Aurors is that no one would praise them for being otherwise decent people if they abandoned their comrades in life threatening adventures. In other words, you can be a decent or even good friend and yet still be called shitty for running out on your friends or being dickish in other scenarios.

*** It's super easy to look at the books and call Ron misloyal. But if I could shove some fucking perspective into opinion:

If I had a friend who stuck by my side while being hunted by the literal embodiment of evil, targeted by the wizarding world be it via the press or the entire fucking government, while I soaked up all the attention and put him in my shadow, albeit not by intention, and only fucks off /twice/ over /7 years/ starting from when we're literally /pre-teens/, I'd consider that the most loyal friend in the entire goddamn world.

To top off this shit sandwich, you're going to replace Ron and one of the choices is /Draco fucking Malfoy/ looooooooool

**** That might be true, except that then we have Hermione who did the same thing and stayed by his side without fucking off twice.

I may personally dislike Ron, but saying that he's more loyal than or as loyal as Hermione (as some comments claim) isn't really the true.

Sure, a friend that in those circumstances falters only twice is still a good friend, but you can't claim him to be more loyal than a friend who didn't falter.

I answered under your comment because you (rightly so) put the times Ron fucked up into perspective, but some (most?) of the people who defend Ron's action because everyone's got flaws also criticize Hermione more than she deserves and forget that while Ron might have been loyal throughout most of the series, Hermione never really fucked up like he did.

**** He didn't stick by his side. He already dicked around in year 4 because "Wah my friend got entered into a lethal competition against his will". To top it off, that jealously streak was (while minor compared to what happened in DH) pervasive throughout a bunch of the portions of other books too. "Why am I poor while you have all this money" (from your dead family).

And that the second time it happens to put your friends lives in danger while the other friend stuck by without fail for the previous years? Yeah that's disloyalty and combined with the other shifty things from 3rd and 6th year where he was constantly disloyal to Hermione too makes it look like a character flaw, not a few times where, woops, I goofed.

And not that I owe you an explanation, but the Malfoys don't have the same history or quite the same disposition as in canon.
