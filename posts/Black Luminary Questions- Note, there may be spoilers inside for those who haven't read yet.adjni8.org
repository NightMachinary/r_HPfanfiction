Hello,

Been reading this story for a while, and while the world building is good, I sometimes feel like I have to go back ten chapters to understand what exactly is going on.

Could somebody here put up the most important parts of the plot that have been revealed so far. Here's what I remember

Harry had problems interacting with girls, and doesn't like been touched by them? (except Daphne and maybe Tracey & Amy?)

Daphne is Regulus' daughter, and Regulus was killed by an Auror named Prewett. Arcturus asked his own daughter, who was married to Prewett to kill him, but she died instead.

What is the exact role Arcturus is playing? Does he retain the power to right all of Harry's "mistakes"? I remember some story with the Lethifolds- it sometimes feels like the Blacks are all powerful, and in another instance, absolutely powerless.

Is there a Voldemort in the story, and is Harry still the prophecy child? Or just Grindewald? And is Aenor related to him?

There's some reason in the recent chapters that Tracey is angry at Harry, and I'm not sure why (after a runes lesson in class)

** Confusion is a common theme with this story, probably cause at least 30% of the content is pointless. The rest is pretty good though.

#+end_quote

I think this is because Harry grew up with some ministry "maids" (spies) who stunted his emotional development by manipulating him and generally fucking him up.

#+end_quote

This has not yet been 100% cleared up, I think. Prewett says Artcturus ordered Lucretia to kill her husband and she was /compelled/ to do it and she chose to take her own life. That may not be what happened though. Arcturus may be ruthless enough to be capable of it, Idk if he's that callous.

Again, it's not exactly clear cut. Arcturus's goals seem to be 1) The family's safety (but the unit's safety, rathen than the individuals) and 2) regaining the family's power.

#+end_quote

From what I understood, Black family members are tasked to do shit by themselves. If they can't solve their own problems and the family has to step in, that means they owe obedience to the family (a bit like owing the mob a favor). In the case of the Lethifolds, Arcturus judged that it would be a task beyond Harry's (or perhaps any regular wizard's) capabilities, hence why he stepped in.

This is a shortcoming of the story. In broad strokes, the Blacks have lost the majority of their influence in the ministry and most of their allies. However they still have enormous wealth, magical power (i.e skilled magic users and archives of knowledge) and a cabal of "hidden" vassal families. That is, families that are sworn to their service, in exchange for protection. I'd guess that noone knows about those except for the family in question and Arcturus. Maybe a couple more senior family members.

#+begin_quote
  Is there a Voldemort in the story
#+end_quote

No clue.

#+begin_quote
  Harry still the prophecy child
#+end_quote

You know, I've absolutely no idea. I think there is something special to him "officially" but it's been so long since I last read the beginning chapters.

#+begin_quote
  And is Aenor related to him?
#+end_quote

There is definitely some fuckery about Aenor. Some popular theories are that she's Voldemort's diary reborn, that she's actually Voldemort the original, that she's something to Grindelwald. Nobody knows.

#+begin_quote
  There's some reason in the recent chapters that Tracey is angry at Harry, and I'm not sure why (after a runes lesson in class)
#+end_quote

Tracey is mad at Harry because of how he treated Hermione (manipulation + memory charms) and because of the Greengrasses becoming vassals to the Blacks (she views it as slavery).

I thought it was obvious foreshadowing that she came from the Black who was too good with memory charms and erased herself from everyone's memory. Which would explain why she is sticking to the Blacks, she is technically one of them.

That part really ruined the story for me. The lethifolds had a death toll roughly a ten times the Blitz (30000 compared to over a quarter of million IIRC) and yet the actual bad part is that the Aurors are suspicious afterwards. I mean, I get giving no quarter to enemies, but that was three times Hiroshima right in the centre of London, not your enemies manor.

*** Does it ever get less melodramatic? I ask not because I think melodrama is a bad thing, but because most of the conflict felt unearned, it lacked grounding in the world.

It was, I think, more a pacing or presentation issue. Rather than empathising with the characters I was rolling my eyes at the histrionics.
