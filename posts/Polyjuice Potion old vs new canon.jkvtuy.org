** The books make several references to the exact one-hour duration (I seem to recall Dumbledore of all people mentioning it when they finally catch on to Barty's impersonation of Moody), so at the very least it's a retcon of existing material. But on the whole I don't think I'd have much of a problem with it. I'm kind of loosey-goosey in that way with details like that; as long as the broad strokes are there, I can work with whatever minutiae you want. Just make it clear to the reader somehow.

For Polyjuice in particular, if you wanted to make an attempt at welding the two together, you could say something like one hour is the accepted average duration for a successful brew, absent unusual (lack of) skill.

** The new cannon would definitely fit better as just going through the instructions wold not male a potions master and precise steps must be carried out to make a potion otherwise there would be no point to grade a potion. One way to identify quality of a potion could be its clarity, for example extremely clear could be a perfect potion while an opaque one would be the low quality one.

Additionally we see that in cannon there isn't really a hard limit on magic and even then it is very vague. A system with a hard limit could be the skyrim or the DnD system. So putting a fixed time limit of a potion of low quality and a high quality potion seems to be in contradiction with the rest of the system.

** I prefer the original canon, with the possibility of a potions master inventing an alternate recipe (presumably with at least one rare/hard to find ingredient) for longer results.

** i feel like the new canon makes more sense. like if a second year is making the potion it shouldnt have the same potency (?) as like if snape made it. i feel like it would also depend on the type of ingredients too tho, like if they were fresh (or maybe like 'aged' or smth idunno) i tend to disregard a lot of canon things like the way in which spells/potions work when i write fics tho so

** My philosophy: In cases where extended material (Pottermore/Wizarding World, the movies including Fantastic Beasts, interviews or Cursed Child) contradicts the books, the books win for being canon. Thus, Polyjuice lasting exactly an hour is canon.

In my head, it's not really possible to get any shorter than an hour - you'd just blow up your cauldron, poison yourself, and/or render the potion useless by making mistakes during the brewing. Similarly, any variations that'd last longer would be the result of extensive modification of the recipe, not "just add a bit more boomslang skin and stir more vigorously" - to the point where a hypothetical longer-lasting version would technically be its own potion.

In Half-Blood Prince, we never see the effect of the Draught of Living Death that Harry (or the rest of the class) brewed, but my headcanon is that Harry's potion would have been the only one that actually worked, not simply the longest-lasting one.

Outside of the "is it canon" debate, it feels more magic-y to me to have it be kind of unstable - it's not like cooking, where you can mess with a recipe a /lot/ while still being able to call it the same dish.

*** Canon is very frustrating when it comes to nailing down the actual rules of magic, potions is a great example of this. We have very little evidence as to what the difference between an A, EE, or O potion would be in terms of effects. We only ever really get extremes - either the potion is perfect (see Slughorn gushing over Harry) or it goes horribly wrong (explosions, turning into a cement-like mixture, having the opposite effect of the original potion are some that I can think of off the top of my head). We are never told what the middle ground potions would do.

** JKR is the worst. I don't pay attention to anything she's said or written since Book 7 was released.

** I'm disappointed a bit every time something gets changed or "revealed". It just seems like a lack of planning, trying to retroactively fix plotholes, or not being able to come up with new material. New canon shouldn't have that much effect on fics because most fics are already outside of canon and fanfic authors could come up the concept themselves (and probably already have).

** I personally see the one hour marker as a benchmark value. I can easily see the test for potions mastery including a random selection of recipes pulled from a list, all of which must meet some minimum efficacy or duration.

Having a strict one-hour benchmark falls into the exact same issue that people always argue about clock spells: how does magic know what an hour is? (Granted, clock spells are easily adjustable as scrying magic focused on locations of the Sun and the Earth.) The potion, however, likely doesn't have a clock built into it

Besides, the one-hour benchmark is what Hermione claims is the limit. Even a very precocious 12-13 year old might misinterpret a textbook intended for much more experienced people.
