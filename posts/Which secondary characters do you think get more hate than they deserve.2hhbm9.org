Obviously a lot of people have strong opinions on characters like Dumbledore/Snape/Ron but I'm actually asking about more minor characters.

Personally, I always thought that Lavender/Parvati get turned into bitchy mean girls, which isn't really a fair characterization. Being girly isn't a character flaw, and they were both members of the D.A.


** This isn't so much a character receiving hate that they don't deserve, but I feel most authors make Peter Pettigrew out to be unintelligent and magically weak.

*The man was able to become an animagus at the age of 15.

*He managed to kill 12 muggles and create a large crater with a single blasting curse when escaping from Sirius after he betrayed the Potters.

*He helped create the Marauder's Map.

*In GoF he was able to cast the Killing Curse and non-verbally conjure ropes, levitate objects, and light a fire using a wand that he had not won the allegiance of.

*He was also intelligent enough to deduce where his master's wraith was hiding and brew the potion for him to regain a body. I would also view spending 12 years as a rat as unhinging as Sirius spending 12 years in Azkaban, and yet he was still able to do this.

*** I think this is more the fault of the actual canon then anything else. When you put it like that, Pettigrew is pretty damn formidable, worthy of being a major antagonist. Yet, as soon as book 3 ends, he is only called "Wormtail," and basically only shown snivelling and being bullied.

It's canon (Pottermore) that it depends on the wand, some wands can be used easily by someone other than its owner, some are near impossible. It depends on the core and wand wood if I remember correctly.

But yeah, Pettigrew is definitely not dumb, just cowardly.

**** I don't envy Fleur. She is the kind of girl who has been getting cat-called since she was 12. She is the kind of girl who other girls instinctively dislike and distrust. She is the kind of girl who will always be thought of as "beautiful" first and smart/kind/friendly/loving/brave second.

Fleur is beautiful, and everything she does is filtered through that lens. In GOF, she's not shy/surprised/angry/sad/homesick/nervous/insecure, she's just a snob. If you look a bit closer at her behavior in GOF, you start to feel a bit bad for her.

In HBP, JKR basically pits Fleur against the three biggest female characters in the books: Hermione, Ginny and Mrs. Weasley. We like them, and they dislike Fleur, ergo, we dislike Fleur.

We give all three of them a lot of leeway for insulting Fleur. Calling her phlegm, being rude to her, and even not making her a Christmas jumper.

After Bill gets attacked, it's obvious to the characters that they've misjudged Fleur. Hermione/Ginny/Mrs. Weasley have a deeper understanding of her motivations and a lot more sympathy for her character. But it's harder to grasp that shift as a reader, and even harder to recognize that the other three were /wrong/ to act as they did.

***** People don't get Ron because they're thinking of the trio in terms of how they're directly contributing to the "mission." Harry is amazing at defense and getting out of tight spots, and Hermione is the genius. You don't see Ron's value unless you look at the trio as a group of people instead of a fighting unit.

Harry needs Ron to keep his spirits up and pull him out of his own head. At the same time, Ron is attentive enough to notice when something is bothering Harry and can help him address it without judgement. Like Harry, Hermione also needs Ron to keep her positive, but she also needs Ron to basically pull her back into reality when she's going into the deep end. Ron takes care of Hermione and Harry in a way that's not really apparent until he's gone.

**** Ron's role isn't as obvious, and I don't think he contributed to the actual fight against Voldemort as much as the other two. However, when you look at the trio as a group of people instead of a fighting unit, you see his value a bit more clearly. All you have to do is look at what happens when he's not around and it's just Harry and Hermione. They're both miserable. Both Harry and Hermione are fairly serious people, and they need Ron to remind them to have fun. However, Ron is also much better at offering emotional support to Harry when he needs it. He also takes a lot more interest in Hermione's life and almost takes care of her at times.

** Much of the hate comes from the realization that HP canon views characters through Harry's eyes and sensibilities. This gives some characters a skewed treatment. For instance:

/Percy Weasley/ - He grew up poor in a largely disrespected family, a middle child in his elder brothers' shadows, and became proud of his academic accomplishments and later his fast-track career at the Ministry. To someone like Harry, who desired the love of a family above all, Percy's actions were a betrayal. His comedic role in the films "I'm Head Boy!" didn't help either.

/Cho/ - Portrayed as a needy, clingy, selfish, high-maintenance romantic interest, she doesn't get a fair shake. Harry hadn't a clue how to maintain a relationship when he was with her and he ditches her partway through their one date to meet up with his best friend (who also happens to be female). So they had one bad date, he was a cad and didn't invest the effort in making her feel valued on said date, and for that she's made out to be some kind of mean-girl harpy.

/Harry's Slytherin classmates in general/ (excepting Draco, who was a twat) - Cliques form in school. That someone is in a rival group doesn't necessarily make them evil. Sure, a few of them may have done some morally questionable things (following Umbridge's orders, e.g.), but then so did the Gryffindors along the way. Kids make mistakes.

*** I'm not going to say that they don't deserve to be hated, but yeah I think that Harry's abuse is sometimes exaggerated for dramatic effect. That doesn't mean it wasn't abuse, but I think that the Dursleys were less physically abusive and more emotionally neglectful. In my opinion, Vernon/Petunia basically wanted to deal with Harry as little as possible. And constantly physically abusing him would have taken far too much time from their precious son.

They did (mostly and with a great deal of reluctance) provide for Harry's physical needs. Not because they're wonderful people, but because they're not stupid and they know that they can't just lock him in the cupboard 24/7/365. People will talk if Harry never has anything for school lunch or if the Dursleys don't shell out for the glasses that he so obviously needs.

The funny thing is, I know a family like the Dursleys. The mother was very concerned with keeping up appearances, and had no idea that literally everyone and their mother knew exactly what was happening.

It's easier-you don't really have to explain physical abuse as it's pretty obvious. Emotional abuse/neglect is more elusive. If they tried to write about emotional abuse or neglect it would take longer to "build the case."

In it Harry describes them as "loveless authoritarians" and says that Dudley got it just as bad as he did at home, and likely it was worse for Dudley as Harry went to Hogwarts before Dudley went to his school. In fact in the world of the story Hermione is a best selling author in the muggle world with her (exagerated)retelling of their adventures that are basically the books we all read and he tells her that the Dursely's were not even half as bad as she made them out to be.

*** Yeah, I think what a LOT of fanfiction writers just don't understand is how JK Rowling sets up her world.

It's meant to be something of a melding between a fairy tale and the real world. And I don't just mean fairy tale /elements/, I mean how one is read and told. They deal in the fantastical, in exaggerations. It is meant to sound whimsical but not necessarily to make logical sense upon close, literal inspection. Perhaps the most visible form of this is how much of the magic is completely unexplained and that the wizards just take such things for granted. Although the muggle world is colored with this to a certain extent, it's quite clear that Harry's entry into the wizarding world plays out like someone managed to enter a fairy tale and must accept all of the strange, illogical things that happen in them.

You simply aren't /meant/ to compare the cupboard under the stairs with the real life implications of something like that. The story just doesn't work if you start doing things like that. It's freaking ridiculous how many people I see thinking JKR's fell off the deep end with these things and trying to "fix" her story.

******** Both of my parents got divorced at least three times. I'm fucked and I know it, as far as that goes.

But I'm inclined to think that James and Lily would not have lasted if they had lived.

******* We don't know that the relationships work out! There's still post-Epilogue and plenty of time to fall out of love.

What relationships do you think would fail or struggle? (I see the main relationships of Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny as being stable and likely to last)

******** I think Harry/Ginny are a good combination, but not Ron/Hermione.

I think plenty of good relationships can be broken up by unavoidable outside circumstances. Parents who don't like their child-in-law and pressure their child to divorce. The death of a couples child, or a birth of a child with a disability. Illness, mental or physical. Infertility. Stressful/time consuming careers.

There are so many couples that were great together and would have been great together if only X had never happened. People who think their relationship can survive anything are either extraordinarily lucky with their ability to weather the storm, or they've never had to deal with something that would shake a relationship.

Sometimes life just sucks, even if neither party has done wrong.

And even beyond all of that, sometimes people just change. If you marry at 25 could potentially have a 60 year long marriage. Are you sure your personality won't change in 10 years? 20? 40?

So it's hard to say who would last and who wouldn't. I think Ron/Hermione would be easily wrecked by something shitty happening in life. Ron is so stubborn and tends not to think before he speaks. Hermione has poor self-confidence. It's easy to see how that can go wrong. But if they changed, they could have become a very strong couple. Or if they were lucky and nothing happened I'm sure they were perfectly happy the whole way in spite of the potential for unhappiness.

Both Ginny and Harry are people I think are more likely to try and see something through to the end. They would fight to repair their marriage if something happened.

(It's late, please excuse the terrible writing on my part!)

******** Also I don't think the Weasley's don't have money, I just think they spend as much as they make. Prime example; they win a few thousand Galleons in a prize draw and go on holiday, then buy their kids second hand books and clothes.

*** I feel like Ginny is treated unfairly by a lot of writers who pair Harry with another female character, especially in stories written after the release of HBP/DH. They're blaming the character for JKR not really developing the romance in the books (the books aren't meant to be romance anyway).

**** IMO Cormac is just a prat being a prat. I've seen plenty of fanfics in which they write about him as a death eather, blood purist, etc. It's the same as Zacharias Smith.There are some characters that are not "agreable", but that doesn't mean that they are evil. Is just as ridiculous as Ron being a DE.

** In slash, most of the girls catch a lot of shit. But then, so do some of the Gryffindor dudes like Dean and Seamus. I see a lot of hate for Zacharias Smith for some reason but I can't recall just what he did in canon to garner that kind of hate. In gen, a lot of it is directed at Ginny or Pansy.
