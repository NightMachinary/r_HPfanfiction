I'm not sure if this question has ever been asked to JKRowling, if it has, I'm sure she'd be able to find a reason why they didn't decide to do this. But, I thought for an AU story it'd be a cool idea.

You'd still have people like Dumbledore believe that Sirius was Secret Keeper, Sirius would know that he wasn't really the Secret Keeper, but wouldn't know who the real Secret Keeper was. That way it'd keep the Potter's and Longbottom's safe.

That way, while they were in hiding, the Longbottoms and Potter's would stay safe, since Voldemort and the Death Eaters wouldn't know where they were staying, since they were each others Secret Keepers.

Are there any stories like this? I'm actually surprised if there isn't. I mean, there are stories where Sirius actually is the Potters Secret Keeper, instead of Wormtail, but I just thought it'd be interesting if the Potters and Longbottoms were each others Secret Keepers.

If anyone would like to write this, please let me know. I'd love to write it, but don't think I'd do it justice.


** Is it ever said the long bottoms were under the fidelus?

*** I don't believe it has, though it'd be rather odd if they weren't, especially if they were one of the people prophised, you'd think Dumbledore would take precaution with both families... but since the Longbottoms were driven to insanity, perhaps not? Though that was after the Potters' were killed (from my recollection, though I could be wrong on this).

** I always thought you could have the main house under one secret keeper and have like a garden shed on the back lawn under another charm with a different secret keeper. That way if you are betrayed you have a safe house right there.

** I'd certainly argue that being a secret-keeper permanently in residence of a site protected by the Fidelius would destabilize it and make it fail. Doesn't even need to be the same site the secret-keeper is holding the secret for.

*** Except for that in book seven shell cottage (bill and fluers house) was under a fidelius with Bill as the secret keeper. Which blows the whole use a friend as a secret keeper thing out of the water. There's no point except for the plot needed it to happen.

**** Yeah, typical JK Rowling is to shoot her plot in the head in order to force the story onto her rails.

**** For all we know dumbledore could have spent sometime since the first war creating a modified version of it so the person under the fidelius could be the secret keeper

*** That's definitely a good argument to make about it, but for the sake of a fanfic, I just thought it'd make for a interesting idea/story.
