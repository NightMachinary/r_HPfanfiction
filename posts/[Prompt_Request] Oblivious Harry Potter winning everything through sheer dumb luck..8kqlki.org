In which Harry is the most innocent, unobservant (is that a word), borderline moronic person in the world, but survives everything that goes wrong unscathed through almost divine intervention.

No hard criteria, but if I were to list what would make it perfect:

- Crack is acceptable, but maybe at least try to make it make logical sense instead of "wizard god fixes everything for lols"
- Harry isn't actually stupid, just seemingly oblivious to everything that goes wrong around him. As a result of growing up with the Dursely's hating him, he subconsciously learned that ignoring problems was easier than facing them, which developed into an unconscious obviousness (I use that word too much, I know)
- For the love of all that is holy (the only one that actually matters to me), PLEASE be well written. Small occasional grammatical errors are alright; I know y'all are doing this in your spare time with MAYBE one person to edit if you're lucky, but there's more to good writing than that.

Again, however, none of these are demands - I recognize that all of fanfiction is a gift freely given and for that I am forever grateful. I'll literally take whatever you guys offer - and thanks in advance :)

I think they were right. If the story is in any way serious you'll have a protagonist without any agency at all. I can imagine a crack!fic like this, but it would probably require breaking the 4th wall a lot to make it very clear that everyone is in on the joke.

**** Or you do play it serious, explore the consequences of that kind of power without any form of control. Is it infinite or finite? Can our main character afford to take the risks necessary to determine the answer to that question? What happens when someone tries to replicate their power, or steal it, or manipulate him into using it to their benefit? Is there some substance, like malaclaw venom, that serves as a kryptonite in our story? Is it constrained by physical possibility (meaning does our main characters speed, skill, and general ability increase the amount that luck can do)?

In order to have a worthwhile story, there either needs to be a force of opposition so strong that luck isn't enough, or the conflict needs to be internal (what do I do with it). But that leaves a lot of room to tell interesting stories. I've seriously considered writing something similar with the character of Alastor Moody, and given it some thought, hope this helps in some way.

***** That's all well and good, but it's still going to be shit storytelling if the protagonist is just "whoops"-ing through all the problems he encounters. It's the main reason why the final sequence with Anakin in Episode 1 sucked such arse. And that was just one scene. I can't fathom trying to do a whole story on that. There can never be any kind of serious dramatic tension if the protagonist prevails just on sheer dumb luck. It can only be comedic and even then it will be difficult. It's the definition of a farce.

In the story you just described someone else needs to be the main character.

****** Looking around from the little prince to don quixote to the mahabharata and many renowned and loved novels in between I see that removing agency, causing obliviousness, and having others solve the problems of the main character for the main character doesn't in and of itself make a work of less quality, though it may make the creation more difficult.

******* When it comes to writing there's always exceptions to the rules. Sure, go ahead and employ non-traditional storytelling, reach for the stars and maybe earn that Pulitzer by having a main character without agency. More likely though the story will be bad.

Personally I just roll my eyes if a fanfiction author thinks this is the time and place to try turning writing conventions on its head and employing all kinds of gimmicks (2nd person, weird tense, "unreliable narrator" but badly done, constantly shifting POVs because GRRM is cool). They usually think they are way cleverer than they are.

******** I mean, 80% of every work of art is shit and 80% more of every work of art that isn't formulaic same old same old is shit, on that I'm sure we agree. However, without trying how will anything good ever come to be. Like, I highly doubt that any fanficiton is going to be a nobel prize winning work of art that revolutionizes literature but that's not what fanfiction is about. Fanfiction is about reveling in literature and your liked fandoms. It's not about writing the odyssey but writing something new whilst reveling in the odyssey and it isn't about revolutionizing literature but reveling in it.

I like writing haikus about my favorite fandoms. I do this not to revolutionize the field of poetry or even to present to the world as a masterpiece or anything. I do so purely to revel and exult in art that I love, Sci fi and fantasy adventures and haiku. By your logic I should cease writing haikus about things like fallout such as:

hidden in death's claw

a vibrant malachite sun

the sight of safety

Simply because haiku is a complicated and difficult form of poetry to do correctly and almost all haikus are shit. when the whole point is that I'm exulting in art as opposed to achieving greatness.

Besides, who knows, maybe nonehistory can be the exception to the rule and can do it right. Like some of the stories linked and mentioned in this very thread.

Fanfiction is a form of exultation.

** I had a joke theory about canon that works a bit like that. The power the Dark Lord knows not is actually a passive AOE spell that make Harry's ennemies stupid. Harry's obviously not aware of that, but it would explain nicely the mistakes they keep doing around him. For instance, the diary summoning the basilisk in the chamber of secrets, thus providing Harry with one of the only weapons hich could kill it. Or Quirrelmort forgetting he's a wizard in front of the mirror.\\
Would explain Malfoy, too, and the ministry's general incompetence.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
