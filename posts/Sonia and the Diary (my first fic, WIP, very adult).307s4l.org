** This is a story I'm working on where the premise is roughly that Tom Riddle's diary is much more erotic than it was in canon, and that Tom was on the verge of discovering some sexual means of creating a horcrux-like object. He wants Sonia (an OC; she was supposed to be Hermione, but unfortunately she was 12 in canon when the diary was in play so gross) to help him complete this research.

It's very WIP; at this point Sonia has not even realized that the diary is sentient, and it's most pornographic. But there is a plot that will emerge as I continue writing. Right now I have almost no experience writing sex scenes so I'm using the site that I'm on as an excuse to practice.

*** If you want to avoid the squick and still use Hermione, just change the cannon. Perhaps the diary was unknown and after the Battle of Hogwarts, Lucius slipped it to Hermione. I personally would rather it not be an oc.

As far as learning how to write quality smut, have you looked at other examples? As far as I know, sexstories.com (formerly stories.xnxx.com) is one of if not the largest dedicated repository (I say dedicated only because of tumblr) of written smut. Though they went through a purge recently to delete the more squick inducing underage stuff, they missed way too many for it the decision to be called effective, so take caution if that stuff offends you greatly.
