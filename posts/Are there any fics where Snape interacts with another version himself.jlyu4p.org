Like through time travel or parallel universes?

I was reading the fic where Harry and Hermione accidentally travel to another universe where Sirius was sorted into Slytherin and Neville was the BWL, and I couldn't help wondering how canon Snape would act around that Snape or any other Snape for that matter.

** bear in mind I've only read part of this, and it was awhile ago, but I'm pretty sure young emo Severus and Older bitter Severus interact in this one. I enjoyed the bit I've read

  Severus remembered dying---that last hopeless look into Lily green eyes. Now he's back in the past, inexplicably in the infant body of Harry Potter. Oh, and there's something wrong with Dudley. Weirdness ensues. A different time travel fix-it. Likely the oddest Severitus you'll ever read. Inspired by Path of Decision---I See the Moon---Athey's Rebirth. Betad by Eider Down. Complete.

The Gates of Azkaban is really good. Parallel Universe and Time Travel fic. Canon Snape, Hermione, Harry and Ginny travel to another universe and meet 19 years old Snape, who chose not to join Death Eaters. WIP
