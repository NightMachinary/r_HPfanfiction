I'm looking for a fic where Harry is a twin, but not a â€˜WBWL-story' where Harry is a forgotten and ignored by his peers in favor for his brother, until it all comes out that it really was him all along. I don't mind if one of the twins is the chosen one named in the prophecy, and thus known as the BWL, or if both are known as the Twins who lived, as long as it doesn't make a negative impact on their relationship. It doesn't matter if they're identical or not, but if they are identical I would love it if they'd several times tried to pass off as the other one.


** Is it okay if the twin is a girl? I read a lovely series from the sister's POV and they are close.

** Technically, linkffn(Potters Against the World) qualifies. Harry and Rose are twins and very close as they had only each other to rely on throughout the Dursley years as well as in Hogwarts. Twincest warning though.

  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).

** Linkffn(Yes, I am Harry's Brother)

Not quite twin, but half-brother. Or at least that's what Harry assumes.

** Linkffn(12597395)

This one is slash Harry\Voldemort.

Might not be your cup of tea but in this fic Harry's main goal and purpose for still continuing on is to protect his brother who is the real boy who lived in this universe.

They have a really good relationship throughout the fic too.

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.
