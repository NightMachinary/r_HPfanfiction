I don't think this is the main storyline as I normally don't read Ron-centric ff. However, it was one I enjoyed very much.

From what I remember, Ron went into healer training. He was separated from the other two, it was an isolated kinda training. So he had limited access to the other 2/3 of the trio. Some of the senior healers were too hard core and Ron was having a hard time keeping up. He couldn't figure out the potions work especially. Someone (Hermione? Harry?) convinced Snape to assist Ron and he made a kind of Dummies Guide to... that helped him a ton. They had to sneak it to him (iirc) since he wasn't supposed to really have much contact with the outside world. Eventually they decided, much to Snape's chagrin, that this guide just couldn't be kept to themselves! It would help many junior healers, so they made it into a book set to publish.

Does this ring a bell for anyone? I tried to do a search for healer in my favorite stories in ff.net, but I only found one... it wasn't it. That's what makes me think it might be a side story (a big one, but still, not the main).

Any help would be appreciated! It's been bugging me for awhile. I'm looking forward to rereading it. :D

Thanks in advance!
