What's your favorite slash pairing?

For me. 1. Harry/Cedric This one came about because of that one scene in GOF. Where Harry is crying his eyes out over Cedric's corpse. Seemed like a lover crying over a deceased partner.

1. Harry/Draco. Enemies to lover trope. Also because of the fixation Draco and Harry had a eachother.

2. Harry/Tom Not Voldemort with a snake face, no. But the Tom Riddle we saw come out of the diary. Idk why but I started liking this pairing.


** Harry/Ron

If Ron was a girl in canon,Harry would be all over that

**** I think they are quite versatile. You can right Colin becoming disillusioned with Harry and that pushes him towards Draco so they re United in their bitterness for Harry

​

or you can have Colin be more mature

​

the best time to get them together is usually sixth year

​

i think Harry and Colin and work too but I think often falls into a pattern where Colin is treated more like a pet for Harry

  Also because of the *fixation* Draco and Harry had a eachother.
#+end_quote

I see people use this argument a lot to explain Drarry, but while I agree that Draco was almost obsessed with Harry (always trying to bait him), was the fixation truly mutual? Because outside of HBP where Harry "/is stalking Draco because he is (rightfully so) convinced that he is up to no good and the only reason why nobody believe him is because Rowling made everyone else hold the idiot ball for plot reason/", did Harry ever initiate any contact with Draco?
