(I'm sorry, don't report me)

ANY FIC that has Dumbledore, Ron and Molly Bashing is great (with all three).

A virtual cookie for any fic that has Hermione, Ginny and/or Snape Bashing.

Again, please don't report me.

EDIT: No HINNY.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

** Try Sunset over Britain And Sunrise over Britain

**** Those are two storys, but to understand Sunrise you have to read Sunset.

It starts in the summer after the incident in the MoM in OotP. Harry is ill and has some overdue magical sickness what he should have been at 11 years old, but due to the mistreatment of the Dursleys it delayed. After that sickness he is the most powerful wizard in the world. But the prophecy is still there. And more will come. Voldemort takes over Britain and Harry and his friends have to flee from Britain and seek shelter in Ireland. Meanwhile Voldemort gets as powerful as Harry through dark rituals. DD and Snape will be bashed mercilessly, including Ron and Molly. Other part of the Weasleys have to take a more difficult route.

Most iconic pairings: H/Hr, DM/LG, RL/NT, GW/NL First chapters are thought, but the writing will get better and better. Including International Affairs, Muggle politics, Military, ICW, Rituals, Ghosts, a new school, House Elves and many many more. You won't regret the read.

** Hermione-critical/bashing fics, because I'm a sock account who's only purpose is to take shots at the beloved princess of the fandom. ðŸ™„

Here's the recs.

(Disclaimer: Some are Ron-centric and some might not be favourable to Harry either.)

-I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/]]) Hermione's one-sided job interview. A bit unrealistic but then again so are most bash fics. ðŸ¤·

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]) has 58-year-old Harry and Ron go back to their 4th year. Hilarity ensues. Does contain some Ginny-bashing. (WARNING: ENDGAME HINNY!)

This community on FFN has some good fics as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/No-Hermione-Allowed/124957/]]

-This fic has a Hermione with a Dumbledore-is-always-right attitude that forces Harry and even Ron to keep her out of the loop for quite a long time. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix]])

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11378607/1/]]) Has McGonagall talk to Hermione about her long essays and tells her to cut them down. Hermione ignores her and continues to do whatever she wants.

-linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/]]) Hermione isn't outright bashed nor is it a big part of the story. It's more about how she would fail to cope in the real world.

-linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569]]) Hermione faces consequences for the bird attack in 6th year. Borders on bashing at times. Alternating POVs.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry at times).

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10434054/1/Not-the-Smartest-Witch]]) Hermione is not as smart as she portrays herself to be. One-shot.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]) SELF-PROMO! where Ron choses not to date Hermione. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13204936/1/Hermione-Granger-and-The-Obliviated-Parents]]) Hermione un-Obliviates her parents. They only /pretend/ to take it well.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon]]) It doesn't focus on bashing, but it portrays Hermione as not perfect and definitely outlines her flaws.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12613015/1/]]) is another one. Fem!Harry, Ron's a good friend, Hermione goes insane.

  Cho cried and she survived Pansy Parkinson's cruel jabs about a dead boy. She wept and she passed all her classes, kept up with Quidditch, watched fairweather friends scatter in the cold wind. She got very good at wordlessly summoning tissues and she joined the DA against her parents' wishes.They had told her to behave, begged her, ordered her, as the threatening darknesses of the world clung close even inside Hogwarts, and Cho walked out to the little pub in Hogsmeade and wrote her name down on Hermione's list.I hope someone in the DA told Cho that she ought to have been in Gryffindor. I hope she laughed at them, hard. Integrity. Truth. Honor. Dedication. These were the tenets of her House, of the blue and the bronze, the eagle called raven (called nerd, called stuck-up, called so many things that were not their names). Bravery was only one way to be a hero.
