I read this and completely forgot the title, and I can't recall if it was on AO3 or ff.net, and I apparently didn't add it to favourites!

Harry somehow walks into a Potions shop, or an Apothecary, and ends up working there, going by Evan I think?, at age 7 or 8 or such.

The owner has a thing for indian curry and later on flirts with Snape when he shows up. Owner also knows he's Harry Potter but doesn't let him know, just gives him a scarf to cover his head.

Snape knows about the shop but doesn't connect Evan with Harry until later I believe, and I /think/ adopts him during first year?

Also they arrange for mandrakes to heal the petrifications in second year which seems to baffle Dumbledore?

My google-fu has failed me and I seriously can't find the story but I really liked it!
