The prompt bit: Harry or Hermione or someone goes back to pre-Hogwarts times, and they decide to become pioneers of magical technology based on their knowledge of the future and using the magic of, well, magic. Because of this the present day wizarding world looks very different. Elevators in Hogwarts, information cubes (iCube), hover boards/vehicles, there's been a colony on mars for about a hundred years; basically whatever you think you'd see in an advanced/sci-fi society.

The discussion/question: Does anyone know why there are very few stories that use the magic system of Harry Potter to create a world /more/ advanced than the muggle one, rather than less advanced? Tbh, the idea that wizards have all this amazing power and have never tried to make their living standards better seems ridiculous. Wizards have probably had easy access to clean water since ancient Roman times, and they only need that to drink, not to wash themselves. Plants can be grown extremely quickly, and thanks to space altering charms we know you can fit a large amount of animals in only the space of a suitcase. What are everyone else's thoughts about this?


** I could imagine someone in a highly advanced magic society advertise to blood purists "you don't like living in a world where magic has to hide? Come to Paradise, the latest terraformed planet in the Draco constellation! Guaranteed 138 lightyears away from the nearest muggle!"

*** Haha, this would be great! “Want to live in a pureblood society with no chance of breeding with muggles? The Blacks have just bought a planet in the Andromeda galaxy. You won't even be in the same galaxy as those pesky muggles!”

**** Now imagine if Sirius became a famous actor in wizard movies instead of rotting in Azkaban.

"So, you wanted to visit your godfather Sirius, the star, and those idiots at the portal network agency sent you to Sirius, the star 8 lightyears away?"

** From the wizards POV, they don't need to advance.

*** But why not? There's no reason for people to not want to advance. We didn't stop making telephones after the creation of the brick on a wire, Or stop making planes after the wood and cloth biplane.

**** Because magic fixes nearly everything (they advanced faster in the beginning before plateauing) and whatever it doesn't fix, they can just steal from the non-magicals. It's the way their society developed.

**** Pretty much every big technology has been fought against for one reason or another. People in the US were against Tractors when they were first introduced, the Middle East against coffee, there are people trying to stop genetic farming, people in the US who're still trying to pull you back to coal and fighting against renewable energies. No matter how dumb you think a reason is, there will be someone somewhere who thinks it.

*** We know that magic has advanced/evolved over the centuries, so this is a bad take IMO. At least, they're /willing/ to change things up and incorporate improvements.

However, you are right that societies don't always see technological advancement in the way we do today, and that makes this sort of plot idea always a bit crack-fiction like.
