  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection by DrizzleWizzle) and its sequels, currently up to fifth year.\\
It sticks very close to canon for the meta plot, but Harry /is/ a Slytherin and is friendly with Draco, but not for no reason. Well fleshed out characters throughout.

  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.
