Forget OTT Lordships, Power Increases, Harems that include 100+ women, we all dislike them. What do you feel is something you hate personally? Even if it's a spectacular fic, this small detail will make you nope outta there.

/Example - I'm a Harry/Hermione shipper, the problem is that authors like to have it so Hermione has the answer for literally everything; I get it, she's smart, that's what Hermione is, but c'mooooon, some of these fics should have cannot-think-for-himself!Harry in the summary..../ *Screams*

Ya know, stuff like that.... /cough/.


** I get really tired of Authors who have a common expression of exasperation. Like every chapter each character /pinches the bridge of their nose/ or /rubs their temples/. I just finished a fix where literally three times a chapter at least some one was pinching their nose.

Common expressions that pop up like /what...just what.../. --I mean what does that even mean?

And last...over-expressive emotions. Every character is falling to their knees in desperation or driven to tears because a single twig in their broom is out of alignment. I consider myself a sensitive/empathetic male and even I don't cry nearly as much as some of these dramas

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

Like why wouldn't the woman who's just lost what's left of the family she loves want to keep and raise her grandson? It's not as if she was ancient or incompetent as a caregiver either. Bellatrix was her older sister and she wasn't even fifty. Also, Andromeda raised a daughter who showed many admirable traits and died bravely to give her son a better world to live in.

Harry knows exactly what it's like to grow up an orphan and I'm sure he'd want to be there for Teddy where and when possible.

But if Harry's the only one raising him, or he's acting as the father and Andromeda only visits Teddy on the weekends or something like a regular grandparent, I end up clicking out of a story. I just can't believe that Andromeda would let an all but stranger (to her) raise her grandkid for her.

** "The Golden Trio"

When I first started reading fanfiction, this was a delightful little name to give Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Now though, it tilts me when I read it. Not sure what changed for me to dislike it so. Strong enough to make me stop and reconsider reading a story.

Also, spelling artifact as artefact. I know both are correct spellings, but for some reason it really bothers me.

Finally, the whole "I can't put you in danger by loving you" and the inevitable follow up "don't you see, I'm already in danger". Happens in so many stories.

Actually I have a lot now that I think about it.

Harry learning some crazy powerful magic from bonding with a Phoenix so well. Of course the phoenix was Hedwig all along, and is some rare never before seen phoenix colour. Don't forget the telepathic conversation they can have that was deemed impossible before Harry came along. Also wouldn't be right without learning some new crazy form of apparition that is undetectable and can go through any ward imaginable.

Hmm, oh. The will readings where Sirius slams everyone in Harry's life and some big revelation comes up out of it. The Weasley family and Dumbledore are probably stealing from him as well. Can't forget earning the love of the entire goblin nation by remembering their names and calling them by some strange made up title or phrase. "May your enemies die screaming lord Griphhook" or something similar.

Harry and Hermione having a relationship where they become a sort of amorphous blob and have no real character progression or conflict.

"So mote it be" Triggers the hell out of me

There are probably more but I have ramble on long enough. These things don't necessarily make an awesome story bad, but they do get my goat.

** Authors making light of Unbreakable Vows by a) strewing them around like cheap candy and b) having children swear them willy-nilly.

Someone swearing an Unbreakable Vows ties their life to keeping that promise. If they break it, they DIE. Often, it seems fanfic authors don't take the Vow seriously.

And also, related to my first pet peeve: Overuse of vows in general. Some authors (HP and the Prince of Slytherin comes to mind) invent their own vows, that carry less serious consequences than an Unbreakable Vow, and then use them for every little thing that comes up. It a) is a cheap cop-out to avoid real character interaction and development, b) takes suspense out of the story and c) isn't canon (Hermione researched ways to keep the DA secret, but only came up with a jinxed parchment that punished the traitor once it was too late, she never mentioned any vows that could help them keep it a secret... and Hermione is our authority on what is and isn't possible in that regard...) But even if we disregard c) and simply see it as a way to expand on the canon universe, a) and b) still make me hate the whole concept.

** Snape and Draco glorification has gotten on my nerves lately. Snape in particular as in Draco's case I'm of the opinion that he might have turned out alright in the end, but I'm not a fan of when he's made overly sympathetic (or his arrogance is played as a likeable trait).

Fanon or completely anti-canon 'facts' represented as canon is a big turn off for me. Namely, Mione which is grating for several reasons but is exacerbated when Ron or Harry seem to believe they've been saying it for years. I'm also not a fan of a sudden strategy genius Ron, Ron in canon didn't have any particular inclination to strategy beyond chess. I don't mind it in general but it's often poorly done and stated in an offhand manner.

I get slightly frustrated when an author isn't technically bashing a character (certainly not to an extreme extent) but still manages to completely misrepresent them. Such as Ron being unintelligent (and often only surviving thanks to Hermione's help), Ron almost did as well as Harry in canon in his OWLs.

** Story:

- OCs as main characters

- OCs as major love interest to main character

#+begin_quote
  This can be done well, but it's /very/ tricky. If you do anything to make the character seem too perfect, you can fall into the below category. If you make them too flawed, it will look like a heavy-handed way of uniting the main character with his/her /true/ love interest.
#+end_quote

- Anything that could potentially be seen as a self-insert (especially the above cases) -- this reeks of self-pleasuring egoism or a kind of egotistical wish fulfillment. It is highly uncommon for a good fanfiction to feature an original character as a main character. That is not to say that one cannot include original characters, of course, only that they should not feature as prominently as the other main characters. Quite honestly, even the name "self-insertion" seems masturbatory.

#+begin_quote
  “What if the ‘Golden Trio' was a ‘Golden Quartet?'”
#+end_quote

- Ridiculously divergent AUs -- this is perhaps a more personal pet peeve, but when a story goes completely off the rails from canon I tend to very quickly become bored or confused. Generally speaking, I prefer my fanfiction to remain somewhat close to canon as regards background lore. After decades of reading fanfiction, any story that completely changes the background of a story is a very hard sell.

- Unnecessary divergences in the background lore of otherwise mostly-canon stories. These are usually done because the author wants to ignore or avoid some of the fundamentals or the story. It's lazy and very, very obvious.

#+begin_quote
  Ex: “Oh, by the way, kids start Hogwarts at age 16.” “I've moved the story up to start in 2011 instead of 1991.”
#+end_quote

- Bashing of any character -- People are meant to be flawed, not incomprehensibly stupid and evil. It is incredibly lazy to make someone almost completely irredeemable and shows a determined unwillingness to craft complex situations and characters. Real-life “bad guys” are just as complicated and conflicted as the “good guys” -- they just happen to have values that differ from others.

#+begin_quote
  “But the author made the character completely idiotic and/or evil!” is a common response. True or not, how the character acts in your fanfiction now reflects on you, and terrible characters cast very unflattering reflections. If a character seems really dumb or one-dimensional in canon, it falls to YOU as the fanfic writer to make them more fleshed out. When you choose to use an existing universe instead of your own, you inherit all the flaws of that universe as well. And then it becomes your duty to fix (or at least paper over) them.
#+end_quote

- Names not following family naming conventions (like celestial names for Blacks and Malfoys, flower names for female Evanses, etc).

- Mpreg -- I get it, you want your hot gay couple to have kids. There's nothing wrong with that! But men don't get pregnant. It is not physically possible. Yes, it's a world of magic, blah blah blah, but it makes everything completely unrelatable. The idea of male pregnancy in humans is just... too far out there for most male readers to tolerate. Besides, what's so bad about adoption or surrogacy?

- Why didn't they think of this? -- Fanfictions where the protagonist is inventing things left and right are a bad, bad idea (excusing fanfictions where a character reacts differently in one specific occasion as the basis of the story). If your character can come up with something simple (Auto-Correcting Quills! Magical purses that hold everything you could possibly need!) that hasn't yet been invented, there had better be a damn good reason why no one else has tried. And no, “they weren't raised in the Muggle world” is not a good reason -- there are several muggleborns in every generation.

- Magical inheritances -- I get that the world of Harry Potter is very much different than our world, but there is no case in real life where turning a specific age suddenly changes you. Certainly, there are ages when new behaviors become legal (sex, smoking, etc.) and possibly when new responsibilities begin (voting, driving, supporting yourself, etc.), but that is about it. Attempting to have some sort of magical inheritance that suddenly appears when a character turns a certain age is a big blow against the reader's willing suspension of disbelief.

- Anachronisms -- Harry Potter is set in a very specific time.

Plot:

- Greater Good!Dumbledore: it's been done to death and back again. 99.9% of the stories that feature this trope are absolutely terrible, usually because they somehow manage to make Dumbledore (and usually some but not all of the Weasleys) both evil masterminds and completely brainless.

- indy!Harry: this one is pretty well known here, so I'm not going to expand on my hatred for it.

- Harems: I've yet to read a good one, quite honestly. Including a harem just makes the fic seem like a teenaged boy's wet dream.

- Canon rehashing: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon]]

Writing:

- Frequent misspellings of names: most commonly, spelling Hermione as "Hermoine," Dursley as "Dursely," and McGonagall as... well, I've seen it spelled some really heinous ways, but it's not that hard to memorize how to spell a pivotal character's name!

- Capitalizing random words in a sentence -- I've heard it said that older forms of English tended to capitalize nouns, but that is certainly not the case with modern English. Please capitalize properly; you look downright silly if you do not.

- Diction -- Writers will often try to use words that they're not really comfortable with, and this often leads to oddly constructed sentences and even incorrectly chosen words. If you're not comfortable with a word, you should probably avoid it. If you feel your vocabulary is limited, at least attempt to make sure you're using the word properly. (Some writers are not native English speakers, and they are partially excused from this.)

- Pluralization -- Nouns are almost always pluralized by adding -s or -es to the end. Do NOT add -'s to pluralize most nouns. It is incorrect and hideous to boot. This occurs most often when referring to multiple members of the same family.

Summary Sins:

- Typos/spelling errors/grammatical errors -- This is the very first thing a potential reader will see; if you can't make a good first impression, you have no chance of writing well in the story.

- “My first fic!” -- No one cares. In fact, if you feel the need to say this you are likely just making excuses.

- “Not your usual X fic!” -- If you have to say this then yes, it almost certainly is.

- Asking questions -- 99% of the time, the answer is incredibly obvious. Asking questions is a bad idea 99% of the time. Change your question into a statement or remove it entirely.

#+begin_quote
  ex: “Can Harry save his family?” “Will they get together?” “What if yadda yadda?”
#+end_quote

- “Sorry I'm bad at summaries.” -- No one cares. It is entirely likely that you cannot come up with a summary because your story is less than well-written or doesn't follow a coherent plot. A decent summary details a portion of the overarching plot without giving away too many details. If you can't make a summary like that, you're probably having some overarching trouble with your plotline rather than just being bad at summarizing.

    There are quite a few other things that bother me, but these are some of the ones I made a list of previously.

**** Not really. The first refers to changing practically EVERYTHING about canon (Grindlewald won the final battle! Dumbledore is the Dark Lord and Tom Riddle is the good guy! Purebloods are actually right to be bigoted! etc etc) whereas canon rehashing means repeating the same canonical events (as in what's already in the books, as opposed to what happened chronologically before the books), especially if the outcomes are pretty much exactly the same. I don't need the fic to have every single event from canon -- but if they change something, I also don't want it to be in the past and only revealed through exposition. Otherwise it tends to seem a little like they wrote themselves into a corner and then decided to retcon their way back out.

Flanderization of characters To get the protagonist a reason to act in the plot.for example: James potter is IMO a egotistic asshole, yet he would NEVER use dark magic to control and marry Lily against her will and this pushes her towards Severus, nor Dumbledore suddenly decides he wants block Harry's "magic paths" and obvliate him and Hermione because she must dato Ron and harry must be loveless making them become outlaws who learn magic from australian aborigines.

2.

Now, if it's well written a Hapne, or harry/pansy I can read it and enjoy it very much, but it usually isn't the case.

3. Draco sexually harassing people. Yes he's a narcissist cunt, but he wouldn't threat to rape someone, specially if he considers her/him an inferior mudblood/ blood traitor.

4. An author asking his/her readers where to go next, specially if the author makes a poll.

** One thing I absolutely can't stand is when authors have harry have a very close friendship with someone who isn't ron/Hermione, without giving any explanation of how or when they became so close. Read one where Harry considered Tracey Davis to be like a sister/twin (her bday was the day after his in this one) with twinspeak and everything, after having had maybe 10 lines of dialogue total.

Harry referring to other female characters who he did not spend significants amount of time with as a very young child as a sister. Not just saying 'she's like a sister.' That I can deal with. Actually calling them a sister, I can't. It's even worse when he says 'sis.' Enough times of that and I'll close down the fic.

Harry not wanting to date someone (usually Ginny) because they're 'too young.' It's completely possible to say you're dating someone without fucking like rabid bunnies on viagra cut with ecstasy. Just have them like sitting next to each other and holding hands, maybe a few pecks on the cheek, boom, they're dating. Perfectly appropriate for 11-13 y/o. You can even take out the pecks and it still works. (I still think it's a little bit off to have 11-13 y/o be interested in each other in that way, but whatever, it could happen. Just don't show how they're sooooooo into each other, then have Harry say they have to wait because she's too young or some bs like that.)

In smut fics/fics with sex scenes, when they have great in detail accurate descriptions of the scene, then when the characters orgasm, it's described as 'like falling off the edge of a cliff' or even worse, just saying 'and with that, harry finished, [insert lubed-up-dickhole name here] following a minute later. If the scene wasn't accurate/descriptive to start with that's one thing,but when an author has shown they're clearly capable of writing good sex, then just throws it out the window for some reason at the best part, it gets on my fucking nerves.

**** From [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Alpha/Beta/Omega]]

Alpha/Beta/Omega or Alpha/Omega (occasionally Alpha/Beta) is a kink trope wherein some or all people have defined biological roles based on a hierarchical system, with the terms originating from animal behaviour research. There may be werewolf, knotting, or other animalistic elements involved, or the characters may be otherwise purely human.

Alphas are generally dominant and able to impregnate Omegas. Male Alphas usually have a knot when aroused.

Betas are subordinate to Alphas and may or may not be able to impregnate Omegas; in some fanworks Betas aren't present and the trope is known as Alpha/Omega, in others they take the role and functions of Omegas and Omegas aren't present. Betas are often presented as having "normal" human anatomy with none of the special attributes of Alphas or Omegas.

Omegas are generally lowest on the hierarchy (although in some fanworks Omegas are rare and prized). Male Omegas are self-lubricating and have the ability to become pregnant, sometimes referred to as being bred or mated. Lovers may form pair-bonds with a special connection with telepathic or empathetic qualities. Paired Alphas may be jealous and possessive of their mate, while the Omega may become submissive. Omegas and Alphas may go into heat and need to have sex; this may be the only time Omegas are fertile.

From these basic elements a wide variety of fanworks can be constructed. Some A/B/O works are straight-up porn, some explore social justice issues, some turn the trope on its head and makes alphas rather than omegas the disenfranchised group, etc. A/B/O is mainly known as a fic trope, but fanart is possible[1].

Also, with that pairing, I really don't like how much smut is involved with them in many stories I read of the pair. Many authors pose Charlie as some sort of sex master, while Hermione is able to keep up with his "animalistic-like" inhibitions which makes the story completely unnatural.

**** People read and write fanfiction for a number of reasons. Personally I loved the books so much that I want more of the stuff I fell in love with - which is canon. I don't mind if people change things, I rather enjoy what-ifs, that explore what could have happened if you change a thing here and there, as long as the writers stay true to the characters and the rules stated in canon. I'd rather people add to this instead of changing the universe completely, but that's just my personal preference.

Many people seem to like that and think that it's canon but being described as smart and bright doesn't mean she was phenomenal.

Don't be one of those writers.

Fucking dialogue!

I don't even know how to explain the absolute bullshit that people write. I wonder to myself how people see two people speaking when they write some of the most wooden dialogue I've come across. Percy Jackson fanfics have better dialogue than 3/4ths of Harry Potter fanfics.

Everyone speaks like they are NPCs in a game telling the main character plot points and storylines just so the main character can get to the end quicker.

NOBODY TALKS FOR TALKING SAKES.

And it's not even well written dialogue, it's some of the most robotic shit that I've ever read. Character's don't even react how you expect THAT character to react, authors just make side characters agree with the main character or side with the main character, JUST BECAUSE HE/SHE IS THE MAIN FUCKING CHARACTER!

** *Slash*. Quite literally the most overused pairings. I have no problem with homosexuals, but can we please stop attempting to put it in every single fic you do? And shoving it down everyone's throats?

*Romance*. A genre that is continually squeezed lifeless by every single author; there is not a single author that doesn't have a romance fic in their discography, and this is both due to their lack of creativity and their lack of understanding on how real relationships work. A Harry with the world on his shoulders doesn't have time for a girlfriend.

*Overcomplication and Oversimplification of Magic*. Magic is Magic. Can it manipulate scientific principals? You betcha. Can it warp Space/Time/Matter, etc..? You betcha. But the featherlight charm doesn't lighten gravity on anything, it just makes it featherlight. You may ask, how does it achieve it if it doesn't lighten gravity? My answer is magic. This also isn't to mention how oblivious the author sometimes makes the main character and his teachers. For example: "McGonagall tells everyone to practice a spell" but doesn't seem to tell them that the way to do it is by imagining it changing into something else in your mind? What kind of teacher doesn't tell you the exact way you're supposed to cast something? Moreso, how does that even help Harry? I'm pretty sure that it's outlined in canon that you can get everything correct for a spell but still be piss poor at casting it (Exhibit Neville). Then there is the oversimplification of Magic. Such as, a Harry that is trained by Dumbledore/Nicholas Flammel/Merlin himself, and Godric Gryffindor's Pet Pygmy Puff, yet still, relies on Stupefy to stun people. Are there not other stunning spells for more powerful wizards in the Potterverse? What happened to certain Wizards being more immune to stunners?

*Throwing Around Unforgiveables like it's Nothing*. Admittedly, Rowling herself did this a lot towards the latter half of Deathly Hallows, what with McGonagall herself using an Imperio on the Carrows. But that doesn't automatically make it good, nor does it make it okay. All the Unforgiveables are Clunky, Hard to use, and generally worse than anything else you could cast unless your opponent is already kneeling before you or has his/her guard down. So why is this Harry's signature spell almost all the time? Why do stories that bash Canon for doing this with Expelliarmus, do this with Avada Kedavra? Both are just as dumb for a wizard to constantly use, as the Potterverse's magic is nigh-infinite in quantity and versatility.

Edit: These are my personal opinions, downvoting it doesn't actually do anything.

What? There are plenty of authors who do not write romance. They are harder to find, but they certanly exist. Just through looking through some of the fics that I read, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/3306612/the-Imaginizer][author of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux]] doesn't really have any romances. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/7794370/][Author of this Snape Luna friendship story]] doesn't all although they only wrote one fic. I have read plenty of fics without any romance so they exist.

And as much as I am not a fan of romance as a genre, I don't understand how you can say that it doesn't make sense for Harry to have a girlfriend. He is a teenage boy who has been thrust into the role of a hero. Sure, he has a lot to deal with, but I don't think that at all means that he doesn't get interested in girls or getting a girlfriend. In canon, his romances are brief but he still goes out and seeks out relationships even if he does end up putting one aside while on the run from Voldemort.

*** Clunky or not (I disagree that "Avada Kedavra" is "clunky"), the unforgiveables have one distinctive advantage:

They can't be blocked (ok: We don't know of the Cruciatus or the Imperius can be blocked, but the Killing Curse can't be blocked by magic - you have to use solid objects (or a phoenix!) to intercept it!), which makes it ideal to kill low-level flunkies (deatheater recruits and deatheaters like Draco Malfoy!)...against enemies like Voldemort or Bellatrix, Snape, Lucius etc. it might very well not work (they can probably conjure up barriers or summon stuff in the way - and dodge of course!) - that's where more versatile magic comes into play (note: Signature spells are kind of stupid, I agree...why would you use Expelliarmus on Voldemort? Unless you don't know any other spell the very attempt is stupid, Voldemort after all will either sick his DEs on you or do some wandless magic (which is canon, if I remember this right there's even cultures that still teach it to students, sadly: the English-Wiz-World does not!), if he even loses his wand in the first place (!)...Voldemort knows shields, knows dodging and intercepting spells, too after all and in Harry's case: You are making it a joke to identify yourself...even polyjuice or being a metamorphmagus (I like that skill, sadly fanfictions that have it under-utilize it in most cases!) or using glamour charms will not help you if you basically TELL PEOPLE WHO YOU ARE!

** I agree with your peeve 100% - but I am going a step further: I hate Hermione basically being a mix of Harry's conscience and brains (as if he either didn't have any or had defective ones that were reserved for quidditch, taunting Malfoy and goofing with the slacker king: Ron!)...and I always hate the label "smartest witch of her age" (or when Harry says that she is so much smarter than him...come on, you only have to fucking apply yourself man, not only that, we've enough evidence to make a case that Hermione might be a great academic because she puts in the work and studies ahead but is otherwise not really all that smart (note: I am not saying she's dumb, but being a know it all bookworm doesn't mean you are the smartest person since the beginning of time! Hell, her accomplishments pale when compared to the Marauders...animagus transformation, pranking spells and let's not forget the Marauder's Map!)! I mean she had a crush on Lockhart of all people! She did that SPEW-Thing! She's socially totally inept (she can't admit that she's wrong and she's bossy as hell!) and she even didn't believe Harry about Malfoy in book 6, which meant that Draco could repair that fucking vanishing cabinet right under everybodies noses, despite the fact that it took him ages because he wasn't very good at it and Harry tried to make people notice Draco acting strange! IMHO McGonagall and Hermione are partially guilty of killing Dumbledore - sure, Dumbledore wanted to die because that dark curse would have probably ended him anyway, still no reason to ignore threats like that and letting Hogwarts (a castle, which is probably a location you could defend easily!) fall to Voldemort! Not to mention endangering all the students and teachers...sorry, Dumbledore but your mental state is in question, if you want to die go to a dragon preserve or something!)

Another peeve of mine is that some people make teenage pregnancies seem ok in fanfiction when IMHO teenagers shouldn't be having kids (that's why I don't get why the US doesn't have sex-ed in many states and then they are woundering why they have a high teen pregnancy rate compared to say Germany!)...hell, kids shouldn't have kids with adults either (I have no problem with Harry having a relationship with an older woman, but IMHO having kids while he's still at school and in the middle of a freaking war? That's a damned no go!)

Then again: I stop reading a fanfiction as soon as there's any pregnancy at all (I am a childfree guy and I will never have kids of my own (I am probably not going to change my mind, hell I would probably be a bad father so I will not inflict myself upon any child!) and I don't want to read about it either!), just not my cup of tea!

It does annoy me when people make Hermione uber-Mary Sue, but I don't think this is fair. Neither Hermione or /Ron/ (Hermione was actually more inclined to think it was plausible-swayed by undeniable facts-while Ron didn't take it seriously) were all that supportive of Harry's 'Malfoy is a Death Eater' theory. It's certainly not their fault that Dumbledore died or Death Eaters entered the school-both trusted that the appropriate authority figures were containing the issue. Both also decided to protect the school even if they didn't believe Harry. Ironically however Hermione was unintentionally responsible for some of Draco's murder attempts-the poisoned wine was partially inspired by an offhand comment and the coin he used to communicate with Rosemerta was a direct copy of a DA coin.

I'm not so sure it's one thing for Draco to be a bully-it's quite another to be actively planning murder. Hermione I think acted perfectly within character in this context-remembering she had previously made the mistake of jumping on the Harry bandwagon and being wrong-she even considered and recognised that Malfoy might be up to something but still didn't go as far as to believe that he was planning murder and was a threat.

Ron is a little bit different but I think part of it came from misjudging Malfoy's capabilities (in Ron's eyes Death Eaters had to be a lot more competent than Malfoy) rather than who he was as a person-truly doubting that he would be capable of a complex plan of murder under Dumbledore's nose.

I think that both Hermione and Ron ultimately viewed Malfoy as 'pathetic' and not really much of a threat. Lucius Malfoy was sent to Azkaban and perhaps in their opinion that was the end of that-no reason for Voldemort to be involved with the Malfoy family.

At this point in time there's really hundred of suspects other than Draco-the person doesn't have to be in the castle or even necessarily near. I think it's fine dismissing him after the first-and even the second incident-it would have been difficult for Draco to commit both of those crimes.

After the incident in the bathroom they should have been more concerned that Draco was capable of an Unforgivable. But I think Hermione and Ron just didn't like the idea of Draco Malfoy being a Death Eater and responsible for attempted murder. Their later dismissal of Harry is more focused on-'You don't know for sure'-which is fine they are likely just in denial-Draco Malfoy being a Death Eater is a lot closer to home then they would like and both have no respect for his abilities. It didn't help that Harry was very obsessive and they had other things to focus on.

It could very easily have been just any old Death Eater-what was going on at Hogwarts really wasn't that odd at the end of the day, all evidence would point to someone outside of Hogwarts rather than inside-someone in Hogsmeade as it turns out (Rosmerta).

How long would it really work to trap Snatchers? I think they would cotton on pretty quickly-although I suppose it would work at least once or twice.

How much would it help as well? Snatchers were kind of the least effective members of Voldemort's entourage-in fact most of them weren't even directly aligned with Voldemort and looking to make cheap money. If you were approaching this from a tactical perspective you're only killing people for the sake of killing-you're definitely not going to make a big dent in Voldemort's power base by killing the least of the least. Maybe they might remove the Taboo? But everyone by that point was avoiding saying Voldemort's name, it was really only a one time thing that did its job. Also how many people are in the Order and would be able to do this at this point-maybe Kingsley, Lupin, McGonagall.

#+begin_quote

I'm not so sure that's fair-I can certainly see the reasoning. They didn't expect the locket to effect them as it did Ginny when they weren't intentionally pouring emotion into it for starters. Also is it really an example of OOC behaviour? Harry doesn't always make the most sensible decisions and other than the putting it in the beaded bag or moleskin pouch (both of which might have potential limitations-and honestly I could definitely see the Horcrux still affecting them in at least the case of the Moleskin) there's really no other practical way around it.

Dumbledore did the whole 'not placing all his eggs in one basket approach' when it came to information. It wasn't entirely sensible but definitely not OOC-Dumbledore's entire story arc is about secretkeeping.

Dumbledore was also barely at the school for the entire year. His lessons with Harry were probably some of his only free time-he had commitments all over the place. He might be able to finish off Tom Riddle's story in an evening-but he would still have only a few hours to train the trio-and really how effective would that be?

Also we really don't know enough about the magic of the Taboo, we know that Dolohov etc. didn't appear immediately and neither did they apparate directly to the trio, it's not unreasonable to believe that part of the magic of the spell is that it considers things such as appearing in muggle areas (they did turn up in workman clothes) and dangerous areas.

  Dumbledore should have made time. Harry was his trump card, the trio his weapon - anything else was less important. I don't know how anyone can defend a shitty "done so we can have a reveal at the end, and a twist" plot device. In the same vein, they should have had the sword or another weapon able to destroy horcruxes from the start. Dumbledore withholding that information makes no fucking sense other than adding pointless drama by having the characters act stupid.

Dumbledore didn't expect to die when he did (I do believe he underestimated Draco-as everyone seemed to apparently), if he had made it all the way back to his office he would have destroyed the Horcrux and most likely with Harry's help (Harry would then have then taken the sword when he left). The will was just a precaution.

I don't think training Harry and trio would have resulted in too much of a difference (How easily can you teach someone advance magic?)-focusing on the Order and the Horcruxes is therefore fair.

******************** There's no need to make up shitty excuses and try to plug plot holes the size of the Knight Bus. JKR focused on plot, not internal consistency or characterisation. The Duplication Charm was mentioned once, and seen in action as a curse because she wanted the kids to starve and suffer, and the vault to be full of copies.

We know enough about the Snatchers to know that any dead Snatcher was a good thing, and any Snatcher unwilling to risk their life was a good thing. Making up even more out of there Apparition by-rules to cover up stupidity is not a good thing.

Dumbledore knew he had not long to live. Assuming he planned to live just so much longer so he could tell Harry everything he needed to know, but simply ran out of time is... stupid. Dumbledore wouldn't have gambled like that, it was pure shitty plot demands that made it so.

Training Harry wouldn't have led to him being a master dueller - but he'd have been prepared to hunt Horcruxes. Hell, Dumbledore could have simply given Hermione a reading list, and taken care of that in 5 minutes.

********************* Just to make this clear I don't disagree with your overall point. In general Harry Potter was more focused on plot than characters (and sometimes at the consequent of characterisation) and of course there are some fantastic character moments that make up for this.

But considering that there was no explicit statements either way-namely for the Taboo or Duplication Charm-it's very difficult to class them as OOC behaviour.

  'Everything you touch will burn and multiply, *but the copies are worthless*-and if you continue to handle the treasure, you will be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold.

If the copies are worthless, I would assume that they're no longer real gold (like Leprechaun Gold). And if the charms to duplicate food and objects are the same, then surely the food is no longer real food?

So, no worthless.

********************* Only the size of the Knight-Bus? Damned, I can drive a SUPERTANKER through some of those ;) (or an entire carrier-attack-group!)

Well, Harry wasn't that bad in a fight (for a school kid) - he saidly only knew limited magic (because he'd rather goof around with Ron instead of applying himself and learning some curses, charms and even some transfiguration and potions (it's not like there isn't probably a potion that can make you faster or something...hell, being able to brew Felix Felicis would have probably been a great asset! Use that when fighting Voldemort and you might have a more level playing field (if you know some more magic than fucking "Expelliarmus"))

******************** Easily enough - remember that PATRONUS CHARM? Harry learned that freaking early (especially since most adults can't produce one!), not to mention that Harry taught it to other people - Dumbledore has much more experience teaching (he spent DECADES (!) teaching freaking transfiguration to people who have never transfigured anything in their lives before coming to Hogwarts after all!), so he could probably teach them at least something and give them pointers (and books!) about a lot of other things!

Teaching Harry about Tom Riddle/Voldemort was the most useless thing that man ever did (why no show Harry those memories in one afternoon...it's not like he didn't have most of the pieces (the only one he didn't have was Slughorn's memory about the NUMBER OF HORCRUXES!))...as for the sword:

He could have told Harry to get some more BASILISK FANGS (!) and carry at least one on his person all the time!
