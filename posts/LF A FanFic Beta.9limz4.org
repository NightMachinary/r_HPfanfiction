I'm writing a fanfic for the first time in maybe 8 years, and I could use a little help/cheering on.

It's a post-war mostly canon-complaint Pansy-centric fic. I want to flesh out her character, explore her life after the war and her relationships with the people in her life.

Just some details about me in case you're interested. :)

- I live in timezone GMT+8 and mostly free on the weekends. I reply at odd times, but will always respond.
- I'm working on AO3. You can find it here. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15759822]]


** While I'm not the best when it comes to general gramma I'm generally a pretty good sounding board and proof reader. If my services intrest you feel free to contact me with a PM, so you can get an email or something of the like
