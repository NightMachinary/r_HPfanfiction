I honestly in my mind cannot understand it.

I guess this is a rant?

(Fem!Harry stories more enjoyable for me, so instead of him/he it will be her/she)

Its always in a form of:

- Sirius takes her in, instead of giving her to Hagrid.

- PoA after she finds out that Sirius is her godfather.

  - (This I always hate reading) ''You have mauraders blood in your veins! of course you like pranks!''

- Weasley twins are the only weasley's not bashed (What a surprise) and talk to her in twin speak (Hate it) on how the mauraders are the idols.

I especially hate it when said Harriet grew up with pureblood traditions, Either Black or Malfoy or even a OC family.


** If she actually grew up with Sirius, she would have lived a very prank oriented life. Also she would have grown up hearing about how many cool pranks her dead father pulled with the rest of his gang. It has been observed in real life that people would often try to partake in similar hobbies to their dead loved ones in order to feel closer to them. Scenarios where Harry becomes a prank lover is actually quite consistent with real life psychology.

*** That is understandable, I have never seen that point of view that you explained, people doing the same stuff to get closer to the deceased?

Frankly speaking, I never could understand why people would do that, Maybe I don't have that kind of attachment to it yet, to do things similiar hobbies to be closer too deceased loved ones.

The stories I somehow manage to find and read is always about Harry (I usually just tend quit reading and back out) finding pranks best thing to do is because of Sirius, just because he's his godfather and a prankster. Never have read where he did it because he felt connected to his Father.

**** To give you a real world scenario: a kid had a parent who died doing their job. Police, Firefighter, Military, whatever. Naturally hearing stories about their parent would usually make them want to "honor" the parent by doing either the same thing or something similar.

It is fairly common among people who lost a loved one in such a way.

** Canon Harry liked pranks, or else he would not appreciate Ginny that much.

The problem with Harry pranking in fanfics is that it's being done way too often.

** Honestly I think it's a slight form of wish fulfilment. I'm guessing a lot of writers wish they were the funny pranksters in high school or whatever and the marauder legacy is a convenient device for them to bring it into the story. I don't think I've read a single fic that was improved by the presence of prankster Harry.

** Why do you people seem to complain about things I don't find? Those sound great and I'd like to read them but I doubt I'd find more than one.
