I'm looking for stories that are 100K+ in words. One of my favorite fics is a black comedy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy]]. Any story that had you rolling with laughter I want to read.


** Harry the Hufflepuff is fucking hilarious, Harry is, as somebody else described the fic "the laziest motherfucker you've ever met."

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11120132/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elves-Most-Fabulous][HP and the Elves Most Fabulous]] is a LoTR/HP crossover, quite short but updated recently.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is HP]] (by Nonjon) and the 2 sequels have a fair few funny moments.

The DA Missions [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3358516/1/The-DA-Missions-Agent-Toots][#1]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3564607/1/The-DA-Missions-Agent-Furry-Fury][#2]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4568921/1/The-DA-Missions-Agent-Miss-Print][#3]] (also by Nonjon).

*** I've read Where in the world is HP and it was good. I've seen the Seventh Horcrux suggested before and wasn't really able to get into it but I think I'll give it another shot. Thanks for the suggestions.

** [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=27777][The Blackman Trilogy]] by MattSilver. Available on the DLP Work by Author forums only. One of the very few comedy stories (aside from nonjon's work or BajaB's) I've enjoyed.

I'll throw in a story from my profile, a collaboration piece with many other authors, each of us taking a turn writing a chapter. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6263067/1/Harry-Potter-and-teh-Sparkly-Hufflepuff][Harry Potter and teh Sparkly Hufflepuff]].

*** seconded opalish, especially scorpius malfoy and the improbable plot.

I've read that fic so many times, and I always end up crying with laughter. Favorite line:

#+begin_quote
  "Why Mum and Dad even wanted a third kid, I dunno, it's not like me'n Al aren't enough. Maybe they just wanted someone else to name after dead people, 'cept Lily's only got one dead-person name. Mister Malfoy says her middle name is meant to celebrate the tragic passing of Aunt Luna's sanity, but Aunt Luna says she never had sanity in the first place, so it can't be that."

Not to mention All My Aurors.
