  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

  With Lucifer in the cage and the Apocalypse averted everyone thought life was going back to normal but Life and Death are rarely that convenient and no one is content with with their share any more. !A sequel to Illusions of Grandeur! Mild spoilers and swearing, not canoncentric. On hiatus

** Welp, unfortunately for you, ffn doesn't let me search by the 2nd of two fandoms, for crossovers, and because H comes before S all the HP/Supernatural fics are in my HP section, and that section is 686 fics long.

All the ones I'd have are MoD fics anyways, though, so it's probably no major loss.

  Hermione has been looking forward to attending Hogwarts as a student ever since she first heard of it. Being separated from her god, however, is terrifying. At least her Hogwarts years are filled with the sort of chaos that "Loki" loves (though Gabriel really would prefer it if she managed to stay out of danger more often. And he really does not like this 'Voldemort' character. Those twins are alright, at least, even though they're a bit too fond of his priestess for his liking).
