Interested in a decent story with a flirty Harry or one of the girls long story 80k+ is a plus! Thank you!


** Linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall; For Love of Magic) are two that I remember that might qualify as flirty but I haven't re-read them to check that they are.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** linkffn(The Reluctant Champion) Has a flirty Harry and I found it fun at first, but then it devolves into /every/ conversation turning into discussions on sex for no damned reason. Every. Single. One.

*** Holy hell, what a trainwreck. Every character is unlikeable, the dialogue is forced and stilted (everybody swears because coolness factor) and the Harry/Daphne romance is actually... a non-romance. They are apparently very close (since they were 5 or something), they hug at every opportunity but they're not dating, because, reasons.

This dude read The Lie I've Lived and thought to himself "I can write a cool story like this!". Unfortunately for him, this story projects such an aura of badness every other AU!GoF rehash diminishes just because this exists.

**** Hah! My opinion isn't quite as harsh as yours, but I agree on a lot. There were moments where I liked it, but for the mostly it was just a mindless read for me, not to be taken too seriously. I did appreciate the attempt to mix up character relationships without just removing Ron and Hermione and dumping in two other characters who fit the exact same roles.

  Raised in magic by a loving family, trained by one of the best Aurors the DMLE has ever seen for a war always on the horizon and the world has a very different Boy-Who-Lived on their hands. Book One of the What A Difference A Father Makes series.
