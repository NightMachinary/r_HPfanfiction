The poverty of the Weasleys makes no sense.

The Ministry pays for Hogwarts as Rowling has told us. The students only buy robes(no uniforms in canon) and books. And in the Weasley family, hand-me-downs are a thing. So save for Lockhart's behavior, the books are just passed down from member to member each year. Ron even got someone's old wand and robes and rat. Even his dress robes were passed down from another family member. That means rarely is money spent on school books or clothes. Hand-me-downs are annoying but they save money.

Molly seems capable of making a never-ending amount of sweets and knitting sweaters on the side every year.

My mom suggests that the Weasleys aren't good at managing whatever money they get if they're really this destitute. How are they still dirt poor when they have 2 children who went on to very unique and well-paying professions? Do you really think Bill and Charlie are out there not finding ways to help their parents? Taking care of your parents is something that was ingrained into children back in the 70s and 80s, in return for them raising you. You have to pay them back, was what children were taught then. Rowling is a product of her time after all.

How are the Weasleys dirt poor when they apparently have so much?

1.) 6 story, well-furnished main house - very cluttered with furniture 2.) broom shed - lots of racing brooms 3.) garage - Arthur's personal space to experiment 4.) chicken coop - providing food 5.) front yard - for playing 6.) orchard full of fruit trees/homemade quidditch pitch - providing food and entertainment 7.) cornfield - providing food 8.) garden - providing entertainment and maybe also food if there are veggies growing in it too

In CoS, Molly tries to feed Harry 4 servings at every meal, which people who are strapped for funds don't do. Once Ginny is off to school with the lot of them, it's just her and Arthur for 10 months. How are they not saving any money at all when all those mouths are gone for so long? When all those needs don't have to be met until the summer? Even if Arthur is paid poorly(which he probably is) they can't save any money with an empty house? 5 out of 7 people are gone and no money is being saved?

Furthermore, I would like to direct everyone to PoA where they decided to waste the first bit of gold they got in a while, on a trip to Egypt. They did this before seeing to the needs of their children. So either they aren't poor at all and certain people are just greedy for everything, or they're poor because they don't know how to budget.

Maybe compared to the Malfoys the Weasleys seem poor, but as someone who is VERY poor and have been my whole life, the Weasleys are so privileged it annoys me.

(Note: My info is gleaned from Pottermore back when it was called such and info was easy to find on it.)


** None of that is inconsistent with the Weasleys being poor /relative to other magical families/. It's just that magic makes everything so much better/cheaper that even "poor" wizards have a higher material standard of living than the vast majority of British muggles, and "rich" wizards are just able to buy a lot of frivolous luxuries.

Take the Burrow, for example. The equivalent amount of housing in muggle Britain would have implied the Weasleys were upper-middle class. But, except for the land, it could have been created entirely by magic for free. We don't know how hard space-expansion charms are, but Arthur did enchant a car to fly and turn invisible, so its plausible that he could have enchanted the Burrow himself. Furniture can be transfigured. And even the land itself would be much cheaper than it would be for muggle housing--wizards don't need their houses to be connected to roads or any other infrastructure, it can just be any empty plot of land in the middle of nowhere.

So if the Weasleys can easily meet their whole families material needs with Arthur's salary, since food and school supplies are essentially their only expenses, there's really nothing irresponsible about splurging a bit with their lottery winnings. It doesn't hurt their ability to provide for their families needs at all.

*** I second this. "Poor" is relative. Some communities have a higher standard of living compared to others. I've lived in the US and in Indonesia. What many Americans would consider poor is considered wealthy for many Indonesians. If you have a solid wall and a roof over your head, you're already better off than many people here in my country. A lot of people in Indonesia used to live in shanties/shacks made out of thin strips of wood or a bamboo mat that's as thin as a cardboard. Their floors are absolutely filthy. They live next to a smelly, polluted river filled with poop that floods inside their houses during rain. They can't afford school, so the kids all work peddling wares or begging on the street and grew up illiterate. Many of the poor in America, on the other hand, still have a solid wall, a clean floor, and a solid roof over their heads. They don't have to experience having human poop floating inside their house or their roof leaking every time it rains, or their entire house smelling like trash 24/7.

The Weasleys may seem wealthy in comparison, but since everything comes easily for wizards, every family, rich or poor, is guaranteed to have their basic needs met thanks to magic. 'Poor' for them basically just means they can't afford luxuries or brand new things every time.

*** In book 2, Ron breaks his wand at the beginning of the school year and goes the rest of the year with a malfunctioning wand. It would have been obvious to at least McGonagall and Flitwick that he's having wand problems (though they don't see any problem with Neville either), so he should have gotten a new wanna within a week of classes starting. And it's not like his parents wouldn't find out, Percy would have told them if Ron didn't himself. If they could afford to, they would have gotten him a new wand. If we use the cannon conversion rate, a brand new wand is less than £50. Even by the more reasonable fan rate of ten times that amount, a wand is well within "upper-middle-class" emergency spending.

** Rowling was on the dole? She wrote a children's book series when she was fairly young herself, and she didn't pay attention in economics? The Labour party's impact amongst educational policies trickled down into the classroom?

Really, you can take your pick. The reality is, she wanted Harry to have a friend who was from a large, but poor family.

The truth of the matter is that with an orchard and a large garden, a stay at home mom can keep even a large family fed without having to budget a lot for food. I can attest to this, having spent many, many, many hours of my young life in the garden, or cleaning the chicken coop, or helping Mum with the canning.

One of the reasons that there are over 800,000 Harry Potter Fanfictions on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] is because while she wrote an enchanting and interesting story, and her premise was great, Rowling is not good at the mechanics of world building.

** Most likely it is because they aren't excesivly poor like one could assume at first glance. They are not well off by any means but they have what they need to get around. And growing food at home most likely help. But I also think that we first meet the Weasleys at a time where a lot of expenses came at the same time. Ron is starting Hogwarts which means that they have to get everything that he needs which is a lot even if they gave him Bill's old robes and Charlie's old wand, Percy got an owl and the twins are thirteen so one could assume that they might need new robes due to a growth spurt.

​

And a large portion probably has to do with the fact that there are so many Weasleys. Let's pretend that the money they took out from their vault in book 2 was 1 galleon, 15 sickles and 25 knuts. That is not very much if you divide it by five but it would have been more if it was only divided between two or not divided at all. So they could have had much more to spend on each child had there not been five of them.

** I'm going to add something that makes stuff even more confusing.

In GOF, Fred and George have savings of thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles and three Knuts. They have also spent the summer inventing and producing fake wands, trick sweets and other such Wheezes. We have no indication that they've started /selling/ the Wheezes yet since they weer only drawing up order forms and price lists, but they've spent time inventing them which has presumably required resources which they would had had to buy.

But we know that as of POA, Percy didn't have ten galleons to cover his bet to Penelope Clearwater if Gryffindor lost and Ron only ever seems to have small change.

** I dont get why people criticize the Weasley's spending the lottery money on a trip to visit Bill. They've managed living off of Arthur's salary for years. And time and time again its shone that the money isn't what really matters to them. They can get by on what they got, but can't often afford to travel to visit their sons. So when they recieved the money they decided to visit Bill because he's family and they haven't seen him in years.

** I liked the explanation of linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities): parents were saving so much for their seven children, that there was not much left for the ordinary living.

** They seem to handle money pretty badly. They blew almost their entire lottery winnings one one holiday (and a wand for Ron), they made a big journey the year before (adults + Ginny to Romania) and yet Ron has to live with some truly ugly, second-hand dress robe. Therefore my conclusion is simply mismanagement. It does not matter how much you earn, if you don't spend it wisely or spend more than your earn.

*** Also, I think Molly just doesn't really care what Ron thinks of those old dress robes. Or really think about his likes at all. In the first train ride he has a packet of sandwiches, but they're corned beef, which he doesn't like, and he says that she "always forgets" he doesn't like it. His Christmas sweaters are always maroon, which he also doesn't like (and really, with a family of redheads, why is maroon yarn even in her knitting bag?). He needs dress robes, and these are the ones she has, and therefore they're good enough regardless of how ridiculous they look. No wonder he develops a chip on his shoulder about hand--me--downs.

The real answer to your question is that JKR is crap at maths and economics, which she freely admits. She made the situation worse when she changed the exchange rate from 50 pounds per galleon to 5. When they go to Gringotts together before second year, the Weasleys have only a single galleon in their vault, with a few other coins. That meant the Weasleys have less than 10 pounds in the bank.

Yes, they have a garden, an orchard, and chickens, which keeps them fed. That doesn't mean that hard coinage is easy to come by. You can't spend produce in Diagon Alley, and Lockhart the bastard wants every single student to buy all seven of his books.

Also, I don't know how old you are, but young people often don't realize that being an adult means having "invisible" bills. Somebody once told me that my husband made enough money that I didn't have to work, and I had to grit my teeth not to rip their heads off because we were barely getting by with both of our salaries.

As far as spending their money on trips, that can be seen as poor money management, or as Molly prioritizing keeping track of her "wayward" sons who've gone out of her reach. (Her children are literally molly-coddled.) That's not the only indicator of them not being as poor as Ron gripes about: Disobedience Writer noted in her(?) story The House of Potter Rebuilt that Ron, while claiming to be poor, also brags that he has over 500 chocolate frog cards, a not-insignificant investment of supposedly scarce pocket change. linkffn(11933512)

** From what I know remember Molly, Arthur and Ginny went to Romania in the Christmas of PS to meet Charlie. Maybe the reason they are poor is because they spend all their funds on whim. I can imagine Arthur spending a lot of things on muggle knick knacks and his projects. This might explain why there are no savings even though no one is home.
