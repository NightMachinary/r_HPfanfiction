Say a dark wizard would want to cause some mayhem without revealing the existence of magic. What are some good ways to do that? Preferably subtle enough for Muggles to write it off as an oddity but clear enough for witches and wizards to notice.

Obviously, giants, werewolves and flashy magic are out of the question. Do not restrict yourself to canon spells, but try to keep it feasible for the HP world (so no antimatter but Nundu Plagues would be alright).


** The idea I was considering was weather manipulation. Create a storm somewhere off Iceland, let it wander across the North Sea and then massively empower it shortly before it hits the shore. Maybe sabotage some dykes for maximum effect.

Looks like freak weather and badly maintained floodwalls, but at least some wizards should connect the dots.

Alternatively, droughts.

** Easiest way is to cast enough charms and spells to mask your presence and cast the imperius curse on the muggle leaders of a nuclear state.

Using multiple wizards to apparate into a city, cast Fiendfyre, and immediately apparate out. With 30-40 wizards, the city is toast. If they're disillusioned or wearing invisibility cloaks, there's no chance of detection.

Another thing to absolutely destroy the economy would be to plant vanishing tablets (which are objects that are enchanted to vanish material) in oil wells and coal mines. Whether it is a smooth constant rate of vanishing, or a rate that can be adjusted according to the user's needs, it will pretty much bring a country to a standstill in a matter of weeks, depending on how quickly you want the fossil fuels to run out. Do it on a global scale to bring the world to a standstill.

Alternatively, because of how broken the magical system is, all you have to do is to fabricate a spell that will destroy a planet, say for instance, a Kamehameha spell, and fire it from space. It will cost you no more than casting the lumos charm.

** Magical have instant travel, why not just jump from place to place starting massive fires with incendio? It's not flashy and as long as you aren't seen (disillusion yourself) it'll be passed off as just a fire.(except for the fact there's fires starting up all over the UK in a very short amount of time. )

Well...

  The Prime Minister's pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations, for they were neither fair nor true. How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was fewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and well-publicized murders? Or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and property? And was it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family?

  [...]

  “So I suppose you're going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too?” said the Prime Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, almost worse than it being the government's fault after all.

  “That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably.

  “Excuse me!” barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamping up and down. “Trees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries ---”

  “It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's followers. And... and we suspect giant involvement.”

** Pull off a Skynet: imperius US and Soviet leaders and order them to fire their nuclear weapons; 90+% Muggles dead easily dead within a few months.

I'm actually surprised that Voldemort hasn't pulled off that yet, considering he had lived through the London Blitz and WW2. He should know about Muggles's strengths and weaknesses.

*** The Blitz was nowhere near the full destructive capabilities of WWII. I mean, London didn't look like [[https://cdn.britannica.com/s:700x450/97/181997-004-F9E0F4AA.jpg][this]] or [[https://newsonia.com/media/upload/images/2017/02/15/gUlfa0ZSxewoxEAEhTZjq727s99QBVMi_598x414.jpg][this]]. And by the time Hiroshima and Nagasaki happened, Riddle was done with the Muggle world. So while definitely traumatic, his experiences during the Blitz wouldn't let him deduct the full capabilities of Muggle warfare, let alone nukes.

Also, I think a MAD would be too severe to be useful. What's the point in ruling the world if you can't go outside without dying?

**** Riddle would certainly learn about the atomic bombs.

--------------

If not a MAD, then release Small Pox through 'lab accidents' when hardly anyone is immunized.

Send Dementors to hit some pesky religious figures who keep calling Witchcraft evil.

Try to stir up a limited nuclear war between countries where Witchcraft is still punishable by death.

Apparate around and cast Incendios in very dry forests.

The countries which believe in witchcraft luckily do not possess nuclear weapons.

That one is a good idea. Not very useful in the UK, but would do in Southern Europe.

**** Riddle wasn't in London during the Blitz. It's possible he would have returned to find parts of the city in ruins, which might have had a similarly powerful effect on his mentality, but he wouldn't have experienced the bombings themselves.

***** You are right. I remembered it as an argument for why Dumbledore was evil (He sends the poor orphan into the bomb rain) and only checked the dates for the Battle of Britain. The German history accounts do not consider the Blitz a separate event but rather a part of the Battle of Britain and I merely checked the situation by the time the Hogwarts term ended (which should be around Dunkirk that year).

** Mass compulsions on major cities to make people read violent, imperious bank heads to buy up all the bonds in circulation or print a shit ton of money. Or maybe just start putting up a lot of wards or invisible magic to fuck with all a cities electricity. Maybe go to a major military base and imperious/confound them to think they need to invade different places and start mass killings or something.
