I have a small problem that I need help with, I have absolutely zero idea how to write my OC, he's one of three MC's (Harry, Neville and him) I have the character down to the finest detail at this point, but I have no idea where to put him in the story, I know how to write him as a friend and partner and even as a fighter, but I have no idea how to write him as a student or where he would even be sorted.

the character is mainly split between Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff with Slytherin close behind, but he would think too logically for Ravenclaws door and would get stuck at the door everytime, so I only see Slytherin or Hufflepuff for him :/

My main idea with the fic is that Harry, Neville and OC develop into a well coordinated combat team, Harry and Neville are like the main power of the team with the OC also being a large part of the power, but also an op support character. I planned to start from first year and see their development as people and friends with the climax being the war and the multiple fights within it (I plan to draw out the war for more cool battle scenes and stuff)

I also planned to have the friend group be a few females in addition, I'll probably pair them up later, but I'm not sure on those yet. (the group I planned was Harry, Neville, OC, Susan, Daphne and Hermione)

I got the fic inspiration from a fic and a song I heard on the radio.

I have no idea if any of this makes sense so if you need clarification on something then please ask.

Thank you for reading my rambling request for assistance, hopefully I'll be succesful in this fic.

Stay safe and healthy!


** Given what you've set up, I'd take one of the canon named characters with no real details and turn him into your own interpretation. Based on the mix, I'd say he should be a Ravenclaw. Keep in mind that the Ravenclaws tend to be individuals with their own ideas, and the highest achievement is to be proven right about something that others got wrong. Try Terry Boot, maybe.

** The most important thing to decide is what the story you want to tell is. If you can summarize the story concept down into one sentence, you can figure out what's actually important to you and therefore the reader, and what should be excluded.

For example I have a fic in progress about Sirius sorted into Slytherin. The story I want to tell does not include seven years of Slytherin Sirius, because that isn't important. Yes I know in my head the details about how he and Severus became friends, how he became rivals with James, and how they clashed over the years, but the reader can pick all that up without needing to slog through seven years of what is essentially backstory for the real tale.

In your case, is the story "the tale of how three young wizards became friends across house lines, growing and facing challenges together during the seven years of their magical schooling until facing the greatest challenge of their lives?" Or is it "The story of three young wizards, taking down Voldemort and Death Eaters as a well coordinated combat team?" Or even just "The story of three wizards, kicking ass and taking down bad guys as a well coordinated combat team"

​

Just by clarifying those three you can find out if your story needs all of the Hogwarts years, some of them, or none at all.

If you want to show the growing friendship from a young age, expound on those challenges and find a way to make them relevant to the reader who has seen the stations of canon a thousand times. (IE. Don't go through the stations of canon please. Change things)

If you want them to be old enough to actually know spells and be able to do things, you can start in fifth year, either providing background information about the implied friendship between Harry, Neville, and OC during the last four years, or even bringing the three of them together at this time.

If the story you want to tell is really about this well oiled combat team, why bother with canon at all? Make the three of them Auror trainees facing a new threat, or shift Voldemort's resurrection back a decade and have them taking on Voldemort as fully trained aurors. Or something like that. You don't have to write a single point of departure story where everything butterfly effects out based on the introduction of your OC.

Then don't. You don't have to prove all your background research.

Just be careful, the worst thing you can do is spend a bunch of time rehashing stuff the reader knows because you want to make tweaks or insert your character inconsequentially.

​

Keep it to what your reader needs to know, so it lets you write what you want to write. It is perfectly acceptable to work our your timeline/character but only give the reader what they need in relation to your story's narrative. This can be references back to things that happened in the past, or even full blown flashbacks when needed.

​

So many stories want to show things that start with small changes in the beginning of series that snowball into huge changes later. The problem with this is your reader has to get through the beginning of your story where 98, 99% of the story is identical to what they have already read.

​

Cover what is important for the story you want to tell.

​

As for where to place your character, if you want it to be very close to the canon characters, you probably want to take over a loosely defined side character that fits. If you are willing to be further away from what is already defined (Making your character a year older or younger, or in Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw), you can usually just have your own character and pretend he was a background character in canon who never spoke up. You should still have your divergence point (what went different that your character spoke to them in your fic that they did not in canon?) Or, if you are saying your character didn't exist in canon and the difference is the character exists, when their appearance made a meaningful change in the plot.

*** THANK YOU FOR THE ADVICE

I just realized that I have a ton of plot changes to make because there's no way my story even could happen in the canon universe or plotline, I'll have to change the whole plotline now. So cya I'm gonna go work

** I'd like to think it's closer to the first one, and as for the year I'd start the story in, I'm thinking of third year, because otherwise I'd have a bajillion flash backs and it'd be awful, imagine having to read a story that starts with twenty flashbacks..

I'm not even sure about the above statement I made, because the only interesting thing would be Sirius escaping from Azkaban, and that's in no way relevant to the story as of now, but I think I'll find a pretty important spot for him.

I think I will change a /lot/ of things about the whole series, things like how stupid Voldemort seems to be in first year and after (ignoring the bookcrux)

It's not about them being a combat team, it's about how well they work together and how much they understand eachother, it just happily translates into combat.

I think I missed a few points but whateva

[[/u/kingsonne][u/kingsonne]] I somehow made this a comment instead of a reply..

*** It's good to know what the important things are, I'd still recommend thinking about and writing your own single sentence summary rather than just going off the one I threw together. Its a good strategy for focusing yourself on the important aspects of the overarching plot. When you've only got one sentence, every word choice, addition, and exclusion means something more.

Remember that just because something happened in the past for your characters, is doesn't mean that you have to show it to your readers. There are less heavy handed approaches to backstory than flashbacks. If something happened in the past that is going to effect the plot in the present, then you can handle filling in the user on the past at the time it becomes relevant.

Consider following an aspect of canon. Harry Potter starts with an introduction, first to the Perfectly Normal world of the Dursleys, through following Vernon's day, and then to the World of Magic through Albus and Minerva. Then the plot jumps forward 10 years. The circumstances that have shaped Harry to be who he is and that have shaped his relationships are explained and doled out in little present day relevant descriptions over the course of the next few chapters.

Consider starting your fic with a chapter introducing your OC and setting the stage for the eventual Harry, Neville, OC friendship. Then jump forward to whenever the plot of your actual story starts. Reveal things from backstory as they are relevant. If you've imagined a super cool way that your trio handled the Basilisk situation but the Basilisk never comes up in your plot, then its best left as author only backstory.

If they come together over fighting the Troll, then you can include that as a small single sentence background point. "They had been inseparable ever since OC used X spell to help Harry and Neville to X thing to take out the troll." It lets the reader know what happened and lets them fill in the gaps from their own imagination rather than having a pointless flashback to write out the scene as you envision it.
