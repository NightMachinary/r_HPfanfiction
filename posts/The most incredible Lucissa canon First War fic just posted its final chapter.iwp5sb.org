[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13016242/1/Vacillation][Vacillation]] by [[/u/fairmaidofkent][u/fairmaidofkent]] is honestly the best Lucius and Narcissa story I've ever read.

It follows their lives and marriage as they navigate their feelings, Narcissa's infertility and the First War. The writing is beautiful and elegant, and the characterizations are fully real and flawed.

Lucius is brooding and alpha male and messed up from his family, and I honestly just want to hug him, despite his occasional assholery. Narcissa is devious, conniving and intelligent, and possesses this hidden, stubborn strength that makes her endearing.

I also loved the author's characterizations of Bellatrix and the Lestrange brothers. Rodolphus provides a lot of comedic relief, and his relationship with Bellatrix is beyond entertaining. We get some Rabastan backstory as well, and even that little snippet broke my heart. The author is that good.

All the main characters are casually horrible people who treat muggles and most wizards who aren't their friends as sub-humans, and yet one roots for them anyway.

Anyway, this story has relatively very little traffic, and I cannot fathom why. It might start a bit slow, but the story is nuanced and subtle and profoundly moving, and if you're into the Malfoys or pureblood society at all you would enjoy this immensely.

** Thanks for posting this - a great example of how good fanfiction gets buried unnoticed beneath the thick layer of trope-ridden garbage. I had never heard of this fic before.

I've only read the first chapter so far, but it's immediately obvious that it's a cut above your standard fic. The description is evocative without being overly wordy. The characters are distinct in voice and personality, with meaningful motivations and conflicts. The pacing is just right - the opening chapter could serve just fine as a one-shot.

In terms of content, I think this is one of the first post-Hogwarts fics I've read where I feel like the post-Hogwarts setting enhances rather than detracts from the story. The concept of a just-graduated Lucius making his first steps as an adult in high society is an interesting premise - it's almost like a de-troped independent!Harry premise.

There's a few negative points, however.

Firstly, the paragraphs are too long. They'd be fine in print, but on a fanfiction website they present almost as a wall of text. It makes reading a bit more difficult than it should be.

Secondly, I have mixed feelings about the aristocratic worldbuilding with political marriages, traditional gender roles, etc. To be clear, this story's depiction of that trope is among the best I've seen. The political marriage is dysfunctional, as opposed to resulting in immediate true love, which immediately places it above 99% of all Lord Potter-Black stories. And the whole atmosphere does have a certain Jane Austen-esque charm.

However, I just don't think that this type of worldbuilding fits particularly well into the world of Harry Potter. At most, I think the Harry Potter world we see can be forced into a Victorian-era society where rule is largely by the gentry, who have displaced the old nobility as the political and social elite. But I just don't think it works as a Georgian/Regency era style aristocratic society without going into heavy AU territory which loses a lot of the character and charm of the canonical HP world.

Thirdly, I'm not completely enamoured with the character interaction between Lucius and Narcissa. I do love the conflict at the heart of the interaction, and the motivations of the characters, simple to understand yet providing so much possibility. What I'm less keen on is the fairly tropey "sneaky Slytherins" type stuff where they hatch all these unlikely and needlessly complex schemes, like Blair Waldorf from Gossip Girl.

To be fair to the story, Lucius' scheme fails and he only gets what he wants when he just comes out and speaks plainly. But the whole "dancing around the point" stuff feels over-egged to me. Being too proud and too polite to just speak directly is fine. That's good characterisation. My problem is with the chain of causation and its realism (or lack thereof). The whole series of events of Lucius negotiating this fake contract, to Narcissa catching wind of it, to her coming immediately to London and Lucius accurately predicting it all... it all just seems inherently unlikely. Complexity creates chaos, long causal chains tend to be interrupted by unexpected events or interventions of third parties. But (so far, at least), there is a certain level of unrealistic predictability about events in this story.

*** Adding to this and responding to the question posed by [[/u/wyanmai]] in the OP:

#+begin_quote
  Anyway, this story has relatively very little traffic, and I cannot fathom why.
#+end_quote

Three reasons, I think.

1. It's not Harry-centric. That immediately loses you a good chunk of the fandom.

2. It's not Hermione centric and it's not slash. That immediately loses you a good chunk of the people who read non-Harry-centric fics.

3. The paragraphs are long, as I mentioned in my post above. Since this thread was posted, I've mentioned the fic to a number of other people. Pretty much all of them clicked on the link, saw the wall of text, and immediately said they weren't going to try reading it. Never underestimate how effective a wall of text is at immediately putting readers off.

*** The paragraphs are a lot longer in the first few chapters but they do get shorter and much more manageable.

Some of the points you brought up about Lucius's scheme in the first chapter are fair. However, this story has scenes marked by specific dates, and later on there are flashbacks to earlier times that shed light on the premise in the first chapter. Latter scenes address why Lucius felt the need to have a scheme like that, and why Narcissa responded that particular way. Specific flashbacks reveal what happened that led to this. This story really isn't really much like Gossip Girl.

The writing standard is definitely higher than the standard fic.

As someone who is woefully ignorant of Victorian and Georgian society (and British class structure in general) would you mind elaborating on this? What makes the HP world lean Victorian?

**** It's not that the HP world leans Victorian - HP society in canon is pretty much the same as modern Muggle society in terms of political and moral norms.

My point is simply that, because Victorian society is closer to modern society than Georgian society, it's less of a stretch to force Victorian elements into the HP world.

** I just finished reading this and was about to post on here! This is one of my favorite fics. It is a very realistic look into the lives of Lucius, Narcissa, Rodolphus, and Bellatrix. This story explicitly has Lucius acting like a major asshole and yet I was rooting for him. Actually, all the main characters are and do horrible things but I still was somewhat rooting for them anyways.

The author, fairmaidofkent, really did her research for this story and it shows. I loved the depiction of pure blood culture and Death Eaters. There were many events here and there that show what they generally do in their lives. This also is canon compliant (even with Pottermore tidbits but in a good way).

One thing that really stood out to me in this fic was the characterization of Lucius. This is really his story, his journey, his transformation into becoming who he is. I like how even though he does change to some extent, he isn't completely whitewashed or OOC.

I too am surprised by the low traffic, but it is understandable since Lucius/Narcissa isn't the most popular ship. But I too would highly recommend reading this gem.

And if you like this story, I would also recommend checking out the author's earlier works. She has a few underlying tropes and characterizations that have evolved with each subsequent story! I've been reading her fics for years and it is really interesting to read these.

Vacillation is hands down the best Lucissa fic I've read. I am so excited for the upcoming sequel!

** ALSO just recently finished this story and I have a lot of thoughts but mostly want to talk more about Rodolphus. He steals every scene he's in. He's horrific and perfect for Bella. The wild violence and disregard for everyone and everything feels really right for the pairing. That scene towards the end where he backhands Bella when she's hysterical, I can't stop thinking about it. I feel like it sums up how Narcissa first idealizes their relationship, then sees the casual violence and horror of it... no love, just commitment... idk anyone else here to discuss?

  Coming together is not always an easy feat, but the rest of the time, things fall apart. As Narcissa and Lucius navigate whether or not to trust one another, the Wizarding world begins to bend to the power of a Dark Lord and everything they've ever known starts to unravel.

*** You could be right if there was death eater apologism in it.

There is not. It's played entirely straight -- it's racist, nasty, and Lucius is a Grade A misogynistic asshole.

I enjoyed reading it so far, because of that -- I always find it remarkable if authors manage to get into heads quite different from the norm and what is commonly considered "right" -- but I kinda do hope this is the story of how Lucius gets some sense knocked into him by Narcissa, because reading about a dumbass servant of a halfblood-pretender is only marginally entertaining. Right now, the story isn't what it could be. And Narcissa is *so* out of his league. (I'd prefer her POV.)

Maybe [[/u/TheEmeraldDoe][u/TheEmeraldDoe]] can clear a few things up. I don't mind spoilers.

**** Narcissa's POV is coming up in the story if you haven't come across it already! It really shows her side of the story. I wouldn't call her completely innocent in their relationship but she is leagues above Lucius in almost all aspects. Like wayyy above. Even Snape thinks so

There is no Death Eater apologism. They are depicted as bloodthirsty, bigoted, and violent. There's a really well written chapter about Rodolphus which is a great origin story and doesn't hold back. Slight spoilers but the author takes real life tragedies and violent events that occurred in the 70s and attributes it to Death Eaters. There is no “but the Death Eaters/Voldemort aren't so bad after all.”

The depiction is done in a way similar to the latest Hunger Games prequel which is about President Snow.

And yes, Lucius is a misogynistic asshole who somewhat tones down. He isn't a “good guy” at the end, but is a better version of who he was in the beginning.

Because nobody actually does/wants to root for them? Just from your post I'm not even going to read it because I don't like reading about casual degenerate psychos bent on genocide and slavery. I'm definitely never going to ROOT for them.
