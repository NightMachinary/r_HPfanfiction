** Quick safety tip: you really should toss out the dairy after the fridge loses power for a few hours.

*** Also find the person who spiked it. That's likely a small part of the problem.

** The marriage law. Yeah, certainly the people who fought Voldemort will accept random forced marriages to people they used to fight. It's a lazy plot device to force characters together who'd never become a couple otherwise. It doesn't make sense at all and is usually a sign of shitty writing.

Or if you write a marriage law, read up on how the Khmer Rouge enforced marriages and depict the marriage law as the horror it would be.

**** Yep. Although I think a contract fic can be done right. Auto making it work after they see each other? No.

***** I agree. In a conservative society like magical Britain, arranged marriages make sense. The problem is that they're hardly ever done right, but that's to be expected in fanfic, where most writers are relatively unexperienced amateurs.

If an author decides to display magical Britain as a society where arranged marriages are the norm, I think it's best to display the full range from a few lucky couples eventually forming a happy relationship, to some resulting in complete and utter disasters, with most of them somewhere in between.

****** I like to think there's a small one up for magical society v. Regular in the case of marriages being happy. And that is if a family has to make a contract that they could be led to an appropriate match through that magic. Either with ancient spells known to matchmakers or fuzzy canon workings of how magic interacts with the human body
