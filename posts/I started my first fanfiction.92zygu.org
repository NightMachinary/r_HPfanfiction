Hello! I'm writing a new fan fiction and wanted to share it here if anyone was interested in it! It's a humor / Dramione story and I am aiming to update it weekly.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13013451/1/A-Tale-of-the-Unlikely-Chapter-1]]

That's the link to it, feel free to PM me with feedback :)


** Overall not a bad start at all. My advice is keep writing, it is the only way you improve. No one is born perfect at anything. The first few things you will be bad. The next few will still be bad. Then you'll finally reach decent. My point is these things take time.

Don't get discouraged, proofread and edit, and keep writing!

I dropped you a review with a bit more expansive things that I saw. Glad that you've started writing, always can use more material out there.
