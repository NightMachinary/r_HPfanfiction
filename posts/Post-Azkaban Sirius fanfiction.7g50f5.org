I love Sirius to pieces but I rarely find fanfiction with him in character and dealing with the after effects of Azkaban. So a one-shot or multi chapter fic of him dealing with the effects would be much appreciated. NO romance (no Wolfstar or Sirius/Hermione) of any kind please. If there are sprinkles of it then it's okay. Pre-OOTP is preferable. Also, it'd be very nice to see the Order learning of his innocence and reforming his friendship with Remus. I wouldn't like to see Sirius cracking a joke every moment, making pranks as though he's an eleven year old, whining to Remus and /always/ talking about Harry. He just had to look like a man who has been mentally tortured for twelve years and IC.

Thanks for your help! =)

  A 'Harry goes to Azkaban' story. Convicted for releasing the Basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets, Harry is put into a cell next to the most feared wizard in the world, Sirius Black. AU 3rd year, canon pairings, no Deathly Hallows.

** Linkffn(darkness ascendant by cole pascal) starts in chapter four, he'll be dealing with aftereffects for the rest of the story. Skip to chapter two. The prologue is a placeholder for dramatis personae i need to finish writing.

** (Idle musing) Seems a shame to deprive him of a bit of romance before he dies. The poor bugger never got much of a break in canon.

****** His issues are a plot point in both, but his inner thoughts are more visible in Patron - his POV in Divided and Entwined starts later, although his anger is clearly visible in his of the Ministry practically from the start.
