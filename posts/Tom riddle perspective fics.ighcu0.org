** It was just posted around here a couple days ago. Voldemort goes back in time and raises Tom Riddle, and it is written from Tom's perspective. I really love it, the writing is very strong, the plot is very interesting, everyone is kept in character. It starts when Tom's about 9 years old and is adopted by Voldemort and goes on through his Hogwarts years- the pacing is really good, it never gets boring. Or at least not for me.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13103526/1/Birds-of-a-Feather][Birds of a Feather]] is one of my favourites because of its very high quality and character development. The main idea is quite odd: Hermione is born in the 1920s and attends Hogwarts together with Tom, but unlike many stories with odd main ideas, this one actually works. Unfortunately, the story appears to be on a long hiatus, if not abandoned. linkffn(13103526)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex][The Imposter Complex]] follows Tom Riddle's diary who becomes an independent agent after the events of CoS. Very action-packed story, too much to my liking, but still exciting and entertaining. linkffn(13275002)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13641104/1/The-Boy-He-Failed-a-Tom-Riddle-Story][The Boy He Failed, a Tom Riddle Story]] is a very recent story that I've just begun to read myself. As of yet I can't say much more than that the prose is good. It has very few readers at the moment and I'd like to give a motivation boost to the writer. linkffn(13641104)

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend". But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle. (1930's Childhood Friends AU)

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

  What if a young Tom Riddle was haunted by nightmares of the evils he would commit to gain power and immortality? Further, what if Albus had taken the time to care for and teach him? This story takes place between 1938 and 1945. Book 2 has begun and is Updated Tuesday and Friday to this feed.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
