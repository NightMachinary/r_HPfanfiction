Seems like an interesting premise.

I don't care if the ministry gets taken over and Hogwarts is the last bastion of the light or not. I just want to read a 7th year at Hogwarts for Harry.


** Ffn(book of Morgan le fey) and its sequel are books six and seven aus, written before HBP came out. Book 6 is Ron focused, but the scope opens back up to harry in book 7. It's well written and developed, and it takes some interesting twists as to what steps voldemort had taken to make himself immortal, given that dumbledore hasn't told us about Horcruxes yet. That being said they're a little . . . odd, and it's hard to go back to the headspace where you can defeat voldemort by fighting him without destroying Horcruxes first.

Oh, the stories are nsfw as well.

**** Sex. It doesn't take up the entire fic, but sex is fairly common in the fics and it certainly isn't something I'd like my supervisor at work to catch me reading.
