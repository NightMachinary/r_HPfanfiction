I have no idea where that stroke in the title came from, but I meant animagus form xD


** I think people take his love for flying and translate it to his animagus form to have the ability to fly. Then they pick the coolest or fastest bird i.e. a falcon (Peregrine Falcon is the fastest bird in the world able to surpass 200 mph in a dive) to become his as you put it snimsgod. Personally I think he would have wanted to be an Owl so that he could talk with Hedwig when she was still alive; Rest In Peace Hedwig.

** Because a lot of people use fanfiction as a form of wish fulfillment, and falcons are probably the animagus form most people want to be, if they're excluding magical creatures.

I personally prefer Harry as Mongoose, but I'd like it if it was a Stag(which I weirdly have never seen).

** I don't think I've ever seen it except in the latest from SteelBadger... I'm more used to see lion/panther/wolf/raven/owl/phoenix/snake/weirdMagicalShit animagus everywhere. Then again, I don't recall reading many fics lately where Harry is an animagus.

I see four solutions:

1. I'm completely out of the loop.
2. You're mainly reading fanfics that are part of a niche where falcon!Harry happens to popular for whatever reason.
3. You have recently randomly encountered a succession of fics with falcon!Harry by pure happenstance.
4. A combination of the three.

Until further adjudication, my personal conclusion on the matter is therefore: meh?

***** Linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black)

It's a pretty small part of the story, and other than some tropes and Mary Sue-ish writing it's pretty good (one of my favorites, actually).

Edit: also it's sadly incomplete and hasn't been updated since like 2017. So likely abandoned.

*** In fairness I'll admit I have seen a couple of stories where Harry has a falcon animagus, or rather snimsgod, form. Couldn't say which ones though, sadly. I've also seen him be an owl or a raven. Flying forms can have an actual use while most terrestrial animals are a bit useless, really, so far as plot is concerned.

I most unique bird I've seen him get as an animagus form is probably a Sparrowhawk. Why? Because in that particular MCU crossover, Tony Stark decided to start calling him that because of the Earthsea books. And then Harry finished his transformation and... well. That happened.

My absolute favourite animagus form isn't Harry's though - it's the one Hermione got in 'Harry's a Dragon and That's Okay'. I mean, you can't beat making her a velociraptor and blaming it on her time turner shenanigans. You just can't.

** Realistically speaking there's a pretty high chance of a completely useless animagus form that is neither capable of flight like a bird or a beetle, nor inconspicuous like a cat or a dog, neither stealthy nor mobile nor particularly powerful. A goldfish, or a cow, or a stag. Yes, a stag is useless unless you have a werewolf friend or you need to hide in a forest. No way of hiding in urban environments, mobility less than flying on a Cleansweep 5, and no chances in combat against a wizard or just a muggle with a gun.
