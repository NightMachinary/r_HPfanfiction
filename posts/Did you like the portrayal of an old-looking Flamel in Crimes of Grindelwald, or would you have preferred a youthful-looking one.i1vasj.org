** I see the elixir as something that just halts ageing, so in my mind he spent almost all of his life making the stone and by the time he had finished he was an old man and has just stayed that way.

I can see both side of the argument but when I read PS the first time I thought of Flamel as an old looking man and then when I was older and re-read it I sort of made up my own headcanon to fit my imagination to the canon.
