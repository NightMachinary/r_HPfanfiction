Now, that's not to say I don't enjoy a good werewolf fic here or there, just that in fanon it makes no sense for what the various groups are after.

Often the trope is that the Ministry and the Dark (tm)/Death Eaters are for tightening restrictions on Werewolves while Harry and the Light (tm) want to get rid of restrictions and allow Werewolves to join Wizarding-kind once more.

The issue isn't with the Ministry's stance or with Harry's or the supposed Light (tm) sides... Its with the Dark faction or Death Eaters. Because it seems like in most fiction (and one werewolf in canon) the Dark WANTS the Werewolves on their side as a weapon of terror. It makes no sense for the Death Eaters to support legislation to discriminate against the group of people who they want on their side. Its not even like they HIDE the fact in most fanfic.

*MY UNWANTED OPINION!*

I like the idea of the Light (tm) and the Ministry being more in line with their thinking in regards to the werewolves, while the 'heroes' that are with Harry have to cope with going against their allies to help werewolves or having to risk making an alliance with the Dark (tm) factions for meaningful laws to be passed to help werewolves. Assuming the 'heroes' even WANT to help werewolves, it is a curse after all.


** You have to remember that the Death Eaters are a terrorist group who are opposing the Ministry. So no-one knows who exactly the Death Eaters are. This means that members (like Lucius Malfoy) can push through restrictions on Werewolves while acting like a part of the 'Ministry' agenda.

Having tighter ministerial laws is more likely to push werewolves into either of the two other sides. Since the "light" side is working closely with the ministry (Dumbledore being Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot), werewolves would rather join forces with the dark side, who would be using people like Fenrir Greyback to sell a narrative that the Death Eaters care about werewolf rights.

Since a common trope in fanon is having the Ministry being practically controlled by Death Eaters, it is clear to the reader that the 'dark' faction is pushing for restrictions on werewolves. But from the perspective of any random werewolf, who doesn't know that, it just seems like the Ministry is against them.

** Is the light side trying to loosen werewolf restrictions? Because the 'Light' side were in power for 12 years and very little was done (though, that's to be expected from british politics... cough 4 years for Brexit cough)

I adore wizard politics, particularly werewolf rights in HP (which yeah, how specifically fucking boring is that). But how Remus would have been treated by governments is so fascinating. And the consiquences of war besides.

The best story that tackles this is linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies). It's an incredible look at the 12 inbetween years of Remus and Sirius and is criminally underappreciated.

It focus's a lot on werewolf rights and what the war was about from a muggle perspective. I now take it as canon. The part that sticks out is this::::

/"Philip tuts impatiently.“Don't you see? It's all the same thing! You live under a regime that denies people the right to their privacy, that restricts and moderates your contact with fellow human beings, simply because they don't have magic; a regime that can shove a vial of truth serum down a man's throat or take him into custody at the drop of a hat because he suffers from a debilitating condition through no fault of his own. It's a regime that allowed you to spend most of your adult life in solitary confinement without a trial for christ's sake! A one-party state that controls the media and marginalises those who do not or cannot conform. And not only do neither of you oppose this regime, you both ACTIVELY FOUGHT TO SAVE IT IN AN ACTUAL WAR!”"/

If you want an insight into how dumb wizarding politics is, this is the fic.

*** And no, in canon the 'Light' side doesn't actually seem to participate in politics at all. All save Arthur's Muggle Protection act in book 2 and Kingsley in the end of book 7. Well... and Dumbledore, but I don't think he was on ANYONES side. Then again, there is also only a total of 2 werewolves in the 7 books as well. Hence why I stuck to fanon.

  Sirius is in Azkaban and Remus, for want of a better option, is getting on with his life. Sirius can only remember the worst parts of his life and Remus can only continue trying to live his, but eventually their separate threads must collide.*complete* (at last!)

** People generally don't accuse fascists of being sensible. I see no problem with magical fascists being as hypocritical, self-contradictory, and impossible to productively argue with as nonmagical ones.

** There are more than two factions.

There is the "Light", there is Voldemort, and there is the Ministry (pre-takeover).

The fact that both the Order and the Ministry are fighting Voldemort doesn't mean they agree on anything else, in the same way that Harry and Voldemort are mortal enemies despite both apparently wanting more freedoms for werewolves.

This is very good evidence that the sentiment "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" is /garbage/ (and that is a lesson very much required in many circles).

** One head canon I've seen is that the DE-aligned werewolves want to reject their humanity and embrace the wolf side. So they don't have jobs, live in packs with a low level of technology, eat only meat they've hunted themselves, stay transformed as much as possible. So from that POV laws that exclude werewolves from society are a good thing as they force others to adopt the same lifestyle.

*** Yeah, I can see Greyback wanting his pack to get bigger by taking in werewolves who've been kicked out of human society. He'd be in favor of laws that make it harder for werewolves to live as humans.
