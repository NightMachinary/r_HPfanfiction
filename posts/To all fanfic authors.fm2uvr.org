I just wanted to thank you all for your wonderful stories during these times. Many times over the past week and a half I have been near tears or in tears with everything falling apart and having to adjust my whole life. I am autistic and dont handle change well, especially when it is not expected change. Almost like clockwork though right when I need a break the most. Or just something to make me smile one of you update your stories and give me a few minutes of happiness where I can forget about the world falling apart around me. I can never think all of you enough.


** The influx of reviews during the quarantine era is crazy, I'm getting so many emails throughout the day, I can barely keep up reading them, and this is coming from a ff writer who hasn't regularly written in years.

** I don't handle change well either, I calm myself by writing and I'm glad that you've also found something that's helped you!

** Being autistic myself, I can understand the sudden change thing. My case manager and I had to have a long talk about how this crisis is going to impact me moving forward since some of the new rules mean that my case manager can only drive me around in the short bus type vehicle, whether that's for grocery shopping or therapy. Suffice to say I'm going to be doing therapy via the computer or phone and do more shopping than I usually do each time I hit the store. The one thing that's kept me sane in the past twenty-four hours is writing and reading fan fiction.

There are some /very good/ ones. I keep coming back to that list every time I've finished reading a fic.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. *Art by Freya Ishtar*
