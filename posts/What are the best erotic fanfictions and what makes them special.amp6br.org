** For me, it's the right balance between plot and smut. The number one reason to read erotica is the emotional satisfaction from seeing the characters you care for together. Else why not just watch straight-up porn, right?

So there should be some setup of the situation and tension buildup before the fun times commence - but it shouldn't take too long, because if I'm reading smut, I want my payoff sooner rather than later. Right balance, as I said.

I disagree. There's a large following of literotica that doesn't have to do with fan fiction.

Reading sexual situations is a totally different way to get off than straight up porn. For one, you can have complete fantasy elements youd never get in porn and a lot or porn is for the male gaze whereaz erotic literature is not.

**** It also allows you to give insights into the characters due to the ability to use their pov. A movie cannot convey what someone feels or tastes. It cannot get emotions or thoughts across.

On that note, does anyone know a story (not necessarily HP related), which depicts how sex feels for women? Most of the female PoV stories I found focus on how hot the guy is or use overly flowery language.

I assume original erotic fiction still takes the time to establish the characters to make the reader emotionally invested to some degree instead of jumping straight to sex the way porn does. That's the main appeal to me, anyway.

#+end_quote

This is interesting because I am the exact opposite. I read fanfiction in general for the plot and the characters and tend to avoid anything smutty or romance focused. I do not like seeing my favorite characters paired together just for sexual scenes at the end.

My erotica preferences are based almost entirely on specific kinks. I prefer short, smutty pwp chapters and mostly stop caring about the specific characters, pairings or whether it's het, slash or femslash. The quality of writing that I am willing to tolerate also drops quite a bit.

As to why not see porn instead. That's like asking why read a book when you can watch a movie instead. Both are different mediums and have their advantages and disadvantages. Erotica can allow you to focus more on your own imagination. You can imagine how some one looks like and allows you to experience things emotionally. There are so many different settings and fantasies that you can explore in writing. Porn is more visual, but also harsher, more explicit and fast paced with no room left to imagination.

It's also a lot easier to find fics with specific situations than to find a porn video with that scenario. Take BDSM for example. Erotica has such a wide variety of fics using this topic while it's difficult to find anything other than those dungeon videos for it in porn videos.

** Generally, I am fairly flexible when it comes to pairings for Harry. While I prefer Hermione, there are very few women in his age group who seem completely out of the question. Plot is the means to an end. You want to tell a story and with erotic ones, we all know where things are going.

"A boy and his cloak" for hands down best character depiction in that genre. The plot and actions feel like something which genuinely could have happened if Rowling didn't write for children.

"The Power of Seven" for an interesting take on "Ritual" magic and while not very much in character, it still manages to capture the spirit of the established ones (Hermione, Ginny and Luna) while creating interesting fillers for the blanks (Katie, Susan, Demelza). It is a harem fic and while undeniably implausible, it is one of the very few harem fics where Harry is genuinely surprised by everything that happens. He is not Harry "Big Dick" Potter who walks around looking for sex. He cares for the girls, he does not take his pleasure for granted and no one becomes just a body to fuck.

"It could only happen to Harry" is a similar premise (Sex Ritual to save his life), but the execution is a little more centred around the thin plot and a little less about the characters.

*** It could Only Happen to Harry is just hands down far and away the best one in the genre. Aside from the scenes themselves which just feel more....realistic than other examples, it focuses heavily on character interaction, and each one feels true to their book selves. It's also just genuinely well written and has some actually really entertaining dialogue at times. Chapter 3 in it's entirety is just a magnum opus. The first half (before ....stuff....happens) practically puts Nonjon to shame.

-edit-

First gold. Well that's definitely a story, hahaha.

**** The power of Seven feels a little more believable because other than Katie, the others aren't as experienced as in It could only. Don't get me wrong, it has very good scenes, quite a few better than Power of Seven, but Seven has a "slow burn" when it comes to the harem (it grows gradually) and you therefore have a more natural transition IMO. It is a little lacking in non-sexual scenes however, and I agree that you would be hard pressed to find something which beats It could only in that regard.

** Eros and Psyche is my favorite! It has multiple pairings and splits evenly between them. If I remember correctly it's Draco/Hermione, Ron/Pansy, Seamus/lavender, Theo/Daphne, Blaise/ginny and Harry/Tracy. The gist of it is that they're playing a card game in the room of requirement in their eighth year and it gets increasingly explicit but there's some condition that keeps them from backing out. There's some BDSM depending on the couple. they all have compelling characterization, none of them are terribly ooc and it's still a moderately slow burn for some of them.

The circumstances that bring about the event at every plausible, the reactions of wanting to explore everything seem really natural... it's just really awesome. The pairing is Harry/Draco, but the first fic all the scenes are fem!Harry/fem!Draco. The sequel has Harry/fem!Draco, and more of both as girls. There's an attempt at Harry/Draco and fem!Harry/Draco, but those aren't as fun. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys genderswap.

** I have a few very filthy favorites, but one of my favorite fics of all time is actually a MCU fic, Darcy/Loki, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3928408/chapters/8798995][this one]]. It's short, fun, and so, so sexy, without actual sex happening. It's just perfect. So it's not just pure wanking material, it's more than just erotic actions, it's everything.

**** Yeah of course I know, but it's a perfect example of what I consider a great erotic fanfiction, and I wish I could find one like that in the HP universe. I don't get the downvotes, but who cares. It's great fic that I absolutely recommend.
