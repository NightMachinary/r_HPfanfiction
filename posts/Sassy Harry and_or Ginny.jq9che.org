I want a long, (60k+ words) Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione fic in which either or both are sassy, playful and flirtatious as in (I think) 'taking control'. Preferably minimal bashing - particularly Dumbledore, Ron or Hermione. Thanks.

Actually if Ron or Hermione were the sassy ones that wouldn't be too bad either. But still, H/G, R/He

Romance isn't the most important thing I'm looking for though. I don't know if I phrased this well so put questions in the comments.
