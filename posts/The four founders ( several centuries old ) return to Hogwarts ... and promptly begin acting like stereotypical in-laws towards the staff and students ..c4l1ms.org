** For the first time in his life, Draco Malfoy regretted being sorted into Slytherin. The cause of his regret was currently ignoring him in favor to Potter, who was next to him. The 2 of them were exchanging hissing sound and Draco guessed they were talking in Parseltongue.

The old man finally stopped and conversation, and looked at him. '/Why can't you be more like Harry/' he said '/He managed to hide his true nature and be sorted into Gryffindor. He break rules on a daily basis whithout getting caught, and when he does get caught he manage to turn the story around to/ */Earn Points/* /for his House. He is the most Slytherin student of this school, and that's/ */without/* /his special talent'./

'/But he is cheating!'/ Said Draco, unable to contain himself. '/Dumbledore favor him/"

/'Of course he favors him'/, Slytherin looked at him as if he was complete idiot. '/Dumbledore is just following the long tradition of favoritism among Hogwart's Headmasters. Why do you think Slytherin remain undefeated for the House Cup every time a Slutherin is the Headmaster. At least Harry is favored for his personal qualities, not his House'/.

Next to him, Potter was blushing, probably embarrassed by the compliment.

'/The question is why YOU, a member of my house, is not favored by him. Do not think I do not know of you Draco Malfoy, you managed to get hated by most of the school, including the staff, and the only reason nobody strangled you in your bed is because of the power of your father! You are a weak little child who think that wielding the power of his ancestors is the same that having power. You do not have a cunning bone in your body and your only ambition seem to follow your father path and lick the feet of the damn little BASTARD my descendant spawned. If left unchecked you will cause the ruin of your house like others did for MINE!/'. Slytherin seemed to let free reign for his anger, yelling the last words of his monologue.

'/This end NOW!',/ he raised his wand, and ropes came out of it, binding Draco. '/I will not let another House fall like mine did. You will stay there and learn how to act as a damn good Slytherin even if I have to beat some cunning into you! As for you./' He looked kindly at Harry 'Y/ou may go. And even if your Sorting was a strock of genius, it pain me to see such a Slytherin wear Godric colors/'.

'/Thank you Professor/', Harry looked at him and seemed to hesitate, but ultimately walked toward the door. '/Have a good day Sir/'.

'/You too Harry, and don't hesitate to come if you have any question. My door will always be open for students like you/'. After Potter closed the door, Slytherin looked down on him, '/Now let's begin, we have a lot of work to do/'.

Hours later, Draco walked toward the Great Hall, wondering if a re Sorting was possible, Hupplepuffs could surely give him asile right?

This idea was promtly discarged when he entered into the Great Hall and saw half of the Hupplepuffs asleep from exhaustions, the few awake one silently crying while hugging each other, with Hupplepuff herself surveying the scene from the Head Table, smilling.

*** I love that Slytherin is not only disgusted by Voldemort's bastardism and bloodline, but also his actions. Hilarious.
