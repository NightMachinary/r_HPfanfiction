Just out of curiosity, why do people object to Harry being referred to as a baby dog instead of a baby goat?


** 'Kid' as a word has general and widespread usage to refer to human children in the English language, 'pup' doesn't. It's like how 'chick' can refer to human women but 'eaglet' can't.

** Is this just a pun that 'kid' is technically also a name for a young goat?

*** Genius idea!

Instead of cheating on James with Sirius or with Snape, Lily had an affair with Dumbledore! Aberfort if you don't orientation-bend Albus.
