Guys I am looking for fanfictions where Harry is detective/auror/unspeakable where he solves cases btw I already read unatoned, uprising n casebook of Harry Potter (or it was something like that where Daphne is a healer) . I prefer if no Harry/Hermione , Harry/Ginny or any slash pairing, Thanks in advance


** Thats a tough sell, since a Ministry employed Harry is almost certainly going to have canon-ish storyline and pairings (given personality). Still, I'll give it a shot:

- linkffn(Incorruptible: A Dementor's Stigma): possibly the best depiction of Harry as an auror or politician as adult, though this fic is fairly AU, deals with the apocalypse and can be a bit bittersweet.
- linkffn(The Aurors): fair warning, this has canon-pairings, though they are honestly pretty background. Its a trilogy of sorts with a different mystery case in each one. A fairly decent story, though they mystery may be a bit on the nose.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

  Yuuko said they would come. With smoke and fire. Blood and ash. She had been saying it for years. She had a friend three towns over who said they had attacked a town several days away....Gossip....But Yuuko swore it was true. But Yuuko didn't have the best track record for being correct in her wild imaginings. ...until now... ~~~ The Russian's had invaded, but they were still far away. Yuuri hadn't been concerned with them when the rumors first began. They were a nightmare, a story used to scare children. They had nothing to worry about. Hasetsu wasn't important enough to warrant a visit from the invaders. And so Yuuri's life went on. Until, of course, soldiers came marching to his door.
