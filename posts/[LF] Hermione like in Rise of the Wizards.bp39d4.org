I want a well-meaning but flawed Hermione who clashes with Harry. Like Rise of the Wizards linkffn(6254783), a blood tipped feather linkffn(3226536), Defiance linkffn(12516323), or the Mind Arts linkffn(12740667). Pairings are meaningless for this request, but no slash preferably, and no adults older than tonks.


** linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) fits your criteria, though it sounds like you want fics in which Hermione clashes with Harry /and invariably loses/.

Also, there's always linkffn(Harry Potter Becomes A Communist by HardcoreCommie).

*** I never liked Hermione in Slytherin stories. Don't get me wrong I always thought she could end up being like Grindelwald and she has a heathy dose of cunning and ambition. It's that they're invariably racist and I'm fairly sure would kill her. Mind the first story does it well.

I've seen the second but haven't really read it. Is it serious?

My sense is that young kins pre-Voldemort's return wouldn't kill her. They'd ostracise and try to bully her, but committing murder and getting away with it is not as easy as it might seem. After Voldemort returns (if her resorting doesn't derail it in the first place), it would depend on how dangerous Hermione has gotten in the prior years.

***** I agree post Voldemort resurrection they'd do it as soon as Dumbledore was kicked out of office.

I caught Professor Pepsi. It was hilarious.

I suppose I was looking where she "loses" the clash. I've seen too many super Hermione fics and I always thought she should have had named academic rivals in canon to keep her humble. She never really struck me as a genius like Voldemort, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, or even Snape. As an aside, I always thought Harry should have been superior in wanded classes as well. A teen Dumbledore would still probably lose to a moderately talented adult and thus wouldn't derail the plot.

I want to see a fic where she has to step out of the mothering capacity she shows in canon. Where when she's wrong or thought to be wrong she's challenged, like Malfoy plotting something in HBP. Where she tries to pry in Harry's personal business or find out business she's not cleared for (why did they get the prophecy/horcrux information when both were untrained for Occulumency).

I'm looking for a Hermione with the flaws that are shown in book 6, jealousy, vindictiveness, and close-mindedness clashing with a bit more independent Harry. Whether it is because she's worried for her place as his friend, jealousy of training or grades, keeping secrets, or being ignorant of the plotting in the background.

Ideally everyone would grow from the experience. Hermione and Ron never really understood what Harry went through until the 7th book and I think a taste of that, like say social isolation, would have been good for the characters. It's easier to find fics about Ron growing as a person, but Hermione, not really.

#+end_quote

How many fics like that /are/ there actually, if you exclude Slytherin in Leather Pants 'ships and stories where her "superness" just exists to facilitate Harry's even bigger "superness"?

Much as I would like to see Hermione as more competitive, I don't think just giving her rivals would do anything. On those few occasions when Harry shows her up in magic (such as the Patronus Charm or DADA in general), she doesn't resent him or work to one-up him. And, while she did resent his Potions success in HBP, I have been persuaded that that was primarily resentment of his prospering by what she perceives as cheating, not envy or competitiveness. Hermione's more likely reaction to someone else getting better marks would be to approach them to form a study group.

#+begin_quote
  She never really struck me as a genius like Voldemort, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, or even Snape.
#+end_quote

I don't think anyone disagrees about the first two (though it would be neat to see more AUs where she is), but I'd put her on about the same level of raw talent as Snape, and chalk the rest up to motivation.

Snape was an uncharismatic, working-class half-Muggle in Slytherin during Voldemort's first rise. Becoming as good as he could be at magic---including Dark Arts---and as useful as he could be at Potions---was the only way he could get any respect and even toleration. Also, there was the rivalry with the Marauders to spur him on. Can you imagine him wasting time on mastering a completely foreign legal system to defend a random animal? Campaigning for liberation of enslaved beings? Helping other people with their essays without asking for anything in return? Reading history books for fun?

Hermione put a lot of work into magic, but her ultimate goals and ambitions lay elsewhere, and she sank a lot of time---most of it off-screen---working on things that didn't facilitate her growth as a witch.

#+end_quote

Pettigrew might not have been able to subdue him in the graveyard. Sirius would have probably survived. That would already derail things.

That said, it's not as much a mater of who would beat up whom, as it is that Harry doesn't actually get into enough fights where that sort of thing matters to make a difference. If you give Harry more raw magical talent (however defined) without changing his personality, he'd find some challenges like the Triwizard easier, but he wouldn't actually do anything interesting with his newfound talents.

You may well be the first person in the fandom who both wants a more powerful Harry and doesn't resent Dumbledore from keeping secrets from him. But, there's also that Hermione can usually make much better use of that sort of information than Harry.

That's because she grew more in canon, I think. Hermione has known more social isolation than Harry (at least at Hogwarts), including much of the PoA year. (And, yes, she was right about the Firebolt, she was right about going over Harry's head, and she was probably even right about not telling him about it---because if Harry knew that the broom was about to possibly be confiscated, he might have tried to have a quick ride and gotten himself killed.) She was also a target of a media smear campaign in GoF, receiving mountains of hate mail, including some that was booby-trapped. She had grown a lot over the course of canon, becoming more empathetic and generally considerate of others.

More generally, I think that people don't appreciate how high-maintenance a friend Harry is and how much Harry takes his friends for granted.

******* Like I said it's a guilty pleasure of mine to have a talented Harry. Pettigrew was remarkably competent. He got one over Sirius, became an animagus, and brewed the potion to resurrect the dark lord.

For a Fanfiction to completely derail canon because of a more talented Harry would be nice. There's only a couple of immutable events in canon and I don't want to read a Canon rehash. Maybe having him live up to his parents for example. As good at charms as his mother, as good at transfiguration as his father, and his defense skills are all him. Maybe a fic where the appreciation of the wonder and potential of magic never really wears off.

Hermione in the half blood prince displayed a less than perfect side to Hermione, and while I didn't like the fact everyone treated Harry like Cassandra, it does deserve credit for showing a less than perfect Hermione. She attacks Ron and she confunds McLaggen (which is ridiculously screwed up). It's the jealousy she shows with Ron that makes me think she's jealous of the potions book Harry has.

While they clashed over the potions book (Harry should admittedly have looked over modifications, but using inferior instructions is stupid), Harry pretty much caves to Hermione over the DA and the horcrux search. He always felt shepherded to me, with someone always as his minder. I don't want an exaggerated independent Harry, I just want one that can stand up for himself.

I'm actually fond of a talented Harry for a couple of reasons. The symbolism would be nice, as choices define him over Voldemort. The second is that Martyr Harry left a bitter taste in my mouth.

Dumbledore keeping some things from Harry in book 5 actually make sense. The general outline of a prophecy in the department of mysteries and him being lured was just stupid. I just see Dumbledore as an overburdened old man. He can't give up control because no one suitable came, and if he could, he'd be in just one job.

I don't want a Harry literally dependent on Hermione for exposition. I want growing pains with the friendship. Self-reflection.

Let's give a synopsis of an imaginary fic. Harry and other people start growing into their potential. Hermione, stressed from schoolwork, starts snapping at people. Her ranking slips a little and Ron has a new girlfriend. She starts hurtful arguments with her friends and does something morally questionable (whether she's caught or not doesn't matter). Harry starts having meetings with Dumbledore. Dumbledore is trying to make up for past years, and while Harry is protected from Voldemort snooping because of Love™ and basic Occulumency, Hermione and Ron both are still untrained in the mind arts and are kept ignorant. Sensing a mystery, Hermione interrogates Harry. While he would be glad to tell her usually, he did promise Dumbledore not to until they learn, and with Hermione the way she is, he cannot recommend it at this time. Hurtful comments are thrown; a friendship is temporarily broken a la Goblet of Fire. Harry is still doing well, he misses her, but life goes on. Hermione gets more withdrawn and has to swallow her pride and apologize. The years problem gets solved through the trio working like the first two books. Where the trio each has a role.

I disagree about Hermione being more socially isolated. Harry had a judgmental cul-de-sac with the Dursleys badmouthing him to everyone. As seen when he goes off to Hogwarts, he had no one. Hermione being a slight social outcast makes sense, but to the level of canon Harry, no.

Harry in my opinion is a bit less high maintenance than you think. I mean he's a very stressful friend to have, with all the situations he gets into, but as a friend, he just needs companionship.

As an aside, I think Hermione is a good friend to Harry. Harry and Hermione have no romantic attraction to each other, but the sheer loyalty inspires a fanbase (although it /could/ have gone that way) I just don't think the dynamic is entirely good for either character. As a character she could be so much more than walking exposition.

Well, that's fanfic... I was wondering how you thought making Harry more talented would have improved canon, which I thought was your original point.

#+end_quote

Hermione has been displaying a wide variety of flaws since the start of the books; envying other people's academic success was never one. Romantic jealousy and academic envy are only superficially related, and, in fact, Harry had offered to share the HBP book, so she had an opportunity to eliminate the source of envy. She could have had the same unfair advantage as Harry, but she /chose/ not to.

#+begin_quote
  While they clashed over the potions book (Harry should admittedly have looked over modifications, but using inferior instructions is stupid),
#+end_quote

Harry was being reckless. He was not qualified to assess the modifications and too drunk on praise to do the smart thing and show the book to Slughorn (who might have recognised Snape's style, short-circuiting that mystery). He was lucky that Snape didn't omit any critical details from his Potions notes the way he had from his spell descriptions.

By the way, notice Hermione's evolution: in PoA, she would have told a teacher about the book like she had about the Firebolt, but in HBP, she chose friendship over caution and just let Harry do what he wanted even if she wanted no part in it.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I wouldn't call helping his friends become better at defending themselves, while being admired for something he actually does feel he deserves, "caving", and on the horcrux search, Hermione was the only one who actually made any preparations or had made any plans. Now, when Harry wanted something, he had no trouble standing up for himself. In fact, given how OotP ended, it would have been better if Hermione were better at standing up to Harry.

#+begin_quote

  Let's give a synopsis of an imaginary fic. Harry and other people start growing into their potential. [SNIP]
#+end_quote

That sounds like Harry growing into his potential while "other people" stagnate before accepting the new Harry's superiority and supremacy. In particular, * Hermione having romantic problems is one thing, but her losing out academically (without a cheat like HBP's book) comes out of nowhere and sounds like just bashing and degrading a character to put her in her place. * What are those amazing, deep secrets that only Dumbledore can teach Harry? In the end, there's very little that he didn't in canon that would actually be useful, and most of those weren't particularly secret. For general magic, including combat, it would be like a Oxford professor of mathematics teaching basic algebra: it can be done, but it's probably not the best use of his time. * Further to the above, at the end of canon, Hermione was the one who actually read up on how to make a horcrux. Harry neither needed nor wanted the knowledge. * Harry's mind is particularly vulnerable because he has a link to Voldemort. Ron and Hermione don't have such a link, so Occlumency isn't nearly as important to them. * Speaking of that, here's another example of how you're really only growing Harry while stagnating the others: if becoming an Occlumens were something she needed to do to be in on the plan, she'd actually try to find a way. You could have, for example, had Hermione go to Dumbledore to ask for Occlumency training. She would probably get fobbed off on Snape, but, unlike Harry, she could put up with whatever insults and exercises Snape throws at her, and actually learn the complete version---rather than Harry's improvised one that only works against Voldemort---and learn about other mind arts. But only Harry is allowed to be extraordinary, apparently. * Between Hermione being useless without Harry while Harry being perfectly happy, it sounds like you don't want Harry to have friends; you want him to have subordinates to order around.

The trouble is that canon universe is built to revolve around Harry and that we only get his perspective without any idea what Hermione is up to when she doesn't know anything. Take away the prophecy and the destiny and the brother wands, and Harry (short of a near-complete personality rewrite) is a far less interesting character than either Hermione or Ron.

Some fic writers (like Stafox5) do a good job with ensemble casts, which also works.

********* I admit I forgot that he offered the book. Fanfiction is clouding my judgment immensely. I'm actually getting some things from fics I read mixed up with Prisoner of Azkaban and Half-Blood Prince. I'm probably due for a canon reread.

​

I repeat, I really don't want Hermione bashing. I mean a couple of those stories do have some, but I mean I do honestly want a fic where there is a well-meaning flawed Hermione and Harry clash over a topic that isn't a potions book or a broom. They're both stubborn characters in canon and I would love a difference of opinion between them. Heck, have Harry be wrong too. It'd be kind of neat to have both learn compromise.

​

Ensemble casts are great. There's actually quite a few characters that are neglected in canon. I mean Ron never really showcases much after book 1 (his loyalty to Harry in book 5 makes me think book 7s abandonment was extremely contrived). Hermione strikes me as the type to require planning, while Harry is spur of the moment. Things like solving the chamber of secrets (Hermione found the monster and the method of movement, Harry and Ron discovered the location and dealt with it) strike me as the best sort of teamwork in the books. I just want a Harry that continues that a bit.

​

They are in a school of magic with facilities that are so awesome. The Room of Requirement is literally the perfect training room, and pretty much gets abandoned after book 5 by Harry. Neville, who apparently isn't a moron, uses it. The library contains enough information to jump start the career of a rising dark lord. And pretty much none of it matters. No one really does anything with it. The world immersion would be amazing if this brought in. Handwaving research away is probably necessary for readability, but the topics you can get into would be broad.

You misunderstood what I was playing at! I get why no one would like that. I was thinking more of marking him as his equal line. I don't want a Harry equal to a revived Voldemort in skill and power (seventh horcrux is the only exception because it is hilarious). It's a literal Gary Stu situation. But I feel it can lead to more interesting situations. An example, maybe Harry decides to attend dueling tournaments abroad. Starts gathering friends and contacts abroad... It sounds familiar. That'd be the type of fic I'd like. Heck, bringing Ron and Hermione along too would be cool as well. I'd love to see Ron immerse himself into Muggle culture, maybe chess tournaments and other things, as well as Hermione just meeting other people with different perspectives. A Harry that leaves the Dursleys for the Weasleys only makes for a boring story for me. You would think after all the Dursleys did to strive to be normal, he'd go against that.

​

Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution is great and easily one of my favorite fics of all time. Starfox5 does a great ensemble cast and keeps good track of them, and his OCs are on point. I've got a couple of minor issues with his fics. His Hermione does occasionally come across as a bit arrogant when thinking to herself and the muggle combination does lessen the mystique of magic. I've got most of them favorited for unique ideas in fanfiction. Seventh Horcrux is another fic where I love the characters. Everyone learns something, I mean except for Harrymort.

​

I've been a bit harsh on Hermione, but I think it's just a bit of backlash from reading so many Mary-sue Hermione fics recently. Hermione in canon needed to learn a bit of tact before I believe she's ready to lead. She was right about the house-elves (replace Dobby with Uncle Tom in canon and you get an extremely disturbing few pages in Goblet of fire and chamber of secrets). But SPEW was a terrible way to go about change. It comes across as slightly... preachy I suppose. She has leadership potential in a non-crisis, like the ministry. But she definitely needed to learn about people first.

​

Honestly, if Starfox5 wrote a Harry centric fic I would follow that thing religiously.

In HBP, Harry finds the regular DADA class challenging enough, especially since Snape is actually a good teacher that pushes the students. Remember his struggles with nonverbal casting. Would going off to RoR to cast curses at dummies have helped him that much?

More generally, it's perfectly rational for Harry not to spend more time training. There is no amount of studying that can overcome the massive difference in raw talent, the many decades' head start, and the general ruthlessness that Voldemort has over Harry in magical fighting. In a pitched battle and without prophecy-related factors, an untrained Harry lasts 10 seconds against Voldemort, then dies; and trained!Harry lasts 15 seconds, then dies. Training Harry as a strategy is futile.

Meanwhile, extra combat training for Harry would come at the expense of Quiddich, hanging out with friends, going on dates, and all the other things that cultivate the Power that [Voldemort] Knows Not, as opposed to those powers that Voldemort knows all too well.

By the way, you're doing that thing again: only Harry gets any agency or gets to do something involving powerful magic and his friends just get dragged along and do things that they don't even need magic for.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU. Powerful!

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
