During the Chamber of Secrets events Harry takes deeper offense to all the adults responsible for the administration of the school and the government that were so willing to let Hagrid take the fall while barely doing anything at all to help solve the problem (at least from his point of view, no bashing please). But instead of going the usual Indy!Harry rote of inheriting a fuck ton of random god ex machines, money, political positions... he instead goes the extremely reasonable path of running for minister of magic... as a twelve years old with virtually no knowledge of how the government works... an /winning/.

This would happen by a combination of factors, first the laws of magical Britain don't have any minimum requirements about age or competence one needs to have to be elected (not a /'wyzzards ale doolmb'/ moment, the idea of a child running for office was just too outlandish to consider, to say nothing of one having chances of winning);

Second, Harry would need to have listened and learned from Lockhart's lessons on public image management and the lessons had to be /good/, like, actually teaching him what to do to get the public in his side despite all evidence pointing to it being the losing side.

Third, the chamber of secrets clusterfuck needs to have a /far/ greater reach. With the public knowing that Harry at the tender age of twelve fought valiantly a Basilisk as old as Hogwarts to save the life of their children his fame would skyrocket beyond compare, any doubts about him being old enough to lead a nation would be quashed by it for the general public while the smart ones to say those are completely different sets of skills would go ignored or jump in Harry's boat looking for power.

By consequence of 3 both Lucius Malfoy and Fudge should fall /hard/, one gave a little girl a dark artifact that possessed her setting loose a mass killing beast on a school while the other decided to send an innocent man to jail instead of conducting an actual investigation, if it goes public the right way both are looking for at least public ridicule, at worst to being publicly mobbed and killed. Dumbledore probably would feel some fire too (which would prevent him from trying to stop Harry campaign if he ever wanted to -I personally think having a third-year minister would be /exactly/ the kind of thing he would approve just for the laughs), but nothing too extreme since he could argue that he did his best to solve the problem while administrating a school and holding two political offices.

With his popularity high from the chamber, the dark families going along because of the pipe dream of him being a dark wizard and both Fudge and Lucius dragged in the mud Harry should conceivably be able to win the election.

Once he is elected though he should continue to be a (barely) thirteen years old with no understanding whatsoever of politics or even the administration of the government, leading to scenarios like the abolition of the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery, sending the Dursley's to Azkaban, nominating the Weasley's twins to the Wizengamont, bugging the DoM to give the general public cool and dangerous stuff (like time turners), starting international crisis left, right, center, up, down, behind... eventually he should let the power get to his head to the point that when Voldemort /does/ come back he should immediately and eagerly take the most unreasonable decision of how to go about hunting him from the get-go, like for example impiriusing the muggle government into dropping a nuke at Malfoy mansion because of a hunch just to later find out that Voldemort wasn't even there.


** I like this idea a whole lot. I could easily see Harry deciding to become Minister to fix all the problems. I'd also love to see people worshipping the ground Harry walks after a picture of the basilisk he killed ends up in the daily prophet. I could just imagine all the Chuck Norris type jokes the Wizarding world would be making about Harry: “Harry Potter looked a Basilisk in the eyes and IT died” or “Harry Potter once let a Basilisk bite him just so he could establish dominance over it”

You ended up losing me at the end though, I was on board all the way until Harry started acting less like a kid and more like an evil Bond villain. I imagine the idea of enslaving a bunch of people with the imperious would draw bad parallels to his own childhood that would put him off the idea.

I'm also just gonna assume you were joking with the nuke as that would instantly out the Wizarding world, potentially kill millions of people as the radioactive winds travel the British isles, and would definitely make Harry one of if not the most destructive dark lord in all of history, potentially combined. Assuming no other government got trigger happy with a nuke going off on the British isles and decided to start world war 3 with a nuclear holocaust, the entire point of the endeavor would likely fail with Voldemort sticking around due to his horcruxes.

*** Thanks, glad you liked it (or at least the beginning), about Harry acting like a villain... I honestly think of it more like a little kid with zero knowledge about politics or governance being handed the most powerful political office in a government. Harry /has/ good intentions, he won't steal and isn't in it for the power-trip, but he also has no idea of what he is doing and his solutions to problems is what you would expect of an actual child.

“Time Turners are cool! I will just give people a bunch of them.”

“The law of underage sorcery is dumb! I think I will repel it! ok kiddos, go crazy! ;)”

“Wow, the Dursley's were really major assholes through my life, I still remember they locking me up for days with little food in a cupboard last summer... Ok, payback time! I will just stuff them in this prison I never went to with half the food given to the other prisoners! This will teach them a lesson”

“Wow, Merlin's balls, the Wizengamont is staffed with old mummies who insist on talking nonstop about caldron bottom thickness in some indecipherable dialect... I know! I will put the Weasley twins there! Yup, this will live things up in no time”

“What do you mean the (insert random country here) minister insulted me on their newspaper! Ok, answer it by taxing everything they send us to hell and back! Let's see how they like it”

“Oh no, Voldemort is back! I need to deal with it quickly... right, I know! I will just blow him up! Muggles have big bombs right? I think I can kind of remember listening about it when I was eight... nucles or something, I will just ask them to fire it at Voldemort! (...) What do you mean they don't want to! Just like my relatives, they don't care who dies if it isn't one of them, well, I won't stand for that! /Make/ them fire the bombs at a Voldemort, don't wanna know nor care how, but get it done now! (...) Huh, they can't fire at a specific person and need a place? Eh, tell them to target Malfoy manor, Malfoy was a Death Eater, so Voldemort must be there, if he isn't then we try another place, maybe London...”

... Truth be told, even /this/ was kind of above what I would expect from an average 13 YO in terms of maturity, to say nothing about one with almost no knowledge about the muggle world and even less about the magical one, and the less said about his possible response and repercussions to the abuse the better.

EDIT: Oh, and yeah, the nuke thing would totally fail, but Harry can't know that because he has no idea what Horcruxes even are, let alone that Voldemort may have made them... but on the slightly less terrible side the Armageddon would probably both disincorporate Voldemort and kill all followers who could do the ritual, rendering him a powerless wraith floating around in a hellish lifeless desert for all eternity, so... half of the goal accomplished I guess? Plus my HC is that nukes actually wouldn't be that useful against magicals (they certainly do things more impossible than protecting against an explosion) with the problems actually coming from the fallout and nuclear winter, so Voldemort and Harry may both just survive it outright even without Horcruxes.

** Well, I'd like to believe that he would not use Unfirgivables or grab at nukes even when power tripping, but being barely competent sounds just about right.

That said, since the premise includes some serious PR training, by Wizarding Houdini, and a big charisma boost... Harry would have a lot of people helping him where they would hinder a normal politician. So my preferred end result would be adults resolving most issues while reacting to his bumbling. And at the end, they are disillusioned, and say he was a bad Minister, and he just twinkles at them and lists all the problems solved, issues led to an agreeable conclusion, alliances secured... Jawdrops all around.

** I don't think he'd be /that/ bad. He's a kid, sure, but he's basically wired for flying by the seat of his pants. Knowing his rather ridiculous luck, he'd end up stumbling into a situation that he (or in this case, his administration) should /not/ survive, nearly tripping over a completely unlikely Deus ex machina, and somehow come out of it smelling like the proverbial political roses.

** First prerequisite could come about due to simple oversight (real legal codes tend to have a lot of stuff that is just assumed/dependent on people respecting political norms).

Two and three come about as part of Harry's change in mindset- Harry himself would publicize what happened as widely as possible as a reason for running for Minister, and a way to discredit his opponents.

The big question is what would motivate Harry to do that in the first place. Its very much not his character to even think of running for Minister. Someone else, I think, would need to suggest it to him. Say:

​

"I can't believe Lucius gave our sister a diary full of You Know Who's memories", Ron growled.

"Well, at least Harry was there to save the day", said George.

"Yeah, its not like the Minister was going to do anything", Fred muttered.

"If only Harry would run for Minister", George said.

"Don't be silly, Hermione replied. "A 12 year old can't be Minister for Magic!"

"Actually there's no law against it", Fred said.

"We looked it up a couple years ago", George supplied to her incredulous look. "We thought it would be a great prank if we both ran, but Dad stopped us."

"This would be even better though", said Fred. "Why, Harry, you might actually win."

George grinned.

"That would be /wicked/."

​

Or maybe...

​

"Dobby is free!" The little elf practically danced for joy. "Harry Potter is being an even greater wizard than Dobby believed."

Harry shrugged uncomfortably.

"It was the least I could do, Dobby."

"Harry Potter is too modest! Harry Potter is a much better wizard than Master Lucius-" he seemed to twitch, and Harry readied himself to grab the elf and stop him from punishing himself, but Dobby recovered a moment later. "or Mister Fudge." Dobby's eyes grew huge as something seemed to occur to him. "Harry Potter would not let dark wizards leave dangerous diaries in young witches' school books! He would treat us elves with respect! Harry Potter would be a great Minister!"

​

Anyway, I'd read it, as long as it strayed clear of Dumbledore bashing and other such offensive things, and didn't have Harry completely lose his moral compass.

Inexperienced over his head Harry can be mined for comedy, tragedy, or both. Evil Harry doesn't really engage my interest. His biggest mistakes would probably be stuff like hiring friends/people he trusts for top posts regardless of qualifications, stepping on the toes of career politicos already pissed that they're taking orders from a thirteen year old boy, or trying to solve everybody's problems at once without taking into account the Ministry's budget or the hundreds of regulations he's trampling on because he isn't aware of them.

I don't think he'd send the Dursleys to Azkaban either- canon Harry just isn't vindictive enough a person for that, especially since in this position they have no power over him any more whatsoever, and he has no need to even be in the same county as them unless he wants to.

Heh, the scene where Dumbledore tries to explain to Minister Harry why he needs to keep living with the Dursleys could be funny. As long as its not bashy. Hmm...

​

Dumbledore gazed at Harry solemnly through his half-moon glasses.

"I'm afraid, Harry, that it is imperative that you return to the Dursleys this summer, at least for a few weeks. Certain steps can be taken, such as connecting the house to the flu network, to allow you to continue the business of government."

Harry snorted. /I Bet the Dursleys would love that./ It would almost be worth it to see Vernon's coronary... but he still couldn't really see the point.

"But why? You've never told me. I get that I needed to stay somewhere when I was just a kid, but I'm the Minister now. I have my own office and everything." He gestured at the room around them.

Dumbledore sighed.

"I am afraid it has to do with the reasons you survived Lord Voldemort's attack as an infant. Specifically, the protection given you by your mother's sacrifice. You see, as long as you live with your mother's blood kin, that protection remains, and neither Voldemort nor his followers can touch or harm you. Now, more than ever, it is paramount that we protect your safety, especially given your new... position."

Harry blinked. Whatever he'd been expecting, it hadn't been that.

"But... I have bodyguards now."

"And would they avail you, if Voldemort came for you himself, restored to his body and his full power? Perhaps they could buy you a few moments with their lives, moments for you to run. Could you do that, Harry? Could you run and leave them to die so that you could live?"

Harry swallowed. No, he didn't think he could do that.

"But there must be defensive enchantments that could be used... Hermione told me that the Ministry is covered in protective enchantments. Madam Bones too."

"Of course. But no enchantment is infallible. Especially if one's enemies have inside information. I am afraid, Harry, that not every Auror can be trusted. Many of them were appointed by Cornelius Fudge, and while some may be good men and women, many share Lucius Malfoy's views. It is even possible that some might be servants of Voldemort."

Harry glanced around his office, suddenly uneasy.

"So I'll fire them. I'm not going back to the Dursleys. Its already hard enough to get anyone to take me seriously as Minister. I can't run the government from my Uncle's spare bedroom."

Dumbledore sighed, realizing that Harry would not be swayed.

"Very well. I will see what I can do to strengthen the Ministry's protective enchantments. I only hope that you will not come to regret this decision."

Harry would have cause to remember this conversation when Auror Dawlish took down the protective enchantments around his office, allowing a dozen Death Eaters to apparate into his office.
