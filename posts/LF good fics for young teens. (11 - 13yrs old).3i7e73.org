My cousin is starting to get into fanfics. She loved the Dangerverse and Hogwarts houses divided. Looking for similar types of fics for her.


** Ignore [[/u/HollowBetrayer][u/HollowBetrayer]], who deserves no cookies and possibly a time-out.

The obvious next stories for your cousin are the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity]], who also wrote Hogwarts Houses Divided.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

  Vernon dies in a car crash when Harry's two years old. Without his influence, Harry's life is quite different - especially as Petunia decides to follow the advice her father gave her long ago. This is not what Albus Dumbledore had in mind when he placed Harry Potter with his Aunt!

      Many thanks for my beta MuggleBeta, who did an awesome job cleaning this up for posting\!This fic was posted at Rough Trade in its raw form under the working title Different Beginning\.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.
