:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was looking for a Harry/Tonks fic which I remember in response to another request on here. I found a reference on DLP scryer, but that link fails because it looks like the author was a plagiarist.

The fic is Nymphadora Back in Time.

During the Battle in the Department of Mysteries Nymphadora Tonks finds herself thrown back to the beginning of Fifth Year. With two Tonks walking around and her faith in Dumbledore eroded what's a Metamorphmagus to do?

Anyone recognise this and know where the original is?

  During the Battle in the Department of Mysteries Nymphadora Tonks finds herself thrown back to the beginning of Fifth Year. With two Tonks walking around and her faith in Dumbledore eroded what's a Metamorphmagus to do? Protect Harry Potter at all costs, that's what! Tonks ends up crafting a new identity for herself and infiltrates Hogwarts to fix the future. Pairing: Harry/Tonks.
