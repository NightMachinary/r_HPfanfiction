** There are some minor grammatical problems/misused words, but overall I think this is great. It's quite dramatic, so much so as to feel OOC for canon Harry in my opinion, but there's stuff like this

#+begin_quote
  Harry was tired of it all. Tired of looking strong infront of people that counted on him. Tired of turning the other cheek. Tired of rising up every time he got knocked down.
#+end_quote

and this

#+begin_quote
  He would get to meet his parents for the first time since he was robbed of them. His parents and the rest of his family. The people that would care for him no matter what. People that would see him and say "it's alright". Or would they be angry with him for giving up? For taking the easy way out? For being a coward?
#+end_quote

Those thoughts felt to me like you nailed Harry's character if he'd had his despair turned up to eleven, very impactful. But finding himself a private place to cry feels a bit overboard, unless there was some inciting incident like Sirius's death that had happened recently.

That said, I enjoyed it. Nice job!

*** Thanks for the input man! English isn't my native language so it's bound to be some errors, even more so considering this is basically the first draft. Could you point out the ones you thought of, if it isn't too much too ask? :) This part taken out of context does seem very dramatic and a bit overboard as you say, I get that haha.. It's pretty far into the story at this point and I personally feel it's a pretty natural build up to this point, considering he's around 14 at the time and have multiple issues he hasn't dealt with at all from a very young age. Hopefully I'll finish it up and can share it with people soon. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on it, means a lot :)

**** Sure thing! I'll do a quick markup for you in a few minutes, but I'm no professional---take my thoughts with a grain of salt.

Canon Harry's mental resilience is a defining character trait, so that's why I feel the emotional stuff is a tad too strong, but then again I have no idea how much worse off he is in your story. If you're going for your own version of Harry that is of course perfectly fine as well.

** There is a lot of purple prose, and I feel like I'm reading a fic where Harry wears guyliner and organizes poetry readings in the shrieking shack. Honestly, if you open with this amount of suicidal ideation I want to either see Harry follow through and impale himself with a basilisk fang through the heart or have him committed to st.mungos for his own safety assuming he has anyone in this fic who actually cares. If there's a suicide hotline for young people in the magical world he should drop them an owl.

That being said, there is a market audience for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, so I'm sure you'll get reviews and or kudos for it.

*** I get what you're saying. This part is pretty deep into the story, around the time Harry is 14. My take on it is that Harry has been abused in different forms since he was taken in by the Dursleys. Not the all out abuse some fics have, more along the canon version. But the way Rowling handled him coming in to the wizarding world doesn't sit right with me. Surely an 11 year old starved on attention and love would be rather hesitant to trust people and have some pretty solid barriers put up around his mind and heart. Just straight up trusting the people he meets in the wizarding world from the get go doesn't seem realistic to me. This is one of the few times he gets away and lets some pressure out of him, not the way he always is. He's not seriously contemplating suicide, it's more along the lines that he's just tired of it all and in a really depressed state of mind in this moment. I realize how it could be taken the way you've taken it, and I'm grateful you took the time to give me your thoughts on it, cheers :)

** I'll try to preserve your wording without injecting too much of my editing.

#+begin_quote
  Harry stood +untop of+ *atop* the astronomy tower and gazed +unto+ *up at* the night sky high above. +His view undiminished by the clarity of the moment.+ He felt +so+ insignificant right there and then. No troubles or worries could measure up to the vastness of the skies above. It was hauntingly beautiful(*,*) and in a moment of realization Harry understood that he truly was nothing compared to the powers at work in the universe.
#+end_quote

Untop isn't a word to my knowledge, unto is an archaic way to say 'to', so I guess "gazed to/unto the sky" is technically valid, but I would change it. Crossed out a sentence that didn't make sense to me as well as an unnecessary word, added a comma to break up a long sentence. (Long sentences can be good sometimes, when you want a scene to feel fast-paced/breathless, but I think it reads better with a pause there.)

#+begin_quote
  Harry was no stranger to the feeling of being nothing, to not matter*ing* to anyone or anything. His heart ached for the love of a family. To feel the embrace of a mother. To +feel+ *see* the proud look in his father(*'*)s eyes.

  The *night sky* became blurry as Harry's thoughts drifted into territory that left his eyes prickling with unshed tears. Slowly he slumped to the floor of the tower *and sat* +on his knees+ with his arms limp +on+ *at* his sides he cried. There was no point in holding back the tears now. No one to show strength for. The people inside the castle *were* long ago asleep, unaware of the troubles of their saviour.

  He couldn't begin to +phatom+ *fathom* how people expected him to be their saviour. Didn't they see that he was broken? Couldn't they tell that all he wanted was someone to see him(*?*)

  Someone to shield him from the terrifying storm that +is+ *was* life.

  Harry was tired of it all. Tired of looking strong *in front* of people that counted on him.

  It was his greatest shame *to* know that he was +week+ *weak*. He wasn't the saviour they all thought +of him+ *he was*. Surely they would all abandon him if they knew the +weekness+ *weakness* of his heart?
#+end_quote

Week = seven days, weak = not strong

#+begin_quote
  He opened his eyes and saw the grounds stretching out *in front* of the tower.

  For taking the easy way out(*?*)

  Harry suddenly rose from the floor of the astronomy tower. He steeled +his look+ *himself* and wiped away the tear tracks on his cheeks.

  It was his moment of +realese+ *release*, fleeting +and short+ as it may be.
#+end_quote

Redundancy and a misspelling

#+begin_quote
  He turned around and left himself behind. He took the spiraling stairs down +from+ the +astronomy+ tower as Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived. Left on top +of the astronomy tower+ was Harry, The Boy Who Loathed Living.
#+end_quote

Once we know what/where something is, there's no need to keep reminding us.

Like I said, minor grammatical nitpicks. I hope some of this helps you.
