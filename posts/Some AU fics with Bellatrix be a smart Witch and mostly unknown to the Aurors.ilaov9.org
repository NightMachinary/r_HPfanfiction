I imagined that Bellatrix is smarter and less insane here...well, she can still have her Canon insanity, but doesnt show it as clearly. What matters is that she is eager to hide her identity, so that not much known is about her activity.

But because of the latest Happenings, Harry (and possibly other Aurors) are Ordered to check and investigate.

Bellatrix would try to stop and manipulate the investigations, even going so far as seduce Harry and get intim with him just to get closer to the work.

Harry also would get attracted to her, or atleast find her fascinating.

I leave it to the Fic, if Bellatrix manage it, to erase the traces or if she gets arrested.

I would accept similar fics, with other characters than Bellatrix, but this scenario with her is my imagination to insert her as a smart witch with a crime story that wouldnt stop by seducing and sleep with an Agent, just to reach her Goal.
