So, a recent conversation with someone and a memory of an older conversation about sudden Religiosity in fics (and a reread of my two favourite Harry Potter with Gods-from-other-Fandoms fics: Harry Potter, Squatter, and The Confectionary Chronicles [Links Below]) got me thinking. Have there been any Harry Potter fics covering Religion, Deities, Faith, or Spirituality (including Philosophies like Taoism) that does them well? Where those things fit the internal logic (verisimilitude) of the fic's plot and/or setting and aren't just crowbarred in for whatever writer-induced reason? Whether it's a character getting adopted by a Deity or a character learning Asian Philosophy as a side dish to their obsession with Martial Arts, there's a lot of variety and a lot of potential in some of that stuff, so I'm curious if there are any people have liked.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

Harry Potter, Squatter - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13274956/1/Harry-Potter-Squatter]]

Confectionary Chronicles [TW for very stark discussions of suicide and bullying, though the fic does get lighter as the mental health aspects are worked through/past] - [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/968343]]

** linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) has Harry striking a deal with a fallen angel as the core plot. The fic is quite centered around the Christian God, although from a rather negative perspective as Harry's views are moulded by an angel that God personally banished from Heaven.

***** Daoist is the romanised version so, assuming your translation is European, that makes sense from a linguistics standpoint. Not sure why they'd list it as Dao de Jing, given that's a book title, not the philosophy, but assuming the translation originated sometime in the Imperialist Europe period, it'd make sense. We weren't the most... culturally sensitive people, at the time. :D

*** Huh. That's quite interesting. I've seen the obvious hyper-Christians integrated into HP (everything from "homosexuality causes Squibs" to "we're all secretly Catholics!"), but never anything from the Jewish faith. Especially interesting, given Jewish views on magic being quite situationally complex and Christianity's views on Jewish magic commonly causing tension and rising to persecution.

Thanks for the rec!

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

Magic gets revealed to muggles and obviously religious extremists clash with it. Al-Qaida and Westboro Christians somehow manage to join forces to attack wizards by crashing plane. A ghost so old he sees Jesus as a relatively recent event becomes a public figure and struggles with the concept of three different Abrahamistic religions. Voldemort gives Al-Qaida nukes. Atlantean documents reveal that Noah's flood was apparently the result of an asteroid impact in the ocean causing a tsunami, and middle eastern wizards did a massive project to build several giant boats. Judgement Day comes and goes. The cult of the Black God causes some trouble too.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

If you can accept that Severus Snape is Catholic, this fic is awesome, though I am not sure how accurate it actually portraits the faith and how much of it is possible when it's a magical version of the faith. Like for example, confession is really confidential as a priest is physically unable to share what was said.

*** I mean, he definitely fits the slightly embittered, self-flagellating perspective of some Catholics I know, so I can go with that. Interesting idea, that magic is integrated into things. And to be fair, accuracy is hard in Christianity, what with there being 10,000 denominations and each of them being made up of a spectrum of believers only leads to more distinction within each one proper.
