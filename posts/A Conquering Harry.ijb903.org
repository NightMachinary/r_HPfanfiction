Just an idea that wouldn't go away recently. Does anyone know of a story where Harry seeks to take control. Either of magical Britain or much more. This probably falls under evil Harry but it doesn't have to be. If anyone has anything good it's be very appreciated.

**** Depends on what you're looking for.

It isn't /really/ a Harry Potter fanfic, as several characters diverge significantly from their canon personalities and arcs, with many OCs taking up quite a bit of screentime. Plus, while it nominally uses the canon magic system, it doesn't stick very strictly to it.

That said, I adore the story and would jump in joy if another update dropped. I like the warfare, the nation-building, and the intrigue it contains, as well as some of the things the story does with magic.

If any of what I mentioned above makes you roll your eyes or groan, you might not enjoy it very much, but if you thought it sounded somewhat interesting, then I would definitely recommend checking it out.

Like I get a polyamorous relationship but having 3 wives who are just fine with it while only he is allowed to sleep with each from the implications is kind of...

Also he wanted to take infant muggleborns from muggles regardless of personality, obliviate them and then have the muggleborns adopted and blood-adopted. And Wizengamot just... Voted for the bill without a single vote against it with Harry just saying a few pretty words.

Like yeah his speech seemed pretty good if it wasn't advocating for what it was advocating for but there is no way this would happen unless he mass-Imperioed them all.

I do like well-written Dark Harry fics, and do not at all mind ridiculous ancestries with 80 lordships and 590 centillion galleons, but they have to be well-written at least to some degree and not just outright ridiculous right from the first chapter.

It just reminds me of the fics I tried writing when I was 14 but worse. Way worse and that's something to behold.

Although I do have to give credit for good writing quality when it comes to vocabulary and grammar at least.

If it was at least "harem but all my boyfriends and/or girlfriends also do each other because it's a polyamorous relationship and not a literal harem," then it would at least be something fresh and sort of realistic (unless the relationship is between all the members of Hogwarts from 5th year up that always grows the second a new batch of students become 5th year students who start doing the do with each other and 6th years, then become full members in adulthood and screw what has by then become literally half of the wizarding Britain, alongside a few thousand foreign students who decided to join in)

#+end_quote

Yeah, that does sound like the cringiest shit I've ever heard as well.

I think I have read a part of Harry Crow, but dropped it for the sheer ridiculousness of the entire thing, including the part where he starts dating Hermione when they're 11, still children, and where he attacks and threatens Hermione and then she still likes him after and everything is fine.

Which it really is not.

I agree harem really sucks though.

I remember once reading a Fanfiction named Core Strings, IIRC, where it started out amazing.

Harry, who was really young, one day got a broken bone and suddenly, a green light appeared, and he learned to control it properly and discovered it to be magic, so he just cultivated it until he had thick green ropes if magic bending to his will.

He literally remade his entire body with magic, which was a bit much but fine and something new, and made his own mindscape where he discovered the Horcrux, destroyed it and absorbed all the memories and abilities.

There was a funny sort of Occlumency where he made thoughts into small ducks with vampire teeth that would guard his mind.

He even gave his aunt weak magic because he unwound her strings.

The Dursleys became better because the Horcrux had been influencing them and didn't hurt him anymore.

He got a wand, but he chose it as his string control made him able to connect with any wand perfectly.

Then he met girls on the Hogwarts Express.

It went downhill real fast.

So he helped them connect with their wands perfectly but of course it apparently felt like he was trailing kisses down their arms, at 11.

When he went to connect Neville's wand it apparently felt "wrong" but he connected the wand if every girl he could find, and apparently it felt like kisses way because of mutual attraction.

At 11.

It also felt extra intense to those he did it to later because he knew them longer and at 11, I cannot stress this enough, he held romantic intentions towards them.

And /all/ of them liked him back.

What. The. Fuck.

******* Okay, so. Reading the terrible prequel and judging this fic on that is... not exactly fair. The prequel is /awful/. The fic itself... is not. Think of the prequel more as a chapter that was cut from the actual story because it didn't fit the tone of the rest of it. At least that's what it seems like to me.

I just finished this story aaaand... the 3 ancestry thing was mentioned once, in the prequel as a way to piss off and distract Hermione (these laws are outdated, gotta get them scrapped!) It was never talked about again, and isn't in the actual fic. Does he eventually get married to three women? Yes. About three quarters of the way into the fic. Why? Politics for Gabrielle (her father is the French minister - marry my daughter and I'll do this thing you want) and Ginny is included because she's in a relationship with Gabby. Again: the ancestry thing was there to tweak Hermione's nose and to distract her lol. It's an obscure and mostly forgotten law that nobody gives a crap about or takes advantage of. And Harry doesn't even want to marry them, but alliances and politics and blah blah blah.

As far as Dark!Harry goes... it does a decent job of explaining it, and a lot of his attitude comes from misunderstandings with Dumbledore. His disdain for Muggles also develops in a mostly reasonable way, and he's... not okay with what he had done after going along with one of the muggleborn kid captures. Accepting, yes. Comfortable with it? No. He still has a moral compass, even if its a little skewed. Speaking of that law... spoiler: Nobody bitched because well, blackmail. Among other politicking things.

Dumbledore is also surprisingly bash-free - he's played as not that effectual, yes, and Harry loathes him by the time he dies... but he isn't bad or 100% deserving of that loathing. He's just an old man with plots that aren't working out as intended but he's trying his best. Hermione... Hermione is bashed. Her narrow-mindedness is turned up to eleven and she's a nose-in-the-air I-know-better-than-you caricature. Ron just goes along for the ride, mostly, and isn't subjected to much bashing at all.

--------------

For those who are thinking of reading this... I would toss out the prequel unless you really, really, /really/ like powerwank or are in the mood for some that's over the top. The story itself is... probably on the better side of average? It kept my interest longer than others I've tried to read recently because it was something that I haven't seen fifty times before. The first half or so of the story is sixth year, the fall of voldemort, and seventh year. It narrates the horcrux 'hunt', and the distancing between Ron/Hermione and Harry - which was caused, mostly, by a lack of communication and some misunderstandings, with a bit of jealousy thrown in (oh no, my best mate is friendly with Neville now, oh noes).

After seventh year, the story moves faster and in total covers about 130-140 years (which is the rise of the wizards part). And talking about that is... spoilers.

Overall, I enjoyed the magical technology, I enjoyed the new take on The Order of the Phoenix, the conspiracy theories... it was a nice brainless read. I was also rather impressed with the way the author handled Dumbledore: he's flawed, he made mistakes but he was trying his damnedest to adjust with the information that he's given while dealing with a self-righteous (and /somewhat/ justified) teenager. Generally, if you get a dark!Harry trope, you also get Dumbledore bashing - he's evil, or he's incompetent, or... and that isn't the case here.

Things I didn't like include... well. In the final confrontation, the 'new villain' that was introduced is kind of just... forgotten about? And the dude was originally a big deal (to one of the people in that confrontation). So that was odd. The marriage with Gabby and Ginny was... It was there, it happened and... we didn't see a goddamn thing about it. Gabrielle had /zero/ lines. In the second half of the story, Ginny had zero. They're barely even in any scenes (in fact, I'm pretty sure that Gabby isn't in any. At all. Not even a wedding.) We're introduced to Gabby's kid (and Ginny's is mentioned but never appears 'on screen') but like... what was the point? They have roles (eventually), but that could've been filled by kids from Daphne just as easily. It's also power-wanky in places, but not nearly as bad as some I've read.

Edited because I grammar good.

What's your issue with this? This was true in many cultures throughout history, and still is in some, e.g. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygyny_in_Islam][Islam]]. I think it's fairly AU from what we know about Magical Britain based on canon, but so are a lot of things in fanfiction.

If a woman had 8 husbands I would also consider it bad writing because if she can get 8 husbands but each is only entitled to one wife and cannot ever openly love another, the relationship is problematic.

If someone has 3 wives who can only ever sleep with him and never have the same privilege to choose another 2 husbands or wives, it's problematic for me.

If a fic has Chad Chaddington who looks at a woman and she falls madly in love with him and begs on her knees to join his harem and wait all day for him to notice her while chatting with his other wives who do the same, I consider it something not only unrealistic, but also bad writing.

I will not "try again with an open mind" because I will not enjoy it. I looked at the description and kept and open mind already.

I hated it.

Please stop saying it as if I came in close-minded and just skimmed through the first paragraph.

You can like this fic but I can criticize it without you saying my description is wrong.

Dark Harry who merged with the Horcrux could be interesting, but in this case it just wasn't for me.

I described what I saw had happened and my feelings about it.

I would understand you saying that if I said that "I saw him being an heir of 3 houses, dropped." Or "I saw it used this or that name which is automatically bad writing." Or "I saw that the main couple is one I don't like so the entire fic is shit."

But I didn't do that because I understand that fiction can be good even with a trope going on.

Alas, this wasn't good.

Also, you said "keep an open mind" twice, yet did not keep an open mind when reading my criticism.

I understand, though, anyone can get a bit defensive when someone criticizes a fic they like.

******* Unfortunately, well-writted Haphne is hard to find. I've put a couple of links below for you to check out. I only have one similar to the above so I gave you a few other stories to check out if you like. If your a Haphne fan then I think you'll have had read some already. Hopefully there's something that you like.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5835213/1/The-Marriage-Contracts-Redux][The Marriage Contracts Redux]] This is another well written Haphne as close the Contractual Invalidation as I know of.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned][Unatoned]] Great writing. Complete. Noir. Very much noir and so it will be different from Contractual Invalidation. Personally I love it but may not be your type.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9774121/1/The-Legacy][The Legacy]] My favourite Haphne for realism. Marriage contract wasn't a good idea. However, this story stops just short of the penultimate battle and hasn't been updated for a few years...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/A-Fine-Spot-of-Trouble][A Fine Spot of Trouble]] An enjoyable post-war story. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4334542/1/The-Grass-Is-Always-Greener][The Grass is Always Greener]] Quite a good story if my memory serves me correctly. I enjoyed it when I first found Haphne. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8769990/1/Second-Chances][Second Chances]] This one is part of a complete series. I remember it having some bashing so take care if that's not what you like. It was well written and had some very original ideas.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]] This is a popular Daphne story. Not the greatest writing but it's complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5598642/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Betrothal-Contract][The Betrothal Contract]] This is another completed story. Very popular. I read it a long time ago and can't remember much about it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10649604/1/The-Legacy-Preservation-Act][The Legacy Preservation Act]] Another James Spookie story. Like the one immediately above, it's not brilliant but it's not awful either. Just a plain Jane Haphne story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244813/1/A-Champion-s-New-Hope][A Champion's New Hope]] Another completed story. Not bad just not amazing. I liked it at the time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5012016/1/Partners][Partners]] Another popular one. Not great writing. Is pretty popular though so it might be your cup of tea.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9750991/1/Angry-Harry-and-the-Seven][Angry Harry and the Seven]] Bashing fic. Indy!Harry. I can't remember much else about it as I read it a long time ago and my taste changed.

I found another Haphne story to add to the above. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19193497/chapters/45627454?view_adult=true][to refuse the givens]] It's a completed story with good writing so it's a top ten for me as that's unfortunately very rare for Haphne. Romantic and canon compliant with no bashing. I hope you enjoy. If you ever stray from Haphne, my other recommendation is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] which is perhaps the best dark lord Harry I have found.

** I guess it would be a spoiler for the story itself to suggest this one, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13569941/1/What-s-a-Gungan][What's a Gungan?]] by mjimeyg has this sort of form as an unintentional case, so I guess it wouldn't count on the "*/seeks/* to take control" aspect but Harry doesn't shy away from taking over otherwise when it is the best solution to solving a problem.

**** I considered mentioning that one as well, but at the time I forgot how far he went, since unlike with What's a Gungan, it was mostly background to him being a very unique operative on Shepard's crew, but remembering his Title, yes, he very much runs with the powerbase he starts with. In comparison to Harry Potter: Geth, a lot of the plot is focused on the takeover/lead aspect in What's a Gungan?.

Unsurprising that mjimeyg had robots basically running everything with Harry a much as a figurehead as an actual ruler/leader. It certainly simplified the displayed Wizard

**** Spoilers spoiled, but please, it's legitimately awful.

​

If anyone wants to read a fic where Harry literally invalidates every single possible threat to the story, is able to 1v1 destroy Sovereign with a sword (even a SUUPPPERRR MAGICAL SWOOOOOOOOOOOORD), is nonsensically immune to indoctrination, is able to effortlessly change any characters' mind, is able to completely invalidate the entirety of the struggle of the series, give it a go. It's tremendous shit. And I'm being honest to shit. It's a story that, literally, has no stakes at all. The conflict is, literally, reduced to "welp, Harry's here!!!" It's... really bad. I would have enjoyed it in my early teens. I don't think I can ever criticize this shit pile enough. It's a legitimate 0/5 star story. Oh, but at least he is able to cure the quarian race and fucks the quarian girl and the geth aren't responsible for anything! To this day, I cannot read any story where Harry is referred to as an Emissary. I cannot castigate this fic enough. I would rather unironically re-read My Immortal.

​

The worst part is that Harry's power could be expressed purely canonically!!! A Harry Potter wizard in Mass Effect would be a force multiplier on a level a master biotic could only dream of. But it's just so fucking bullshit.

And here's a protip to any author over the age of 14, if your main character is able to invalidate the entire struggle in a crossover, if he is able to make every single main character irrelevant because he's just so awesome... please do some self-reflection. I'm still angry that I read it to its entirety. I hate this story. It was a wonder I was able to even speak about it outside of incoherent screeches of hate. Even if you want to read some word-ramble about a god powered Harry doing work, you can do better than this.

Anakin was just a "prisoner.". Oh, my god.

**** Some further comments:

If you want to read a story similar to the Geth abomination up there, go for it. Harry here completely invalidates every single threat he comes across. He defeats Maul in a few seconds, immobilizes and captures Darth Sidious in seconds, and manages to capture Darth Plagueis OUT OF SCENE and presents him to the Jedi Council. Because that's what we want in a Star Wars Prequel story. We want the entirety of the Sith Great Plan to be neutralized and every single Sith Lord to be captured within a week. With Zero Effort. Oh wait, Harry had to come to grips with the fact that Maul could deflect a stunning charm. But wait! The reductor charm doesn't have visible light! Therefore the force sensitive Maul was completely vulnerable and had his legs shatter! Jesus Christ. That a witch or wizard can be invisible to the force is a... decent story telling technique. That that power completely invalidates the prescience of the force users so they can be taken out in three seconds is complete nonsense.

>! All because the great conflict of the story is the nonsense awkward "chemistry" between Harry and Tali (OH WAIT sorry, Not Tali. Padme. It's the same shit) God what trash. Maybe in the next chapter Harry will blush when he realizes his love interest accidentally looked at him :) What suspense is there here? Harry could take out every single jedi on the council in 2 seconds and then hunt down the rest. He could go to the senate and use the blasting curse to kill them all with no consequence. And then he could give out a super special Indy!Harry speech to the holonet denouncing them! Christ. This one is just as bad as Harry Potter: Geth up there. -0 out of 5.!<
