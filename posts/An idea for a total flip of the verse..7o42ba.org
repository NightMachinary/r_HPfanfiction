Harry lived in the world of magic, until one day a half-giant, paid a visit to him.

"Yer an engineer 'arry." he said.

Since that day Harry's new life begins. He knew that his family lied to him, he wasn't a Darkspawn from the Underdark. He had nanomachines in his blood and ingrained knowledge how to create things no one in the world has ever seen.

The friendly half cyborg led him to the world of engineering, hidden in the subspace fold right in the center of magical London. He bought his STC's, a professional nano forge at Ollivander's and a familiar in the form of white AI drone.

When the time finally came up, he joined the rest of his fellow young engineers on an express space elevator maglev, to the technological space school of Hogquarks.

** "Magic World with secret science" isn't that uncommon of a trope to run into in general science fiction/fantasy. It is often portrayed as the magic civilization being the fallen remnents of some more advanced technogical civilization. The understanding of the nanites/applied phlebotinum has faded but still operates unseen and allows for 'magic' to be preformed.

I don't know of any fics set in HP that use this, but some books come to mind.

"There will be dragons" cronicals the fall of a technological civilization into a swords&sorcery situation

The "Pern" series started out so strongly as low fantasy that the publisher put it out as fantasy, only to have the later books go 'sci-fi all along'

I also recall "The Practice Effect" having this twist in the end.

*** I know this trope kinda exists already. I thought it out to be more "parallel evolution", than "after the fall" though. You know, they were developing together, like in canon HP, but at some point, the science guys had Oppenheimer's "I have become the destroyer of worlds" moment and decided to fall back into the shadows.

BTW. Is the "magic erodes logic" thing canon or fanon? Cos I'm pretty sure Rowling said that, but I'm not sure if that was in real life or in my imagination.

When the answer to 1+1 really is 3, all bets are off. Magic changes all the rules.

**** Now that I think about it, doing an after the fall thing would be pretty easy: Someone discovers that magic was added to the world when the aliens visited 1000's of years ago, and thus is closer to muggle science than you would think. Could do a neat thing with this allowing muggleborn's to better understand the nature of magic once it is revealed.

However, you are right, it isn't really what you originally asked.

The problem with what you ask is it changes the concept from being 'someone with special powers' to 'someone without special powers'.

"A secret society of magic users hiding under the surface of a world of non-magic users" fits a lot better than the inverse. I mean it is possible just.. not that interesting. "A secret society of people with no hair hiding under the surface of a world of harry people".

And putting 'technology' in place of magic doesn't really fit: By its nature, technology is not some special skill but is something everyone can learn. I suppose you could do something like 'this group chose to give up their magic in order to do this', but it isn't really the same...

***** The idea evolves in my head as I read the responses, and here's one such thing.

You see, you think of the technology like a toaster or a cellphone. I think of the tech that lets you manipulate gravity, create matter out of quantum foam and move whole planets. The world is filled with nanomachines. Ground, air, and people carry them around. Unfortunately, high technology doesn't see eye to eye with magic, so only those with the low level of it in their bodies are able to cultivate great numbers of them and achieve quantum level manipulation.

Be aware, that if this idea takes flight, the magic will take significant nerf. After all, it plays the role of the mundane in the story. Some spells might get removed, and overall it'll be much harder to achieve substantial results. After all, an 11-year-old kid that can take the rule of conservation of mass and without much effort bend it over the desk is moronically OP.

****** That is just magic by a different name though.

The very nature of science is that you achieve great things via an intimate understanding of the universe around you. There is no intrinsic value to it. Even in 'magicie' sci-fi like Telepathy, where there isn't any hard science behind it, is that it is something that fundamentally could be understood by the characters in their universe, instead of say, 'mind magic'. The wonder of it is the idea of being able to do basically magical things purely through having a grand and intimate understanding of how the world works.

Thus, by definition, those with magic would be able to use tech. It is easy to flip it around (you lose magic by doing science). "Magic requires belief, and a scientific viewpoint is incompatible" (You see this alot in the 'grow up and lose magic' ideas). But not being able to use technology because of magic?

I know some people try with the whole 'hey electronics don't work around magic', but that doesn't block science at all. Any decent electrical engineer (or scientist), when presented with a situation where electricity and magic are interacting that way, would immediately hunker down and start experimenting to measure and quantify the effect. The engineer would then try to find a way to use the properties of magic to his advantage (Remember, rapidly dampening electricity is a very important concept to electrical engineering). They would totally find a way to use the phenomena to their advantage.

Oh a side note, there are no-where near enough fics with scientists scienceing the shit out of magic. You know the first science professor who has a magical child would subject them to all sorts of tests.

******* Who said the magicals can't use tech? It's just that they don't have access to anything more advanced than a gas lamp, that already is more magical than mechanical. Higher tech won't work at maximum capacity in hands of someone powerful, because of interference, but it will work. Average Ron (or rather Dudley) wouldn't be even able to pas the filters to take it below 100%.

Those that developed it had little to no connection with magic (as in they have low mana capacity), so at the beginning, the tech was sort of a crutch for them. Those that had magic in abundance didn't care about developing tech because whatever they wanted, they could get by waving a stick. That's why the magicals are happy with living in (sort of) renaissance times, while techs smash together moons to create new planets. And by the time tech was able to do things magic couldn't, the "worlds" were in separation for a long time and techs aren't very keen on "giving a nuke to a toddler" so to speak.

As for the "sufficiently advanced technology...", the difference between this and the actual magic, is that it isn't magic.

BTW. I too would like to read a "scientist(s) vs magic" story. The best I ever found was a geneticist taking a look at dragon DNA.

******** I mean, mana capacity doesn't really exist as a concept in HP proper, only in fanfics. There are "powerful wizards," but all the magic shown is due to belief and willpower. We never actually see wizards "tiring out" from using spells.

******** Ehh I am still not seeing it. The thing is, science is a thought process not so much a particular set of technologies. When you want to do 'suppressed scientist' narrative s, usually it isn't the entire notion of scientists that are hidden but the practitioner's, out of fear due to the climate ("religious society that rejects them")

What you need is a reason that your subgroup would be more critical/logical thinkers than the rest of the population, and would keep it hidden.

Maybe something like "magic World was populated by starship long time ago and nanites provide 'magic' to the population. The population has lost knowedge about their origins. The ship selects kids at age 11 to join it's official crew, when they learn about how their world works."

The motivation stays the same: secret population keeps itself secret because general population would prosecute them for power. The scientists can do things the general population can not through their greater understanding and access to the mothership.

The general population could understand the science behind their wonders but there is no motivation for them to do so. As far as they are concerned it is just 'forbidden magic'.

A couple of themes in the book can shine through, including the belief crew membership should stay in the direct line of the original members, the scientists still operating under a military type hierchy, while the magicals have moved on to democracy...

******* I watched only a few eps, so I can't say yes or no.

One thing I can say for sure is that they wouldn't have any ESP. All their skill would be tech based. If there's telepathy, it's not because they are telepaths, but because they have brain-to-brain quantum entanglement communication network. If someone can move stuff without touching it, it's not because they are telekinetics, but they can wirelessly control femtomachines that can redirect graviton waves.
