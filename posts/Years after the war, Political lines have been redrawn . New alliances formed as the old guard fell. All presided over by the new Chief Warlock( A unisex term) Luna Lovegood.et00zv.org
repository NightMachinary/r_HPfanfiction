We all know Hermione Became Minister of Magic, Harry Is the head of magical Law enforcement, And Ron runs the Financial side of the largest corporation in the magical world Weasley wizard weeses Incorporated.

Someone has to preside over the Wizengamot.

Yes this is a prompt.

For the purposes of this from Luna is heading the Wizengamot While are they discuss The implications on the international statute of secrecy now That Draco Malfoy has successfully started a magical colony on Mars. There is great debate Over which magical legislative body has The authority to govern such a colony. As Draco Malfoy submitted a formal request for aid In dealing with the gnome infestation on Mars. It's the largest colony they've ever seen.


** Wow. I might just do this. It sounds pretty interesting. I have no idea how to write Luna though, so I might focus on the Ron part; I'm good at him. I personally feel like Luna is the most underdeveloped of the Big Six. Harry is the hero who doesn't want to be famous, Hermione is the smart, bad at socialising girl, Ron is the brave, insecure guy, Neville wants to prove himself, Ginny wants to be seen as more than the Weasley Girl, but Luna is just the weird one. I'd love a fic explaining the effect of her mothers death on her.
