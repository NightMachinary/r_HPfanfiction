There's a mention of Ginny's magic being drained away in the end of this one-shot, but it's not very major.

*** If I remember correctly it had something to do with what Tom was doing to her when he was draining her. And then when Harry wakes up in the hospital wing Ron tells him that the Weasley's are taking Ginny on a vacation around the world, but that she wouldn't really enjoy it.

  What binds Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort together goes deeper than a simple prophecy. As Harry struggles to learn the true nature of their bond, he eventually discovers the true prophecy that was hidden from him. Whether he chooses to accept it or fight it, he must act or risk losing everything he's fought for and everything that could have been.
