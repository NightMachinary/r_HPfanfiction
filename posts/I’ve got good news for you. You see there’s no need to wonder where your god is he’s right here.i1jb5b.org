***** Oh, of course, and this naturally means that we must always forgive him for any misconduct, crime, atrocities and generally being a scum-bag of cosmic proportions. After all his childhood was though! I mean, he had to pass all those days as a god being raised by a caring mother while his siblings (that he didn't particularly care about and turned out to be slightly less horrible) were locked up inside his father's stomach!

Yeah, those demi-digested assholes were the lucky ones as they had the company of each other, their parents and the rock that passed as him, he on the other hand was lonely! (well, expect by his adoptive mother, but she doesn't count! She is a mortal, and so not plot-relevant). This of course means that our highness Marry Su- I mean, Zeus, must become king of everything, be always right no matter the subject or the minor detail that he is clearly in the wrong and everybody must always ask his forgiveness for not having a worse childhood than him (after all he was /lonely/).
