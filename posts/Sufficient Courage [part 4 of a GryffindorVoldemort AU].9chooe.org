Summary: Remus wonders where it went wrong. There is nothing to fear.


** I enjoy this. I wouldn't say it is great, but I am highly entertained.

  Loyalty was a Hufflepuff virtue. Perhaps it was also a Gryffindor vice.

Dang. Still on hiatus. I'd seen people talking about it a few times recently and was beginning to think it had revived. ;_;

Thank you for reading. I'm glad that you found it to be worth your time!
