I'm a little bored of the main trio and Hogwarts. Are there any good crossovers where a different character gets sent over to the non-HP-setting while retaining their canon characterization? Preferably characters who are not overpowered enough to take away all suspense. Bonus points for Dumbledore being the person crossing over.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11695139/1/Gelassenheit][Gelassenheit]] by HauntedCinders is pretty decent from I remember. It's a MCU crossover though. Ginny start off working for SHIELD as a sort of manger for the Avengers Facility. Eventually, she was trained to be an agent. A fascinating read with excellent story telling.

  After the war, Ginny did everything in her power to forget what she had lost. She moved to New York, changed her last name and gave up magic. But after a phone call from her boss, Ginny finds her new, safe, magic-less life threatened as she is forced into the surreal world of the Avengers. And then there's that one Sokovian guy who just won't leave her alone...

  Harry was never the only person with a penchant for tripping into the most absurd of situations. Reincarnated!Hermione. Somewhat darker than the usual take on Naruto. Political machinations. Character progression. Strong friendship, no romance.

*** Does she keep her magic? I've seen this one countless times but never went for it because of that, as without magic all you get is a more mature Sakura which already exists in lots of time travel stories...

**** She keeps some aspects, though yeah, it did feel a bit like it's a more mature Sakura sometimes. It's quite well written though, so you might try it anyway.

I've not gotten too deep into Naruto fics though, and it's sub isn't as good, so do you have any recs? I loved Dreaming of Sunshine and vapors, and haven't read too many more

** You could try [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4838629/1][Not Quite A Maia]], where Neville and Molly Weasley, fresh out of the Battle of Hogwarts, end up in Middle-Earth to help the Fellowship as temporary stand-ins for Gandalf, who has got lost in time and space after falling in Moria.

The fic also brings in Augusta Longbottom, and later on it even calls Dumbledore and Fred in, back from the dead and ready to do their part. The fic is a little goofy, but it has some great bits with all the characters, especially Augusta. Also you get Dumbledore VS Saruman.

** The Wolf and the Moon seems pretty popular. Luna goes to the game of thrones world, is a targaryen. Your mileage may vary - it has good bits but drags on at times. linkffn(12259049)

A much better fic-in-progress in that area is The Winter Witch by Kneazle: Hermione gets thrown into the Game of Thrones universe, without really realising it at first. She helps out Robb. I've enjoyed most of this so far, give it a go! The main reason I like it is that for once it's not Hermione-reborn-as-a-Lady trope that seems to have utterly dominated that crossover area. linkffn(12689889)

Logic, meet Luna: Just a bit of fun mixed with Sherlock. I only watched a few episodes of the series and could easily follow along. Linkffn(7673486)

Actually, I can recommend filtering all crossovers on ffnet by including luna, excluding harry, and sorting by favourites. i spent ages finding unexpected Luna fics that were very funny. I suppose you could do the same with Dumbledore. If you find any good oens, feel free to share :D

  Luna Lovegood has moved into 221c Baker Street! So what happens when you mix a 'loony' pureblood witch in a muggle area with logic driven residents? Err... not much, really. Just a whole lot of confusion.

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom, and finished with a battle outside her tent. The deciding line between staying and helping Robb Stark, or returning to her universe, is getting harder to see the longer she's in Westeros. But it's a decision that she has to make, or it's one that will be made for her.

  Luna has always had a special relationship with Death, especially after her mother died. And after the final battle as she lies dying on the floor of the great hall, the spectre, claiming she was robbed of the life she should have had sends her to Westeros where she is reborn as the twin sister of Rhaegar Targaryen.
