From three-month-long intervals at best to those who update frenetically with several chapters a week, it's no secret that update rates are very varied in fanfiction. What rates do you find optimal as a reader? And as a writer?


** As a writer, once per week. it'll keep you going with a deadline, you have some slack to do rewrites with your beta, and you keep the story going at a decent pace without taking too long to finish it.

** I never start posting a multi chapter story until it's complete and in the past I've updated twice a week. When I start posting my new story I might do it a bit slower. Or I might be impatient to get it out of the way. Posting regularly never helped me get any reviews though - maybe I even got less reviews because no one ever needed to ask me to update. I don't know. It seems to be different for everyone.

** I don't start posting a story until I have at least 15000 words which is roughly 15 chapters for me. My chapters are quite short since I struggle to write more than 1000 words. I update once a week on Fridays after noon.

** As a writer, it really depends on the story and how well things are going with it. When I've got my creative bits all lined up, I can update several times a week, but when I'm stuck on a bit, an update can take a few weeks. I know if I planned my work out better, some of this could be mitigated. Sometimes when working on a multi-chapter an idea for a one-shot will intrude and I'll have to set aside one to work on the other.

As a reader, I don't really have any update frequency expectations. I'm fine with whenever a writer I follow updates. I think maybe non-writers tend to be less tolerant of non-regular updates. I will say though if a writer explicitly says they'll update at specific intervals, then they should do their best to keep to that schedule. If you're going to set expectations, then you need to meet them. I'm looking at you, Rothfuss.

** am i reader and mostly thankful for any updates. if a fic has more frequent updates (more than 1 per week) i tend to wait a bit and then read several chapters

** My update rate is currently 1x per month. I would like to increase the frequency to 2x but that's just not possible for me right now unless I start writing shorter chapters.

** What I find optimal as a writer is to update once the whole story is finished. However, what I typically do is write two chapters and then post the first. The second will come two days afterwards. Therefore, I update about two times a week which leads to a faster completion time altogether. However, my latest story I've fallen behind on and haven't updated in over a month now.

** It doesn't matter as long as it's consistent, like the perfect Upload rate is like twice a month as a reader, the only way more uploads would be better is if the story was already done and it's just a matter of uploading it then once a day is best.

** As an author, I noticed that you get the most views on Saturday night (GMT)/Saturday afternoon (US). While I am not writing for the sake of popularity, updating on a weekend is a low effort way to tell your story to more people without much inconvenience.

My regular schedule is once a week (which results in an update every two weeks for either of my fics) but it is impossible to keep that up during exams. University has higher priority than any hobby so the readers will have to be patient.

Semi-monthly or more frequent. I try to not pick up ongoing fics that update less often than that.

** At the moment, I'm updating my story on AO3 fortnightly because I've only recently started publishing it there. On Wattpad, I update the same story as the chapters are finished (written, edited, etc..) but Wattpad is (obviously) ahead of AO3, by about 20 chapters for now.

** I was updating once a week, but now I'm just going to write it all entirely before updating my story! :)
