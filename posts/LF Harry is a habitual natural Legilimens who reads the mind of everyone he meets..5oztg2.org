See title. I'd prefer a nice-guy Harry who doesn't judge and uses his ability to organize the right birthday presents for people rather than a Super!Harry who discovers X character is lying to him (gasp!) and et-cetera.

*** Read it up to the latest update, like it a lot. It's a growing Super!Harry who's also genuinely likable.

**** I started reading it, it's good but Harry doesn't feel 11 years old to me. Difficult with his power I know, but it does take away from the fic.

***** It is a huge point of the fic. The people he knows act the way they do around him because he doesn't seem 11 years old. Every time he touches something or someone he lives/ sees when it/ they have experienced. It has added a lot of maturity to his character.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
