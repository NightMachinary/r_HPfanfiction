According to wiki fandom:

#+begin_quote
  During the war, Lily and James defied Voldemort on at least three occasions, the first being when they refused to join his cause when he tried to recruit them.
#+end_quote

I can't ever believe that Voldemort would consider recruiting a Muggle-born. He completely hates them.

I think this is probably a mistake, and Voldemort only offered to have James in his ranks (since he's a Pure-blood).


** I don't think he hated mudbloods as much as many of his followers did (I also don't think Hitler hated the Jews as much as his followers did -some Jewish people were even working with the Nazis in WWII, even in high positions). I think he recognized how well he can manipulate people with a common goal/enemy. He is a halfblood himself, his most trusted right hand man was a halfblood, he had werewolves working for him... He saw that through their hatred of mudbloods he could unite many pure bloods and have them do what he wanted. I think he would have made exceptions for particularly skilled muggle borns.

** Voldemort just cared about power. Pure blood supremacy was just the path of least resistance in achieving a following. His followers would have similar disdain for werewolf's and giants as they do muggleborns. Yet that didn't stop him from using them to achieve his goals.

** Voldemort hates muggles, but while he uses pureblood supremacy dogma to get rich people who already have lots of power to fight against the system he knows that blood isn't quite everything, as he's halfblood himself.

I think if Lily was extraordinarily powerful and Snape put in a good word he'd certainly consider recruiting her as a spy since nobody would expect her to work for him. If her loyalty is lacking he can always threaten to make the muggle neighborhood where her parents live the next death eater target.

Obviously if Lily was more Gryffindorish than expected and refused, that might explain why we never see Harry's maternal grandparents and why Petunia hates wizards so much.

***** oh my god, I had never considered that a possibility. It would add an entirely new layer of to petunias hatred towards magic (and harry) if both her parents and her sister had died due to Voldemort and harry was the only one that survived. Fuuuck its like my brain just exploded

** He took half-bloods and it is stated in the books that people lie about their genealogy. I bet if she agreed to join it would quickly be "discovered" that she is /actually/ descended from some old, preferably died out, pure-blood family. And she would have documentation to prove it.

** It's said in text that Voldemort tried to recruit her. Hagrid says it, so maybe take it with a grain of salt, but it's plausible. The pureblood movement was just a means to some ends: absolute power and immortality.

And he hated everyone. Bellatrix a little less, but she would've died too had she been master of the elder wand.

*** Yes, I always took it as more 'sit in your corner quietly and you won't be killed' than 'we want you as a Death Eater'. I reckon they'd have snapped her wand too.

** He did it because of Snape, I also think he did it because it's good to have as many people on your side as, possible.

He could have easily gone and tried to kill Neville, and yet he went after Harry, a Half-Blood, the same as himself. He had a self hatred for Halfbloods/Muggleborns, but he also loved power as well.

If someone was powerful, or he saw them as a personal threat, he'd either A go after them or B try and get them to join his side.

His right hand man was Snape, who was a halfblood, he had Greyback, who was a werewolf work for him. For some reason he didn't view Neville as a threat, or not enough of a one to mark him as such, but he did Harry.

I think it's because he knew better then anyone, what it meant to go past what people believe your limits are, as a Halfblood himself.
