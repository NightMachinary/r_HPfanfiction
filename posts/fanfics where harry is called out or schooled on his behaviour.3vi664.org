we've all seen the stupid fanfictions where harry becomes strong and is a brat and annoying gary sue or fanfics where it seems that acting like a tool or jerk with dealign with people even people he hates seems to be the way to get what he wants and it sadly works. My question is ever seen on where harry ends up offending or alienating people and he regrets it and suffers the consequences or he learns the hard way that some training in magic doesn't make you a match for people who have years of experience. It;d be great to see harry get torn a new one
