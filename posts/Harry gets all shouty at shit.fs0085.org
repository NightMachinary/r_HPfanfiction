I'm in the mood to read some real bad tropes, yo - specifically, the indy!Harry trope where he yells at people about things for reasons. One such example is the ever-famous "I DO NOT FORGIVE, I DO NOT FORGET" from Cadmean Victory - which amusingly, is one of the things Voldemort says to the Death Eaters in the Graveyard. Not sure if that parallel is deliberate or not, but it's fun, and Harry in Cadmean Victory doesn't pull it off in the slightest. :D

Anyway. Yes. Fics with Shouty Harry, please. He can be shouting about anything, but he just has to be really, really angry and self-righteous about it. Petulance is an additional bonus. :)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.
