As in, has there been an official statement made by somebody that it's dead and not coming back? Last time it was gone for quite a while and then came back.

Do we know if the owner had a backups that can be, for example, handed off to the OTW to add to AO3? Many of those works weren't archived anywhere else.

*** Skyehawke was an archive. In the old days, it was THE place for quality fiction because authors had to be invited, which meant they could be choosy and only pick those who wrote quality stories (as opposed to FFN who let anybody join and upload, as long as they claimed to be at least 13).

One of the things they had was "top 100" lists of stories, authors, etc. I discovered a lot of authors by reading through those lists, and also checking the favorites of the authors I liked.

Not currently. It disappeared for a month or so last year and then came back, so this post is me trying to find out if we know for sure whether it's gone, or if it might come back again.

*** Most of my links are in saved fics. When I save a fic, I include the link(s) where it can be found in case I want to recommend it to somebody. For a few fics, Skyehawke is the only link I have, which means those would need to be tagged "no longer online."
