:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been looking for this fic for /years/. Basically, Severus meets this man at the club that he has no idea is Harry. He thinks he's 18/19 even though I think Harry is 15/16 at the time. Harry was kicked out by the Dursleys when he was like 8 or something and has made his way since. This includes picking up guys at nightclubs so he has food and a place to stay. Snape picks up on the clues that his lover is homeless. I think he teaches Harry how to read, as well as letting him use his apartment when he's teaching so he won't have to go back to the streets. Much later on in the fic, when Dumbledore is once again insisting they search for Harry, they discover him. Snape is absolutely shocked to find out that it's his lover.

It was on ff.net. /Please/ does anyone have any clue which story this is?


** Sounds an awful lot like Willing by debstheslytherinsnapefan, it's on A03 & ff now.

  Harry's been missing since he was 9 years old, the wizarding world have been looking him for seven years. Since he was eleven years old and did not come to Hogwarts. He's Seventeen when they find him, but they are in for a shock if they think he'd do what they wanted. Turns out Harry has known Severus for years, he's a metamorphamagus. Dumbledore's manipulations are found out, the world is in for a shock. I want to show a caring side to Dom/Sub so there won't be a rough side to be seen here.

  DomSev/SubHarry. Harry's been missing since he was 9 years old the wizarding world have been looking him for seven years to no avail. He's Seventeen when they find him, but they were in for a shock if they thought he'd do what they wanted. Turns out Harry has known Severus for years, he's a metamorphamagus.
