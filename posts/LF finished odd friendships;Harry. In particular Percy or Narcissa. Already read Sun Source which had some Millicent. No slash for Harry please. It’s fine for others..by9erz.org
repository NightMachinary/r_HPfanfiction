*** Definitely not a requirement. Like i mentioned I don't want any Harry slash. Just simple friendship is fine.

I believe I've read what consists of all 3 complete stories pairing Narcissa up with Harry on ffnet.

As for Percy, I've read of few fics where it shows glimpses of Harry getting on with Percy and then a fic that turned out to be a time travel crack that showed Harry praising Percy saying he was one of the most badass people he ever knew.

I guess I was kind of looking for something like that but not crack.

But any other odd friendships are fine too and they don't have to be paired up.
