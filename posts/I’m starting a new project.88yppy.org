I've always wondered about the “little people” in Harry Potter - the nameless NPCs who encounter the main characters, both Muggle and wizard

What's their story? What's their opinion on the character?

I wrote my first 500 words tonight - a girl from Vernon's company

I'm tackling the surgical team who remove Dudley's tail next (I'm a theatre nurse IRL and there's no way that would've been ignored. Do you think the Ministry got involved?)

Who would you like to hear about? No one is too random!


** Madam Marsh. Why is she getting the knight bus everywhere? She seems to hate it.

** This is brilliant

I was planning on doing it in chronological order so I'm not jumping from book to book so I think Diagon Alley shopkeepers might be next

I'm thinking I'll put it on FanFiction.Net as that's where I read most of my stuff

When I post, I'll be sure to let you all know

Keep the suggestions coming please!

** Perhaps the views of everyone who hwlped Harry during his first shopping expedition with Hagrid. Maybe have them all get together for dinner afterwards to discuss how different he was from his father.
