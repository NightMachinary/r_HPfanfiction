In Golbet of Fire we see McGonagall teaching the Gryffindors how to ballroom dance. This suggests that students in other houses are also taught to dance by their head of house. I feel that there must be a fic somewhere going into glorious awkward detail of Snape teaching his students how to dance OR Snape outright refusing to teach the Slytherins dancing, and offering some explanation of how to students learn on their own. Please help me with my quest.


** That sounds hilarious and I will send imaginary cookies to anyone who finds such a fic.

However, here's a story with Snape offering the Slytherins career advice like we saw McGonagall do in OOTP. It's really funny.

  The student of Slytherin House were born with everything: wealth, prestige and pure wizarding blood. Now it's Severus Snape's job to help them find the one thing they don't have: careers.

** This reminds me of a hilarious fic of Snape having to deal with girls getting their first period. I think it was a one shot but can you imagine? "Professor Snape! Someone hit me with a dark curse, I know it! My stomach hurts and I won't stop bleeding!"

I now have a mental image of Severus Snape leading the entire Slytherin house in a call-and-response rap.

** linkffn(Bring Me To Life by Slytherpouf) contains a scene where Hermione and Snape visit him teaching the Slytherins to dance in a Penseive. It's fairly dark though, and obviously SSHG, so it might not be your thing.)

  Snape is engulfed by his own personal Darkness following the final battle. How can Hermione help the wizard who believes he has nothing to live for? This is a little dark, a little ugly, a little sexy, a little romantic and a lot M, for several reasons. Definitely one for adults only. *NOW COMPLETE*

** And now I want to read that story!

Although I believe that most Slytherins are Pureblood and Half-Blood who live in the Wizarding world, meaning that they likely already know the traditional dances.

From what we have seen Slytherin in particular seems to be very traditional with that kind of stuff. Still makes me want to read a story like that though! lol just the thought in my head is hilarious.
