Please shoot me your favorite Tom Riddle stories as a kid on some lonely type of fanfic thank you !!


** linkao3(Ouroboros by Metalomagnetic) - It's a time travel adoption story, but the twist is that Voldemort is the one traveling back in time and adopting him. The author really nailed Tom's character in this one IMO.

  A strange man adopts Tom Riddle and it is not his father, as Tom desperately wants to believe. Stranded in the past, Voldemort once again comes to the conclusion he's the only one he truly needs.

** Birds of a Feather Â» In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend". But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle. (1930's Childhood Friends AU)

Is a good story and the characters are well written plus you really feel in the 1930's. Tom's character is him is not just as if he becomes a good person because he has someone to talk to. Is not time travel Hermione is a Hermione that grew in the this time period.
