  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC

** For the past month or so I've been going through FFN reading every story tagged with "Voldemort", from most faves to least. There is amazing variety, and I've found many that I love.

Here are some of my favorites arranged by plot element.

(677k+ words, frequently updated)

(No bashing, but a Dumbledore that gets very scary)

(Only minor pairings thus far: Snape with a female side character)

Voldemort's sanity is restored after the resurrection in book 4. He reevaluates all of his goals and decides to pursue a more diplomatic path to victory by claiming the Slytherin Lordship. But to do so he requires an heir who speaks parseltongue. Thus, to the horror of most of wizarding Britain, Voldemort exploits some ancient laws to be exonerated of his crimes and then claim guardianship of Harry Potter. Drama ensues.

(no bashing, evil(?) Dumbledore)

(no pairings)

Voldemort is sane and intelligent during the confrontation over the Philosopher's Stone. He gains two prizes: the Stone and a living Horcrux. Over the coming months Voldemort works quickly to restore his power-base, but his opposition is more cunning than he ever would have expected.

(193k+ words, 9 months since last update)

(Ron bashing, extremely evil Dumbledore)

(no pairings)

After his name comes out of the Goblet, Harry discovers that someone has been heavily tampering with his mind. He suspects that Dumbledore has been grooming him to be an obedient pawn. Feeling his mind crumbling further every day, Harry turns in desperation to the only person he knows is not completely under Dumbledore's influence: Alastor Moody.

 

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2905557/1/Heir-of-Slytherin][Heir of Slytherin]]*

(55k+ words, DEAD)

(no bashing, no pairings)

Voldemort requires an heir so that he can claim the Slytherin Lordship. His planning finally pays off in an unexpected way when he claims Harry as his heir. Meanwhile, when Harry goes missing Severus Snape makes a disturbing discovery: his own decades old memories that had been locked away. This fic contains some great moments of creepiness which somehow manage to be chilling and hilarious at the same time.

(148k+ words, COMPLETE)

(no bashing, no pairing)

Told from Snape's perspective, the story starts in fifth year. Snape is the first person to notice that there is something terribly wrong with Harry Potter. The boy seems to be suicidal, but Snape suspects there is something much darker at work. By the time he discovers the truth, Harry is no longer present. This fic is a slow burn of psychological horror as "Harry" subtly twists the people around him into mockeries of what they could have been.

(no bashing, no pairings)

That night in Godric's Hollow played out differently. Lilly Potter died to protect her children from Voldemort, but with his death the Dark Lord left a piece of himself inside the 8 year old Harry Potter. James Potter doesn't know how to cope with suddenly having two young children to care for by himself, especially since Harry has started to act out in disturbing ways.

The two boys grow up thinking that they are brothers. Meanwhile, Grindelwald's scheming in Europe leads to the troubling discovery of an unstable time loop, which might threaten the survival of the entire world. Grindelwald decides that he must entwine his fate with that of the two boys currently living in Wool's Orphanage.

 

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11261838/1/The-Unwinding-Golden-Thread][The Unwinding Golden Thread]]*

(53k+ words, COMPLETE)

(no bashing, no pairings)

Told from Tom Riddle's perspective. Harry is unwillingly transported back in time to the year that Tom Riddle would have loosed the basilisk within Hogwarts. The boy can't just stand by and do nothing, even if the future will be changed by his actions. Unfortunately, the changes unravel far worse than Harry could have ever imagined.

 

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment]]*

(no pairing, no bashing)

Told from Tom Riddle's perspective. The world is turned on its head when a powerful wizard launches a full assault on Hogwarts with the sole purpose of assassinating young Tom Riddle.

Harry unwittingly enters a simulation of the year Tom Riddle opened the Chamber of Secrets. Harry is willing to do almost anything to keep his own secrets and ensure he can return safely to the present. After all, if none of this is real then his actions don't really matter. That makes it ok... right?

(148k+ words, frequently updated)

(eventual Marauders bashing)

(Pairings: eventual Tom Riddle/Lilly Evans)

The story begins with Harry, as Death personified, meeting Tom Riddle on the train to Hogwarts in 1938. Their interactions change the course of the future, eventually leading Tom to an unforeseen immortality and a brand new nation on Mars. This fic contains some very surreal moments as Tom sets out on a path diametrically opposed to what he ever would have become in canon.

  "He disappeared after leaving the school... traveled far and wide... sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable." --- Albus Dumbledore Tom Riddle's four most pivotal encounters in the years between his departure from England and his return a decade later as Lord Voldemort: a vampire hunter in Albania, a voodoo queen in New Orleans, a snake charmer in India, a Seer in Greece---and somewhere on the way, a transformation.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?
