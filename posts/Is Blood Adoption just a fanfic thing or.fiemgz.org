So I have seen quite a few fan fictions that feature "blood adoption". But I have never read or heard about in the books, Pottermore or the movies. So is it just a thing that fan fiction writers came up with?


** It appears nowhere in canon content. Just one of those things that a popular early fic did that other people adopted.

** Part of what I enjoy about fanfiction is the extension of magical theory.

** Nowadays about 90 percent of HP lore is fanfic only, Rowling's a good author but she kinda sucks at lorebuilding. For example literally every single peice of info on spell creation is entirely non-canon

** Apart from Voldemort using Harry's blood in his rebirth, blood adoption ( or incorporating foreign DNA) isn't canon.

** Although it doesn'y actually appear in canon, it is actually a logical conclusion to make considering things like polyjuice and blood magic exist.
