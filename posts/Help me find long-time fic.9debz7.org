This is going to be a bit of a weird post. I am searching for a fic that I read about 8-10 years ago, that I have often thought about since, and if it's out there still, I'd love your help to find it.

It was a DARK Dramione, 50k+ words, originally published on AFF, but I can't remember if it was anywhere else too. I believe the original title was "The Unsaid" but the title may have changed as I can't find it under this.

I do not remember a lot of details about the fic itself, but the ending always stuck with me. I believe the majority of the fic took place in Hogwarts, and then it ends during the war in a dramatic scene. If you'd read it, I feel like you'd know.

*Spoiler alert below for ending*

The end of the fic results in Draco and Hermione going their separate ways, to opposite sides of the now-raging war, accepting they'd never see each other again unless as enemies. Later, Hermione is in a house that is raided by Death Eaters, Draco among them. I believe she was hiding under a table or something, where Draco found her. He is crying silently as he casts the killing curse.
