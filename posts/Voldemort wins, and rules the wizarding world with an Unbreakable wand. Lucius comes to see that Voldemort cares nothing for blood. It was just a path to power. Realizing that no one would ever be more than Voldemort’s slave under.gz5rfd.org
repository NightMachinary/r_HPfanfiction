** He should've seen it.

Or maybe he did, and just ignored it, like many of his companions, and now all suffered for it.

Voldemort ruled all of Britain, and soon Europe would follow, he honestly thought the Yanks would be able to resist for years, what with their greater numbers and martial disposition, the Chinese and Japanese Wizards too for much the same reasons, but Riddle had the Wand, and he couldn't be stopped, all it would take was time.

Meaning him, Draco and any future Malfoys would live in war, a bloody war that would erase anything good about the Wizarding World, the only ones with the power to stop him, Dumbledore and Potter, were gone. There was no hope.

But he found something, he was one of the few allowed to raid the Department of Mysteries and he found the key to fix all this, a powerful artifact from a bygone era one he was sure the Unspeakables had chosen to "forget" about, it took him weeks to make preparations, quite easy given the fact his Lord was out in the continent finishing off what was left of the European nations and he was given shore leave, Narcissa had left, and Draco was a broken man, he had nothing to lose.

He held the crystal butterfly in his hands, the reflection of it's multicolored wings coloring the room. The instructions were simple after the necessary spells and rituals were made, a few drops of blood and words in welsh and all he had to do was think about the moment he wanted to go back into, the travel only of soul and mind, so he had to be alive and conscious at the time.

He thought about that one /hard/, there was so much he could change, he didn't know enough to get rid of Riddle before he came to power that was before his time, and any records had been 'lost', so maybe he should take his chances for when he was actually threatened /after/ he marked his equal, and when said equal was entering their world.

He knew enough about Harry Potter to know the important events in his life, he even knew about how he was almost a Slytherin(Legilimency was a useful tool and the boy had told more than enough people about it), and he knew that Riddle only won because Potter didn't have the time, drive or knowledge to train himself to be able to beat him. Even starved and untrained the boy had almost won.

So now, when and where would be the best time and place for him to talk to Potter? To guide him, to use the Slytherin traits his son so lacked to bring the boy to his side, he had enough information to do so, the boy despised his relatives, was ambitious and would cling to anyone that was willing to be his friend. So after he came to Hogwarts was out of the question.

This also needed to happen /before/ Riddle 'returned'.

He knew roughly the steps his Lord would need to take to come back, he knew he had Horcruxes(what they were and their location was a mystery).

He remembered his son recounting how he had met who he had later realized was a then clueless Harry Potter before his first year, and that the gamekeeper had been escorting him.

He nodded to himself a plan coming to fruition in his mind, he would need to read a few things about those times, that felt so long ago, but the basic outline was there.

He closed his eyes and thought hard, this timeline would be rewritten, such was the power of the Butterly, and he only had one shot at this.

*** -----x-----

Harry Potter arrived at Madam Malkins, a bit unsure about wearing 'robes', the woman took him to take his measures, saying there was another client there.

He found a blond boy being measure and a man with long blond hair of the same tone seating in the bench and reading a newspaper.

When he entered the man lowered the newspaper, looked at him for a few moments before recognition appeared in his eyes and he smiled.

"Ah, Harry, good to see you, you have your mother's eyes."

Harry stood, confused and oddly happy, everyone talked about either the scar or his father, never his mother.

"Uh, I am sorry, sir, you knew her?"

Lucius Malfoy smiled wistfully. "Oh, where are my manners, Lucius Malfoy." he extended his hand and Harry shook it, "We went to school together, though I was a few years ahead, we became friends when I tutored her in Charms, she had quite a talent to it."

Harry smiled, he never heard about his mother before today, Hagrid talked about her but in that distant way, but this man, Mr. Malfoy seemed to know quite a bit about her and he had even taught her Charms.

So Lucius talked to Harry about his mother and father, introduced him to Draco and helped him choose formal and regular robes and overruled Hagrid as a Head Governor of Hogwarts so he could guide Harry during his shopping trip, he went with him to get his Wand(Aspen with the Feather from a Phoenix who only gave one other Feather!), all the while speaking about the House of Potter, and his ancestors, he then invited Harry for dinner, before which Harry got to fly a broom for the first time with the help of Draco.

Dumbledore would only find out about it the next day.

-----x-----

A month later, he managed to disguise his eagerness for news only enough so that Narcissa merely smiled and didn't tease him, when both Draco's eagle owl arrived, shortly followed by a familiar Snowy owl, he very carefully opened them and began to read.

"Dear Father and Mother, Hogwarts is incredible as you said it was, there are some people of the wrong sort, but that's a fact of life," Lucius snorted "I was, of course, sorted into Slytherin and, as Father said, so was Harry, this apparently shocked some people, though I am not surprised, with him by my side I think we will be a success here."

He read the rest of the letter, smiling that with just a few changes he had raised Draco to be much more bearable and he would openly admit, a much better person.

He opened Harry's letter, noticing Narcissa looked just as interested in this one, he smiled internally, she really had empathized with the innocent orphan and he knew Harry had liked her too. He looked over the writing, less neat than Draco's, but he could see Harry had been practicing his writing like he had been taught.

"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy, first, thank for the sweets, they were delicious, second, Hogwarts is incredible, I really love it here. Magic is everywhere, the opening feast was great, and I was sorted into Slytherin along with Draco, the other students seemed surprised though. "Now Lucius and Narcissa smiled, "I also met Theodore, Blaise, Daphne, and Tracy, they seem to be great too. Thank you for teaching how to properly greet people, and we are already talking about making our own study group like Mrs. Malfoy suggested, some other people in our year have been interested too."

Lucius smiled at that, it was all coming together "And Mr. Malfoy, thank you for that dueling book, I swear to practice every day, Theodore offered to help us with that, and Daphne too."

There were some other information as a child wont to write their parents and Lucius couldn't help feeling how happy Harry Potter was he had someone to write to. He mentally went through the adoption steps again, he would have to wait a while and weather whatever Dumbledore threw at him, he had already told Harry about his past, and he knew he had the boy's trust, in three weekends the boy had come to trust him and his family, Narcissa made the process much easier by providing the lacking motherly presence in his life without being overbearing.

Harry Potter trusted him and any attempt of Dumbledore to reverse that would backfire, though he suspected the old man would do nothing, he preferred the hands-off approach.

Lucius looked at Narcissa, who was rereading both letters with a real smile and probably already planning the box of sweets she would send both boys tomorrow.

Now all he had to do was visit with Severus and guilt-trip him into being decent with the boy, who behaved so much like Lily he would probably soften the man's heart if he only let it.

Lucius reflected on the past eighteen years, he had used some memory spells and Occlumency to recall everything, but, apart from few changes everything was almost the same, his almost secret friendship with Lily Evans hadn't changed much, except maybe for his own beliefs, he regretted not being able to save her, and he now was sure of the path he would take.

With the new information he learned, this time, he could secure a future where all would be free, he smirked at the thought that even Dumbledore would accept it over the one Lucius came from.

"What are you thinking about, Lucius?"

"The future, my love, the future." his plans had changed yes, but for the better.

After all, learning 'muggleborn' Lily Evans could talk to snakes was bound to change a few things.

** I mean he wouldn't need to go back in time to fix this.

Voldemort has followers for a reason. He clearly couldn't achieve his goals on his own.

This means that he's vulnerable to being turned on by his court. If Voldemort literally made everyone, including his followers, his slaves after taking over, then Voldemort is an idiot.

All Lucius would need to do is convince Voldemorts circle to support him in a coup. All he'd need to promise is that he'll treat Voldemorts followers much better than Voldemort does. They'd get huge shares from the government's coffers, land and won't get crucioed by Lucius.

Boom. Lucius is now the new leader and Voldemort is dead. A true pureblood reign is what follows.

This is how real dictatorships behave.

Also, risky though it was, it was less risky for him to engage in time travel than to try to stage a coup.

**** Regardless, Voldemorts reign would be limited with such policies. Dictators are only ever permitted by their court to stay in power. His immortality may be a stabilizing factor but there's nothing stopping any one of his followers making themselves immortal and replacing him. A dictator with an unhappy court is a short lived dictator.

***** Except Voldemort is immortal, and far stronger than even his whole inner circle combined, and a legilimens, so any plot against him would have to be so masterfully crafted that the chance to use time travel is safer than fighting him. Not to mention he is very paranoid. And controls his followers by fear.

And who said his other followers would want it? Maybe they like fighting and conquering their whole lives.

******* Why does an insane megalomaniac dictator with delusions of grandeur needs followers?

He can't be everywhere at once, he needs people to do the jobs he doesn't want to, administrative functions, spying, money, politics.

There are many reasons he needs followers even if he is more powerful than them.

Bellatrix is said to be the most powerful of them and Dumbledore shut her down in 3 seconds, he couldn't do the same to Voldemort.

There's also the fact he reads minds and is immortal, and as any paranoid dictator he would want to read the minds of his followers and very few are as good occlumens as Snape.

A coup against him would either backfire or turn into a bloodbath , why take that kind of risk if you have the chance to travel time and do it in a much safer way?

******** Eh, because dictatorships always turn into bloodbaths when the court isn't happy. Regardless, Voldemort isn't invincible and if he really was that powerful he wouldn't need funds, spying or administrative functions. People will just fall in line or be killed within a matter of hours. Voldemort is strong but people here are overestimating that strength.
