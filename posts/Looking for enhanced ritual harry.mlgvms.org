I'm trying to find a particular one where Harry gets captured by Voldemort then has a ritual performed on Harry that makes him stronger but also only able to follow Voldemorts orders. Harry is stronger now but still himself because his blood is also voldemorts blood and eventually escapes.

Hogwarts is also overrun with acromantula and the only spot safe near there is Hagrid hut because he buried Arragogs body near there and the Acromantula Avoid It.


** I've been looking for this fic as well, no luck so far
