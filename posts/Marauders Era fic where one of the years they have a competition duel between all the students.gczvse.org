Basically what the title says. It's a marauders era story, where during one of the years there's a competition. Every student gets a special wand so they don't hurt each other, but then they basically have a hunger games style battle with every student where they try and hit eachother with a spell, and when you're hit you're knocked out of the competition. That's not the only part of it since the story spans most of the years (I can't remember if it did all 7 or not).
