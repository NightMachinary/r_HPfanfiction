** Linkao3(runaway by draconunqumdormiens) Linkao3(succession by draconunquamdormiens)

Two in the same AU. Basic premise: the Blacks are connected to Voldemort, efforts are made to recruit Sirius, and he and James share a special bond (not slash). Runaway is the first story but Succession, the prequel, focuses more on the family. Both are incomplete and it's been a couple months since an update.

If you're looking for a similar tone to Blackpool, these are probably not be what you had in mind. Although they are very dark and angsty, they're also over-the-top, a hair ridiculous, and James and Sirius are both overpowered---but that's exactly what makes these stories so fun and meant entirely as a compliment. I genuinely laughed out loud, in public, at multiple points (maybe I just have dark humor), in between feeling /terribly/ sad for teenage Sirius.

  Three days after he turns fourteen, Sirius Black is called home, to spend some quality time with his loving family before he's killed by the Ministry's Disposal of Dangerous Creatures Squad.One month later, Orion Black is dead, Sirius is alive, and Walburga has no choice but give him the title he's never wanted - and along with it, a nice fat bullseye on his head. Sirius realises why he wasn't allowed to turn down the Ring of the Blacks: for that to happen, he must die.Not twenty-four hours into the Succession Ritual, he's seriously considering it as an option.Life is unfair like that.Notes: Sister fic to Thirteen Moons and plays between Chapters 3 and 6, prequel to Runaway, AU

** Since you've read Blackpool, you may or may not have read The Divine Comedian's other stuff. linkffn(They're Hiding Inside Me) is another great story she wrote, which also explores how an abusive family like the Blacks might use magic to enforce their will.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight. (Light Remus/Sirius.)
