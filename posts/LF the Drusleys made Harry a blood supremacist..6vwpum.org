I was reading someone's opinion that said that Snape became a racist because his father and probably many muggles were assholes to him. The idea has some merit, yet I'm not here to discuss it.

Could it be possible to read a good quality fic where is Harry the one who becomes resentful about muggles? Not necessarily a Dark wizard but at least a more mean or distrustful.


** It's a pretty common starting element in plenty of Slytherin!Harry stories, at least the ones that actually use the house as more than just a pallet-swapped Gryffindor. Not sure how many of those are actually good quality and recommendable though. Been a long time since I've seen one (though this exact thing is my current project at the moment).

** linkffn(7659033)its they shook hands, the first couple years are pretty similar to canon with slight divergences that only really start affecting the plot at the end of fourth year. This has harry befriend malfoy in diagon alley and be sorted in to slytherin. Because he doesn't really have any positive experiences with muggles or any experiences with muggleborns, he end up believing in blood purity until he starts doubting it quite a while later.

linkffn(11762850) when harry is a child the horcrux in his head starts talking to him. Harry starts believing "Tom" that muggles are filthy because of the dursleys and others in school. Its very well written and a really good fic, the sequel is also regularly updated

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry
