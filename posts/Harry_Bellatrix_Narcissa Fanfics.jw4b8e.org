So basically i was reading The Taste of your magic which is basically Bellatrix finding Harry when he was at the Dursleys an raise him to be the New better Dark Lord, and She and Cissy are raising him to be their husband and Dark King (Cissy betrayed Lucius, and He stole Draco) but the Author quit before he even got to hogwarts because he lost a bunch of chapters cause of a bug, Well my point is. Im searching for something similar that has a Harry/Bella/Cissy relationship, maybe some Andromeda or Tonks too idc if Harry is Dark, Grey or Light It can be That either time travel or in the present idc i just got so hook up in searching for this tipe of story even if it's a PWP smut please recommend something
