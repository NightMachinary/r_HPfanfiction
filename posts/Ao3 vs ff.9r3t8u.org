** Prefer AO3 because the tagging system is so much easier to use and find good fics, but FFN has more fics especially for the HP fandom. So I use both

**** It's actually quite simple, but there are many authors who abuse the system to get more exposure by spamming tags, especially characters and relationships. You have plenty of stories tagged with "Harry/background character" when they have one offscreen kiss or are referenced once in chapter 35.

When I exclude stories with Snape on FFN, that removes those where he is an important character. When I exclude him on AO3, that blocks every story which includes a potion class. The other issue comes from multiple relationships. When you exclude "Draco Malfoy/ Hermione Granger" and "Hermione Granger/Severus Snape", that does not block "Draco Malfoy/Severus Snape/Hermione Granger" for some reason.

**** Well I mainly use it to find specific tropes that I am interested in. I was bewildered at first too but when you get used to it, it's actually super helpful.

*How to filter:*

I'll google or type into the search bar "Harry Potter", which will make stories that have "Harry Potter" in their *title* turn up. Obviously I'm not looking for stories named "Harry Potter", but this is a quick way for me to access the "Harry Potter" *fandom tag* that shows up under the title of the story. I click on that and the site transports me to a page filled with stories with "Harry Potter" as the fandom, sorted by *date updated*. On the side there is a box with *filters*. I usually go sort by kudos, and add whichever relationships and tags I am looking for, eg. Harry Potter/Tom Riddle under relationships and BAMF!Harry under additional tags.

*How to read tags:*

The title and author show up first.

Under that is the fandom. There may be multiple

Then, in *bold,* warnings. In *grey highlight,* pairings. In regular text, additional tags. Usually tropes. Some authors will put silly tags that aren't meant to help people find this story but to explain other tags or make small comments. All tags are also links that can help find other fics with the same tags.

Then the summary, and under that, story stats (length, kudos, hits, comments, etc)

Hope this helps!

** I prefer ao3 for most of the reasons articulated by callmesalticidae. I'd add that I like how easy ao3 makes it to make tiny edits as opposed to ffn, with all the exporting and whatnot. It's just a few extra steps, but a few I'd rather not have to take them when I realize I forgot an apostrophe.

The quality of feedback that I get on ao3 tends to be better. I've seen great comments on other stories on ffn -- and I've gotten some really helpful comments there as well -- but the vast majority are from people begging for updates, comments that are painfully misspelled/grammatically incorrect to the point that I don't know what they say or, the most common, comments like "loved this chapter!" Those last are nice enough, really, but I tend to have better true critics on ao3 (and, for what it's worth, I don't write slash.)

I do despise the over-tagging on ao3. If there's more than a handful, I usually just scroll on past.

******** I'm not sure that's an accurate representation. If I want a pairing on FFN, I can find it. Because the amount of listable characters is limited, people are forced to put the ones that actually matters in the story. Ao3 allows so many that 95% of people put everyone and every relationship there so I have little clue if the characters or relationships are even relevant to the story.

Like constraints force straightforwardness which helps. My issue with Ao3 isn't so much slash and harems as it is that those stories inevitably list what I'm interested in. But it's most often nested in a story which mostly involves elements I have no interest in but the author had no self control. That's something that never happens to me on FFN. For all its issues, I can usually find the sort of thing I want as far as searching goes.

Lemme give an example. Say I want to read a Harry/Hermione story (my usual). Well ok, I pop that in (just checked on Ao3) and 6 results on the first search page list it as part of a massive character/relationship list. I just find it unhelpful and makes me not want to waste my time checking if that pairing is actually a prominent focus. It's not impossible to find, and I recently got into a number of stories there, but I admit it's excessive freedom of tagging irritates me. :/

********* I can definitely see how FFN's tag format would be better suited to people interested a specific pairing.

I sort-of have the opposite problem. I'm looking for fics with a specific character, and on FFN that character tag typically gets used as part of pairings and tropes that I'm not interested in. Also, FFN's search ends up missing a lot of stories where the character isn't even tagged because they are an enemy rather than a love interest. In those cases the more versatile tagging and exclusion options of Ao3 are better suited to my needs.

****** And then you miss the stories that mention Harry having a nightmare where he thinks about kissing Draco, but is otherwise is a completely non-Harry/Draco story because 90% of the stories are overtagged to hell.

And then you find Harry/Draco stories anyway because the author also tagged it "Harry/Draco/<character>" (whether it's due to an actual threesome or a situation similar to my first paragraph doesn't really matter)

I'll be honest, I LOVE the idea of Ao3 and it's tagging system, but it's users make it an absolute hell to use. My exclude tags shouldn't need 1000 filters just to get to a baseline similar to FFN filtering.

Are there any fics in which Harry has smutty dreams about someone and /doesn't/ end up having smutty personal encounters with them later on?

But joking aside, I agree that the freeform tagging system on Ao3 is a nightmare. When I search for fics on there I usually end up excluding 20 or more tags, which tends to be very cumbersome. I wish there were some sort of cabal in charge of approving tags, that way authors wouldn't use them like twitter hashtags.

But I still find Ao3's system more useful than the limited tagging on FFN, which has character tagging but no tagging for common tropes (creature inheritance, vampires, gender-bending, etc.) Those are the kinds of things that I want to exclude from my searches, so when I search FFN I almost always use Scryer instead.

** Archive of Our Own, hands down:

- Easy to upload or edit stories

- Limited html formatting so you can include links, art, strange fonts, and more.

- I don't tag my stories as extensively as others do, but tags are useful as both an author and a reader, and some people have such a knack for it that they make their tags a delight to read.

- By the fans, for the fans

- I can bookmark stories that aren't on Ao3

- I can set some bookmarks to "private"

- Easy to download stories in multiple formats

- Replies to comments become part of a thread so that you can see the whole conversation

- Ability to sequence stories as part of a series

- The mods are responsive.

Downsides:

- No default way to get rid of tags if you don't like them

- No PMs, just comments on stories

** My personal opinion is that as fanfiction frameworks /both/ FFN and AO3 are equally frustrating to use if for different reasons. What matters most and defines a choice for most ppl is the content which for these sites is way more didferent than their UI intricacies.

Personally, I equally loathe search on both of them. I have written my own layer over FFN's search (because I prefer ffn's /content/ ) that solves all my issues and I am very happy using that and if I never see FFN's search again I would be perfectly happy.

It leaves utterly ridiculous and unhelpful search results because everyone and their mother are listed and given a relationship. And that's to say nothing of the genre and trope tags...

It's just unnecessary. It would be an easy fix too. Just remove custom tags and replace them with hard coded options, limit the number of listable characters and such, and if more are needed just hide them in a collapseable "Added Details" spoiler.

** For Harry Potter, easily FF.N. Largely this is just because the beginning of FF.N happened to coincide with the first explosion of Potter fic, and so since more old stories were there, more new stories showed up. Yes, there are a lot of terribly written stories amidst all this, but between favorite lists, filtering, and communities I've never found it difficult to find something good and precisely to my tastes.

Meanwhile AO3-- which I don't dislike--- is going to have a more limited selection, much of it kinky and explicit. Nothing wrong with kinky and explicit per se, but there are very few popular HP couples I actually like, so gen fic is more my speed for this fandom.

And the walls of tags on AO3 are annoying. To be fair, not nearly as annoying as when FF.N refuses to get its house in order upon being infected with malicious code...

I hopped straight from LJ to AO3 and never used FFN to any significant degree, so I find its search function hopelessly inadequate in comparison to AO3's tags and have a really hard time finding interesting stories there. I also prefer the design and ease of uploading at AO3.

A lot of people complain about over-tagging on AO3, but it doesn't bother me much. I just scroll past if the tag list gets too long. My only major annoyance with AO3 is that I wish there was a way to mark primary vs secondary characters and ships, since there are a few ships I like that appear commonly as background pairings for other ships and it can be annoying having to filter out those to find stories that are actually about the ship I'm looking for. However, the new otp:true filter has made that much easier.

I looked at FFN and was put off by the no explicit content rule, so I went with AO3 which had to such rules. Eventually I also started posting to FFN, but I haven't changed any of my content. If it gets pulled down, then so be it.

I find that posting to AO3 is easier. FFN with having to upload a document and then link that document and then and then and then is just too cumbersome and annoying. Also, FFN removes certain bits of formatting, something I didn't discover until I'd posted my 39-chapter work in its entirety and deleted the associated documents. Yes, I know there aren't any scene separators, but I honestly can't be arsed to reupload all of those documents and make one little change. If it bothers you that much, read it on AO3.

** FFN frustrates me what with its tiny staff and thus effectively zero responsiveness from the staff (and the admin, only one guy), is therefore slow to react to serious issues like the current one.

At the same time, FFN is simple in design and in use. No stupid shit. Its search and tagging are more on the barebones side, but I vastly prefer that to AO3's retarded tagging system. You can target a search on FFN. AO3 will always spit out a wall of overtagged mess. FFN has no gimmicks: upload your story, receive feedback. Plus it's the YT of fanfic hosting (yes, I know it's older than YT), it has the advantage of a huge audience.

And in theory the tagging on Ao3 should help you find exactly what you are looking for, more often I'm just sorting through exactly what I don't want because people abuse the tagging system. So for me it's just easier to stick to FF where I have the basic tagging that's not as overused.

I've got fics on both, and I will say the upside Ao3 has is the ability to quickly introduce fandoms. After a few episodes of a new show, or a few days post-release of games/movies/books there's already a main tag for it.
