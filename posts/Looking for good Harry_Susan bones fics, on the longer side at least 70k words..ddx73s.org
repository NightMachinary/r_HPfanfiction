#+begin_quote
  Despair over the loss of his godfather in the Battle of the Dept. of Mysteries, followed by abandonment, isolation and hopelessness drive Harry to try and end his own life. Though death itself cannot halt his just vengeance against the Dark Lord, nor keep him from attaining that which he has ever been denied; someone to love and be loved by.

*** Considering he went on to write best-selling original fiction novels, I think it's safe to say you can, at the very least, see the beginnings of that level of quality with this story.

Personally, I like this story, and think it's better than about 99% of stuff on FFN, and much better technically than many of the stories frequently recommended on this sub.

Is the snarky protagonist who kicks 47 varieties of ass a bit overdone at this point? Probably. But considering this story is 15 years old, I still think it holds up well.

And I prefer his other stories over this one, but I think this is still worth a read compared to typical fanfics.

**** To be fair, this one was probably the worst of his Harry Potter ones.

Oh the quality of the writing is top notch. He definitely beats Sturgeon's law.

Of course, switching to original fiction probably suits his writing better.
