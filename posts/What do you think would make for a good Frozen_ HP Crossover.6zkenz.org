** Following the Battle of Hogwarts, it is discovered that the Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement continues to burn and appears to be getting hotter. The whole center of the castle is radiating like a reactor.

In an effort to preserve this iconic castle, Headmistress Minerva McGonagall recruits Harry, Luna, and Ginny to search for a legendary recluse, the only one who might possibly have the power to contain living fire: the undying Queen of Living Ice.

Luna leads them into far northern lands. When they arrive [no simple matter, of course], the Queen won't consider leaving her home to aid them until she is introduced to Ginny...

***** As if it's my fault the femslash came to mind. This is a /Frozen/ fanfic.

Actually, I was thinking along the lines of reuniting lost souls. Ginny's backstory includes a touch of destiny in her birth. If the undying Ice Queen never reconciled with her estranged sister and the land stayed locked in permanent winter, it might take a reincarnation of Anna to melt her heart.

Luna, of course, is there for comedy and area knowledge.

******* Never remove complications during the planning phase.

Imagine if Elsa's accidental heart-freezing killed Anna. She sits in seclusion for 200 years only to see her sister in the flesh once more (though speaking a different language) and seeks to apologize and ask for how to redeem her error and all.

Ginny might not be inclined to accept Luna's translation of all this, and then there's a matter of Ginny's ex-boyfriend who is also trying to respark some flames so he'll be defensive - "Step off, queenie, this is my hotness, and oh, by the way, can you maybe fight off a fire demon we released?"

Plenty of miscommunication about love vs. sex could ensue, when really the Queen just wants a platonic friendship and absolution.

** You could have Hans as a Weasley, since he mentions having a ton of brothers. If you want Harry and Co in it you could stick them in to thwart Hans' plan or you could have all the Weasleys go to Arendelle for Elsa's party and Harry and Hermione could go with them since they'd be on holiday from Hogwarts. With that one you could maybe have them helping Elsa with her magic or something. Idk.

** The royal family of Arendelle was distantly related to a squib. That's why there were still a few books about magic in their library. Elsa inherited a rare talent for Ice magic (much like being a Parselmouth). She is told to hide it because she shows no signs of having regular witch/wizard magic, and elemental powers are seen as unpredictable.

Hans was a Slytherin, or went to Durmstrang. Originally he was sent to Arendelle to find allies for the purebood cause and Voldemort. He recognizes Elsa's elemental abilities, and realizes that this is his chance to earn power and respect for himself. He tries to manipulate the situation to get Elsa to join Voldemort. When that doesn't work as well as he'd hoped, he tries to kill her. That backfires as well.

After a slight legal kerfuffle, it is realized that Arendelle does not technically fall under the MoM's rule. Elsa is allowed to show magic to her subjects. She begins campaigning for the repeal of the SoS, and helps in the fight against the Death Eaters.

I don't know if she would go to Hogwarts or meet the trio. There might be an occasional appearance by an Order member, or Charlie looking for Snow Dragons. I feel like the main fight would be against Death Eaters stationed near Durmstrang. We don't know exactly where Durmstang is, but it has a focus on the dark arts and a ship that can travel long distances. I also feel like the Duke of Wesselton might be a distant Weasley relation, from a long line of squibs. His superstitious nature comes from the fact that his family has always believed magic exists, even if they don't remember much about it.

I did not know I had so many thoughts about this until I wrote them out.

** Harry lives two lives asynchronously. Every time he sleeps he synchronizes memories with his connection to his other body. Just like every time you wake up you have memories of the day before. Every time Harry wakes up he has two days worth of memories.

His other life is as Elsa and Anna's younger brother.

He also discovers that the veil sent Sirius to his other world. The reason that world has a historical problem with evil sorcerers is because the veil is sometimes used as a method of execution which really just ships one worlds evil sorcerer to another.

**** never heard of awake. i just remember thinking how the dynamics of having multiple bodies would work without fundamentally altering a person to be controlling multiple bodies. my solution was asynchronous knowledge transfer where sleeping updates the "knowledge cloud" and downloads any memories you don't already have.

things get neat when you consider how something would feel from a first person perspective. Like imagine today was tuesday when you thought it should be wednesday then realize the previous two days actually happened simultaneously but it feels like they didn't because they are separate experiences.

The mechanic of having two waking lives is indeed interesting, but in this context, what the hell is the point? There is no point besides wanting to do an HP/Frozen crossover. I can't see how this would be any different than just transporting Harry to the Frozen dimension or reincarnating him. It's just a pointless gimmick that I can't see leading anywhere truly interesting.

***** I think it would make Harry's childhood a bit different. When he sleeps, he's in a world that doesn't persecute him. I could see a lot of developmental child psychology coming into play and shaping him into someone a bit different.

It's an interesting concept, even if it might fall flat in its execution.

****** Sounds extremely dry and uneventful. In order to make an awesome mechanic even slightly interesting, you have to show a vast portion of Harry's childhood in both worlds just to get a slightly different characterization in the HP universe.

Just watching Harry grow up in the Frozen universe is an incredible waste of potential. Why would you want to waste half the chapters rehashing canon on top of that?

The interesting intersection points between Harry's and Elsa's timelines, it seems to me, is either during the events of Frozen or after the events of both worlds when both have position in their societies (depending on if you want to drive the plot and what ages you want them to be).

******* Personally, I'll probably just fuse the worlds. Make Arendelle Norway, which is the country it was heavily based on, and explore Elsa's family as a staunch dark family that is supporting Voldemort's movement by funneling funds through the Malfoy family.

When Elsa's powers start to come up, they hide from the Dark Lord to prevent her from being used as a weapon. The parents are arrested after his fall, and Elsa and Anna (8 and 5 at the time) inherit the throne of Norway. I think there's a lot of options here. Uniquely, Elsa's family could be in the position where they govern Norway and are very influential in the magical world, acting sort of as an intersecting world between both worlds.

Yeah, I may go with this. Not sure, though.

Why would they hide else from Voldemort if they are a staunch dark family?

********* Allow me to explain my mindset.

1.) Why would they hide else from Voldemort if they are a staunch dark family?

When I say a staunch dark family, allow me to explain what that means to me.

a.) Holds the dark arts close to their chest b.) Is, whether because of bigotry and hate, or some other reason, is against muggle borns coming into wizarding society.

For this royal family, it would be the latter. They would not have the same sense of self-importance compared to muggles because they are able to see and understand the technological advances that are beginning to catch up to magic (in some ways).

Their stance is that it runs the risk of exposure, and thus they support anti-muggle factions with cash.

They support the isolationism that would rise from Voldie's beliefs and methods, but not the hate-driven propaganda.

I simply don't like all dark families conforming to a specific trope/ cliche.

2.) I'm not as certain on this point, yet. This idea is still more of a thought than anything else.

But, I can see them being arrested by magical authorities, who would not have much trouble orchestrating some kind of scene (a fake assassination?). In other words, the death of their muggle identities. When/ if they are released they still have money and influence in the magical world.

Vice-versa, they could bribe their way out, but the muggle world already believes them to have passed, and thus they have to keep themselves to the magical world.

Anything can be written well or written badly. People will often post things like that as some sort of negative criticism. But just examine what those same statements actually say.

"I can't see it." is the same thing as "I lack the creativity to imagine this scenario."

"What's the point?" is the same as "My insight is insufficient to deduce a reason."

I see this as a person undermining their own self and not even realizing it. Often they think this is somehow a valid criticism.

** Sirius as Elsa, Regulus as Anna. Bellatrix would make a good Hans, I think? Or else drop all pretense of metaphor and cast Voldemort as Hans, with Regulus being tempted by evil directly. James is Olaf, to continue being friends with Sirius. Cursed Remus will do for Sven, and Muggle-born Lily as outcast Kristoff. I'm thinking Hagrid for the giant snowman, and possibly Snape as the Duke? Which leaves us without a clear spot for Peter...idk there.

Also we're kicking out all the romance; this is now a story about a bunch of teenagers discovering that sometimes, the love that saves the day is the love you have for your friends and family--just like it was Elsa and Anna's love in the original movie.
