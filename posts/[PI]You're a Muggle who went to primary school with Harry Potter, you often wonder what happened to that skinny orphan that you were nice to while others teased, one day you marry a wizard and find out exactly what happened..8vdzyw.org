The Aurors appeared with a loud /pop,/ hardly disturbing the still night air. They immediately set about their task, canvassing the residents of Seaton Close about the recent events. Maxine couldn't help but stare at them, despite having seen her husband apparate several times already. But it wasn't the act of apparition that had distracted her; it was the Aurors.

"Ma'am?" urged the auror who was assigned to question her, impatiently tapping his toes.

"Oh, sorry! I was just...I thought I saw someone I know. Erm...yes, it was around half six. My husband had just arrived home from Quidditch practice. We both heard a commotion outside. Looking out the window, we saw everyone gathering on the street and staring at number 46's roof, so we went outside ourselves to see what had happened. Everyone was white as a sheet!"

"And would you please state, for the record, who your husband is?"

"Yes, it's that gentleman over there, Roderick Sheppard" she stated, waving an arm to where her husband was being questioned. He met her gaze and nodded to her, his brow furrowed. She had never seen him more shaken and concerned.

As she spoke, a quill and parchment hovering next to the auror took down the entire exchange.

"Erm...officer?" she started.

"Ma'am, I'm not a policeman. I'm an Auror. You can call me by my name. Travers. Benjy Travers."

"Right. Benjy...what's going on? Should I be worried? How's Mrs. Spavin doing?"

Benjy took a moment to look over his shoulder at number 46. His eyes darted towards the sky above the house for a brief moment, then fell back onto Maxine.

"You're a muggle, correct?" Benjy began. Maxine nodded. "Well, the mark you saw over Mrs. Spavin's house earlier was the Dark Mark. It was used by the followers of a dark wizard who brought terror to the wizarding world for decades, until he and his followers were defeated three years ago."

Maxine inhaled sharply. "You mean Voldemort?" Benjy, flinching, nodded his agreement. "And what about Mrs. Spavin? Will she be ok?"

Benjy paused, making Maxine fear the worst. "I'm afraid I can't answer that right now, Ma'am. We're trying to treat her as best we can."

She caught sight of Roderick, who had finished being questioned, jogging over to her. Reaching her arm out to him, he accepted it and squeezed, putting an arm round her for comfort.

"We'll let you know how we get on, Ma'am. In the meantime, if you see anything suspicious, please let us know." Benjy said, making his way towards the rest of the aurors who had finished canvassing.

Maxine and Roderick watched as they started to apparate back to the ministry and her neighbours head back indoors. Sighing, they both decided to do the same.

"Max?"

Maxine turned around to see an auror jaunting over to her. His dishevelled hair fell out in tufts over his brilliant green eyes, his glasses counted each street lamp he passed. Next to him jogged another auror. This one had bright red hair and a long nose, and was slightly taller than the other.

"Max, is that you?" gasped the nearest auror, slowing down as he arrived by their front door. As he drew closer, Maxine could make out the scar on his forehead in the unmistakable shape of a lightning bolt.

"Harry! I thought I recognised you earlier!" she exclaimed, as the ginger auror approached. Almost out of breath, he looked first at Harry, then the couple, Harry again, then stopped when he got to the couple, stretching out his hand. "Ron Weasley" he gasped.

Maxine and Rod took turns shaking his hand and introducing themselves, then she turned back to Harry. "Can I invite you in for a cup of tea? I haven't seen you in years!"

She looked over at Rod, and could have sworn his eyes were almost about to pop out of his head. When she first heard about Harry, she had told Rob they'd gone to primary school together but he'd never believed her.

Harry's smile vanished quickly. "Sorry Max, can't stay. Ron and I have to get back to the ministry for our de-brief. But how about next weekend?"

After a quick back and forth, they agreed the date for their meeting and promised each other a proper catch-up then. Smiling, he waved goodbye and /popped/ into thin air, along with Ron.

---------------

"Friend of yours?" Ron asked, halfway through a slice of toast. The de-brief had gone on for hours and they were both famished.

Harry paused. "You could say that...we went to muggle school together. Before Hogwarts." He stopped to wipe some crumbs from the side of his mouth. As he did so, he couldn't stop his mind from wondering back to when he was a child.

/Dudley and his gang had broken Harry's arm in a scuffle, and he'd been sent to the nurse. Maxine was the only one who'd visited him, bringing him some sweets to cheer him up. She genuinely seemed to care how he was doing. The next day, his arm was completely healed. She had brought him a "Get Well Soon" card and seemed as confused as he was when he said his arm was all better. She had hurriedly tried to hide the card, but ended up giving it to him anyway, after changing it to a "Got Well Soon" card./

/Harry came in to school that day with his hair shaved off. Max had given him her hat when she saw how unhappy his new haircut had made him. He returned her hat the next day. Max had remarked at how much the wig looked like his own hair, and was surprised when she tugged at the hair gently to find it didn't fall off./

/Maxine walked Harry home after they'd found him suddenly on the roof of the school. She was concerned that he might be having trouble at home, and offered to have Harry stay over at her house for a few days./

/Everyone in school was spreading rumours about Harry, that he'd set the snake free during their school trip and that he'd tried to speak to it. Maxine found it funny, and they laughed about it together./

/A girl with brilliant green eyes and auburn hair was approaching a boy with dark hair. She reached out to touch the side of his forehead, which was bleeding from the wound he'd just received. She gently brushed aside his hair to reveal the wound. She hurriedly spun around as someone called her name. "I'm coming, James!" she exclaimed, before setting off, leaving the boy alone./

"Potter, Weasley, Robards wants a word. It's urgent" shouted Benjy from across the hall. "We think they might have been copycats" he continued as he neared the duo, shaking his head.

"What about the lady, Mrs. Spavin?" Ron asked, trying to finish off the last morsel of toast.

Benjy broke off. "They performed the cruciatus curse on her before leaving the mark. She's going to be fine, if a little shaken."

The look on Ron's face conveyed everything Harry was feeling. Clenching his fists to stop himself shaking from anger, he and Ron made their way towards Robards.

** Isn't there a oneshot with this same premise, but far more happy? If I recall correctly, the Muggle is out with her husband, when they run into Harry, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron. It turns out that her husband works for the Obliviators, and they have a friendly chat at either a bar or a pub.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
