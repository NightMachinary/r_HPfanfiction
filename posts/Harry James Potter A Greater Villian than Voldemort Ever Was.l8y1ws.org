As the title suggests, I am looking for a fic with Harry as the villain or antagonist of the story.

I do not want those edgy "Dark" Harry James Potter-Black-Slytherin-Griffindor-Name-with-too-many-Names. If he has some ancestors, that is fine, but I do not want that to be his entire identity.

I want Harry to think and be like Heath Ledger's Joker by creating situations that force people to reveal who they truly are. His goal is to systematically destroy the world that has treated him as a punching bag and Messiah at their convenience. Maybe he disagrees with the Wizarding World on protecting Muggles, wants revenge against the government, or desires to teach the Wizarding world his ways of peace...by force. Anything is fair game.

The public absolutely fears Harry. Some treat him as a joke, but they do not last long. For the rest, he is the one that boggarts and Dementors fear and avoid.

After the first war with Voldemort dying or Harry killing him during the Battle of Hogwarts, the story can take place. Voldemort can be alive, but I do not want them working together. If Voldemort is alive, Harry wants to kill him for killing his parents, representing everything bad with the Wizarding world, or because he does not like him.

For pairings, anything is fair game except for Harry/Ginny, Harems whose entire purpose is to look pretty by his side (Harems and Polyamorous relationships are not the same things), and slash (unless the story is absolutely worth it and the pairing is not Adult/Kid who does not better).

The story can AU, Crossover (if I can follow the story without knowing too much, the better), Time Travel, Genderbent, Dimensional travel, etc., are completely welcomed.

Thank you everyone in advance.

** I once read a story where Harry went to Hufflepuff and was their lord. It was short, and set during Triwizard Tournament where he meets Voldemort in the cemetery, laughs all of, and gives his blood willingly to have some fun. Can't recall the name but it was written by one of the more well known ao3 writers!

** I can't remember what these are called, hopefully someone can name them for me. Firstly a post Battle of Hogwarts fic where Harry can't die due to already 'missing his train' and is also missing part of his soul due to being hit by the killing curse as a baby, leading to insanity.

â€‹

The second was a Vampire! Harry where vampires are more the Hellsing or Castlevania kind, complete with increadibly visceral descriptions of massacres and torture. He had a harem with Luna and Hermione as well as a few other women (can't remember who), but he'd twisted them into dark abominations of themselves. I think Luna was the torturer, for example.

I am looking for a Harry that has unknowlingly created his own side. I like the idea that there is no good or bad factions, just ideas that can be taken to the extremes.

There have been some extremely well written fics that explore the idea of the "Pureblood" and "Dark" ideology and potrays them as people who wish to conserve their culture, but some bad apples are extremists or criminals and results in the Death Eater movement (Novocaine).

The villian Harry that I am looking for is not good or bad, his ideology just happens to result in the devastation of the Wizarding world.

** There's a pretty good alternate universe one out there in which Tom Riddle is the BWL, Bellatrix and Lucius are his friends, and Harry is the Dark Lord (who Dumbledore opposes), and canon Harry gets shoved into the mix (while his AU counterpart is still waging war with his followers, including many of our other Light heroes). I just can't remember the name or author. Everything is flipped: purebloods are oppressed and Harry is the champion of Muggleborns (but I think he was anti-Muggle). Harry's parents died in Grindewald's War (birth dates are messed with--Dark Lord Harry is older than young Tom).

** I hope you're still looking for recommendations! I saved this on mobile a month ago hoping to come back when I had time. I can't recommend anything that exactly fits your request, but I'll explain why I recommended each and where the rec fails to meet your request so you can decide if it's worth your time.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/839169][The Uncle]] is a little similar to the one recommended by [[/u/Kathema1]]. Remus isn't given room to flourish at Hogwarts and becomes a crime lord. He adopts Harry as his protege. The summary reads: "Remus had the Dursleys whacked. Tactfully, of course, and well after Harry left the house."
- I haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5778006/1/Smoke-and-Mirrors][Smoke and Mirrors]] in ages, but I remember genuinely enjoying it. Basically, Harry is a street kid who grows up in Muggle gangs. If memory serves, he becomes a lieutenant or higher in a criminal organization (complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly][Tread Softly]] is about Harry's transformation into the exact character you described. This is pretty old.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is an extremely imaginative AU that is updated pretty frequently. I enjoyed this so much I read the author's crossover with Naruto. I don't even watch anime. I'm a little hesitant to recommend it because I think it has a different feel than you're looking for. It doesn't feel very dark. Lily's name isn't spoken under breaths. However, she gives precisely zero fucks about what people think is "ethical" or "just". Also, the general public is terrified of her, they just don't recognize her based on her nom de guerre.

Happy reading!

** I can imagine a story like this with Tomarry.

Voldemort died but as a punishement for cheating death, he can't go to the afterlife and is forced to follow his ancient vessel as a ghost/spirit for eternity, under his teenager form. Kinda like Ryuk.

Maybe Immortal Master of Death Harry would be great for this fic.

Tom teasing Harry for getting consumed by the darkness and Harry teasing Tom because he became the Dark Lord Tom could only dream to become.

Everyone being conscious of the fact that what makes Harry infinitely more lethal than Voldemort ever was is that Harry isn't afraid of Death.

He would rather not to but he is willing to die if it means breaking his arch-nemesis' no killing rule.
