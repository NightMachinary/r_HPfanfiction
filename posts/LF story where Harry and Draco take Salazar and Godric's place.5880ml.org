I read the first few chapters of a story where Harry picks up the sword of Griffondor or something, and he and Draco are taken to the past into the founder's places. They meet the other two, and begin planning to build Hogwarts, while trying to hide that they aren't who they say they are. I didn't get far, so I don't really know how it plays out in later chapters, but i know it had at least double digits in term of number of chapters posted.

Thanks in advance!
