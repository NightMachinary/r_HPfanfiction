#+TITLE: [Searching] Iâ€™m looking for a story where Harry, Neville, and 2 girls they are dating/married live in a series of trucks that form and extra-dimensional world. They somehow find James and Lily in a enchanted coma inside an inherited trunk that was added. Having been transferred rather than killed.

I remember the trunks formed while mansions and surrounding terrain and while it was many trunks once inside it was basically one big world. I think they had lots of house elves helping them and I seem to remember them having a car of some sort to travel in the trunk world. I think the girls were Luna, Tracey, or Daphne, but I'm not sure at all.

It is highly likely I read it on FanFiction.net, but it may have been ao3. I probably read this originally in 2015-2016 and I usually only read completed docs and ones more than 20,000 words, however this is not a strict rule.

Any help finding this would be greatly appreciated as I've been looking thru my favorites and follows for weeks with no luck.

Edit: spelling


** I giggled when I read trucks in the title. I imagined redneck wizards.

** This sounds suspiciously like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7144149/1/Not-Normal][Not Normal]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1806836/Radaslab][Radaslab]], a story that has an uncompleted and probably abandoned sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9606531/1/The-New-Normal][The New Normal]].

It is a harem-fic (kinda) and there is both significant world-building and political maneuvering involved.

It also has a Manipulative!Dumbledore, but the fic as a whole is well written.

** That sounds...really weird, but could be a very interesting read if well done.

Also, it reminds me a bit of a concept from Significant Digits, where long narrow expanded spaces were nested inside each other in order to add up to a substantial volume.
