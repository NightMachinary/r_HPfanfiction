Hello all! I've been looking for a this fic for a while and I hope you guys can help me out! In this fic, Hermione's time turner breaks durning a fight with Ron. The broken time turner causes time to be frozen around Hermione. She is able to move around while time is frozen. Being Hermione she goes to the library to figure out what went wrong. After reading all the books in the library without finding a way out of her predicament, she goes to the ministry to research. She finds out all the ministry's secrets after reading classified files and books contained there, but she didn't find a way a to start time again. She then travels to various other library's to research. She doesn't know how much time passes while time is frozen, and she doesn't age. I remember that she eventually starts time again, but can't remember how. I can't remember how the fic ends, which is why I wanted to find it and reread it. I hope this is enough information for you guys. Thanks for all the help redditors!!

  The war is finally over. Hermione just wanted to enjoy the peace, sit back, read and study, but that never happens. Hermione's wish is granted in a roundabout way, but becomes a curse as much as it is a gift. How long does it take to break Hermione Granger? How long until she actually retaliates? - Slightly Dark!Hermione/Bellatrix - Completed

** Though it's told from Harry's POV, not Hermione's, and it's not quite the same setup, elements of this premise resemble those of linkffn(My Name is Harry Potter by KwanLi).
