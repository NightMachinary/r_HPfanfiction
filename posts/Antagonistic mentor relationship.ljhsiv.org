I'm rewatching Vinland saga rn and Thorfinn and Askeladds relationship is super interesting. For those of you that haven't see it basically Askeladd kills Thorfinns father in front of him and then at like 5 Thorfinn swears to kill him. Through some plot shit Thorfinn ends up serving under Askeladd in order to get Askeladd to duel him so he has a chance to kill him after each one of his accomplishments, successful missions, etc... He ends up turning Thorfinn into a great warrior and Thorfinn saves his life on multiple occasions because he wants to be the one to kill him.

Not verbatim but does a relationship similar to this exist in any fics cuz the character dynamic is great.


** Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) fits from what I remember? Harry is clearly uncomfortable around Voldemort, but Voldemort insists on mentoring him. I don't really remember how much Harry trusts him by the current end state of it though, it's been a while since I've read it and it's a real undertaking
