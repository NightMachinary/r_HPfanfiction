I lost my voice at a protest march yesterday, so for the time being I'm going about my day mute, and as I was walking between lectures I started thinking about how the books treat Mad-Eye Moody and how much disability would actually affect someone in the wizarding world.

So, for example, we definitely see a very real sense of a /new/ disability - to us, the reader - in the very idea of the Squib. I mean, that's very much a disability in the sense we'd use it, with very little that can be done about it, and Squibs are very much ostracized from society as a /result/ of this. Characters like Argus Filch obviously fret over how they're perceived and desperately grasp for what little magic they might be able to produce.

In Moody, we see actual prosthetics. The magical eye makes a lot of sense, because people often take on a prosthetic that can do something different to what the original element might have performed...

But Moody walks with a very pronounced limp, and from what we can perceive his prosthetic leg is fairly ordinary. Like, it just seems to be plain wood with a clawed foot for balance.

How curable are disabilities within the series?

For example, with Moody, we know that a lot of the damage was likely from nasty curse damage, meaning that it may have been very difficult to heal...

Like, St Mungo's is a big hospital, but it's likely they can't just cure /everything/, because magic isn't as simple as waving a wand and fixing everything. It has its own rules and functions and patterns, meaning that healing certain problems comes down to a slow-moving science as much as anything. There are terrible magical diseases within the community that could well cause defects like deafness, muteness, blindness. Is there a text to speech spell, like the inverse of a Dictaquill? Do wizards use sign language? For a character who is deaf and/or mute, is non-verbal magic harder or easier? Is it taught from the beginning?

Are there guide crups? Guide kneazles? Do wizards use a web of magic in the same way some blind people use elements of echolocation? How does the wizarding world treat the disabled? Would a character without legs have a wheelchair, or some kind of completely different way of moving? Or are individuals like these confined to their beds, like they might have been a few hundred years ago?

And physical problems aside, do you think the wizarding world would medicate mental illness, or just cast it aside entirely? People with schizophrenic or depressive or anxious disorders - do you think the wizarding world understands that these problems are physical as much as mental? Do you think the mentally ill are locked up in asylums or denied assistance entirely?


** rowling said this is one of the first things she thought of.[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/illness-and-disability]] it basiaclly says that a wizard could catch anything a muggle can but would be able to cure all of it and that magical damage is more serious.

#+begin_quote
  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening. This is the reason that Gilderoy Lockhart, victim of his own mangled Memory Charm, has permanent amnesia, why the poor Longbottoms remain permanently damaged by magical torture, and why Mad-Eye Moody had to resort to a wooden leg and a magical eye when the originals were irreparably damaged in a wizards' battle; Luna Lovegood's mother, Pandora, died when one of her own experimental spells went wrong, and Bill Weasley is irreversibly scarred after his meeting with Fenrir Greyback.

I think that includes every mental illnes and we see with moody that magical items for disabled do exist(probably less usefull for regular wizards).

For example, a Muggleborn Deaf kid coming to Hogwarts may well not consent to be suddenly "cured" of their Deafness. If someone has schizophrenia, which would occur in adulthood, how would it be DEALT with? Depression and mania begin to manifest around 15-20 - what would the response be? Even if there /was/ a cure, how quickly would it be administered? What are the tests?

**** there are spells that manipulate your actions and make you think its your idea,spells that can rewrite all of you memories, spells that manipulate your emotion,spells that let you perceive things differently, transfiguration allows you to entirely change the molecular structure of anything into almost anything(Rowlings words). The magic in harry potter has few limits that we know of. And we have no idea how they detect any injuries and diseases, for all we know they may have a quill that writes down anything wrong with you (it certainly would fit in with the harry potter magic). But the magic we know should be able to able to heal anything wrong with the body, brain and anything caused by experiences. And Rowling said she gave harry glasses because she herself had glasses and wanted to finally have a charachter who has glasses but isnt the brainy one. So she probably added glasses as wish fulfillment in disregard of what her magic was capable of.

And there are probably magical items for people with magically caused deafness that could be used for a muggleborn who doesn't want his deafness cured

***** This is one of the things that is kind of frustrating when writing fan fiction. The magic in HP is pretty much limitless which makes for very boring stories, so authors have to come up with limits on their own which may or may not make sense. For example, the glasses. Ron didn't know what a dentist was because wizards don't need them--why do they need glasses, then? As soon as Harry landed at Hogwarts, it seems like Madame Pomfrey could have done a spell or gave him a potion or whatever to correct his vision; she regrew his arm bones, after all.

Why does it matter that the Weasleys have a load of kids? With the exception of food, can't they just conjure up the school robes and other mundane things? There have been several times when my beta reader or husband reads something over and they ask, "Couldn't Harry just xyz this with magic?" and then I have to figure out a reason why he can't. I guess in the end, it forces authors to be more creative within the confines created by JKR.

Regarding disabilities, we've already observed that not all mental disabilities can be remedied by magic. Yes, the Longbottom's damage was spell-based, so that fits within JKR's explanation, but what about Ariana? She was traumatized in some fashion by Muggles--why couldn't that mental anguish be remedied by magic? Of course it couldn't because JKR needed a reason for the Dumbledore patriarch to go to Azkaban and she was a conduit for Albus's greatest failure.

As for deafness, there's a debate about deaf culture and whether children should be cured of their deafness through cochlear implants or other devices or allowed to live and thrive in the deaf culture--do wizards have the same thing? Seems doubtful as it would be a logical assumption that deafness could be easily managed if found in a child. But what about a deaf Muggleborn child coming to Hogwarts? Does Madame Pomfrey meet them on the steps of the Great Hall and restore their hearing? What if the child didn't want to be cured and was perfectly happy being deaf?

There's a lot of questions that are yet to be answered!

Well, with that one one /could/ argue that the trauma of whatever they'd done to her made her into an Obscurial, which would be magical in nature, but we can't really say for sure without knowing the details.

******** Well, it's ... hard to say if it actually is a viable solution to the issue. The lexicon states that in 1920s there's been an attempt to treat an Obscurial via removing her Obscurus, which in my opinion suggests that even if you were to try erasing the memory it may very well end up doing diddly because the Obscurus would still be there and it would still do its thing. It /may/ be that this is the solution that nobody's ever thought of, and if someone used that in a fic that was humour-based I'd probably accept it without batting an eye, but yeah, considering that an Obscurus is some kind of weird magical parasite thing that's been created from their magic rather than just an ongoing effect of their trauma (i.e. trauma led to its creation, no info if it's required for continued existence), I find it unlikely that erasing the affected witch or wizard's memories would at that point do anything more than confuse them.

It does give us the possibility of it having been treatable in Ariana's case had their father started with a memory charm instead of going off to get revenge and getting Azkabinned since it /may/ have been in time then (assuming that she was an Obscurial), but that's just speculation on my side.

And I don't know that it's a coincidence that barring Dumbledore (who wears half-moon spectacles, which are generally worn by those who are long-sighted and need them to read, and are definitely the sort of glasses favoured by those who need reading glasses in their old age), a lot of those wearing glasses are either lacking money or very busy on their jobs.

Percy Weasley wears spectacles; Harry wears spectacles, and neither are ever said to be particularly special glasses except that Percy's are horn-rimmed, and that's just an old-fashioned style. Rita Skeeter wears nice-looking glasses, but they're never attributed anything fun.

***** With how advanced healing magic is, I really don't think curing eyesight would be difficult in the wizarding world, but JKR isn't the best world builder, so you have multiple people with glasses. Even though those same people didn't need glasses once they took polyjuice potion.

One fic I read came up with a good explanation for this: most wizards didn't bother to correct their eyesight because the pain of doing so was practically unbearable. I don't remember the name or much else about it, except for that eyesight curing potion. It was a severitus fic where Snape sent the cure to Harry. The potion was in two little eye cups. You had to raise the cup and hold it to your eye. The longer you held it, the better your vision became, but also the longer the excruciating pain went on, so only the bare minimum amount of time was recommended to hold the potion to your eyes.

Why couldn't they just take a mundane knife, chop off a bit more of the stump to get rid of the tainted wound, and /then/ regrow it?

And cosmetic surgery - why the hell are there ugly witches and wizards when potions and spells can restructure someone's face? You'd think that after thousands of years of vain magicals and their society's magical research (which isn't nearly as dependant on infrastructure as scientific research), you'd have enough potions and spells that a mere 5/10 witch could win a /Ms. Universe/ pageant while a true 10/10 or a veela would exceed any level of beauty attainable by a muggle.

*** With regards to cosmetic surgery: There's a couple options here that magicals could use.

The first that comes to mind is transfiguration, but the exact limits of it are a bit iffy with regards to permanence so there may be some impeding factor here aside from the difficulty.

Next we have charms. Here I can see mages using minor illusions to alter their looks like a sort of magical make-up. Making an illusion move with your face is probably rather tricky. A delicate spell like that would probably also be easy to dispell. Imagine going to scratch your nose and accidentally disrupting your delicate illusion hiding your uni-brow and acne. There's probably a goodly number of miscellaneous charms that help with a wide variety of beautification tasks.

Then there's medical magic. This would help heal up wounds, scars, and other disfigurements, but I don't really see it as doing more than restoring someone to full health.

Now we get to potions, which is where things get really interesting. The first potion we see is the boil cure potion, which presumably treats acne. There's probably a bunch of other potions that do specific things like moisturize skin, give you just the right tan, remove unsightly hair, whiten your teeth, give you amazing hair (Sleakeazy!), burn off excess fat (maybe not, see Slughorn, though maybe burn is rather literal here and it hurts like bitch), etc.

Then we get to actual transfiguration potions. I imagine Polyjuice is just one example of an entire category of shape-altering potions such as the Shrinking Solution. This is where you would find a means of permanently altering your looks. Even though we know polyjuice has a limited duration when brewed properly, we also know an improper brew using a non-human genetic sample can really fuck you up. This implies that polyjuice is a very specialized potion but that there could potentially be similar brews that specialize in other effects such as non-human transformation, permanent transformations, or even partial transformations.

The challenge of making a 'beatification potion' then lies in defining your end goal. Polyjuice (and its presumed variants) relies on a genetic sample, so you could easily make yourself beautiful at the cost of looking like someone else entirely or even just partially rather than just a prettier version of yourself. I could see maybe a potion that makes you more symmetrical being possible, but I think we hit a limit with making precise changes like altering the slope of the nose and nothing else.

The final thing to keep in mind is cost. Just like plastic surgery is expensive, these highly specialized potions would be expensive as well. We know polyjuice at the very least uses some rare ingredients and is considered a difficult brew. This would drive up the price for anyone looking to buy it from a professional potioneer, and a potion with permanent effects is something you would want an expert to brew.

In conclusion, a 5/10 probably could make themselves into a 10/10 with a lot of daily work, personal skill, and enough money to throw around to get profession help. So it's not much different than the muggle world in the end. Though it may skew a bit higher due to more accessible treatments you're still going to get a wide range of appearances.

Also, I can't believe I just wrote what amounts to a small essay on wizarding cosmetics, lol.

**** I had a reply essay of my own written up, then my browser fckd up and deleted it before I could post. Here's the shorter version.

--------------

We probably haven't seen everything that magic can do in this world. Our sample of magic users is limited to a pool of middle/high schoolers, teachers, and terrorists --- not exactly medical professionals. Also, stopping to explain "everyone os beautiful and here's why" would have detracted from the story itself, especially when JKR uses physical appearance as a shorthand for character traits.

But there are things that imply magic is more versatile than we've seen. For example, you can turn an inanimate object into a living animal. If you can do that, why couldn't you animate a makeup illusion to move naturally with your face? And charms is all about changing the properties of things, one of which is "position." Using a mix of transfiguration and charms, I'd imagine it's entirely possible to sculpt flesh and bone as if it were clay and permanently keep it in that shape.

Also, the wizarding world partially acts like a post-automation society, in that food and some goods can be mass-produced by a single worker with the same efficiency as a robot (the Weasley Twins can produce enough goods to stock a store while also still having enough time to run their store and have a life). And, what goods they can't make themselves, they can get from the muggle world. Even jobs that don't involve a lot of repetition can be accelerated when you can magic away the boring, inefficient parts.

Thus, that leaves a large portion of the magical economy with a lot of time on their hands and an economic motivation to produce luxury goods and services... like growing ingredients or making beautification products. They wouldn't continue to teach potions at Hogwarts if ingredients were so expensive that it could only be a niche career /unless/ potions were stupidly powerful and worth the cost. So either potions are very strong or the ingredients are cheap enough to justify mandating that all wizards learn the skill.

You've probably got a point about the lack of skill, but of that's the case, then you'll definitely see people trying to market their skills in making others beautiful. Enough, in fact, that I think free market competition would keep it relatively inexpensive.

I might be wildly off-base, but that's my two cents.

***** Yeah, definitely we've probably only seen a small slice of what magic can do since Harry is such an oblivious, unreliable narrator and JKR's world-building isn't particularly deep. But we should try to keep any assumptions we make conservative and based on what we see in the text, so even though magic can make people beautiful in all sorts of ways we still see ugly people, so there must be some sort of limit to it.

I didn't say you couldn't animate an illusion, just that it adds difficulty to it which raises the barrier of skill required.

I wasn't saying all potion ingredients are rare, far from it. The boil cure uses generic porcupine quills and snake fangs for example. I was just talking about the polyjuice potion (and derivatives) specifically. It is an advanced potion that has both some common ingredients such as lacewing flies and some hard to get ingredients like boomslang skin.

Here's what the Harry Potter wiki has to say about Boomslang Skin:

#+begin_quote
  The Boomslang Skin is skin shed from a Boomslang snake. The skin is mostly green in males and brown in females. It is an unusual potion ingredient, but is used in potions such as the Polyjuice Potion. Boomslang skin is not sold at the Apothecary in Diagon Alley, nor is it available in the student store-cupboard, but it can be found in the Potion master's private storage. It is not an ingredient on the Restricted Register.

So I'd say potions would run the gamut from super cheap to bloody expensive.

  Why couldn't they just take a mundane knife, chop off a bit more of the stump to get rid of the tainted wound, and then regrow it?
#+end_quote

It's not that simple. The curse, while /focused/ on the stump, would not necessarily be fully /housed/ there, so to speak --- just like cutting off the piece of Harry's forehead with the scar on it wouldn't have destroyed the Horcrux. Presumably the curse is still within Moody and even after cutting off some more of the stump it would automatically cancel out any attempts at regrowing a leg there.

**** But then Moody couldn't be healed of /anything.../ which actually makes sense considering how scarred he is.

A thought occurs. Keep in mind that this is at least partially based on fanon, but wouldn't it be funny if Wizards were so focused on /magical/ healing that they refused to or neglected to consider healing with mundane techniques? Like, they're so focused on undoing cueses that they completely neglect cutting the curse off and then healing it. Keep in mind, I'm just talking about restoring bodily functions, not actually wholly purging curses that affect the entire body.

For mute people, sign language would be one hand only, either hand works, so you can hold a wand at the same time.

  do you think the wizarding world understands that these problems are physical as much as mental?

I don't think we can be certain that this is true in the Harry Potter world.
