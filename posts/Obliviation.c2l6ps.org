Are there any fanfics in which Dumbledore obliviates Harry? Thank you.


** now i can't remember it's title but it shows abuse to harry and him being obliviated multiple times. it's a cycle and it doesn't sound freaky but it's kind of eerie. the last line is, "The rememberall spun. He was forgetting something."

good!dumbledore, btw

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.
