So in many fics they mention Voldemort having an insurmountable advantage because he has over 50 years of magical education on Harry.\\
Especially if you combine this with the fact that he's a prodigy this seems pretty air tight, but I was wondering what would be needed to bridge the gap if their potential was equal? Some things to consider: - LV probably studied a pretty broad range of magic.

- LV focused most of his efforts on achieving immortality.

- Manipulating, politicking and dark lording probably takes a lot of hours out of ones day (especially if one is paranoid and has followers of questionable loyalty and competence)

- Did he continue learning/ improving at the same rate throughout his life or did he reach a level where he felt unbeatable or wasn't able to improve much further(diminishing returns) and focus on other pursuits?

- it seems like LV was always a loner, how much difference would support/ teaching/ practice partners/ advise make from competent and trusted allies (if Harry had any) ?

QUESTION/TLDR : if Dumbledore/ some other powerful mentor guy would use all their ingenuity and resources to prepare Harry to beat Voldemort without relying on some deus ex machina BS, how long would they have to block Voldemort from returning back to his physical form?


** Harry would have to be in his upper 30s. 16 year old Tom Riddle would be handled by 70 yr Voldemort with ease, so even if Harry reads to know and understand everyday of his entire 7 years at Hogwarts he'd still be at a disadvantage in knowledge and practice.

And it's not that Harry /can't/ learn unless his life is on the line (this is even contradicted in GoF) he just doesn't do it until OotP when he's just sitting around reading Defense books.

** At least until Harry has finished school and is a few years into adulthood.

Sure, Dumbledore knows a lot, but I liken it to trying to teach an 11 year old advanced calculus. Harry doesn't have the knowledge base to understand whatever Dumbledore (or whomever else) could try to teach him.

From what we've seen of Harry, he's not especially great at learning things when his life is not on the line. If we take what canon says about Hogwarts at face value, he already has the best teachers available for him in the main subjects.

As the books drag on, even his curiosity seems to disappear, leaving his only outstanding aspect to be his willpower. While willpower is useful for remaining motivated through a long war, it doesn't translate to technical skills---think occlumency or nonverbal spells or anything really.

In conclusion, the only thing Harry can really train for is reaction speed, battle awareness, pain tolerance, etc. In other words, things that don't need magic.

~~~

At minimum, Voldemort worked through his entire school years, and most likely disappeared afterwards to learn more magic. He's also widely regarded as a genius by his teachers. Assuming he stopped learning as soon as he got his job at Borgin & Burke's, he's still knows a /tonne/ of stuff. The question is: how does it translates to combat ability?

If you've seen martial arts competitions, you'll know that skill is a big factor. If Harry dedicates his entire life to defeating Voldemort in a straight fight, he'll probably be able to in his twenties at the earliest.

But if you've seen a street fight, you'll know that sometimes skill doesn't matter. The key to winning a fight is to rig the fight to be advantageous to you. Set traps, take pot shots, be creative! A good hit and it's over. In that sense, Harry could beat Voldemort at any point. Think Harry vs Quirrelmort. If the horcruxes were gone, Voldemort would have been vanquished that night. Or, think Pettigrew vs Cedric in the graveyard. I think Cedric could take the rat in a straight fight, but when Peter won due to the element of surprise.

*** True so maybe a better question would be at which point Harry would be powerful enough to spring a trap and have a decent chance of fighting his way out of it fails.

But yea by preparing him I also means raising him to fulfil his potential, I'm not a child psychologist but the whole Dursley thing and growing up with the number one rule being "don't ask questions" probably didn't do him any favours.

Also he might have had expert teachers but individual tutoring is definitely more effective, especially for people with learning styles that don't fit with the normal class style way of teaching.

But yea I was imagining it based on him being raised properly and then increasing the pressure whenever he's ready..

**** How much will changing a person's childhood affect someone? It brings up the whole nature vs nurture thing. In any case, I think Harry will end up a bit OOC, but that's my favourite type of Harry so I don't particularly care.

From all accounts, James & co. were especially bright. From child-animagi to pranks to the marauder's map, they were extraordinary. Lily is awesome by her own right, as evidenced by her moving flowers and the professors' praise. Together, they managed to defy Voldemort thrice.

It's not a stretch to think that Harry could have inherited that talent. This can sort of be seen in canon, via his patronus at thirteen, and his teacher-position in the DA.

I'm going to assume that there's a good reason for starting magic at age eleven. Even with the limitation, there's no reason theory cannot be learnt earlier. With this in mind, we can imagine Harry speed-running his Hogwarts years with a highly specialized one on one curriculum for combat only. This means that he'll end up lacking in other areas, but that's not a concern. I do feel that this could be accomplished in a year or two with enough prior preparation.

Honestly, that will be enough to pot-shot Voldemort. Most of the Order of the Phoenix seems to have fought the DEs with just this. But this is Voldemort after all, someone who's very name is feared. He's probably much more powerful than depicted in the canon confrontations. Unless he's insane already, which is certainly a possibility.

Anyways, let's just give Harry some advanced training from Albus et al, because why not. In my opinion, he'll be ready to face Voldemort by year 4, assuming that there's some way to get him real battle experience. Maybe go join Dumbledore fighting some evil wizards on mainland Europe?

I prefer to think of channelling magic like flexing a muscle. You can't run out of magic just like you can't run out of muscle. I think 14 seems like a reasonable age for a prodigy-child to be able to channel more magic than the average adult. This age is sort of backed by canon through everyone's reactions to Harry being entered into the Triwizard tournament and Harry's patronus.

So assuming his education is entirely focused on combat, I think 14 seems to be a reasonable age. But he'll be horrible at everything other than straight up fighting due to his lack of people-skills.

***** There were real Martial artists (like Musashi Miyamoto) who were impressive on their teens but they trained since their Childhood, so a malnourished Harry starting on War Magic at eleven might still become a master but I believe it would take More than three years (even considering His illustrious heritage which adds up a Lot). Nevertheless while there's a big concern about creating a child soldier I agree, Harry should have trained (and nourished himself) far more.

****** I was more thinking along the lines of Harry training for every conceivable subject since he could walk, such as physical training and magic theory. The only thing he wouldn't cover would be actually casting magic (which he would start at eleven). He'd have the best diet and best teachers. From eleven, he'd spend almost all his time practicing magic.

******* Following that route he should be killing it by 14 then. If we considered Dumbledore is indeed training him to become an "Anti-Voldemort/DE" weapon he would already be fully aware of Curses and Anti-curses, this would be however a Manipulative!Dumbledore to the 11....Would read though.

** You're forgetting that Voldemort has done rituals and the like to boost his strength. McGonagall's conversation with Dumbledore heavily implies this in the first chapter of PS.

The result of these boosts mean that Voldemort is able to match Dumbledore when they duel in OotP. And Dumbledore has been around about 50 years more than Voldemort - that's 50 years more experience. Dumbledore also is possessing the unbeatable Elder Wand - which for the sake of story, let's assume just increases the power of his spells - and is still not able to outduel Voldemort. Dumbledore also has access to way more information since people are more open to share their knowledge with the person who is widely regarded as the saviour of Europe, unlike Voldemort.

So in essence, unless Harry is a prodigy of the same class as Voldemort or Dumbledore and willing to go through those same rituals, he doesn't stand a chance against Voldemort.

*** True but it's also possible that Dumbledore is past his prime, we don't really know how magic develops. Also Dumbledore has definitely not been focusing on battle for most of his life. And I kinda like the idea of rituals, obviously for the whole thing to work Harry would have to be pretty ooc.

There could be more exploring of magic/ world building and all sorts of cool stuff (exploring, adventures, new magic, magical professions etc.) But I haven't seen it done well often, if it is it's usually not completed. :(

** After reading this great post I believe a good Solution to Harry being so much outclassed by Voldemort would be him going the Time Traveling route (through a mysterious unreplicable Spell) back to Godric's/Merlin's days in order to devote a decade or more to train (and nourish his body) so that when he returns (older, More experienced and confident) he can truly take on Voldie and his DE.
