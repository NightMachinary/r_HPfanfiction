Saw a post about having the ability to talk to inanimate objects and it made me wonder, what other Magical abilities have you guys seen through out fanfiction? I honestly can't think of many, and apparently canon itself is incredibly barren of this, other than Parseltongue, Metamorphomagus and Animagi. Only one I saw in fanfic is having varying degrees of control over an element.

Any good examples you saw, or can think of?


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11364705/1/Barefoot]]) features someone who can get the history of an object by touch. It also features empaths, iirc.

linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/]]) had a blind harry who developed other magic to "see", but it's been a while since I read it and I really don't remember the peculiarities.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads]]) Kinda tropy, definitely OP, but had some interesting ideas about magic. Harry could manipulate "magic cores/threads" and do a lot of interesting stuff.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]]) Now, this one is pretty much HP in name only and even that's debatable since HP creates a cover identity named Rakesh Asmodeus iirc . But it featured some decent ideas worth exploring

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/]]) Harry has some interesting soul/sex magic and the story features other interesting magical concepts. The author has some pretty fucked ideas about gender, and it does become more noticeable towards the end. He also can't seem to hide his disdain towards religion. But yeah, he does a decent job of exploring magical concepts.

** There's a fic in which Harry is raised by Sirius in Azkaban, where his accidental magic develops into the ability to make the people around him more sane.
