He doesn't have to be like, the single most popular person, but I would love some fics where he is like, a generally well liked person among the other houses. And consistently not just when like, he wins a match.

  This is my own version of the Loud House where I move to Royal Woods, Michigan. When I move to Michigan and Meet the Loud Kids, The Entirety of the Universe will change forever. Get ready evil, Justice has many brand new faces. The Universe now has a bunch of new Champions. Self Insert OC story. Crossovers with other shows later on. Mixed genres. Multi-crossover. Harem later on.
