Looking for a fic I remember reading a long time ago on fanfiction.net. It was a female Harry fic, where she was a natural born seer. I remember there being scenes where they helped Vernon out with his investments by marking out notes on his newspapers each morning. Does this sound vaguely familiar to anyone?

I might be confusing fics. Might be the case that she was just a natural born telepath.
