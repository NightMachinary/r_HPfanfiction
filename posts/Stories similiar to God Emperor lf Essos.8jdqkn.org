To keep with the ASoIaF theme, there is The Difference One Man Can Make, by joen1801, witch is pretty well known I think. What I like about this fic is the large scale way he affect the world and there is a kind of management-game like feel when he builds his village, I got nice flashes of games like Banished or Civilization II.

You can also go LoTR with The Power He Knows Not, by Steelbadger (who also writes other great crossovers). The more well known by this writer would perhaps be The Shadow Of Angmar ( linkffn(11115934) ), but in Power, Harry takes part in the main plot of the LoTR books, interacting with Aragorn, Gimli and all the crew, so that may be closer to what you are looking for. Still, both are great reads.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Ã‰owyn.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
