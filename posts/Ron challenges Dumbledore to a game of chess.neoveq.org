A silly little prompt that came to mind.

In first year, Ron plays a lot of chess, without losing a game.\\
What would have happened if someone compared his skill with Dumbledore? I propose a story where at the end of first year, after beating McGonagall's chess set, he offers a game to Dumbledore, and wins.\\
Because of this, The Elder Wand recognises that Ron has beaten him, and switches allegiance.\\
Would Dumbledore notice? Maybe he senses that it feels a bit odd when he goes to use it, and puts it down to the mental exercise he's just done, maybe he doesn't try to use magic for the rest of the day, and doesn't put the pieces together when he realises something is wrong, or maybe he doesn't notice at all.

There are a lot of options for progressing from one small scene that is almost inconsequential, I figure it can be a good point to start a crackfic from.


** It has to be one of those Giant magical Chess boards though. And Ron and Dumbeldore standing decisively on elevated platforms as their fans cheer. Sort of like a Yugioh sort of thing, only that the loser is not sent to the shadow realm or any shit like that, because both are gingers and hence have no souls.

** There are couple of stories, where Harry mostly by misunderstanding disarms Dumbledore and becomes the master of the Elder Wand.
