- Starting a fic with no information just three sentences that have five different things happen. Like where's the flavor? Where's the details? You've used 12 words and a whole day has passed.

- "I opened my eyes." At this point I can only read first person in print form without cringing.

-No plot twist. Come on, hit em in them in gut. Make your reader's eyebrows disappear into their hairline.

-Lack of originality. I've read this same plot five times, what makes yours special?

-Mary Sue's

-No structure and I mean in all forms. Please break up your dialogue.

-Having someone appear to fix a problem and just ignore them. Like I've read three sentences about this OC and it has so much potential but apparently they spontaneous combusted.


** Snape-wanking. Make Harry apologise to Snape for not accepting Snapes bullying? Im out.

James and lily were evil cheating bullies and the slytherins were just poor innocent children? -back out slowly and hope the insanity of the author isn't contagious.

** May I suggest looking at past threads? [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9bl6uq/what_pet_peeves_make_you_immediately_stop_reading/]]

My own limits are:

Ron bashing.

Dumbledore bashing.

Dialogue that no one would say.

Pygmypuffonacid style editing.

Magic being only intent and belief.

Luna treated as someone who isn't merely a conspiracy nut and has some special abilities.

Muggle wank as opposed to canon where wizards control the schedule of muggle leaders at a whim.

50 thousand words and 200 chapters.

If on AO3, an inane amount of tags.

Wandless magic that replaces wand magic.

Thematically inconsistent worldbuilding. Healers do not conduct surgery.

Goblins being anything but bankers. Go to a damn healer to fix your eyesight.

Stupid nicknames. Bumblebee, Moldyshorts, etc

** The only things that'll actually make me stop reading immediately midway-through a story are sudden unexplained Religiosity, Homophobia, Pureblood Bigotry, Smut, Gore, or Redemption. If you're gonna have a character go full Outlast/Westboro Baptist, you gotta have some build-up. I've read a surprising number of stories where everything is fine and usual until suddenly Harry turns and tells Hermione how homosexuality causes Squibs, someone goes full 'Yes, a lot of Wizards are secretly Christian', everything just turns Warhammer 40K levels of Brutal Grimdark, or there's suddenly a pit of people-bits and /insert bloody thing here/.

Otherwise, it just depends on if the story interests me in the first 2-5 chapters/paragraphs (depending on story length) or if I've been recc'ed it for something happening later.

** How about going to Gringots for an inheritance test. That would be ok to find any vaults that he should have access to, which is in the Goblin's purview. However, then the test starts listing things such as Natural in wandless magic, metamorh abilities partially blocked etc etc. What does that have to do with vaults and money, and why would it show up on a Gringots inheritance test?

** I agree with you on the first person stories, as soon as I see the story is that, I can't hit the back button fast enough. In the hundreds Harry Potter stories I have read, I have only ever seen two that were written in 1st person that were pretty decent, and the last one was a few years ago. As such, I make a point of no longer reading them. It's really too bad that authors limit themselves like that, I have seen some 1st person perspective stories in the past that would have been spectacular, if they have been written in 3rd person instead.

** One of my biggest pet peeves, and something that will easily cause me to hit the back button, is retelling the canon stories. For example, a story billed as Slytherin/Harry where Harry must put his wits to the test in learning what it means to be Slytherin. Then all it is, is that Harry makes two friends in Slytherin (male and female) and then author basically rewrites Philosopher's Stone pretty much word for word, except replacing everything having to do with Harry's time in Gryffindor, with Slytherin.

** I don't really mind a lot with fics, but I think there was about three i found that I remember where oh it was just every single time someone spoke, every sentence they spoke, they said whoever's name they were speaking to at the end of beginning. Like, EVERY TINY BIT OF SPEECH I couldn't stand it. Example: ‘Harry, would you come here please?' ‘Yes professor Dumbledore' ‘Harry do you know what this is?' ‘Sort Professor Dumbledore, i don't sir' ‘that's a shame Harry, I thought you could help' oh it was so so annoying! It just got worse as I read it so I couldn't finish it 😖 I think there was another one where Snape was raiding Harry and frick me every ten seconds it was ‘son' and ‘dad' like, so much and oh my god no 😖 But I don't mind a lot of other things

** Any fic that has -ette on the end of a hair color. That's not how it works. Brunette is French or has French origins, you can't just apply that to every hair color you think of!

Excessive bashing. Even if you can make it work, eventually you go too far and lose the plot. I get that Dumbledore was shady as hell but do you really think he wanted to rule the world? Did he seriously want Harry to adie nine times over? Is Ron really that bad when you get down to the root of it? Does Hermione absolutely need to know everything? Can't they be kids?

Having the kids act like mini adults and the politicking alone makes my head spin.

I might add more once I think about this a bit.

EDIT: The godsforsaken pedophilia gone wild in this fandom. Even if you age them up are you seriously telling me that Snape wouldn't take one look at Hermione or whoever and say "I watched you go through your acne phase. And cry over tests. Sit down and stir this cauldron the right way."

Like... they might not always be kids when they get shipped but the fact remains that there is a serious power imbalance there. Why would any of the teachers ever go for a student, even a grown up student?! Especially in fics where they just left Hogwarts or came of age or whatever?

This is an element of canon and important to the books but the fandom takes teacher obliviousness to a whole new level.

Fics where Lily and James somehow survived but Harry still has a ridiculously bad life. Is there no other way to defeat Voldemort? He has to have the exact same life? You're telling me they would have a kid,or even two or more, and would only seriously intentionally focus on one of them? #doubt
