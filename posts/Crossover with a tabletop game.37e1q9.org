Are there any good crossovers with a character from a tabletop coming into Hogwarts? Something similar to Natural 20, the planar professor fic, and Harry potter and the magic of paragon.

Probably isn't a lot out there. I've spent a while looking and haven't found much.


** well is not harry potter but theres always Shinji and WH40K
