*** Mostly a pretty amusing fic, though notably not one chapter involving a canon HP character other than Harry himself has been any good, it also kinda feels like the author doesn't actually like the series (stuff like wizards being actually just wrong about magic, bashing all the canon characters who show up, apart from Luna who's at her fanon worst).\\
Pity too because there's a lot of fun stuff too when the author is just making up fun crossover interaction and divine poker nights.

** Linkffn(6915344)

A oneshot where the Dursleys abandon Harry in the Australian outback. It's a one shot and reading it is a rather nice experience.

Edit: Whoops just realized this is a prompt!

I'll give it a shot. I hope I pulled off a forest gumpy vibe.

Looking back, Harry Potter firmly believes he wouldn't change a thing in the world. Not having to cook and clean for those awful Dursleys, not having to sleep in a cupboard under the stairs, not even having to deal with Harry huntings.

No, because in the end, Harry found something greater than all those things combined.

When his uncle had dragged him from the garden, ordered him to pack up everything he owned (which wasn't much), and gave him a ticket with the express order not to lose it... Well, Harry had been more than eager to comply. He couldn't read much back then, he was only 4 and a half. But he recognized the words on the slip of paper from an ad he saw on the TV while dusting the mantle off.

"MADELINE TOURS PROMISES AN AMAZING, SPECTACULAR VACATION FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY AT LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA"

In hind sight, maybe that was the ad that finally ignited the fuse in Vernon Dursley. Because less than a week later he'd booked a tour with the Madeline company and off they went.

Harry had been ecstatic, what kid wouldn't? It'd be his first vacation! He'd get to see a big city! And the ad promised it would be an amazing and spectacular experience!

But the second they landed, Vernon dropped off his wife and son in a nice hotel and ordered Harry back into the rental car. Confused, he followed along. They drove for hours and hours. The afternoon turned to night. And then, on a dusty road in the middle of nowhere, Vernon made Harry get out the car. He shoved his bag into the boy's arms, told him to stay put. Then he got back into the drivers seat, slammed the door, and sped away.

And that's how Harry Potter found himself abandoned on the highway, halfway across the globe from the land of his birth, with only the clothes on his back and a plastic bag full of all his earthly belongings.

Alone and utterly lost, he did exactly what Vernon told him to do. He stayed put. At first, he thought his uncle would come back any minute now, and he feared the punishment he'd get if he moved. He'd hate it if he ruined this awesome, spectacular trip before it even began! But as the night turned to morning, he got hungry, and tired, and upset. And... It was starting to dawn on him that his uncle may not be coming back...

So, when an old Volkswagen van stopped on the highway, and a bunch of hippies came pouring out the back asking him if he was okay: he started bawling. They couldn't just leave a crying kid stranded on the high way, so they promised to take him to the nearest town.

Harry, didn't exactly believe them. After all, the Madeline company lied. This was certainly /not/ an amazing, spectacular vacation. But after a while his needs got the best of him and he climbed in with them.

They introduced him to vintage music, to dream catchers, to radical socio-politico-economic ideologies, to lava lamps, and other generic hippy things. Including some interesting vegtables in baggies that Harry had never cooked with before. Then again, the Dursley family wasn't big on eating healthy, so he wasn't too surprised.

They drove and drove until they found a small town. But for some reason no one was willing to go into the sheriffs office with him. Or even remotely near it. So instead they dropped him off a few blocks away and sped off.

Harry had shrugged, putting some of the stuff they gave him into his bag. It was only a dream catcher and a peace sign bookmark, but it was pretty cool.

Then he continued on until he got to the sheriffs office. Except, he didn't, because he got distracted by a big, fancy bus feuling up at the petrol pump. He'd never seen something like it before. It had bold letters painted against its shiny black body. It read:

"AC/DC"

And, what was even cooler, it had the lighting bolt between the letters! Just like the scar on his forehead! And, because Harry was a curious boy with nothing else to do and no where he particularly wanted to be, he went to get a closer look. And, because the door was opened, he climbed inside.

It was super cool! It looked more like a lounge to party in than a bus!

And the seats looked so comfortable too... And he was so tired... So Harry climbed onto a velvet lined seat, laid down, and dozed off.

Hours later 4 famous band members would find a 4 and a half year old boy at the back of their bus. They would freak out, he would freak out, but at the end of the day there wasn't much anyone could do. They were already halfway to Denver and turning around would cause them to miss their show. And, seeing as Harry Potter had no idea where the Dursleys were right then and had no interest in going back to them, everyone decided to just go with it.

They promised him it would be a fun trip as long as he didn't tell the cops.

So that's how Harry Potter ending up touring with AC/DC, as an unofficial mascot of sorts. At some point, lighting bolt scars became rather fashionable amongst the AC/DC fans, and Harry ended up signing many, many peoples foreheads where they had drawn on their own lightning bolt.

With them, he had seen Denver, then Kansas City, and then Minneapolis, along with so much more! But after that the band would be going to Winnipeg, and no one wanted to have to explain to border Patrol why there was a random little kid on their bus.

So, they parted ways in Minnesota and that was that. Harry added a few signed photos of him and the crew, and a lucky guitar pick to his little bag.

From there the boy hitchhiked his way across the states.

He met a 89 year old man on the run for tax fraud who promised him he'd teach him how to swindle like hell. And he did.

He chatted with a family of Amish as he rode with them in their horse drawn carriage, they promised him they'd teach him to drive a horse and raise a barn. And they did.

He met a king who promised him he had the scariest stories to tell. And he did. Harry was happy to suggest changes though. Who cares about a boring murderer when a cursed clown is so much better?

By the time he'd finished talking about clowns though, he found he wasn't so scared of them anymore. Which is good because his next adventure would be with a travelling circus. They promised to teach him every thing from acrobatics to knife throwing. And, unsurprisingly, they did.

As he touched each person's life, they'd give him a small token to take with him, and soon enough his bag was filled with things from his journeys. In a small rucksack was all his earthly possessions, but he thought it was better than anything else. Not even a castle could compare.

Harry aplologized to the Madeline company then. He said that they lied, that they didn't show him an amazing or spectacular time. But he'd clearly been proven wrong. They'd kept their promise, all right.

And as Harry Potter, now a full 5 years and a half, trots along the side of a highway at an easy pace, he knows he wouldn't change anything.

He didn't know it of course, and maybe never would. But in 5 and a half more years there would be thousands of letters and thousands of owls which would never make their way to him. After all, you can't put an address on a boy who's home is his own self and the single bag he carries.

But even if he did know, he probably wouldn't care much for Hogwarts and magic and prophecies. No, the road's all he needs.

** /Queens, New York/

​

Harry felt fear. 

Vernon had dragged him to this abandoned alley; the only life coming from the rats scuttling here and there. It wasn't dark nor scary as it was still day and the alley he dragged him to wasn't quite narrow. Yet, somehow, Harry felt this squeezing feeling, this intense foreboding of something about to happen. 

He often was right with his inaccurate hunches.

“Stay here,” Vernon spat at the shaking boy. At that, Harry braced himself, wielding the tiny shred of courage he had left, to look directly at his eyes.

“What?” 

“Stay here”

Harry blinked, confused at the remark, “Why? Until when?”

Vernon said nothing and turned around. A horrible inkling treaded its way to Harry's mind and a voice whispered in its ear

/He's going to leave you alone/

“You're going to leave me aren't you?... But why?” Harry whispered. Despite their cruel nature and treatment to him, they still held his shelter and food. Without them, Harry wouldn't know what to do or where to go.

Vernon laughed. His eyes prickled with tears as if this was the funniest joke he has ever heard. For Harry, he felt slowly destroyed. They were going to abandon him, leave him here to rot. Just like Vernon, Harry's eyes started to prickle with tears but not for the same reason.

The more he laughed, the more Harry felt despair grow stronger within him. The alley no longer looked bland or normal, it's slowly going narrow. He couldn't breathe anymore. It was suddenly all so narrow, so tight. He wanted to run away, lash out, but that would mean death.

Despite being so young, he knew a lot already. He knew he would die with nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep. He knew he would be vulnerable, more so from here on because at least with the hurtful home he has with the Durselys, they gave him his cupboard which held warmth. His cupboard would never harm him. It was where he could be open and cry about the world.

From here on, there would be nothing and he was afraid. He had heard of those horror stories his classmates had told him, of evil men who stole children and kill them. 

Harry closed his eyes and let the tears flow down his cheek.

“You? Why would I want to keep a freak in my household! Listen here boy, the moment I saw you I hated you and wanted nothing to do with you, in fact, if you die right here I would be happy! Good riddance!” Vernon's voice boomed in the alley, making the hair on the whimpering boy rise.

And in one sudden turn, his mocking joy turned to absolute scorn. 

“You brought nothing but taint to my household”

Vernon raised his hand, about to hit the boy but as he was about to swing his palm, a woman's scream echoed through the alley. 

“/STOP! GETAWAY FROM HIM!/”

Harry's eyes flew up and there he saw her. A woman, whose face stricken in horror, running towards him, the bags she was carrying all sprawled across the floor. She immediately enveloped him in her hug and for once, despite being uncomfortable in an adult's arms, he felt hope.

A small hope that maybe she wouldn't hurt him. Right? 

Missus Abernathy, his preschool teacher, use to tell him of how superheroes, saviours, would never hurt anyone. She told him all these stories and fantasies that he so loved. He missed her dearly when she left. That was the second time Harry felt abandonment. 

This one, was a saviour /right/?

Footsteps were heard and Harry knew, with his inaccurate hunches, that Vernon has left.

*** “Hey, got the key?” Harry grumbled. His day was awful, not only did he just receive a hefty load of homework to do but the new star wars lego set he was going to order got sold out.

“It's in the last pocket in my backpack,” Peter replied, turning around for Harry to get easier access to his bag.

Harry fished out the key and opened the door.

“Hey May,” both of them said in unison as they dropped their belongings in the table.

“How's school today?” 

“Okay,” Peter mumbled, stretching his back from the pain of his heavy backpack.

“And there's this crazy car outside---“ Harry continued but his words fell to nothing as both boys suddenly noticed a familiar stranger in their household. Right there, beside their aunt May, was Tony Stark, eating their Aunt May's date loaf on their couch.

The /Tony Stark./

"Mr Parker, Mr Potter,” The man smiled, his hand on the date loaf that's slightly burnt in the side.

Both boys stared at each other before trying to say something, which ended in Harry piping up something unintelligible “,Uhm..wha---what's are you... uhm”

“I-I, I'm Peter, and this is my brother Harry,” Peter continued, gesturing to himself and his still gobsmacked brother.

“Tony”

Harry, trying to salvage his busted dignity, lightly coughed and straightened his back to look composed, “What... err.. what are you doing here?”

Tony smiled, his eyes amused at the two flustered boys especially in their pitiful attempts at hiding it “, About time we met, you both got my emails right?”

“Yeah...?” Harry said unsurely, of which Peter hit him subtly with his elbow. He glared at his brother.

“Yeah, yeah, Harry meant yeah, regarding the---?”

“You both never told me about the grant,” Aunt May piped in. Her genuine smile easing the stutters in their words, and the nervousness in their hearts.

“About the grant”

“The September Foundation,” Tony supplied.

“Right”

“Remember when you both applied?”

Peter looked at Harry who spoke up for both of them, “Yeah?”

“I approved, so now we're in business”

Aunt May suddenly gasped, her eyes excited as she narrowed her eyes playfully at his two boys, her finger pointing at them mockingly “, But you never told me anything, what's up with that? Are my two mischievous boys now keeping secrets from me?”

“Well...Well we just knew how much you love surprises so Harry and I---uh...“

“So we thought we would let you know... the--- anyway what did we apply for?” Harry asked, his face looking unsure at

Mr Stark. 

“That's what we're here to hash out”

⊱ ─────────────── ⊰

Tony closed the door behind them, “As for walnut date loaves go, that wasn't so bad” He surveyed the room, each glance looking inquisitively at everything. From the blue bunk beds littered with homework, to the messy rectangular study table with the various wires, and the dated computer sitting in the middle of it.

“Ah! What do we have here, retro-tech huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?” 

“Oh, ah the garbage---“

“You're both dumpster divers”

“Yeah, we are...,” Peter tried to continue but suddenly felt helpless, he looked towards Harry to continue the discussion.

“Uhm, we uh...we definitely did not apply for your grant---“

“Nah uh, me first,” Tony interrupted, “Quick questions of the rhetorical variety”

Tony fished out his phone, raised it, and; without even looking at the screen, pressed a button that immediately displayed a small hologram of an image---no, a paused video of Peter and Harry in their respective hand-tailored suits.

In another tap, the video played and zoomed into the scene of Peter swinging around the building.

“That's you isn't it?” Tony remarked, his eyes staring at the nervous boy, clearly enjoying his subtle attempts at denying it.

“No, no, what---er..what do, what do you mean?”

Tony smirked and looked again at the hologram. It was now zoomed in to Harry subtly waving his hand to move a detached car door that was being hurled at Peter's way.

“And, I suppose that's you”

Harry gulped, his eyes betraying his agitation, “Of course not, I can't, I can't do that, that's a err.. clearly a, just a look-a-like of me, which is--- is which yes, impressive because doppelgängers are rare, kinda rare? rare? yes”

The hologram zoomed out to see Peter grabbing Harry and lifting him up away to the building. Afterwards, Harry grabbed a random abandoned jacked in the ground and sent it hurling through their enemies, wrapping around their faces with only a mere wave of his hand.

The attempt at denial continued for a few minutes before Tony found a small secret hatch at the ceiling that exposed both of their poorly made suits. And at speeds Harry only saw when they were fighting crime together, Peter immediately lunged to their suits before hiding it behind his back. He crossed his arms in an attempt to look as if nothing happened at all.

Tony backed up his steps to get a good look at the both of them before looking straight at Peter, “So you're the spiderling,” and then to Harry, “And the wizardling or is it the magic boy?”

Harry and Peter stared at each other.

For some reason, Harry's inaccurate hunches were telling him that something was about to change. Meanwhile, Peter's spider senses mirrored the same feeling.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13359087/1/Harry-Potter-in-the-City-of-Angels]])

And linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13401887/1/The-Devil-as-a-Father]])

Both are heart-warming stories (after a bit). The first is short and kind of perfect. Both are crossovers with the TV show Lucifer.

  Maze knew there was something different about the bone-thin child in rags she'd seen rummaging through a trash can for food. She was going to find him and figure this out. He shouldn't be any harder to track down than a rogue demon after all, his appearance was quite distinctive. Scruffy black hair, round glasses, and a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead. Rescue!fic, complete.

  Inspired by Brilliant Lady's Story. What would happen if Lucifer Morningstar found an abandoned Harry Potter in L.A. and adopted him?

** Personally I'd love a story where Harry is left somewhere in France and discovered by the Delacours... or the Veela coven. Fleur (and Gabrielle) - or her parents - may come upon him while out walking, or Harry finds their house.

Or what Vernon think is somewhere without anything for miles, is really the hidden-from-muggles estate of the Delacourts or the mountains(?) of Appoline's Veela Coven.

*** It is sad, but you could make a really happy story out of it. I mean, sure, Harry would be pretty torn up at first, but he'd probably be happier living with anyone else, or even alone (like in [[/u/Comtesse_Kamilia][u/Comtesse_Kamilia]]'s reply to the prompt).

** I know I read one where the Dursleys leave Harry at a British campsite. With a little luck, some trial and error, plus magic kicking in, he learns to fend for himself and does a great job of it. But he decides he is a wood elf, related to house elves (after all, the Dursleys had made him work like one), which leads to interesting times when the Hogwarts crew catches up with him.
