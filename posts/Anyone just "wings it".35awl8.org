I find that whenever I try to plan a fic, with spreadsheets, biographies, plot descriptions of every chapter, and the like, my creative flow gets broken and though I know what happens, I can never write it.

I normally just start with a vague idea like " [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11226527/1/Regulus-and-Snape-s-Gloom][I want Severus and Regulus to have a warm cuddly moment]] " and write it up as I go along.

Sure that story was a oneshot, but I don't have any long fics with Harry Potter so I'm just using it as an example.

So...anyone just does that? I'm wondering because Rowling had every detail planned out before she even started.


** Yeah, that only works for one-shots and already talented writers.

*** Actually, there're a lot of successful published authors who do this, too.

I'm really not sure what you mean by "already talented" -- if you mean in terms of skills practiced and mastered, then that's not necessarily so (many of the aforementioned published authors /always/ wrote like that, even before learning to write /well/).

**** I'm not saying everyone uses the spreadsheet method, I'm saying everyone at least plans their chapters ahead a bit.

*** I use this method. Maybe call it talented, maybe lucky, but all of my professional and personal works are written this way. I prefer it, as if I stop in the middle, it breaks my flow of narrative. Slower, as i check for spelling and grammar as I go, but infinitely easier for me.

Unless I'm typing on a phone, like this post :)

** Planning is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.

On the one hand a complete lack of planning is likely to reduce the interconnectedness of the story. Without planning it becomes more difficult to create hooks and clues that you can capitalise on later, instead you have to just latch on to thing you already wrote and pretend it was planned all along. If not planned it becomes more difficult to explore more complex themes and interactions, everything (themes, plot-lines, character-arcs) becomes more short term and immediate.

On the other hand too much planning can easily spell the death of a story. It can also kill the characters and the feeling of living spontaneity that most strive for. It can make a story feel more like a script, rather than a description of events. For me personally, too much planning can kill my enjoyment of writing a story. If I already know everything that's going to happen the need to write wastes away. I write for the same reason I read, because I want to see what happens. If I already know that before-hand then the enjoyment is much reduced.

I've gone to both ends. While it's easy to finish an unplanned story it also doesn't hold together quite so well, the strings and tape sometimes become visible. On the other side an exhaustively planned story looses the feeling of spontaneity and begins to feel more like an exercise in transcription.

I think it's best to try and find the middle-ground that best suits you and your style. Personally I follow these steps:

- The Bunny: "Harry Potter timetravels to WW2 and battles Grindelwald"

- The Investigation of Worth: I create a very brief overview of disparate events that could happen in such a story and decide if they would be likely to make it worth reading. I also consider the characters involved and consider if their growth or personality would be interesting.

- The Rough Plan: A time-line of events that the story much fit between. There are set milestones that are, for the most part, outside of the influence of the story. For example D-Day in the Grindelwald idea above.

- The Chapter Plan: Do a very brief (1 paragraph per chapter) description of events and things that I want to have mentioned/foreshadowed in that chapter. Nothing specific about characterization here as I like to leave them mostly to be explored in the full text. If the full text does not follow the plan exactly it's no big deal, if I discover a character simply /would not/ act in the way I'd thought they would then I'll probably re-think the plan.

TL;DR: Plan enough to foreshadow stuff and map character growth. Don't plan too much or you might kill your enjoyment of the fic.

** Take a look for [[https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=architect%20vs%20gardener%20writing][Architect vs Gardener]] on google and you'll find a lot on this topic.

Some writers are more "planners" and plan everything out. Some are more spontaneous and write what comes to them as they go. Most authors, fanfic or pro, are a combination of the two, though they may lean more to one side than the other.

Both types can be successful, for sure!

** I think that you need to have major plot points planned out. Beyond that, it depends on the person. I've found that I need to plan things out chapter by chapter, because otherwise the major plot points just feel like random points on a map; I have no idea how to get from where I am to where I want to be.

** Yes, but I haven't even finished the first chapter in over a year, sooo...

Well, I do a ton of a worldbuilding, very little planning of the plot.

** I get an idea and write a paragraph to structure each chapter. Other than that I like to write as I go, it feels real. Often when you have every little detail planned out the writing is emotionless and hollow compared to writing as you go.

Well at least for me anyway.

** It's my standard, to be honest. I hammer out the first draft, making it up as I go, and then I can fine-tune the plot later. I've tried planning it out before I write and it just doesn't work; I don't know what's going to happen until I write it.

** I figure it out as I go. I generally just have a few ideas, things I want to happen, and I just let those goals direct everything else. I planned out an original story once, had every little detail figured out, and completely lost interest in writing it so decided excessive planning wasn't the way to go.

** I try to write as much as possible, maybe even the whole thing (has only happened once) and then go back and edit it. Try to make connections, cut things that dont add. This is after having a very bare bones outline, just so I know I have to get somewhere.

I find this is the best way, then I can keep a consistent once a week update schedule
