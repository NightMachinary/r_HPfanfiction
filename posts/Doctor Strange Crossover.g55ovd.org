I only read the first chapter a very long time ago, I remember finding it interesting but for some reason I stopped reading it and have been unable to find it again. I'm pretty sure it was on AO3. All I can remember is that Doctor Strange was also known as Nicolas Flamel, and he was the leader of a secret organization, and Aberforth knew who he was. I'm not sure how Harry fit into the story although it may have been one of those "powerful figure rescues him from the Dursleys" situations. If anyone knows what I'm talking about please let me know!!
