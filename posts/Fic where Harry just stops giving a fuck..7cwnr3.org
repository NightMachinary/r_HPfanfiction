Like, if after fifth year, Harry declines Dumbledores offer to have lessons, throws the Order's words back in his face ("I'm too young to be involved in anyway, sorry") and just general things where he stops caring about Voldemort.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

***** And if you can't, read another chapter anyway, at some point you just stop noticing it.

I started lining the perspective for how personal it made everything feel, while in the beginning i found it off-putting.

**** I thought it was decent, and it does have a good bit of interesting AU stuff in it. But it doesn't exactly conform to OP's question, Harry doesn't stop giving a shit about Voldemort, he just realizes that Dumbledore is as much his enemy as Voldemort is. It starts at the end of OotP I believe, and most everything is the same as canon, with two large exceptions which either kickstart the story and make some problems down the line.

**** In essence, it's a series of beautifully described fights strung lightly together with plot.

It's the only second person fic I'd ever consider recommending. It's not my usual sort of story, at all, but I still like it a lot. I'm not so sure on the sequel. If you know you want to read /something/, go for this and eventually the second person perspective stops mattering at all.

It is a fun read. But a well-written fun read.
