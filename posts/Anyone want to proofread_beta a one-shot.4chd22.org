I'm looking for someone to read over a WIP one-shot and give feedback/edits. It's written in third-person but from the POV of Regulus Black, and the pairing is Regulus/Remus. Which... is unusual I guess.

If anyone is up for having a read through it, I can PM you a google docs link.


** I'd be interested - please PM with link and details.

** I'm down. My plot-driving skills are ehhh, but sentence structure is my jam.
