I am drawing a massive blank about this. I have memories of them dragging trunks around and piles of books in the library. But what did they do about carrying their books and parchment and quills from one class to the other? Did they just go back to their dorm after every class? And from what I know in ff the only time books ar mentioned is when they get spilled on the ground


** Yeah - Harry deliberately splits Cedric's rucksack/backpack in GOF to separate him from his friends. There are a few references to students grabbing bags, and these might be satchels/rucksacks/totes, etc

*** Additionally in year two when the singing dwarf is after Harry, his bag splits and all his stuff falls everywhere (which is how Ginny finds out he found the diary).

Also there's several mentions of people angrily shoving their books/supplies into their bags after class - one of the OotP potions lessons comes to mind.

** I like to imagine they all use bindles. And Ernie Macmillan uses a briefcase. The bastard.

** CLOUDY yes they have BAGS because Harry broke Cedric's so he could ask him out away from his friends!

** Satchels I reckon. Everything else about Hogwarts is stuck in the 50s so why not the bags.
