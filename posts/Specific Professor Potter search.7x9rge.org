I read this story years ago and can't find it again! Harry, as a professor, starts to help out this kind of weird OC girl student. Theres an injured unicorn at one point. I don't remember much more than that unfortunately. She hangs out in his rooms a bunch and he knows she shouldn't but doesn't do much to stop her I think...

Not sure if it's this one but it fits some of what you said. Writing is so so, but he is a professor and has a relationship with OC student.
