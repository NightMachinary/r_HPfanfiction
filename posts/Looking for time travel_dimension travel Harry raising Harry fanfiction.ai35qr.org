Hello,

I've been in a specific fanfiction mood recently, but sadly what I've been craving seems to be pretty rare - specifically, Harry raising Harry fanfiction. Either time travel, dimension travel, or other possible explanations are fine, relationships for both older and younger Harrys are good, and I'm fine with both het and slash, I'm not very picky - I think my only turn-off ship is Harry/Ron in any way, and I'd prefer no Harry/Ginny, but with rare tropes I can suffer through that :D. But no major relationships is also fine, I just want to read abut Harry being taken care of by the one person who knew what he went through - himself :D

Example of what I'm thinking of would be 'Beyond the breaking point' by FalconLux, which was what made me want to read something from this trope again :3


** The closest that I know of is linkffn(11321032) where a 34 year old Harry Potter gets sent back to his fifth year. It is HP/SS.

*** The amount of fics that look interesting and I have to drop because of ham-fisted slash relationships is staggering.

The last one was the one with a half insane Harry stuck in a loop of living his life and dying, only to start again. +The many deaths of Harry potter+ Again and Again, actually.

It started out really interesting, then out of nowhere the author starts trying to humanize Voldemort and before I know it there are awkwards moments with a 13 years old kid (no matter how old he is mentally) and a 35 years old touching each other.

Dropped faster than panties in a rock concert's backstage.

**** Uh where you reading the same "the many deaths of harry potter" as I was? I don't remember any slash in it, and I definitely would have remembered Harry/Voldemort.

***** Someone else pointed out. It was a different fic with a very similar prompt. Again and Again, is the name.

**** tbh I checked out completely from Games when Ginny started contemplated sleeping with Blake to get the best deal out of knowing he's hiding something

also this paraphrase:

Author: hey good thing Severus was wearing a robe to hid that boner amirite guys

and this one:

Severus: (chuckles seductively)

Blake: 'did he just chuckle seductively, did I just describe his chuckle as seductive'

**** I think you mixed up linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again]]) and Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter]])

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

**** And what does that have to do with the fic recommended above? Iirc the relationship concerns the older Harry Potter in it.

I'm seriously getting fed up with people dissing on slash fics just because they can't do their search properly. If anyone even dares to request slash on this reddit, they're instantly downvoted :/.

***** I mentioned that because the fic above is equally distracting. Snape is old enough to be Harry's father and Harry, while older, is still a 16 years old at that point. While not illegal in many places, still a considerable age difference. I don't mind slash fics. It is not my thing since I am straight, but I have even read some with interesting enough prompts. I dislike weird and outrageously AU slash fics between characters that would never look at each other in such away.

This is more about me disliking OoC characters rather than disliking slash.

You will also note that the guy is very much so not being downvoted to hell.

****** Did you even read that fic before dissing it because omigawd slash? The Harry paired with Snape there is NOT the young Harry under trial, but the older time traveler one, who happens to be more reasonable age of above 30. I can admit there's a lot of slash fiction with inapropriately aged characters and most people don't like that, so I hope you don't feel like I'm jumping at you because of this. It's just, your first comment had nothing to do with the fic which recommendation you posted to, and I'm really getting tired of all the slash witch hunts going on here :(

  Thirty-Four year old Harry Potter travels back in time, adopting the name of Blake Slytherin - he interferes with his own trial and messes with Dumbledore's perfectly laid plans. What happens afterwards? will Blake have bitten off more than he can chew? Will it be left to Harry to do what needs to be done? SLASH HP/? BS/SS
