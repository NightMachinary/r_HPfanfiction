So I'm looking for some good less known Fics. My only requirements are they can't have next gen characters and they MUST BE FINISHED. If the story is done being told then ill read it but if its abandoned, isn't finished or has a sequel or sequels sequel that isn't finished. please don't post it.

*** Because I don't want to go through the trauma of enjoying a fic and then it ends in the middle.

****** Most author's write fanfiction to improve their writing. They're hoping for feedback, comments, reviews and what not. Really, anything that will help them with their writing.

Most stories become abandoned because writing a story takes a massive amount of time and effort and the writer receives no real help from the readers. So the writer decides that it's not worth the time and effort, and moves on to something else.

A refusal to read non-completed fics is an incredibly selfish attitude to have. It shows your interest is purely in your own entertainment. Fanfiction isn't about your entertainment. It's about people trying to improve their writing. And it's amazingly easy to help with that. It's also amazingly easy to keep writer's motivated by talking with them about their works in ways that make it seem like you actually read it. ((Note: update soon! cool story bro! More! are not helpful reviews. "I really like how X acted in the scene where X and Y were discussing their future plans. It threw a twist into the plot I didn't see coming and really hope to see it explored soon!" is a helpful review.))

Less than 0.5% of unique hits on my stories have left a review. Zero Point Five Percent. And I didn't do the math wrong. Don't be part of the 99.5%.

And yes, having a selfish attitude and refusing to attempt to provide feedback because 'you feel bad' if the story isn't complete is insulting. How do you think the author felt when they stopped writing it? Because I'll guarantee you they stopped writing it because they felt it was a waste of time. They crossed the point when it simply wasn't worth the effort.

It's right up there in the same boat with the people that complain constantly that there's no 'new' fanfiction, and then refuse to read in progress stories.

******* You're using your view on fanfiction to justify an argument which may only apply to you.

I read fanfiction for entertainment - that's what a hobby is for. I write fanfiction for entertainment, as I find it interesting to explore avenues of my own imagination that haven't been pinned down.

Sure, a side affect is my writing gets better, but I write for me. Countless others no doubt write for themselves.

Some people quit because it isn't worth the effort, and some just get bored.

******* I'm not going to read a story that has been long since abandoned (which many good abandoned stories are) because its depressing. I'm not saying I won't read in progress works but I'm currently looking for finished work.

******* Thank you for saying this!! I'm currently writing my first ever fic, and the amount of feedback I've received has really disappointed me. I get so jealous of the people who have a one/two chapter log story and they already have dozens of reviews, whilst I'm there with my twenty-ish long WIP that has three or four reviews (one of which is loner than a sentence) and I'm just like; oh. It makes me wonder if it's all worth it. I mean, I'll still do it because I enjoy for myself, but still.

********* Really? Oh wow i'd love that, thank you!

I'll warn you now- it's about an OC of mine (She's at Hogwarts with our favorite group of misfits, though). I know many people don't like OC's, but... i gave it a try anyway :D

***** I don't think it's insulting to authors so much as limiting with respect to what someone will read.

To the OP: Given your strong dislike for incomplete stories, I think you might be best served staying with one-shots. They're guaranteed to be complete and there are about half a million to choose from, meaning you're unlikely to run out of material. In particular, consider reading some of the various collections of one-shots out there by writers like Rorschach's Blot, nonjon, Perspicacity, etc.

** Meh. Too many constraints.

Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] by [[/u/Taure]], which (in my opinion) doesn't get enough attention on the sub. 120k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.
