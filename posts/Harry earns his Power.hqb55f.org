Fics where Harry is slowly becoming someone on par with Dumbledore and Voldemort, or he's already there but really had to work for it.


** The problem is if you want that you need Harry to minimum be in his late twenties early thirties. Harry couldn't be on Voldemort or Dumbledore level sithout training and research magic for decades without him being overpowered

So you couldn't have Harry being in school as a student I would love to see a realistically powerful Harry

*** The easiest way to circumvent this is making harry talented while he is a child.

Not even overpowered stuff, just making him live and breathe magic while growing up.

Instead of picking things up they come to his hand due to wandless magic,things like that. And when he comes to Hogwarts he doesn't need to be incredibly powerfull just a 'oh wow that is totally what I was doing all the time, wonder how to take it to the next level now?' By that point he would have had a decade of flexing his magic and intent. Even if he was weaker than Voldemort or Dumbledore on raw power and skill he could still rival them because he would understand magic on a deeper level or something of the sort.

***** Of course, it's the easiest way to make sure harry is usefull when shit hits the fan.

If the author wants harry to fight Voldemort or Dumbledore then the only way for him to do it without dying instantly is having a level of power or skill superior than that of school children. The reason this leads to power wank is because these authors put these harry's in fights against their peers, rather than Aurors or skilled death eaters that would actually give them a challenge.

There is nothing wrong with the concept of magical child prodigy harry. It's just that there are bad stories based on it.

****** True

The problem with that is that some authors do put Harry against death eaters and aurors and Harry absolutely demolishes them with a single snap of his fingers :/ when Voldemort comes knocking he just dodges an avada and kills voldy with another snap of his fingers, it's ridiculous.

I agree, but the problem is that they almost always turn into power wank, and actually I don't think I've seen a fic where it /doesn't/ turn into power wank

******* I've seen a few.

The best way to approach this problem is to try and make your harry as powerfull as bellatrix or snape.

When he reaches this level, if harry is creative/smart enough he could kill Voldemort or Dumbledore if he made a plan or a good strategy.

The problem is that authors tend to make harry so strong that there is not really a point to the story since harry could just use a spell and end all human life or something in some fics.

- Harry falls in love with a wizard neo-nazi

- Hermione falls in love with actual nazis

- Harry or Draco switch sex and fall in love

****** I've written an essay on the subject and posted it here as to why it would be a bad story/impossible to write.

It basically boils down to:

1) Voldemort was as naturally talented as any Wizard ever as a child and Voldemort has learned for 60 years.

2) Volddmort must be respected to be a good villian - he isn't impressive if he does not live up to the expectation set up by 1).

3) Harry must therefore be more talented (mary sue/boring to read since he would have to have godlike power as a child) or have at least some long period to get more powerful (need time travel or post-hogwarts).

People dont want to read serious stories where Harry has godlike power because it removes many good storytellling tropes (overcoming barriers etc).

And, frankly, you're just flat out wrong. You're replying to a comment from someone who wants to read a serious story where Harry beats Voldemort in magical combat, on a thread where a /different/ person also wants to read that. So some people obviously want to read it.

My story, where Harry is OP, has racked up a quarter million views and 1k follows since I started it in April. Granted, perhaps many of those viewers disliked this idea as you do - regardless, you are demonstrating my point that you're trying to police a topic in a /fanfiction/ community.

Do you think your essay, about why a fanfiction topic is "bad" and "impossible to write" will change minds? There are tons of articles about how The Bachelor is sexist, but it is still incredibly popular. Did it ever cross your mind that maybe people aren't interested in your opinion about their like/dislike regarding a /fictional story about wizards/?

******** I believe part of why Zephrok considers super!Harry fics to be 'bad' and 'impossible to write' is because it ignored the journey of how the MC became so powerful.

I enjoy a nice super!Harry fic as much as the next person but after having read so many they tend to get old. Many contain the same or similar tropes and cliches such as the goblins either adoring Harry simply because 'he is the first person in centuries to use manners to goblins' (despite the fact that wizarding bigotry would not include muggleborns or their families), the goblins giving him an inheritance test to 'prove he is who he says he is' resulting in him becoming the heir to the Potters, blacks, peverells, founders and occasionally some unknown Lordships, the goblins telling Harry that Dumbledore had been stealing his monetary assets to bribe the weasleys (etc). OR, the goblins try to cheat him at every turn and are simply grouchy bastards.

But I digress:

Harry generally gets special abilities, wandless magic, parsel magic, family magic, is a prodigy, etc etc.

This usually happens at the start of the story and takes away a large part of Harry's character building. He has little room for improvement and is never challenged by his opponents.

In fics where he is challenged by opponents, it's rather unrealistic because he has all that power, but he has no idea how to use it properly. It contradicts the whole super!Harry thing going on. It seems odd for the writer to give him so much power, with so many different uses, only for him to fail spectacularly.

Also, why give an eleven year old, the power to kill wizards 7 times his age with ease? And come out without any mental issues regarding killing a human being? Or for any issues to disappear within two chapters? And the horcrux hunts when he is still a child?

Next, we move on to the villain:

Like Zephrok (it was him, right?) mentioned, a villain had to be respected and feared. If not, it's not gonna be a very good story, is it?

It's long since been known, that Voldemort was a prodigious child, that he could use wandless magic before he came to Hogwarts, and he had no cares about injuring other children. In Hogwarts, he rose through the ranks of Slytherin, despite being a halfblood (though possibly thought to be a mudblood due to not knowing his parentage) and during his later years at Hogwarts (5th?) Kills Myrtle Warrens to create his first horcrux.

This alone shows he is an intelligent adversary, add on over half a century of practical magic studies and use, a few years in politics, and an army of death eaters, he is not someone to be messed with. During the first war, many of those willing to Satan's up to him were killed, and during the second their didn't seem to be many outside of Hogwarts, or the order of the Phoenix, both of which took a heavy blow with Dumbledore's death.

If Harry, at a young age, were to kill Voldemort, regardless of if he is yet to get another body, it makes all of Voldemorts accomplishments seem moot. After all, a child killed him, he couldn't have been THAT bad. It takes away the gear and the respect he has as a villain.

(I'm getting so distracted so I'll try to finish off soon, I've kinda forgotten what I had planned to write.)

We then have the struggle... What is there to struggle against when the MC just killed a MFing dark lord? Not getting homework in on time? End of year exams?

This also means the rest of Harry's Hogwarts years won't happen the same way.

HEAR THAT WRITERS?!?! IF YOU KILL VOLDEMORT BEFORE HARRY GOES TO HOGWARTS, NOTHING THAT HAPPENS THEIR CAN BE CANON!! (Sorry, it's a real peeve of mine).

(I've kinda forgot completely why I was writing this, but I don't want to delete it cause it might be relevant - I have no idea? - so I'm gonna post this anyway.)

** I'd see a three parts series.

1st part: Harry's days at Hogwarts (and maybe some pre Hogwarts stuff as well). Harry is very talented at magic, and develops a real passion for it. He starts to hone his skills.No Voldemort at this point. But Harry will have to face some of the dark lords old henchmen, like Lucius Malfoy (there are some nice things to do with Crabbe and Goyle Sr as a comic duo and Lucius as a mustache twirling villain) or Peter Pettygrew.This one could be a nice blend of comedy, mystery and adventure.

2nd part: Young adult Harry has to face some stronger Death Eaters who are thought to be in contact with Voldemort. The idea is to have Voldemort's figure looming in the background up to this point. Harry could probably face Rookwood/Bellatrix. Challenging opponents, for sure, but nowhere near Voldemort/Dumbledore.This part could become grittier.

3rd part: Later in life, the actual war against a resurrected Voldemort.

This way, the power curve would be a lot leaner while still ending with a good ass kicking for Voldemort.
