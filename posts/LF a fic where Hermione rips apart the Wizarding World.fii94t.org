:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find a story I once read. I recall it being rather sizable.

The scene I recall is a conversation between Harry, Hermione and Neville. Potentially a few other participants. In it, Hermione gets on something of a roll about her views that the Muggle world is superior to the magical one, and winds up saying a number of things in the vein of 'the magical should get with the times' etc. Through this, Neville gets more and more frustrated.

Eventually, when towards the end of the scene, the group has drifted apart. But Neville, venting, pulls Harry aside for a moment and in a fit of temper asks if Hermione has to be such a Mudblood sometimes, referring specifically to the way she tends to hear one aspect of magical culture and then leap to conclusions and start trying to 'fix' what she doesn't bother to understand.

Any ideas?


** Ooh I know this fic! It's The Well Groomed Mind! I'll try to link it in a bit.
