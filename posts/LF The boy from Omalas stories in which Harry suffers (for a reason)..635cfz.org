What I want: suffering for a /reason/.

Example.

1) Kaleidoscope of Magic: he is 'betrayed' and he suffers to awaken a latent power that can only be activated through betrayal. It is not the best written work out there (you can skim a lot of his early rants) but the people in power have a reasonably in-universe consistent reason for inflicting the suffering on Harry. I truly love the Dumbledore's arc in this story. And the authortries decently well to grapple with the morality of making Harry suffer in order to turn him into a weapon/or save him.

2) The one in which he resurrects his sister. Not the best written, and a bit whiny, but Harry's anger and desperation sing from the page.

3) The Merging. Short sequence earlier in the story when he tries to come to terms with the fact that he's basically a sacrifice.

4) The substitute. Classic.
