Hi, could you recommend some Fanfictions where Harry is addicted to the Felix Felicis potion? Thanks so much!


** I read this one in which Harry was addicted and kind of insane: linkffn(stages of hope by kayly silverstorm)

#+begin_quote
  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** I cannot for the life of me find the fic, despite having read it a few days ago - but there's a time travel fic where Harry, Hermione, Luna and Neville are thrown into the past. They go on a rescue mission to retrieve Luna and Neville from a castle with death eaters in and Harry is off his rocker due to the addiction.

I've added the spoiler in case it jolts anyone else's minds. I think it's likely to be on ffn because I can't see it in my Ao3 history. It's a WIP and possibly abandoned.

*** Are you sure it's not [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]]? It's dimension travel and not time travel but the rest of your description is close enough. It's complete and on FFN (don't know if it's also on AO3).
