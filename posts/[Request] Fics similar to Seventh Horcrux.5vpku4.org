  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

  Death messed up his job at Halloween 1981 and now neither Voldemort nor Harry Potter are dead. As if that wasn't bad enough that noisy little brat appears to be able to see him. All of that was quite unexpected. Still it doesn't explain how he somehow found himself stuck to raise the baby. Alright, now that's just awkward. Complete (sort of)
