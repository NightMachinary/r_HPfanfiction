I'm not sure how to describe this correctly, but there is one reason that annoyes me with many fics thas has a !Dark/Grey !Slytherin/Ravenclaw Fem!Harry/Harry where they: like to Prank people because of their ''Marauder blood flowing through their veins'' , Changing Slytherins view of Muggles in 1-3 chool years,

I'm pretty sure there are more reasons but those 2 are the only ones I can think off trying to write it down without it being a rant.


** Linkffn(pureblood pretense) very Slytherin harry, doesn't enjoy being manipulative but will do so in service of her ambitions.

*** Thanks for the Recommendation! But I think I will skip this. Fem!Harry disguising her self as Male!Harry is just for some odd reason Male!Harry to begin with. I'm just guessing that her friends know her gender by accident or something.

**** No, they never find out, and there are no wacky embarassing shower scenes either. She's pretending to be her cousin (Sirius's son). I avoided the series for a long time for similar reasons, but trust me, this one is different, and the best female Harry fic I've ever read.

**** You know how fanfiction authors were first fanfiction readers. That, I believe, leads to many fics being very alike if not in general plot than in little details. And we, as readers, tend to have certain expectations based on what we've already read. This isn't one those fics. It reads like a standalone work, a YA fantasy novel, maybe:) Sorry, if I am not explaining it properly, English is not my native language.

Give it a go, it won't disappoint. And it gets better and bigger as years progress.

** I highly recommend linkffn(Parselbrat). It's a story where fem!Harry finds out she speaks Parseltongue early, and the author is actually quite brisk with their writing. It's rather refreshing. Right now she's in close contact with Quirrelmort, and I'm biting my fingernails, more so than usual, hoping that she's not twisted too much by him.

  Harry discovers Parseltongue a little earlier. As magic goes, it's not very useful. It's enough to make a few friends though. And isn't that enough? (Fem!Harry)

At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

** Wait, did you only want fem!Harry recs? These are not but he doesn't act like a Gryffindor in them.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) Harry doesn't act like the a Gryffindor at all in this fic, although he is somewhat brainwashed by his Horcrux.

linkffn(The art of self fashioning) Harry has a really different personality here,he is somewhat of a sociopath and a lot darker than in canon.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
