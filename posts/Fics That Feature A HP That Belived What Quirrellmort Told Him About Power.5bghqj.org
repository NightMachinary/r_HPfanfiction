Other than linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi), are there any other fics that have the title's premise?


** linkffn(Path of Decision by lulu42) has someone else (and I won't spoil who) tells Harry a slightly different thing, specifically "There is no right and wrong. There is only power and those too weak to see it." Note the one letter change.

It's probably not what you're looking for, but it's quite good, and the crossover elements with "The Sandman" are well done.

*** That was incredible. I've read a lot of fanfiction over the last few months and after reading tens upon tens of fanfictions based on the same tropes it is a real treat to read something new and fresh. Thank you for the recommendation, what an incredible tale.

** In this fic, Harry doesn't believe what Quirrell says about power, BUT Quirrell does emotionally manipulate him into handing over the Philosopher's Stone and becomes a mentor figure to Harry after he flees the castle. Harry's in third year and just now figuring out that Quirrell was lying to him and wasn't a friend of his mother's. Linkffn(a new kind of normal by brilliantlady)

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. Complete. Part 2 of "Perfectly Normal".

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
