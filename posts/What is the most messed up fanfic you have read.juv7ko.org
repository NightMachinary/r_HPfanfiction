** Honestly... its not like gore porn or anything but I'm still DEEPLY affronted by the fact one of the top M rated Harmony fics on FFN featured a blow job scene.... IN FIRST YEAR.

I think the direct moment of 'oh no' came when an Hermione asked "do you know what a blow job is?"

I saw the next sentence wasn't "no and you're still a child so you shouldn't either", and noped so fast my SO asked me what was wrong.

*** I hate when fanfics rush relationships (ESPECIALLY SEXUAL ONES) way to early. I myself am asexual but my brother has had many relationships over the years so I know that even though he had childish 'girlfriends' in elementry and middle school, his first serious relationship wasn't until he was 15-16 years old.

**** Agreed. I mean i know people don't change in the fan fic world be in real life people do. I wasn't the same person at 14, 19, 21 or 25. Partners can grow with you, but only through so much.

And like... I get it. Teenagers have sex. I'm not really gonna get on my high horse for 5th or higher. Maybe 4th year depending on the pairing (and thus age).

But MOTHER FUCKING 11?!?! Thats some call DCFS stuff right thefe.

***** I don't think anyone around the age of 14-15 should be doing that, (or 16 and sometimes 17 for that matter) But DAMN, I hope it's just a messed up child and not an actual adult

****** Like... yeah they shouldn't be. But I also know it happens. Also like... at 14 its pretty harmless to get felt up or whatever. Also I think Hermione is 16 4th year but regardless there are a lot of factors.

There are no factors that make an 11 YO okay. Time travel? No. Soul mates. No. Ancient vampire in young body. No.

Just... like... start the fic later if you must include it at all.

******* I agree... also, I'm pretty sure 4th year is just 14 YO kids so that'd be still pretty weird, but it's got nothing on whatever that fic is. If he didn't start late then it probably was intentional which makes me want to know the name just to report the f*ck out of it. Jesus I certainly think that at least gore is just disgusting on a human level.

******** Everyone starts 4th year at 14, but there are people like Hermione, who turned 15 about two weeks after the term started. So her going to the Yule Ball with a 17 year old Krum isn't that weird, for example.

And as I recall, it's not that unusual for some kids to start dating or otherwise experimenting around 13 or 14. But I don't think those kids usually go very far beyond kissing, and even if they did, I wouldn't want to read about it.

****** In Germany, age of consent is 14 for a reason - as long as both (or more, lol) parties involved consent, are of age and the age gap ain't too crass no one's going to bat an eye.

I don't mind Hogwarts 3rd years experimenting around for that reason as long as it ain't outright porn, but student/teacher ships - that is just... wtf in any case. Why?

******* I don't know. I have been 13 and I don't think either me or anyone on my classroom were any close to reaching enough maturity for a serious relationship so it's quite a bit weird for me, but I guess if it's just some innocent hand holding I wouldn't die. I do know people mature at different ages but I haven't seen anyone myself at that age having reached it. I guess there could be a wizards mature faster excuse, but on my eyes that's a weak one.

** I remember reading a fanfic where a Harry from a war-torn future came back in time to his first year and violently raped Hermione. IIRC, Hermione forgave him after 2 days since "if she didn't, she would feel even worse". That was what she literally said in the fic. This was all in the first chapter BTW. I stopped reading it after that.

** I believe that the Black Queen series by Silently Watches is fairly high up this list. There is some screwed up shit that goes on. Among the many terrible things in those fics are child trafficking, pedophilia, rape, and even more fun things which I've probably forgotten. It's been a while since I read them.

That series is one of the few ones I can think of where the protagonist is a horrible person that you cheer for anyways just because she is the /least/ horrible person at that point.

Lesson learned. I'll trust the description.

** While perusing the Jily tag on AO3 you might stumble upon this fic wherein Jily treat little Harry as a sex toy; little as in 5 or 6 years old, if memory serves right. At one point they give him female genitalia through magic and James gets him pregnant, I think that's included in the tags, too, so you don't even have to read the story to learn such details.

What really disturbs me is how positive the commenters were in that fic, I typically skip reviews but I was curious to see what people were saying about such atrocity and man; it's not just the writer who's a fucking degenerate, but there's a whole gaggle of them who like reading such things.
