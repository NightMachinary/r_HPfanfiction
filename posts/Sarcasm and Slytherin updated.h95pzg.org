There are new chapters for the fifth part of The Sarcasm and Slytherin Series on ao3! They were posted under the profile anonymousmagpie who claims to be the original author sunmoonandstars who recently deleted the account.

It's a Slytherin!Harry fic that is admittedly tropey but otherwise decently written. Especially Harry's friends. And until last year it updated very frequently so hopefully the author can get back into the habit.

** Omg thanks, I was totally blindsided by the deleted account and super sad it would never be completed!

** Thanks for the post. I subscribed to anonymousmagpie on ao3 after seeing the update for 'right under their noses', but for some reason I never got the email update for the S&S story.

** Thank you most kindly for the info! I'm just coming up to Book 5 and was sad that it seemed abandoned.

** Is this a gen or does Harry have a love interest? And do you know any other well written WBWL Slytherin Harry stories? Besides Prince of Slytherin.
