Doing a scene in my fanfiction where some mercenaries attempt to kidnap a certain student but bodyguard Harry stops them.


** Hogsmeade would have lesser security as would travel days.

** A Group of two Wizards polyjuiced followed by two More invisible, and two More on the Air (dissilusioned). The invisible ones acts as taggers, those polyjuiced stun the Target and put him on a Bubble charm+body binding hex, then bag him on an extended bag, finally the bag is taken by air team using a portkey, the other members get out and portkey/apparate away.

** I have several questions about the kind of scene you are trying to write :

- Do the mercenaries have a specific target, or just a specific kind of target (as an example, do they want to kidnap Fleur Delacour, or would any Champion do) ?
- Is their target one of the Champions?
- Is Harry also a Champion (and is he even a student? Or part of the same school than target) ?

​

Anyways, if I had to kidnap someone from Hogwarts (without using the too obvious "touch them with a Portkey while they are at Hogsmead"), I guess I would do something like this :

1. Enter the school using the Triwizard Tournament as an excuse (maybe by impersonating a journalist, or one of these experts sent to create the labyrinth)
2. Try to isolate the target, making her enter the Forst would be optimal. To do so, several scenarios are possible depending of who the target is. Asking him to come for a love confession, threatening to divulgue his secret, following a cute animal, letting him believe you can give him a hint for the Tournament (if Champion) . . .
3. Stund the target while out of sight, and then Transfigure it into something inconspicuous (can a living being be Transfigured into an item like a Knut and survie? If not, just a small animal that can be carried).
4. Simply walk outside of the school by the door and leave

​

Like this, you only need one Mercenary (though others could still be there as backup). Harry can notice something strange (like seeing 2 people enter the Forest, and only one leave). And you can have a chase on the grounds with the Mercenary trying to reach the door and Harry trying to stop them.

​

Also, if the Target is a Champion, I guess you could have an ambush during the 2nd Task. All Champions are alone in the water for one hour, making them easy prey as long as the target can be located (by sneaking an item enchanted to be traceable on her maybe).

*** Harry's a foreign student, attends Beauxbatons, 3yrs older than in canon. The target is Fleur Delacour. This is before the Champions are selected but still in Hogwarts.
