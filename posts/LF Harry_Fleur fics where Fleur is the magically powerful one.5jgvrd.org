** Hm...if you go by Fleur's record in the tournament, then she isn't really that powerful or good at magic, even when playing to her strengths (using that sleeping enchantment on the dragon and enchantment that's similar to her veela-pull) and even when she knows what she will have to face (all the champs new the challenges beforehand and could prepare accordingly!)

I'd rather read a fanfiction where there's no such thing as more magically powerful (why? Because IMHO power in magic comes from knowledge, creativity and flexibility in thinking and not from having larger reserves...kind of bogus, same for that obsession many fanfiction writers have with magical cores!) - unless you do it like Voldemort and go for sacrificial rituals etc. maybe!

*** While I think the magical cores don't make any sense, it wouldn't make sense to say that a Patronus is considered the [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/patronus-charm][mark of superior magical ability]] if there were no such thing. While their magic is not something finite, at least not in the same way the 'magical cores' portray, it does depend on how powerful or talented the wizard is; it's not just a matter of knowledge, creativity and flexibility as you say.

I'd say that while Fleur was a little disappointing, you'd have to take into account that the Tournament was kind of arranged and all 4 of them were talented wizards. It kind of shows when every one of them was elected as the best of their own school (not many possible prospects, certainly, but all of them were well above average).

** I think she was more powerful in linkffn(When A Veela Cries) but I'm not re-reading that to check.

*** Not the case unfortunately. Harry ends up going to Durmstrang and gets tutored specifically so he can fight better.

  A tale of rage and revenge, of loss beyond what any person should have to bear . . . and a tale of love, Harry's only hope out of the darkness.
