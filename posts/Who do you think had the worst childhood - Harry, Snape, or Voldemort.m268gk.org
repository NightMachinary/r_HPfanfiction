** I'm going to have to say Harry. Mostly because he had almost no affection or companionship before Hogwarts. Snape had a mother who loved him (even if she didn't do a good job of protecting him) and a friendship with Lily. I'm not saying he didn't have a bad home life (we can agree he did) but he at least had a few people in his corner. Tom Riddle was a bully in an orphanage. He had other children around him, even if he didn't like them. Contrast this to Harry, who was unloved by his family and had no friends. He slept in a cupboard, forced to watch as his cousin was given unconditional love while he got nothing. For me, that's the worst part. Snape had it bad, but he also came from a poor household. His mother's inability to provide for him wasn't a result of neglect, it was a result of necessity. Voldemort shared the same conditions as all the other children. Harry, on the other hand, was shown time and time again that HE was unworthy, that other children deserved more than he did. That would have been incredibly damaging.

If we move on to Hogwarts years, I again have to say Harry. I don't deny that Snape had a bad relationship with the Marauders, but (contrary to some opinions I've seen) he did have friends. Voldemort had a large circle of followers. Maybe not friends, but I don't think he cared much. Then there's Harry. I've seen people say Harry was popular, but that's just false. He faces widespread scorn multiple times throughout the series (books 2,4, and 5 come to mind) and almost dies nearly every year. If you also consider that he watches Cedric, Sirius, AND Dumbledore die all before the age of 17, I think we have to agree his childhood is worse.

All that being said, trauma isn't a competition :)

** Harry.

Harry was actively neglected and denied his heritage. He slept in a cupboard, got called horrible names, didn't have any friends, and was physically struck by his cousin. These are all things we can confirm with evidence from canon. With Snape, it's a bit vaguer, but it's heavily implied he lived in an abusive household, and we know he was poor. He met Lily when he was about nine (iirc), so he at least had a close friend and was told of his heritage. We're told his father either hated or disliked him, but we don't know what his relationship was like with his mother. If you're including Hogwarts years into "childhood," then I think it'd be a closer call, seeing as Snape wasn't in the same House as his friend, was bullied and belittled by the Marauders, and continued to be poor and abused at home. Harry, on the other hand, had a much better life after starting Hogwarts--coming into wealth, learning about magic, gaining friends, and spending more of his summers away from the Dursleys. He continued to experience terrible things, but he had a support net/group Snape lacked.

We really don't know enough about Voldemort's childhood to make a call about him. We know he hated the orphanage--but whether or not this was because of his superiority complex against Muggles or because of neglect/abuse, who's to say? He was the primary instigator in bullying / violence against the other children. His basic needs seemed to be met. Being in an orphanage is no joke, but from what we see in canon, he did not appear to be abused or neglected, either emotionally or physically.

Tldr; Harry, but worse is subjective. People process traumatic experiences differently.

** Personally I think they all had really bad childhoods but Tom had it the worst. Snape had his mother who even though she tried to help him just got abused aswell, and he grew up with a friend, lily. Harry didn't have friends growing up because of Dudley but he had his relatives but even though they don't exactly like him. Tom didn't have anyone, no family or even friends. He was just left alone after his mother died in birth, and while he was growing up alone and bitter, his dad was having a jolly good time with the rest of the riddles. Not to mention he was in muggle London during ww2, having to live in fear of dying a lonely death, every single time the lights go out. I firmly believe that I would of probably ended up being the same as him, he grew up knowing nothing even remotely close to love. No friends. Nobody to just try hug him when he has a nightmare, tuck him into bed, read him a story, or even clean up his wounds. That just breaks my heart. Snape and Harry grew up knowing a little bit of love but Tom? He didn't even get a few seconds of it. So I'm not surprised at all that he grew up guarded and good manipulator.

He was essentially drugged for months and he left immediately after he got free, which is reasonable considering he has no idea what's going on. Also I'd imagine him not even knowing he had a child and even if he knew his reaction was what most people would do anyways, which again is reasonable. I mean from his perspective his entire free will was taken away from him and when he broken away from the control he found out he has a child he never even wanted in the first place.

The Dutch translation says the following on page 42: 'Toen we 'm in huis namen, hebben we gezworen dat we een eind zouden maken aan dat soort nonsens, dat we die eruit zouden rammen!' zei oom Herman. Tovenaar, m'n hoela!'

Rammen is the plural of ram I think it is used in English with the same meaning: it means punching very hard. It's the same kind of ram you use in English for "battering ram", or "ram-raid for instance.

The Dursleys didn't "try to take the magic out of him" in the same context as Credence. Witches are the devil and that sort of thing didn't happen to Harry, because, first and foremost, the Dursleys didn't even acknowledged magic in his presence. They were rough when they thought he misbehave, which could be as often or not as you like to think, but it was not done without an excuse. Credence got it in a regular basis, misbehaved or not.

The Dursleys path to take the magic out of him was more on the "if they focused enough on muggle things and made him think anything magic was nonsense, then he would forget about magic"

And no, even with the obscurus retcon, Harry does not qualify outside of some weird Indy!Harry fics. Our two examples, Credence and Arianna, had levels of stress and abuse that Harry just didn't reach.

** Mmmm, that's hard to say. I'll go from each case chronologically.

Tom: Unarguably terrible from the start. His mother died from childbirth in the middle of winter in the streets of London and lived long enough to give birth to him in an orphanage. He was the product of a rape, and his father probably hated the very idea of him. He then grew up during The Great Depression as an impoverished orphan and as a teenager lived on in the middle of the worst war humanity has probably known. As a kid he terrorized other children in the orphanage, was ostracized and grew up without love or family.

Snape: Not much is known. Grew up impoverished in a crappy place with an abusive father, was handed secondhand female clothing but unlike Harry and Tom was completely aware of his heritage and looked forward to Hogwarts and unlike Harry and Tom had a friend (Lily). His mother probably loved and cared for him though so he wasn't loveless and wasn't an orphan.

Harry: Orphaned from the start like Tom, unaware of his magical heritage, ostracized and bullied at school, lonely, grew up in a broom closet and was worked like a house-elf by his magic-hating relatives was barely fed and has secondhand clothing from his overweight cousin. No one really loved him but he was a good-hearted kid unlike Tom.

Overall I would say Tom had it worse but Harry can definitely hold a candle to the title. Tom at least had a room in the orphanage he wasn't kept behind a cupboard with bars like an animal and he had clothing of his own even though it's threadbare ones but the orphans looked like they were well taken care of from Harry's POV. Also Harry was constantly working at his relatives house who were abusive like hell. But Tom didn't have a vault full of gold at 11 and lived through two of the lowest times the world has known so I would say he had it worse. Also wether Tom was physically abused/punished in the orphanage is unknown so it's a bit hard to decide.

** I think there is a great difference between how bad their childhood was, and how they perceived their own childhood.

I think both Harry and Tom had it worse with facing violence in what should have been their home, with the combination of not being free to spend the day on the streets if they so wished. It is clear that Severus had that option, which is how he met Lily. Also, he had his mother around whom was presumably his ally in facing his abusive father.

In school Severus and Tom might have been unpopular or bullied, but they certainly didn't nearly a few times die each year, nor did they have to face the entire school's antipathy with each negative rumour or points loss. (The Gryffindor quidditch team is on my shit list for 'the seeker' in book 1)

Severus lashed out because of his childhood grievances, and don't get me started on Voldemort's motivations. Harry settles down and raises a family.

** It's arguable that Tom had the worst childhood. The only person who could have cared for him unconditionally died in childbirth, his father was raped and probably hated the very idea of him from the start. And that's just the beginning. he grew up in an orphanage in the late 1920s/1930s and that time was not a good time to be an orphan. In addition, he was forced to return to that orphanage during the London Blitz during World War II, which started the "holiday" before the year he opened the chamber and created his first Horcrux.

​

This is, of course, ignoring what he did as a child. It's entirely possible that he was always going to turn out that way and no matter what kind of childhood he had, but it certainly didn't help him become a well adjusted person.

*** It makes you wonder if JK realized what the dates meant when she wrote it, or if she realized it later. Seems like having a Hogwarts student return to a muggle orphanage during the summer during the blitz would be cruel, even wizards had to have noticed london getting bombed, and yet knowing he lived in an orphanage there with zero wizarding support and no legal way to protect himself, supposedly no alternative was offered to him... Did any orphanages in london actually stay open or would he had to have broken in? I tried looking it up but couldn't find anything difinative, yes the evacuations were voluntary but one would think an orphanage wouldn't risk it. Makes sense as a parent not wanting to be separated but someone in charge of an orphanage wouldn't have that problem, maybe they didnt offer evacuation for orphans but that also seems unlikely. Can you imagine the press should an orphanage get bombed? So what, Tom shows up and sits alone in the vacant orphanage all summer hoping the bombs miss the only shelter he has? If that's the case Dumbledore isn't all that original in placing Harry at risk and disregarding his welfare, it's just part of being a headmaster at Hogwarts. 🤷‍♀️ Sounds like Hermione should have started a wizarding social services department, they're truly lacking in that field.

** Hard question. Harry's childhood was really sad but it leaves me impressed what kind of person he grew up to be. Voldemort was psychopathic and did horrendous acts early on in his childhood. (Hanging Billy Stubbs' rabbit from the rafters, traumatized two children into silence) maybe he was ostracized but he clearly knew how to fight back in his own way. Snape hat Lily but lived in a poor, abusive home.

So the most pity I've left is for Snape and Harry. Both had shitty childhoods but in a different way. I'm not sure how I should go about comparing them.

** Totally Voldemort in my opinon. Can you imagine growing up alone in an orphanage during the worst of a world war? We know nowadays that orphanages are terrible places to raise children. That's why they were phased out because so many of the children growing up in them turned out emotionally unstable with a massive increase in their risk of becoming a criminal. Simply put, we don't know what kind of things Tom Riddle suffered growing up in the orphanage, but at the very least he was in London during the bombings of the city. I would postulate that he suffered at least some abuse from at least a few of the older children when he was small enough that his accidental magic was unreliable. In fact, it's probably because he had to control his accidental magic to prevent abuse and protect himself that he had such exemplary control growing up.

Snape had his mother, so he had some form of comfort in his life, though we don't honestly learn very much about her. Still, he obviously thought very highly of her since much of his early hatred of muggles came from redirecting his hatred for his father onto other people, so I would state that while he likely suffered the most severe physical abuse of the three he likely had a better relationship with his mother and was able to know love in some form growing up/

Most of the abuse we see in the books for Harry is verbal and the occasional physical. We know the Dursleys lock him in his room, deny him adequate living space, and denigrate him to the neighbors whenever possible. I don't personally subscribe to the idea that they regularly beat the shit out of him, but we also have the most information regarding his personal life of the three. The emotional abuse that he receives is extreme, and it is obvious to see how that affects him in cannon.

Now all of these situations seem terrible. I would never recommend comparing abuse in real life since it is rarely beneficial to compare trama, but as I stated at the beginning, Voldemort likely had the worst childhood of the three. See, even with how objectively awful the Dursleys are and how terrible Tobias Snape is there is something that they offer to Harry and Severus that Tom never has.

Security.

At the end of the day, Petunia Dursley took in Harry. Tobias Snape never kicked Eileen and Severus out. And if either of those things were to happen, there is something there. A safety net. Harry has the order and a vault with gold to stay at the Leaky Cauldron if nothing else. Severus has a mother who could have made certain to provide for her son I necessary. Did Tom have that? No. If Wool's orphanage was carpet-bombed into infinity and beyond, Tom literally has nothing. No one but himself and his dream to be great.

Now, if the question was who seems the least affected by their abuse, my vote would be Harry. Not to say that he isn't affected, he totally is, but nowhere near the degree Voldemort or Severus are.

**** Being abused causes different reactions in different people. Besides that, Harry goes from abuse to abject adoration at the age of eleven. I figure that if he had simply been some no name kid his first year things might have gone differently.

Harry also isnt particularly ambitious. Severus and Tom are incredibly talented and ambitious people. They want things desperately, whereas Harry mostly wants to be left to himself and his friends and family.

I also feel like they both were more likely to have experienced cruelty from a wider base than Harry was. Harry relates all his woes back to the Durselys and the Dursleys alone. Even being bullied in primary he traces back to Dudley. Tom likely experienced cruelty from tons of people just because of the way orphanages worked there would have been staff moving in and out of the facility. Furthermore, being an orphan isnt the most luxurious well respected position. Severus too attributed the faults of the non magical as begin caused by their lack of magic rather than them simply being assholes.

** if childhood as in before hogwarts years, I'd say Harry, obviously.

if childhood means before the age 17, I'd say Snape cuz at least hogwarts felt like home to Harry (and he got Weasleys), but to Snape, Voldemort was kinda home, that's how worse things were. and tbh i don't believe Eileen loved Severus that much, would he become a death eater if his mother is obviously against it (as she married a muggle despite knowing her parents would disown her, (wait that's canon, right?)). idk. he had his friendship with Lily but it was toxic to both of them (except before hogwarts and that was 3 years only).

Voldemort grew up in orphanage and all but he made things worse himself and, well, the "unable to love" thing didn't help much

** Voldie for sure. Orphanages back in those days were supposedly notoriously awful, and his life starts right around the time of the great depression. To top it off he's spending his early years dealing with WW2 and all that comes with it. That means living through food and clothing rationing, blackouts, the Blitz (which would mess up anyone I think), and constantly being denied the safety of the wizarding world during wartime when he gets sent back to the muggle orphanage every year without regard to what's happening in the muggle world. Thats just a whole lot of awful to be piling into a kid.

I lived in San Francisco where they still utilize their ww2 era air raid sirens on a weekly basis. Even knowing that the sirens are just a system test, my heart would still jump into my throat when they went off! I can't imagine hearing that and knowing it means your city is about to be bombed, so good luck to you. /shudder/

It's just my own theory, but I figure having had to live a childhood where everything was dominate or be dominated on a daily basis, and death was a very real reality in the grand scheme are the the factors that lead him to become obsessed with finding a way to be undefeatable and to never die.

🤷🏻‍♀️ But also I just think too much in general so take that as you will.

EDIT TO ADD: In case anyone who isn't familiar with it and is curious, this is a video of the air raid siren in the Bay Area. Every Tuesday at noon, doing me a concern, giving me a panic! (I don't live there anymore, btw.) Some parts of the city you can hear multiple sirens from all around you at once. Fun times. 😨

** tom, his and harry's childhood are not comparable. but also like, trauma isn't objective and all three (snape, riddle, and potter) are extremely traumatized and emotionally stunted. tom was a magical orphan in the 1930s, he had Nothing, harry was neglected severely but he still grew up in a suburb with family. harry grew up in this weird pseudo poverty which is obviously horrible, and he was the scapegoat in the dursley's family, which would be extremely traumatizing . tom probably lived in extreme poverty throughout his childhood and young adulthood, he was threatened with institutionalization and was definitely excluded by his peers. additionally living through WWII and being denied any job opportunities.\\
harry potter gets a family, tom does not.

basically: tom had to buy second hand robes from a scholarship and couldn't get a job, and grew up surrounded by bigots. harry had a shit childhood but is worshipped from age 11 onwards, he doesn't have to worry about money or a job. contrary to fanon, the dursley's would not kill harry (although they might sell him out to DEs but...), his summers are horrible but he gets to go spend time with his family every year, tom had to go back to an orphanage in the middle of a war.

just remembered this post also involves snape, well i think he got the best childhood out of the three, he had, albeit abusive, parents and a close friend in lily.

** Does childhood include Hogwarts years? I personally feel that before Hogwarts, the one who had it worst was Harry. He had no refugee, and was unloved and treated badly by his supposed family. It's a wonder he turned out as well as he did.

Snape had a refugee in Lily. Sure, the friendship didn't last, but he did go through the pre-Hogwarts years with her friendship intact and (at least in my headcanon) healthy. However, it's not surprising that he turned out the way he did, if what general fanon portrays the childhood as is mostly correct. Spinner's End is probably not the nicest place to live, and he had poor experiences with Muggles as a whole (his father, Petunia, etc) while the magical people he knew (Lily, his mother) treated him with human decency. For someone as young as him, it's not surprised that this evolved into a prejudice against Muggles as a whole.

Come Hogwarts however, Snape easily had it worse than Harry. He ends up the target of bullying from the most popular group in school, and people avoided him as a result. The only ones treating him decently seems to be the Slytherin junior DE squad, and we all know how that turned out. I personally always felt sympathy for /young/ Snape and like reading fics where things turn out for the better for him. But this sympathy doesn't really last past his student years where he decides to join a group whose goals is exterminating people like his former best friend. I can understand the choice, but can't really sympathize with it. I mostly just feel pity for the lost potential at that point, and for the fact that he could have turned out so much better if more people actually cared about him. He's an absolute prodigy, and who knows what he could have done for the Wizarding World had he turned out better.

I always saw Tom as a sociopath. Yeah, I know orphanages, especially back then, had it rough, but that is no excuse to do what he did. It seems to me like he was actively tormenting everyone there. No wonder the people around him was wary about him. Beyond that, we know very little about his Hogwarts years.

** The answer is without a doubt Harry. He lost his parents when he was a baby, didn't know anything about his family until he turned 11, lives in a cupboard under the stairs and has to cook, clean and do other chores for his aunt and uncle, and gets tortured and beat up by his cousin, all the while acting “weird” because he can't help it or explain it, and not having any friends because he does random acts of magic and gets punished for them.

***** Harry also didn't use dark magic on muggleborn students or bullied others like Snape did. Snape gave as good as he got. At fifteen years old he had literally invented a spell to slice people open, leaving them to a slow and painful death if not treated. I‘m not saying the marauders were angels but they also didn't gang up on innocent, helpless little Snape like some people make it out to be. And Snape had a loyal and forgiving friend. He just lost her when he called her a racial slur after already for years associating with people who wanted to kill people like her. It was Snapes own fault that he lost her. He literally brought his own misery upon himself during his Hogwarts years and I honestly doubt that if this were real life and Snape was some openly racist Nazi kid, anyone would bat an eye when he got bullied /for being a Nazi and bullying other kids for their race/. Snape, at any point, could have just stopped being a racist git and would have had a quiet and peaceful live at Hogwarts living under the radar.

Harry on the other hand didn't do shit and got ostracised by the whole school and later even by the whole fucking wizarding world. And it's ridiculous to pretend that his money or a position on a school team somehow compensated for that.

** Snape!

Broken home. Parents didn't really care about him and often fought. He wore shitty clothes, wasn't made of money. Looked like a tool so kids avoided him.

Lily was different, Lily didn't care. He found one Ray of sunshine in his otherwise muddled life and clung onto it.

Sorting hat made stupidest decision threw him into the vengeful lot. Bunch of horny bullies made his life hell because worse of them all James Potter wanted Lily. They were bullies, so didn't have any class to go one on one with him. Snape tried to have them thrown out of school, was there any other way? Sirius Black wanted him to ripped apart by Werewolf form Lupin. Thousand of students in the school, none stood up for him, except for Lily.

He house mates try to brainwash him, "Don't hang out with the muggle borne, you're destined for greatness, Dark lord will take over the world you can take your revenge." But he was like, "Oh fuck off!"

Things are still depressing, He's inventing new spells to fend of Bullies. After particular long session of showing underwear upside down and have 20 dickheads laugh at you, he finally snaps.

Calls Lily, mudblood. She's in shock, their Friendship cracks just like that.

He spends nights sitting in front of Fat lady, finally she comes out and speaks. But for the last time.

Snape lost everything. He now has nothing to live for.

Having parents who don't give a fuck about you is worse than not having them at all.

Harry had wonderful friends, a circle of them, most powerful wizards in entire nation stalked him day and night to keep him safe. Snape had just one, for a while.

His life was cursed from the start and till the end!

** I think we lack sufficient information on all three childhoods before Hogwarts.

Harry's primary school was not mentioned, I always thought it was weird and a bit of a lazy plot device that he didn't have friends. He did had it bad with being locked in a tiny space and the emotional abuse but I believe he was the one more physically healthy.

We don't know what type of abuse suffered Snape but if we assume that was the typical that the ambience give, physical abuse in a poor household would not be too unlikely. Drunk father, overwhelmed mother.

And finally Tom, true his emotional abuse could be downplayed because of his lack of emotional attachment but orphanages back then were awful. It was the middle of the great depression so even food was lacking and later on wwii. I can imagine some pretty horrifying situations.
