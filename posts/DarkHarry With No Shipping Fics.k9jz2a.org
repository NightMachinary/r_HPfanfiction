Looking for some Dark!Harry Potter fics with no shipping/relationships with Harry himself. Can have other ships, but none for Harry.

Can be Dark, Grey, Dark Lord, Slytherin, Insane etc. So long as there is no endgame Harry/X Person!

Would prefer it on AO3 & at least 20,000 or over words.

Thanx in advance!


** 1)Blood Crest ¬ª Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

2) The Eyes ¬ª Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to. Excerpt from the story:

The old man frowned. "My child?"

"They do not blink," Harry continued. "They do not breathe, drink, eat, properly talk or walk. They walk, but not well enough. They are not real. They are more than real. I see them," he whispered. "I see their shadows at night dance under the pale light of death's candle, and I'm afraid. Afraid..."

A sixteen year old would have been able to speak in such a way. At eleven with his shoddy and gaunt appearance, the words that Harry Potter, the saviour of the wizardry world, spoke were starting to make the back of Dumbledore's beard rise.

3) Had I Known ¬ª After killing Voldemort during seventh year, Harry vanished without a trace. But now, 8 years later, a deadly secret forces him to return and it seems that only Snape will be able to save him. Grey Harry deals with ptsd eventual friendship powerful Harry with lots of darkness in the story

4) Quo Vadis? by Ruskbyte

Summary: It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way.

Excerpt from story: "No. Don't worry; we won't insult the clich√© of hero versus villain by ignoring your offers of power, glory and material wealth," said Potter as they approached. "So... please, begin tempting us."

5) Evil Be Thou My Good Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.

5) Leviathan Rising by Ruskbyte

Set in Gof, what if Harry had found a way to overcome the second task? What if while searching through the library he came across an insignificant seeming little book that teaches him the magic he needs?

6) The Unforgiving Minute ¬ª Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours

7) Elizium for the Sleepless Souls ¬ª The crumbling island prison of Azkaban has been evacuated, its remaining prisoners left behind. Time growing short, Harry Potter will make one final bid for freedom, enlisting an unlikely crew of allies in a daring escape, where nothing is as it seems

8) The Sum of Their Parts by holdmybeer Harry Potter u:04-12-2016 - For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

9) Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails Oceanbreeze7 Summary: Are you a witch or Are you a fairy? Or are you the wife of Michael Cleary? ‚ÄúThe fairies will do wicked things sometimes,‚Äù Harry murmured gently, ‚ÄúSteal the milk when they get a chance, or skim the cream off the milk crocks.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo they ever steal anything more?‚Äù Luna asked him rhetorically. Harry couldn't answer.

10) Petrichor BlameMyMuses Summary: In attempting to stop Sirius from falling through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries, Harry goes half through it himself before being dragged back into the living world. After the battle, things should have gone back to normal...but they don't. Something about Harry is changing, and he doesn't know why, what to do about it, or just what it means for his future confrontations with Voldemort.
