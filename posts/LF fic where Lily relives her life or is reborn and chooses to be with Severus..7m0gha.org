  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

** Hmmmm linkffn(ananke) might count. She might as well have been reborn in that fic. You could check out linkffn(obscura nox animae) as well! That one has an interesting premise and has Lily sort of reborn through a unique spell.

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.

***** No problem, it was actually a reply to a comment I made here in the sub! If you look at my post history you'll be able to see. I was actually rooting for James/Lily but it won't be that as well...

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.
