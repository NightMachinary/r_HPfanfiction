I'm writing a scene where a character floos into a house that has been empty for a while and I'm not sure if it would be a plot hole. Do you just need a connection to the floo network? After all, the Weasleys managed (mostly) to floo to Privet Drive not only without any fire in the fireplace, but the fireplace itself was electric. On the other hand, if anybody could just floo whenever, it would be very bad for security, especially during the war.

So what do you think, does a fireplace at the destination have to be lit?


** The departure fireplace has to be lit, but the arrival fireplace needn't be. That allows the Weasleys to get to Privet Drive in canon. It does seem like a security risk, so I have them be lockable in my story. You can set your fireplace to accept calls only, or be totally closed. I have a switch on the side of the fireplace with three settings, and also remote switches you can carry with you to enable you to open your home Floo remotely. I admit that this seems too logical for the wizarding world, but it was all I could think of.

** I don't think it has to be lit as long as the fireplaces is connected it can create green flames on the destination side but most people probably have their fireplaces set up in a way that only lets certain people through or requires a password to step out.
