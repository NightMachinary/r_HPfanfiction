I know both Broomstick Flyer and myself have done it, but I'm looking for stories where despite Ron and Hermione being married, either Rose, Hugo or both is Harry's child and it ends up with Harry/Hermione at the end.

Can anyone help

  Did you ever wonder what happened in the 19 years between the last chapter and the epilogue of Deathly Hallows? Or what happens afterward? Totally, completely, and eventually H/Hr, but we have a long road to get there! Rated T for language & sexuality.
