  ABANDONED. Tricked into falling through the veil, Harry finds himself in an alternate dimension where the first war continues to rage and people he thought he had lost are alive and well. You've read it all before, right? Wrong. Warning: sequels will never be written. Apologies.

My summary: shortly after the war, a research accident sends Harry to Arrakis, and he gets caught up in the events of /Dune/. Harry becomes an officer for the House of Atreides. Maintains the brutality of the Dune series. The plot does adjust to Harry's influence, but he isn't given god-like power/agency and many events still happen the same. Very good fic in my opinion. The author is still at it too, it's been updated recently. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6964817/1/Chosen-Ones]]

***** Thanks. The Dune series has been on my "to-read" pile for a while now, so this actually encourages me to up it on my list. The fact that the idea of reading a fanfic is what is encouraging me to read the books is pretty... funny(/cough/ weird /cough/) to say the least...

  Harry's lived a long life. A good life. He's ready to go, but like all bureaucracies, Death's a little behind on their paperwork. He'll be fine in a temporary storage track, right? AU Epilogue-compliant WARNINGS: ineffective suicide(s), light gore, swearing, off-kilter humor, sort of dark!Harry, sort of time travel

  Harry James Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, the Defeater of Voldemort, Chief Auror, Master of Death, finds that he is five years old. It should not surprise anyone that things in Magical Britain immediately become rather strange.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.

** It's been a long time since I read it and I don't remember many of the details, but Crumbling Pedestal by Shivani has Harry go back to the time of the founders, grow into an adult there with adopted kids, and then returns to the current time still an adult. A warning it's Harry/Snape slash if that's not your thing.

Shivani also has it [[http://hp.grazhir.com/cp][here]].

  Slash, HPSS- Harry's date with Voldemort at the conclusion of the Triwizard tournament didn't go quite as planned. Fate steps in with a 'unique' opportunity, offering Harry the chance to live and mature in the past. For a while, anyway.
