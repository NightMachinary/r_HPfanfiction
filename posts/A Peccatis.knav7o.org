I know a lot of people who have tried to go through the DYAoD Trilogy couldn't make it past Sluagh. But if you have what did you guys think of A Peccatis and its ending. Personally I think it was a little rushed in the end, but overall an interesting end to it all. And yes I know the author is a bit fucked in the head, but ignore all that for now.
