What I'm trying to ask is: Do you go looking for recently posted stories or do you wait until stories have a certain number of reviews, favourites and follows or are recommended to you somewhere?

How long does a new story have to be for you to give it a go?

What else are you looking for when you read new stories?

How/where do you look for new stories?

How much time/words do you give a story to convince you it's worth reading? And: Do you give stories that were recommended to you by a trusted source / stories with a good reputation / many reviews / followers /favourites more time to convince you than you give new stories?

Personally I wait until a story has somewhere between 10 000 to 20 000 words because quite often stories get abandoned after one or two chapters and I don't like getting invested in a plot and then never seeing it updated again. I mostly look on ffnet, sometimes archiveofourown.org. If there are severe grammar or spelling mistakes or if the author switches between times I'll most certainly stop reading. Mostly I can tell after the first chapter if I want to continue reading a story, but if it was recommended somewhere I trust/ has many followers etc. I might continue reading even if the first chapter didn't impress me, hoping that it gets better.


** I never look at the glut of recent stories in ff.net because there's so many pebbles to wade through to get to the rare gem. Also, I rarely look at reviews, as they aren't an accurate gauge of quality. This is particularly true now, with blatant review whoring (hello LessWrong) and the fandom's reading being done increasingly on mobile devices where leaving reviews is a PITA.

Instead, I focus my searches. For new stories, I tend to browse threads like DLP's "Almost Recommended" and Beyond the Veil's "Updated Fics" for promising stories I've not yet encountered. This sub also occasionally has something good I've not run across. "Favorites" and "C2" lists compiled by authors who write stories I enjoy and whose tastes seem to align with mine are another source of new material.

As for whether I read work in its early phases or not, if it's an author whose work I've read before and enjoyed, I'll read their stories pretty much from chapter 1. I tend to request alerts to authors along with stories if I find an author to be good and this tends to be a pretty reliable way to get new stuff.

If it's a story I'm picking up cold (however I happened upon it), I read in detail the first paragraph and then skim the first couple chapters to get a sense of whether it's worth the investment. If it is, I go back and reread carefully and get into it for real (unless it's a dimension/time travel story, in which case chapter 1 is almost always a throwaway prologue that can be safely ignored).

** I have these two links bookmarked, and check them around once per day:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10&len=100][Stories with at least 100,000 words, sorted by update date]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10&len=40&s=2][Complete stories with at least 40,000 words, sorted by update date]]

This is after I've already looked through the most-favorited and most-reviewed stories on FFN, the most-kudoed stories on AO3, and some of the TV Tropes recommendations. (I have similar bookmarks set up for /Naruto,/ as well.) I don't look at the first chapter of /every/ story I find in this fashion, of course--I check the summary and the counts of reviews and favorites before deciding to click on it.

If the summary and favorite/review count look promising (in terms of /both/ story /and/ English), I'll usually glance at at least the first page. It's fairly rare that I continue to read after the first chapter if it doesn't interest me.

** Mostly I go by recommendations on here but sometimes I just browse by recent over 100k words in English and without snape or Draco.

  Just had my first promising find in months actually. I'm only halfway through the prologue but I'm really enjoying the writing of The Hogwarts Strike Team so far.

Sociopath Harry and Hermione didn't put you off? You're made of more tolerant stuff than I.

**** Bummer--I didn't mean to chase off the person to whom I responded. I was genuinely curious about how others receive certain elements of the story. [[/s][Spoiler]]

** I'm generally looking for a story to have at least 10k words, and a good ratio of words-to-chapter (1,000 words per chapter at minimum). There are certain red flags that will make me drop a story faster than Lucius Malfoy would drop a muggleborn off a cliff, such as poor grammar and spelling, poor writing in general, obvious OOC behavior or blatant lore-breaking.
