I've read Where No Shadows Fall and Shiny and Blue, but finding >20k fics beyond them is proving harder than I thought. I have a soft spot for Hermione centric ones but open to options here.

I also once read one where Hermione was thrown back to the Victorian era (aka extra old Dumbledore I guess) that was really good, but I can't find it again, extra points to anyone who does. I don't remember much at all except that witches had to take some kind fo household management class and Hermione was not pleased.

(Yes I know Dumbledore is canon gay and/or hung up on Grindelwald)
