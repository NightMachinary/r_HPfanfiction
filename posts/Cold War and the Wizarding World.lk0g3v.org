Obviously I've been on a very big James Bond kick (sorry) and last night after reading and listening to a podcast on the Cold War I had a thought: If Grindlewald and his rise and defeat = WW2 then is their anCold War analogue? Maybe not so much the Ministry of Magic vs the Wizarding equivalents of the USSR but maybe a MACUSA led NATO analogue be some sort of East Europe type Warsaw Pact group. In my head canon, which clearly is cracked, Durmstrang is part of the Warsaw Pact group and one of the reasons (aside from being a former Death Eater) for Karkaroff being distrustful is that Durmstrang (like the rest of the world) is still acclimating to the fall of the USSR and more open relationship with the west. Clearly I should lay off the coffee and spy novels. Thanks for listening.


** If I'm being completely honest here, that could easily be a good analogy for Voldemort gaining followers and creating Horcruxes

*** That really would be a neat thing to see. I've read some stories talking about Russian wizards with special winter battle magic and I would like to see a thing about friends turning to foes and maybe even some Wizarding version of project paperclip

**** It would be amazing. And, since we're on this topic, doesn't it seem weird that the Triwizard Tournament returned after the fall of the Soviet Union? So perhaps we can view that under the lens of the ending of a Wizarding Cold War?

***** Ooh I like that a lot. A whole lot actually. I bet the fallout of that tournament was a PR nightmare. What was supposed to be a renewal of friendship ended with a dead competitor and claims that a Dark Lord had returned. No wonder Fudge covered it up. Also how suspicious would it look that the person who defeated Grindelwald was now saying another Dark wizard was back right at the point tensions were loosening? Might look like Dumbledore was trying to push for more power. No wonder he lost his titles.

****** On top of that, it after it was revealed that Dumbledore was telling the truth, no other country would be able to help due to how far behind the eight ball they were. It fixes a lot of things that don't exactly hold up, while also giving us a pure explanation about everything else that happened

******* And what if, like you said, during the Cold War Voldemort starts getting followers and poses as a sort of defector to the Wizarding equivalent of the USSR to get recruits? Maybe Karkaroff started as a high ranking member of the Warsaw Pact wizard nations who was acclimating a young Tom Riddle to the Eastern Bloc but wound up being controlled by him? I kind of want this to be a thing.

******** Or perhaps Karkaroff was a supporter/acolyte of Grindelwald and essentially gave Voldemort a demonstration on how they were trained, inspiring him to create the Death Eaters

********* That's a pretty good idea. I could also see maybe that Tom might...and I stress might...ask some questions to Dumbledore about Grindlewald which would add to the suspicions Dumbledore had of him. I still like the idea of Karkaroff thinking he is in control of this you g kid but really Tom is the one in charge. This is a really fun Avenue of discussion. Also, of Karkaroff was a high ranking Grindlewald supporter would he know about him a d Dumbledore? If so would Tom be privy to that information? Probably not but a neat thought

********** Perhaps he would, and if Grindelwald actually wanted to be redeemed, what better way than to help Dumbledore? Riddle asking about their relationship would make him seem more suspicious, and then using a high ranking supporter of the previous Dark Lord would give them a common enemy. So, perhaps Grindelwald saw the future and told Dumbledore about around the same time as he heard the prophecy, leading to the two accepting their deaths and essentially giving their last few decades to trying to protect the generation that would follow Voldemort's fall?

*********** Sold on this. Someone had a really neat fanfic that was essentially letters between Albus and Grindlewald and a few were of Grindlewald talking about how an “upstart dark lord” was talking to him. This idea of yours would really fit well into canon and give some good behind the scenes stuff. I really like it and it could show how the magic and Muggle words are intertwined
