Or H/L fics, both are good. But I'm just sick of the bashing. The unrealism.

**** For anyone considering starting this story, some caveats:

The author is adamant about using movie canon, as they never read the books. This probably isn't a big deal to some people, but take the first chapter's A/N seriously. Constantly reading about Hermione gazing into Harry's brilliant blue eyes was a bit off-putting to me.

Perhaps also stemming from not having read the books, I felt like the author didn't really have a good grasp on any of the HP characters; almost everyone seemed very OOC and one-dimensional.

Both those things made me put the story down about half-way through, which was really disappointing to me as it comes so highly recommended in this subreddit.

*** How do you put up Champion's Champion as a suggestion for "not Weasley bashing H/HR fics" when the SUMMARY for that fic has the following quote:

"This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing."

**** Because this is a list that gets posted whenever people go looking for H/Hr fics, usually without additional requirements, so some entries are not going to meet tighter standards since it was created with looser ones in mind.

This new fic is pretty sweet and regularly updated. It's H/Hr time travel with no Dumbledore bashing (he's a pretty cool guy eh). Still don't know which way will it turn in regards to Ginny though.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]] is wonderful. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6624252/1/Nocturnal][Nocturnal]] has a goofy Ron and barmy Dumbles, but no bashing. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8101469/1/Hermione-Granger-is-Stupid][Hermione Granger Is Stupid]] is one of the best HBP replacement fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3255466/1/The-List][The List]] also keeps everyone likeable.

Those are just the ones I could think of off the top of my head. If you don't mind Ron and Dumbles being /very/ light-hearted comic relief, I'd start with Nocturnal.

** Chem prof and Old Crow write some good ones. They are usually long and keep Ron and Dumbles likeable. They are also fun because many of their stories were written before HP was completed, so you get to be reminded of what the fandom speculated on!
