Where females are friends/best friends. We see a lot of male/male or male/female friends, but not as much female/female friendships.

Can be from any ERA/Any Site/Anyone can be the MC/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, if not that's fine

NO Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.

Not looking for romance, but if there is: I'm fine with het/slash/femslash (Note I don't want the friends to be in a romantic relationship with each other)


** I've said before that linkao3(Flutter by bking4) is not only one of the better ritual magic fics, but also one of the best feminist fics, because it tells a story focused on the girls of canon without bashing the guys or even really focusing on them. It's about Ginny and Luna bonding, about how Hermione and Ginny become closer as friends, and about inter-house rivalries and relationships. Through it all, the boys are around, canon events are still happening, they're just not the focus of the story. Really a beautiful example of telling a story by weaving around the gaps in canon.

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

  A missing scene set after Ginny and Hermione disagree about Harry using Sectumsempra on Malfoy in the "Sectumsempra" chapter of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Ginny feels badly about insulting Hermione's lack of Quidditch know-how, and they hash things out and then talk about Ginny's feelings for Harry. The title is taken from a song from "Jesus Christ Superstar."

** /Faith and Understanding/ is one of my very favorites. It's Ginny and Luna's friendship, with Ginny's musings therein.

[[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Link]]

It's sweet, it's heart-warming, it's tender. It breaks with canon fairly considerably, but I don't care. This is, frankly, one of the most beautiful platonic love stories I've ever read.

As a final note, it has my favorite passage from any /Harry Potter/ fanfic:

#+begin_quote
  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  “Luna, who's your favorite person?”

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  “You are.”

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely---nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
