I'm looking for a fic I read a while back that popped into my mind recently. The only scenes I remember are that Harry was apparently a Warlock with a back tattoo symbolising his status, and he attended a lovecraftian university somewhere in America that had a several thousand year old Headmaster. I believe it was a time-travel fic as well, although I'm hazy on that part (it was a long time ago).

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

*** The title sounds familiar, and it's the kind of thing I'd read back then, so this is probably it. Thanks!
