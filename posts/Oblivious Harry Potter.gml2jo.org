Basically Harry is super oblivious when it comes to love- like he doesn't even realise it.

Does anybody know any ff's where idk like somebody is trying to express their love to Harry or trying to subtly convey their feelings, but like Harry doesn't even know it and that is making the person very frustrated about that. And maybe soon they give up on being subtle -cause it's not like Harry noticed their gestures anyway- and starts going all out with big romantic stuff and there are bets going on with students and teachers on 1.) How long it will take for Harry to finally notice and 2.) How long it will take (insert person's name here) to give up?

And it soon turns into this huge inside joke involving literally every student, teacher, portrait and ghost (except Harry). Maybe the students who bet against (insert person's name here) and Harry will try to spoil all the plans while others who bet to support (insert person's name here) and Harry will try to make it perfect and suddenly everybody's fighting about that; “and dammit Harry! Can't you see that (insert person's name here) loves you? Just kiss him already! Seriously, kiss him. Preferably before this weekend.”

And poor Harry is so confused and just wants to eat his treacle tart in peace without somebody trying to bring him flowers or gifts or poems or snakes.

If anybody knows any ff similar to this, please, please tell me! Thanks :)

** Canon.

I mean, the books were written from his perspective, and we didn't know if one of his best friends was black or white till Rowling said something on Twitter.

Do you think he notices shit like people having a crush on him!?

*** ...I hate to defend Rowling because the TERF shit she said is absolutely stupid and disgusting.

Still, you have to have really bad reading comprehension if you read that tweet as "Hermione was black all along I meant it like that."

When an black actress played Hermiome, bigots were yelling that Hermione can't be black. Rowling said she "loves black Hermiome," and that she didn't write Hermione as exclusively white - as in, her white-ness wasn't a necessary trait for her character. Contrast that with her wild, unkempt hair, which is.)

This is not to endorse her treatment of race in the boom series, we have like 3 people of color - and none of them really is 'of color' beside having a sterotypical name ('Cho Chang'? come on!)

Back to black Hermione, if you try to read that one tweet maliciously, and try to take all context away, then sure, you can read it as "Rowling always meant Hermione was black." But that would be stupid.

If you want to get mad at Rowling, do it for shit that matters, like her being a TERF.

**** I never thought I would get into a discussion on transphobia and racism because of a slightly inaccurate joke...

For the record, I'm not mad at Rowling. What she says, what she believes in, is her business. I spend hours reading headcanons and fanfic which are clearly a big 'f*ck you' to canon. It simply doesn't matter.

I get where you're coming from tho, some of the stuff she said isn't what most people can ignore.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.
