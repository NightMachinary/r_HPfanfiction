Yes, I'm utterly shameless. To be more specific, here are the elements I'm looking for:

- 4th-6th year preferably
- Romance/smut focus
- R rating preferably
- Slow progression of "sex acts", not diving straight into full-on sex.
- Lots of teasing before people get around to sex (accidental nudity, sleeping in the same bed but not screwing, that sort of thing)
- Decent writing from a technical standpoint
- Characters who feel like they could conceivably act that way, rather than being instant sex gods with no inhibitions and complete confidence

Don't want:

- "I love you more", "No, I love you more" fluff.
- Angst
- Tens of thousands of words that aren't progressing the romance/smut plotline e.g. 30,000 words of will readings in Gringotts
- Harems (multiple partners acceptable if it's a non-harem, e.g. truth or dare, threesome, successive partners not being seen simultaneously)
- Dark Harry, violent sex, BDSM

Examples:

- Chapters 1-18 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5790760/1/Searching-For-The-Power][Searching for the Power]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5446275/1/It-Could-Only-Happen-to-Harry][It Could Only Happen to Harry]] by HoosYourDaddy

- [[http://restrictedsection.org/story.php?story=1458][The Best of a Bad Situation]] by RossWrock

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4541731/1/Alternative-Medicine][Alternative Medicine]] by Canoncansodoff


** None of these match the requirements specifically, but they might interest:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5445767/1/Whatever-Happened-to-Bromance][Whatever Happened to Bromance]] by Vlad the Inhaler Harry/Romilda, comedy first chapter then it becomes smutty.

OP mentioned canoncansodoff, so I assume you've read "Testing Defences". What you might not know is that there's a significantly smuttier version on [[http://www.patronuscharm.net/s/66/1/][PatronusCharm]] with less fluff.

Your mileage may vary on this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4606270/1/Effects-and-Side-Effects][Effects and Side Effects]]. It's a "Harry turned into a girl" fic, probably the best example of such a fic. On the plus side, it has the slow progression mentioned in the OP. On the downside it's unbelievably angsty (in the really irritating "Harry is too noble to be attracted to girls" way), has loads of indy!Harry clich√©s, and also has loads of non-romance/smut content.

Finally, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10100723/1/Parkinson-s-Knickers-Or-Lack-Thereof][Parkinson's Knickers (Or Lack Thereof)]] is a well-paced smutty one-shot.

Smutty Harry / Tonks fic. I enjoyed it a lot, well, at least until the two latest chapters.
