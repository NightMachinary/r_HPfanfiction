In a previous post I talked abt a fic I'm planning. It's one of those "reincarnated into the world of Harry Potter" fanfics.

The oc is going to be the younger sister of tonks(the oc will be in the same year as the golden trio) and I need help with a name for the oc.

Edit: yes I know it says "hello with a name" I hate autocorrect


** I really like the name Adrastia which can be shortened to Tia. This is stolen from Brent Weeks' /Lightbringer/ series.

** why not have into astrological names and keep with the black family tradition, or go the opposite with the most normal muggle english name possible

** Nymphadora means 'given by nymphs.' So I could see a younger sister having either A) a plain Muggle name, as Ted gets to pick one, or B) a name following the same tradition, or C) a constellation name like the rest of the Blacks.

So you might have Sarah or Amelia, or you could have a ridiculous Greek mashup name, like Agatheleuke or Raisaphilana, or a constellation like Lyra or Sagitta.

Personally, I think the Muggle name would be more likely, since Tonks would have been old enough to express discontent with her name by the time your OC was born.

You might want to elaborate on her personality or role, since name-seers are a thing in canon.

** Quick look around for some unusual names I think our dear Andromeda might have chosen

Agrippina / Agrippa, Alienor / Nell / Nelda, Glynis, Roisin, Orla.

Star names, for the sake of it. Auriga, Gomeisa, Hadar, Agena, Lacerta.

** Continuing with their tradition of using Greek names with embarrassing modern implications, I suggest [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanippe][Melanippe]].
