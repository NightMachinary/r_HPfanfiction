Powerful, dark, *adult* Harry.

That's it. He could be working with Voldy or on his own. Just no slash please.

All recommendations are welcome.

Thanks!


** You've probably already read it, but linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts) is probably the best Dark Lord Harry Potter fic that I've read where he's an adult. Bonus points for the fact that Ron and Hermione are with him.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Harry could be considered in linkffn(The Rise of Wizards) It starts as an alt to HBP but the second half is him as an adult.
