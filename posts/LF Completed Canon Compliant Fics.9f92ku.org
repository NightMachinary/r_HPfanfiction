Any topic really, I finished The Aurors (so good), and Exile - with Draco in the muggle world (also super good), I was reading Aurors and Schoolgirls and loved it but its unfinished and seems abandoned. Now I'm just sad.

Anyone rec a good canon compliant completed fic? I'll read most any topic, just not super smut or AU.

** These are the stories that always come to mind, I feel a bit boring constantly recommending these, but hopefully you enjoy them as much as I did (I also second the other recommendations):

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12001201/1/Let-Perpetual-Light][Let Perpetual Light]]: Minor Dumbledore/Grindelwald. The story from Kendra's death to Ariana's death. Plays with canon a bit, but is still very much canon compliant-even works surprisingly well with Fantastic Beasts.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=247000][Latet Anguis in Herba]]: Slytherin (Original Characters) group of friends during the series. It's part of a series (Anguis), but this one is primarily to set up the characters-oneshot style, the later ones are full novels.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12330043/1/Tell-Brave-Deeds-of-War][Tell Brave Deeds of War]]: Terry Boot, Michael Corner and Anthony Goldstein during Deathly Hallows (at Hogwarts).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][Professor C. Binns: A Personal History]]: Professor Binns' backstory. It's unexpectedly amazing.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Minds Eye, Souls Reflection]]: Luna's perspective of Order of the Phoenix.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3867967/1/Asking-for-Roses][Asking for Roses]]: Neville in the summer before Deathly Hallows.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][Ignite]]: Sequel series to Anguis, but not necessary to read Anguis. Next-gen story with Scorpius, Albus and Rose.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662%22][Muggle Studies]]: Comedy series. During Harry's kids time, about a Muggle Studies teacher and his (hilarious) experience trying to teach wizards/witches Muggle Studies.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12096051/1/Put-Your-Guns-Away-it-s-Tea-Time][Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time]]: Scorpius/Albus, it's a very sweet and funny story (post-cursed child) that has excellent interactions between Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny. The slash is minor and it has sequels.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]]: Set long after the epilogue, a Harry, Ron and Hermione adventure when they're much older.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel][Scarlet Pimpernal]]: Percy during the Deathly Hallows.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4007457/1/The-Sleeper-Awakes][The Sleeper Awakes]]: Percy during the Deathly Hallows.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7562379/1/Australia][Australia]]: Ron/Hermione post-war. A bit angsty, but it's my favourite of this type.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection]]: Luna's perspective on Order of the Phoenix.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8103339/1/Seven-Simple-Years][Seven Simple Years]]: Ron/Hermione during the series. Author has written other works.

Oneshots:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9526039/1/Out-of-the-Fire-and-into-the-Cupboard][Out of the Fire and Into the Cupboard]]: Absolutely hilarious. Harry at Ron and Hermione's wedding-hiding in a cupboard. The author has a lot of great oneshots/stories (such as Seven Simple Years) series but this one is my favourite.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4008738/1/Red-Ink-Remains][Red Ink Remains]]: Author also wrote Cauterize (and many other great oneshots), but this one is my favourite-conveys so much in so little words.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]]: Considered one of the best stories. It's pretty amazing.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12998948/1/The-Curious-Case-of-the-Kitchen-Scissors][The Curious Case of the Kitchen Scissors]]: Harry's regrowing hair.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11746692][Five Facts You Won't Find in "Hogwarts, A History"]]: Five oneshots during the series-very funny and sweet

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5578897/1/Lest-We-Forget][Lest We Forget]]: George talking to his mother many years post-series.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/245007][Lost among Our Winnings]] : series of oneshots post-war.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11968875][to welcome you home]]: Very sweet. Harry, Ron and Hermione go back to Hogwarts. Author has other canon-compliant work and wrote Thirty Years On: The Man Behind the Mystery.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10770606][Thirty Years On: The Man Behind the Mystery]]: Absolutely hilarious-post war Harry, Hermione, Ron and Ginny.

** Also check out [[/r/harryandginny][r/harryandginny]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), is a very good Year 6 fic from Ginny's POV. This is the story that got me interested in HP fanfics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]], linkffn(11419408), is Year 7 from Ginny's POV, written by the same author of “The Aurors”.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers of Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126), is finally finished after 8 years of writing. It depicts Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009, and is my favorite canon-compliant postwar fic.

Dudley has a witch daughter and asks Harry for help in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11994595/1/Perfectly-Normal-Thank-You-Very-Much][Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much]], linkffn(11994595).

Finally, a little self-promotion: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][Interview with Director Potter]], linkffn(12925628), is an interview with Harry that takes place 20 years after the Battle of Hogwarts.

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood by cambangst) - focuses on Harry, Ron, and Hermione well after the epilogue.

linkao3(Glass of Water by lyin) - how Lily and Sirius become friends during their sixth year at Hogwarts. (Technically makes one very small change to the canon timeline, but it's so minor I wouldn't have noticed except that the author talked about it in the notes.)
