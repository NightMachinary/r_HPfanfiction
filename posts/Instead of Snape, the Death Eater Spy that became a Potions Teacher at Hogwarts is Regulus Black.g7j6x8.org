  What if Regulus Black, and not Severus Snape, ended up being the turncoat Potions Master of Hogwarts? A not!fic written in bullet points, ignoring the Deathly Hallows entirely because they annoy me. Beta by my immensely patient Best Beloved, Turn_of_the_Sonic_Screw, and by the delightful starbirdrampant.

** I imagine regulus would hate sirius even more then snape did Regulus had finally made the right choice and left the death eaters, only for his brother to betray his friends voldemort.

when sirius breaks out and they are in the shack, he decides to listen to sirius due to conflicting emotions.

he is overjoyed when he discovers his brother is innocent, and reminds remus to stay in the shack due to the full moon.

Sirius ends up getting his freedom, and getting custody of harry though harry does have to spend a few weeks at the dursley for the spell only now sirius is there in dog form.

the black family vaults reopen due to sirius return he buys an old house with a massive backyard so harry can fly. he also asks the weasleys if he could borrow ron, so harry has a friend while he adjusts to the new living sitution

In a crackfic I could see Sirius paying the Weasleys to "borrow" Ron and Molly and Arthur realize they should rent out their kids since they have so many...
