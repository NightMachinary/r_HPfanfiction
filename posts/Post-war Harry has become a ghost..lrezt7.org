Basically looking for any Post-war fics that have Harry kind of disappear and become a bit of a ghost to the wizarding world and even his friends, he is just traveling around learning, watching, showing up at the odd important thing. Maybe he has become a bit of a myth or something, I don't know, I don't really mind what the plot is just something that could vaguely reassemble this. Don't really mind what the pairing is either if there is one.


** There was a one shot where Harry becomes a guardian spirit for Hogwarts after his death, showing up sporadically as a teenager to those that needed help. Forgot the name

#+begin_quote
  A continuation of "Secret Loves" wherein Hermione admits to herself liking more than just the way Harry hugs. This is a Hermione-centric, Harry/Hermione/Polyamorous. It is not a harem story the way most people think of "harem" in fan fiction.
