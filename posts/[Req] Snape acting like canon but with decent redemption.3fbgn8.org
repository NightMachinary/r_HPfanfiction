In canon, Snape is a terrible educator, biased toward Slytherin to the point of ignoring minor assault, and mean to most children outside of Slytherin. He is redeemed by having had the hots for Lily Evans.

Do you know of any fic in which Snape starts off being as petty and cruel as he is in canon but goes through a more credible redemption?


** Oh man, yes, yes I have the perfect fic for you (sort of?). It's actually basically completely canon until the end. Fair warning, it's SSHP, but it's not at all the focus of the story. It's really one of the best portraits of Severus Snape that I've ever seen.

**** Right!!! I try to spread the word about it as much as possible. I think I just read it a month or two ago, but I might read it again.

** I highly recommend Harry Potter and the other Path: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9661560/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Other-Path]]

It was one of the first fanfics I ever read and despite its weaknesses it remains one of my favorite fics to this day.

Amongst many other things it features (eventually) redeemed Draco and Snape and a much more active Harry as well as very enjoyable magic duels and a believably strong (but not overpowered) Harry.

** Man, I just reread my favorite Snape story. It has a lot of angst in the beginning, but it does have a fantastic Snape redemption. linkffn(Stronger Than Hope by Alaunatar)
