If I were a witch I would experiment the hell with magic and make up the most bizarre shit and test things that would randomly come to mind and the question I've been thinking about for a while is:

If I were to light something on fire and wait until it was completely ash (like a piece of paper for example) and then I cast a reparo on it what do u think would happen? Would it repair or would it not be able to?

What do u think?


** I don't think it would work. /Reparo/ in my understanding is just a really good equivalent of put-together-all-pieces-and-glue-them. Changing from ashes to the original requires some kind of transfiguration/alchemy/something way more drastic.

*** I agree with this. Burning something changes its state which is covered by transfiguration. I presume you'd need to be fairly proficient to pull off an identical replica.

*** While I dont think a standard reparo would be enough, it should still be possible with charms considering you can use them to turn vinegar into wine.

** I think it's all fun and games until you get expelled from Durmstrang for doing this experiment on a human.

** This question is in a roundabout way hinted at in a canon when talking about how durable Horcruxes have to be, it's mentioned that basalik venem is only on the only things destructive enough to prevent the Horcrux from repairing itself.

A Horcrux can be repaired from being burned by normal fire or by the incedio spell or similar, but not from fiendfyre. The wizard or witch who made the Horcrux has to specifically make a Horcrux to be that durable however, which suggests to me that objects normally can't be repaired past a certain point. so I would say that no, reparo would not be enough, and likely nothing would once an object is reduced to ashes.

Even Harry's wand, which was basically just broken in half couldn't be repaired by reparo until Harry came to master the Elder wand at any rate.

** A thing I'd like to figure out is exactly what technology works at Hogwarts and what doesn't. A mechanical device should work just fine, right? What about pneumatics? Very simple electric circuits?
