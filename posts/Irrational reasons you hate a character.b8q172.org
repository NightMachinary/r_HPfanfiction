**** I think Ginny is worse because Cho had some development as a Quidditch player years before Harry ever went out with her, and a layer of emotional depth as the conflicted girlfriend of a dead guy.

Ginny's development, on the other hand, came through exposition of other people. Slughorn praising her fieriness and giving her an invitation to his club, Zabini praising her looks as "hot for a blood traitor", and Hermione telling Harry she's all grown up and has been in the dating game for years.

It feels like a cheap set-up for other people to say a character is totally awesome, compared to /showing/ it on-screen.

***** The reason Ginny's book 6 development really makes me mad is that there /could/ have been so much more JKR could've done with her.

Harry and Ginny could have built up a real connection through their shared trauma at the hands of Voldemort. Ginny was able to move past the guilt of what happened in her first year, she could've helped Harry move past his guilt at letting Voldemort implant visions in his head which lead to Sirius' death.

idk, I'm not opposed to the ship at all but how it was handled really is frustrating.

I also hate the "I have to break up with you....for your own good" trope, especially when he's saying this to a girl that fought Death Eaters with him in the Department of Mysteries at age 14.

***** Ginny's treatment makes me mad because it would have been so easy to introduce a real relationship between her and Harry. Just have Ginny confront Harry alone when he's angsting about potentially being possessed by Voldemort over the winter holidays and be moderately compassionate instead of telling him he's an idiot (well, probably a bit of that too). With them actually knowing each other there's a plausible reason for Harry to feel jealous of her and Dean during HBP, and she has more actual characterization, so a relationship would feel much more natural.

**** Rowling's treatment of her race is definitely problematic but I think this is a bit unfair. Cho and Chang are both Mandarin (sur)names, often romanized Zhou and Zhang, so my guess is that Rowling looked up a list of common Mandarin names and combined two which fit her obsession with alliteration. Absolutely disrespectful to Chinese culture, but not as aggressively racist as some people seem to think.

***** In a previous incarnation of Pottermore, she listed the Fiji Quidditch team players. So to give context, Fiji has two main ethnic groups, Indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians (Indian diaspora from Colonial times). Their names are quite distinct and easy to differentiate, you will easily pick out what name belongs to what ethnicity. Also, while many Indo-Fijian surnames are common eg Kumar or Singh, most Indigenous surnames are quite unique to one family or village. She named the captain of the team by using an Indo-Fijian first name with an Indigenous Fijian surname shared by a previous Prime Minister. Maybe 10 people in the whole country use that surname, it's that rare. This was cringeworthy. It didn't make me think Rowling was an evil racist, but it did make me think I didn't want to visit Pottermore again.

Surely she can pay someone whose expertise it is to come up with names? Or at least review the names/places she's making up and giving her feedback?

Most people think Hagrid is so lovable, but I never got emotionally attached to him. He brought Norbert, Aragog, Mosag, Buckbeak, the Skrewts, and Grawp to Hogwarts and faced minimal to no consequences for it. The only real one was his expulsion back in 1942.

Riddle chose the perfect scapegoat.

Yet I always liked Hagrid, mainly for what he represents. Thanks to him we know that half giant can use a wand, with reasonable skill (Hagrid is not so bad for a guy expelled in 3rd year with a broken wand, and Mrs Maxime did manage to become Headmistress of her school). Yet, these half giant still keep an amazing strengh and have some kind of magic resistance (like Hagrid resisting arrest in book 5). Hell we can even see that they can be free of the Giant violent instinct (Hagrid is a gentle soul deep down, even if he can't understand that cute things for him can be mortal for normal wizards.\\

**** Such a breeding would require the cooperation of either witches, for the use of their uteri, or wizards, for a sperm donation. I doubt any witches could be persuaded to participate, and few wizards would be willing to let their genetic material be mixed with giants. The prospective breeders, if they found even one wizard willing to donate, would then have to secure multiple female giants and keep tabs on them, for nine months, or however long the gestation period would last, and then take the babies from the mothers for training. The logistics are a nightmare.

** I hate Remus Lupin. He's a deadbeat dad who attempted to abandon his child, he abandoned Harry for his entire childhood and apart from Patronus lessons never had much to do with Harry for the school year and the years afterward.

Yeah, he reminds me so much of my uncle who abandoned his kids and made them hate him so badly they changed their last name...

*** Lupin is my least favourite character in the entire series. He is a person who is constantly running from responsibility while feeling sorry for himself. It bothers me how he's always this "honorary uncle/godfather" for Harry in fics while he didn't much care for him in canon.

** Ron was too much of an asshole too many times. Plus even though I'm really sarcastic myself I hate hearing him commenting on things or when he stupidly states the obvious.

** Specifically in fanfiction, I dislike Hermione, Ginny, and Luna. Probably mostly because I think they're overused, and after seeing them in the character lists 500 bajillion times I started to hate them, even though I like them well enough in canon.

** What inhuman monster could hate Young Frankenstein?

​

I've never been fond of Ron. I just wouldn't put up with him as a friend, and get annoyed at the other characters for doing so.

** Marauder-era James and Severus dynamics reminds me too much of my own time in highschool, making me have an irrationally strong dislike for James, and an irrationally strong /like/ for Marauder-era Severus (I was basically him during this time). Objectively, I like to think that James grew up, especially during 7th year to become a good person, and that Sirius was genuinely the worse person between the two, but I am irrationally annoyed that he seemed to get everything basically handed to him without deserving it and act the way he did. Thankfully, there wasn't an equivalent to Lily in higschool to complete the dynamics -- I'd rather not think too much over the possibility of irrational attraction -- or worse, /jealousy/ -- of fictional characters...

*** If you were the the severus does that mean you were the weirdo that insulted a popular kid, started a weird rivalry with him, came off worse and then moaned about it for nearly 20 years.

**** The significant things I share with him is being the awkward, socially inept, kid who was also bullied but had a much better interest in actually learning things at the time than others, and victim of bullying. I /did/ start things off by unintentionally insulting the wrong guy, although rather by doing something weird, rather than just letting off some acidic remark.

There are obvious similarities that I can identify with, but also major differences. He has major issues moving on from his past with Marauders (and Lily), I didn't have this problem. Nor did I become a bully myself, but I can see myself falling for the same kind of pressure he did in theory -- thankfully, there were no Averys/etc in my case to lead me on that path. I did mention that my bias towards SS is strictly Marauder-era -- I can't identify with how he eventually turned out after school (DE and later on, asshole teacher) nearly as much, if at all.
