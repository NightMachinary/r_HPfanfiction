Like the title says any stories where Harry is a Peverell and maybe the Master of Death.

Thank you


** I mean technically canon Harry is both a Peverell and a Potter, even if his last name doesn't reflect that.

** Well I Think that /Out of the Night/ by Raining Ink should respond to the criteria : Harry Potter and Hepheastus Peverell are the same person and Harry becomes more Peverell by being a Dark Wizard in the wizard Culture developed by the author. Sadly Discontinued, this fanfiction that was developed on Dark Lord Potter can be found on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] by RemeberFics. linkffn(12723942)

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)
