** There's this very interesting theory that he never actually figured out /what/ the Room of Requirements was. He was just wandering through Hogwarts looking for "a secret lair for the Heir of Slytherin" or something like that, and the Room materialized as that; and he thought that it only appeared for him due to who he was, never even suspecting it could turn into /anything/ else than a cool evil lair. Years later when hiding the Diadem, he thought he was bringing it to another place of significance to him --- the Secret Slytherin Lair, see.
