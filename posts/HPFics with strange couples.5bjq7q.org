I'm the kind of girl that really like strange couples in mostly every fandom I'm in. In Harry Potter I specifically love Dramione fics, BUT close to an year ago I thought about a couple that never left my mind since (actually started to write about it, never finished though) and that is Narcissa and Sirius.

I KNOW, TERRIBLE.

But if anyone has this weird taste and a couple of fics to recommend, it would make me very happy!!

Luv u <3

(Sorry if my English is bad, not native speaker :( )

EDIT: Ok, I didn't expected this many recommendations! HAHAH As soon as I finish my finals, I'll start reading them all! Thank you very, very much <3 U guys are really sweet!


** We're a fandom with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3096379/1/First-Encounter][Hogwarts/Giant Squid]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Drapple/100478/][Draco/Apple]] fics. Honestly, Sirius/Narcissa barely warrants a raised eyebrow in terms of "strange". The incest is ick, but given that there are plenty of fics with sibling and parent/child incest, first cousins becomes a little less weird (especially within the Black family, which is canonically incestuous).

But for an actual rec of a rarepair, my favourite is still Theo Nott/Piers Polkiss in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1213036][The Housewarming Party]].

*** I just noticed that I misunderstood everything you just said and deleted my previous comment that didn't make any sense. Lol

First of all, thank you very much for the recommendation! :D I'm reading it as soon as my finals are over.

And about the couple, it's curious to see someone saying that, because every time I told a friend about it they were like "ARGH, STOPPED IT NOW". I'm very relieved to hear that's not that absurd hahahahahah

Thanks!

  After the events of Order of the Phoenix, Harry reluctantly returns to Privet Drive and the Dursleys. How will he deal with the loss of Sirius and his guilt over it? Will he learn how to fend off the mental attacks of Lord Voldemort? And what's up with Cho?

Post OttP and abandonded, unfortunately. But a very interesting fic, that's stayed with me throughout the years.

  When the world turns against him, leaving only one by his side, Harry finds out that life, love and truth are more complicated than they seem. Danger, suspense, heartbreak and treachery abound.

This is a post-GoF, Harry/Cho, Harry goes to Azkaban story. Unlike most shitty Azkaban fics, in this story things happen for a reason.

Well plotted, well paced, brilliant action scenes. The dialogue is maybe a bit weak at places but it's a pretty minor flaw. The fic does away with the worst of Azkaban cliches (excessive angst, forgiveness wanking) and presents one my favorite interpretations of Harry in the fandom; he slowly becomes dangerous, subtle, pro-active and /lethal/. Best of all, the story is completed and there's a finished sequel too.

I understand that people love Hermione and that she's a bigger character, but Luna does have a large following! Maybe try one of those eight fics? An strange couple indeed!

** Speaking of strange couples, I usually don't read femslash but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7200246/1/Impossible]]) is probably the weirdest couple I have ever read and the Fic actually kinda managed to pull it off. As opposed to most Dramione fics I've seen the author actually made Hermione stronger instead of weaker to make the pairing work. IMHO she's quite consistent with canon-Hermione in the way she stoically deals with her situation.

  Hermione/Bellatrix - Time Heals All Wounds
#+end_quote

That story is kinda lame. I've always hated reset button time-travel stories. Why go through all the character development just to wipe it all away later. I understand tragedy, but this goes way to far into fatalism ("Why even try to do anything?"). "Debt of Time" (which also seems very popular) has the same problem, but at least that story is upfront about the fact that the time travel is just sightseeing (also it's Hermione-centric and she takes her character development with her, Bellatrix in Time Heals All Wounds just gets a reset button).

Time Heals All Wounds totally fails as a tragedy though, because Bellatrix is already mentally unstable and is screwed by fate (removing her only support at a crucial time). Her "downfall" isn't happening because of bad personal choices like in a proper tragedy.

  There is a very fine line between obsession and love. Harry Potter is the greatest wizard of his age and a troubled poster boy, and Draco's son is beautiful and gifted. Their relationship is intense from its beginning, and everything else in their lives is collateral damage. They say every hero someday meets his match. Harry has definitely met his.
