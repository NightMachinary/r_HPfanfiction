Given wizarding judiciary, it is quite plausible for Lucius Malfoy to convince Cornelius Fudge and Dolores Umbridge to send Ginny to Azkaban for opening the Chamber.


** To escape prison, some adult Death Eaters said they were under Imperius curse and were not sentenced. Here we are talking about an eleven-year-old girl who claims to have been possessed by an obscure book (of which there is also evidence of existence). The best political and social suicide of both.

*** Well, they have no qualms about sending innocent men to Azkaban sans trial and the Ministry will be under pressure to act.

**** Sirius' case was completely different, they stopped at the evidence to suspect (the finger, the corpses). And Sirius was an adult wizard. Then they would have to send Harry to Azkaban for inflating his aunt, accidental magic has the same degree of control that Ginny had while she was owned by Tom. In fact, maybe Ginny had even less control.
