I need some help here. I am trying to think through canon, and I can only really remember characters commenting on Ron's chess skill in the first book when he beats Harry, Hermione, and the giant animated chess set. Is it ever mentioned again in later books? A lot of fanfics portray Ron as a chess prodigy, but he might just be average with more practice than Harry and Hermione (both of whom had effectively no friends growing up and likely had minimal opportunities to play).


** He did beat all other classmates in Gryffindor in his year. And McGonagall chess... So he is anything between 1800 score at chess.com to chess prodigy

*** Do you remember which book mentions him beating his other classmates? I'm not comfortable asserting that Ron is all that much better than any other average teenager who enjoys the game. Hogwarts doesn't seem to have a chess club, so it's not like there are any organized opportunities for people to play. It's possible that Ron was a few years ahead of his peers skill-wise.

We do not know the skill level of McGonagall's chess set in the books. We never hear of her playing the game, and we don't know whether the animated chess pieces would even inherit her skill. It's not like the animated armor in book 7 inherit her skill in melee combat. It's possible that animated chessmen always have a standard skill level.

**** I don't remember a quote but I think Ron beats Seamus and Dean at least.

About McGonagall we can be considerably sure McGonagall was good at chess or at the very least her chess set was. Otherwise why would she put it as an obstacle if it were easy to beat? I can beat all my peers at chess but still I wouldn't put my skill as good enough to beat a random stranger.

** The movies had him playing at an international master level. Of course, they were the movies, but it's a nice rough guide towards Ron's skill with chess.

*** I agree that an international master helped design the game that got cut from the final release, but all we saw was tiny snippets that don't really show his level. For all we know, the giant chess board was just supposed to be a stalling tactic. We have no evidence that McGonagall is all that good at chess either or if her animated statues inherit her skills.

**** Does the movies have enough to give a complete image of the setup for the final few moves? It could give a rough idea of strength, since I figured Ron's final few moves was essentially a !! (brilliant) combination.

** Eh, I'd peg him around an 800 or so tops. Can't imagine he has formal training with the Weasleys' resources, and can't imagine organized chess is big at all in the Wizarding World.

There are quite a few 11-year-olds playing at 2000 or above level these days, but this is largely an aspect of computer technology and beginning formal training at a really young age. To reach that level without the contributions of computers or chess books (consider how isolated the Wizarding World is from the Muggle world), or, for that matter, a good teacher, is pretty much impossible.

So he's probably worked out a couple basic tactics and the basics of a good opening. That's definitely enough to win all your games against someone who just knows the rules.

** People think he's good at chess because McGonagall was so confident in HER skills that she thought they were good enough to protect a Philosopher's Stone, and Ron beat her.
