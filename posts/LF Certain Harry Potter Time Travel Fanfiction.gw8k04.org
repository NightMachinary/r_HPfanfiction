From what I remember, there is a Black family heirloom? that sends people back in time. It's kind of a known thing. Harry gets sent back because he's technically a Black being Lord Black. That's really all I remember. Also, it's not Delenda Est.


** Well that last sentence threw a wrench in things. As soon as I first started reading your request I immediately thought of Delenda Est.

I haven't read any other story that had a black family heirloom involved with a full time travel plotline. I've seen the locket, a pensieve, a cursed tiara, and a rune covered triangle.

Now the last one (rune covered triangle) takes both people back in time. The story is a series of PWP oneshots called Black Family Magic by DarkLordRising on hpfanficarchive

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
