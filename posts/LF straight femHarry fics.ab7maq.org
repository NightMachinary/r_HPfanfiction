Basically the title. I don't particularly care about the pairing but Draco or Riddle would be preferable. Again, no slash please. Thanks in advance!


** Linkffn(The Long Journey Home): a very well-written fem!Harry story, if a bit meandering. She is straight, though its not Draco or Riddle and it is a time-travel story.

Linkffn(Victoria Potter): probably one of the most believably canon-like fem!Harry's and Slythern!Harry stories. Just starting 2nd year, but whats there is beautiful. Not relationship stuff yet.

Linkffn(The Never-Ending Road): fem!Harry raised by Snape, if I remember correctly. The sequel is officially abandoned.

Linkffn(0-800-Rent-A-Hero): technically this is a dimension-travel story with male Harry, but that dimension has a female Harry as his counterpart for a good part of the story.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

** A new fic that is currently on hiatus due to computer problems. There is no pairings yet but it does a very good job (and a unique method) of justifying why Voldie would give up on killing fem!Harry. Currently 107k and I'm really hopeful that we'll see new chapters in the coming year.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15966983][Harriet Potter and the Meddling of The Fates]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ItCouldAllBeForNothingTommorow/pseuds/ItCouldAllBeForNothingTommorow][ItCouldAllBeForNothingTommorow]]

"The fates could have worked with Harry Potter, son of James Potter but when the chance came to steer Loki into Lilly's path so they might conceive a child together? That was an opportunity to tempting to let pass.

Harriet spends the first 11 years of her life with no idea of the magical world or her mother's status as a witch. She would spend many years more ignorant of the heritage running in her veins but that blood will turn her greatest enemy into her most loyal ally. It is not until Loki comes to earth to fulfill his “glorious purpose” that the truth of her heritage will become known to her. Daughter will meet father and the destinies of the Avengers, Asgard, and beyond will be drastically changed. This is the future the fates desire. They aren't beyond meddling to get what they want.

tl;dr Female!Harry is Loki's daughter and a goddess but doesn't know it. In using her blood to return Voldemort is magically forced through a change that leaves him an ally rather than an enemy. When the events of Avengers happens Harry gets involved and her heritage doesn't stay secret for long."

Edit: It got updated just now! Sooooo excited! Length is now 128k words!

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.
