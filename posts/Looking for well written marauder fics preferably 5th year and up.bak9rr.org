** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12540852][They're Hiding Inside Me]] linkao3(12540852) - Remus/Sirius but James and Peter are there too, note the content warnings

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14447502][The Mapmakers]] linkao3(14447502) - eventual James/Lily, WIP, canon compliant

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9106972][Glass of Water]] linkao3(9106972) - calling this a marauders' fic is maybe pushing it, as the POV character is Lily, but Sirius plays a prominent role and James, Remus, and Peter also appear

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  It's 1975, and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Lily Evans, James Potter, and Severus Snape are about to be tested in ways they cannot imagine. A canon-compliant account of the First Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it. (Fifth year COMPLETE.)

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

I love that story! It really shows all the characters as real people with flaws and strengths!

  [Marauders Era Year Five] It's 1975 and Hogwarts students are trying to focus on their schooling, but with fellow students practicing dark magic and friendships being tested, it's hard to ignore that their parents' war will soon be theirs. And yet, they still try, forcing light in the darkness and daring to laugh when others want to cry. After all, they aren't dead yet.
