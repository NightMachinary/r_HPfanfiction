:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic a while back where harry becomes some sort of higher being(probably death) after uniting the hallows. He is not happy about it. There is a scene where the fate sister try to trick him into remain as this Saviour or sort with a new prophecy. Harry is pissed off and threatens one of the fate sisters. The other convinces him not to and they finally let him go. It was a one shot I think

So anyone know what I'm talking about?


** Sounds familiar though i think the one I'm thinking of was a time travel fic.
