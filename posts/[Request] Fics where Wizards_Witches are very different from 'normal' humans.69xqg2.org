Request inspired by astolat's House Proud, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703]] I really enjoyed the 'otherworldly' nature of the authors description of wizards/witches who had embraced the 'old ways'.

Something where magic really is magical and ethereal, rituals, unique cultural holidays, societal expectations, like something completely otherworldly and alien ; almost a religious experience or culture. Some of the ritual magic/ideas explored in Mizuni-sama's Prince of the Dark Kingdom [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]] struck me as very interesting and compelling, as well as some of the descriptions/concepts in Darth Marss' Firebird's Son trilogy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]] .

I feel like House Proud could be a snippet of a hypothetical longer fic exploring these concepts are explored, I find the idea of magic itself almost being a sentient force very compelling. No true preference around the content of the fics I'm looking for outside of a focus on those things outlined above, go ahead and recommend pretty much anything. Don't really have a problem with any pairing/slash/whatever but not really looking for anything where romance is a focus/major plot point or anything that spends a lot of time around angsty romantic plotlines in general.

Hopefully there are some more gems out there, thanks in advance.


** Actually, I wouldn't mind seeing a fic where magic induces physiological changes to wizards and witches over time. I've rarely (or ever even in my memory) come across a fic where exposure to certain types of magic can influence the very body of the wizard or witch exposed to them in a permanent fashion.

For example, what if Voldemort's appearance were literally due to Dark Magic exposure? Not due to rituals or botched potions or anything like that, but due to the fact that he was exposed to Dark Magic to such a degree that his body was physically changed by it.

Or if Hogwarts is considered to be safe because it's one of the few places in the UK where you can safely learn magic without undergoing involuntary mutation as a result?

Or if exposure to time magic changes your brain structure to be able to understand the physics behind time (time travel, time locking, atemporal anomalies etc) on an instinctual level? Or if animagus magic directly influences your thought patterns to better conform to those of your animagus shape?

If done right, seeing that would be amazing.

** This is something I've been looking for as well! I can't think of any that are an exact match for what you're looking for, but here's some that might have at least a couple of the concepts you want.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) -- has a bit of political shenanigans as well as a bit of pureblood culture

linkffn(Princess of the Blacks) -- expands more on the idea of black, dark, light, and white magic

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I remember a story where magical people literally glowed with their power and had to wear glamours anytime they went into the muggle world. Also, when somebody was powerful, they attracted other magicals due to their power. Women built wands a certain way so that they could control men and leach off of their power because men were way more powerful then women. Them men would have to take wives until they physically couldn't take anymore. If anyone could remember what that was, it fits the criteria pretty well.

#+end_quote

I'm looking for the exact opposite. I really don't like the idea that magic is like the Force in Star Wars. Maybe I'm too influenced by old fantasy novels, but the whole "magic is sentient" just feels so derivative of Star Wars.

I get it, it makes sense and explains a lot of magical effects very well, but for me it's more impactful if Magic is an internal force that doesn't rely on accessing some 'outside' power, but something that comes from within.

It's been a while since I've read Firebird's Son... but isn't that kinda how it works in that Fic?
