By epic crossover I mean a crossover with multiple fandoms. Child of the Storm has Avengers, X-Men, Dr. Strange, Dresden Files, Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Green Lantern, Constantine...the list goes on.

Anything else like that?

linkffn(Child of the Storm)


** How much do you need to know about the various fandoms to understand the fic? I'm not usually a fan of superhero stories but i know the basics. And more importantly, how much Dresden Files content is there? I just finished re-reading 'Awaken Sleeper' and in the mood for more.

*** They do a very good job of explaining what you need to know. You'll most likely have no issue with understanding what's going on. They don't delve into many obscure characters. Maybe one or two but they're either eventually well fleshed out or very minor in the plot.

There's not a lot of Dresden in it. He's mostly a "second string" character because there are just so many other characters in this. Watching him have a snark off with Tony Stark was enjoyable.

*** Have you read linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and sequels? It's honestly one of the best HP fanfics, and it's mostly HP characters with some Dresden concepts that are explained very well.

**** I read the first one and the second to about 50% and then I got bored. I liked it in the beginning but there is just so much of 'massive asshole Harry' i can take.

It had some great scenes but I just think it's a shame that there was absolutely no character development. The author had this whole thing set up with Amanda having a crush on Harry and Harry trying to corrupt her but it just never went anywhere. Harry didn't change at all and i felt it was just the same thing over and over.

***** I agree. I read the series to the end but it felt WAY too much like Harry was some ultra hardcore edgy goth kid. And that was when I was in high school and eating those kinds of stories up.

He never grew at all as a character and the story is basically edgy badass teenager runs circles around everyone with hiccups here and there.

I liked the Fallen Angel in the coin though, she was cool.

** linkffn(6995114) is a crossover with Naruto and Fate/Stay Night. It gets pretty good later on but is a bit of a mess. There's also a rewrite, but it appears to be abandoned.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
