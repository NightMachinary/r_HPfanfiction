Seeing as weird some stories can be, how ridiculous their plot can be, I was wondering.

Is there a story, where Sirius travels forward in time before his death, romances adult Harry, gets impregnated, travels back in time, and gives birth to Harry, turning from a godfather into a father to him?


** Wait, hold on. I'll ignore mpreg for a moment, because Magic. But.

How would Sirius give birth to Harry? That... that doesn't even make sense. It's not even... Lily... or James... and himself and I just...

But how would he even

Where would the genes...

Wait

wait wait wait

So who would the Godfather be?

*** I don't know. Never read one, and I'm not about to check out.

As for Godfather, why Sirius of course. There would be two of them now. The one who gave birth to Harry would Pollyjuice himself into an owl. The white one.

***** Gah! It wasn't me, it was Sirius... siriously!

BTW. Never liked how they characterized her in that scene. Was it so hard to give her face some depth, a muzzle? She looked like a cat that faceplanted into a window at full tilt.

** I can only hope not. But with HP fanfiction I wouldn't be at all surprised.

** Watch the movie Predestination, if you haven't yet. Sounds like it might be your thing, I know I enjoyed it immensely.
