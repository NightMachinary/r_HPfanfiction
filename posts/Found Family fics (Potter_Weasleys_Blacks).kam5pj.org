I love the family dynamic between the Weasleys and Harry in the books and that he became a part of their family. I am a sucker for found family fics, but most of the fics I found on Ao3 were either Snarry, involved bad Oc's, or had Dumbledore bashing (which at least is partially understandable or even worst Weasley bashing. Here are some idea of what fics I am looking for:

1) Weasley centered fic where Harry becomes a part of the Weasley Clan. Just show the bond that has developed between Harry and Ron and his relationship with the rest of t he Weasley Family.

2) Sirius adopting Harry (please no gray Harry, DLP fics, Dumbledore bashing)

3) Sirius being adopted by the Potters after running away

Sorry for dumping so many requests into one post.


** - Stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] ... start with “Tales of the Battle” and go on (you can return to the earlier ones later, but he is by far the best in post-war stories). Northumbrian has Harry/Ginny-Weasleys dynamics very well written.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

  Sirius punches a wall, runs away from home, drinks way too much Firewhisky with James, and realizes he still has a home after all.

  “Prongs,” he said, his voice choked with emotion.James nodded. “I know.”Sirius tried to express how much the letter meant to him, how much it all meant to him, but all he could manage was, “Fuck.”“I know,” James repeated, hoisting himself off the ground so he could clap Sirius on the back bracingly. “I told you not to read it now, mate.” He grinned and offered Sirius the bottle of firewhisky, and somehow that simple gesture conveyed the sort of comfort and understanding that could only come from James.
