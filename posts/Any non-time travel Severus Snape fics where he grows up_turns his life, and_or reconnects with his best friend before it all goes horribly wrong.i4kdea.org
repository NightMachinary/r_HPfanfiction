I'm not looking for romance, specifically. Friendship or Romance for Snape and Lily is fine.

Mostly I'm just looking for non-TT because the TT fics tend to ignore the absolutely awful person Snape turned out to be.

So yeah, any fics where he breaks out of it BEFORE joining Voldermot/before Lily and James die?

** linkao3(If Someone Cared Enough by Aishling)

This fic becomes canon divergent from SWM and everybody's bs is called out here so it's very satisfying to read this lmao and there is no time travel in this. There are a few OCs and they are all well-developed and super cool I really loved the OCs

linkao3(A Dream Carved in Stone by diadelphous)

This one also has no time travel, and Snape does turn his life around but he does still join the DEs before the change occurs but the writing is solid in this fic and I enjoyed it very much, you can give it a try

  What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens?

** Sorry, can't help with the specific request, although my favourite time travel one is quite aware of Severus' faults (and he himself is very aware of them, too). The thing about time travel fics is, he has long experience in sublimating his self-loathing into a conviction that his life is owed in service.

That said, canon does make plain that he has good qualities. He had the strength of character to protect Lily's legacy for so many years despite having nothing personally to gain from it; Lily was forever out of his reach and he didn't even like Harry. He's clearly intelligent, organised, and careful. The Peace Not Promised has Lily choosing to date him while all her friends are asking each other, and asking her, what she sees in him. And she herself realises that being in a relationship with him is challenging; at one point, when he's being spectacularly socially awkward, she tells him that he can be adorable sometimes, "not in the puppies and kittens kind of way, of course. More like if a Boggart decided to give up its day job and try its hand at being human." But she sees potential in him, and she knows he's loyal and devoted to her, and her presence softens him.

*** Of course he has good qualities but he was still a cruel, vindictive person who got off on being mean to teenagers.

Snape is one of my favorite characters, but it's BECAUSE he's complex that I like him. He hates bullying but is a bully. He loves Lily but mistreats her son. He works for the good guys while not being a good person. He was at some point a racist, despite his own half-blood status and his love being muggle-born. It's great. It makes him interesting.

A lot of the time travel fics turn the Marauders into caricatures and handwave Snape using mudblood as "he was angry and trying to hurt her." People generally don't throw out racial slurs when they're angry, unless a part of them believes it. And a part of Snape did, because of his father and being in Slytherin and his fascination with Voldemort. I've read maybe three fanfics where Lily calls him out on this. Every fanfic should do so.

I want to read about complex, struggling Snape, not fanfic!Snape who continues to be a jerk but it all stays very superficial while everyone around him is somehow 10x worse than before.

I have been reading The Peace Not Promised, but thanks for recommending it anyway!

#+end_quote

How does awkwardness even register as a flaw or difficulty in their relationship when he canonically was hoping to join a fascistic, genocidal terrorist organisation that specifically targeted muggleborns (like Lily) and muggles (like all of her family and basically every person (apart from Snape) she ever knew for the first eleven years of her life)?

And, like, yeah, he does protect Harry in the sense that he keeps him from dying, but he also goes out of his way to make him miserable, bullies and outright abuses him, and refuses to acknowledge Harry as his own person rather than an echo of his dead parents, in whose deaths Snape played a major role.

Like, I'm not looking to start a Great Snape Debate, here, but I strongly feel that any fic in which Snape and Lily interact after he's spent years horribly mistreating the son for whom she gave her life needs to acknowledge how utterly contemptible and inexcusable that is.

  "So all that. Everything that I saw. It happened? To you?" Disbelief still did not touch her eyes.

  "All of it," he confirmed, feeling the slow heavy thudding of his heart, "because of me."

  Tears. He felt it then, sliding down his sallow cheek, sliding slowly down his angular chin and falling away. He made no motion to stem this shameful display of emotions; he could not stop himself even if he tried.

  "My fault. I'm sorry," he gasped, his voice catching. "I killed you Lily."

  He could not stop himself as the words poured from his mouth. Confessions of the sort of man he truly was.

  "You died because I sold your son to the Dark Lord. Because I overheard a prophecy. I hadn't known who it spoke of, but had it affected anyone but you I would not have done a single thing to stop it. I would not have cared."

  He was babbling, he knew. His words were not reassuring, he knew. She could not derive any comfort from them, he knew.

  "I was a Death Eater! I killed so many. Committed many terrible acts on behalf of the Dark Lord."

  The worst of himself poured freely from his mouth. He could not stop himself. Why couldn't he stop himself?

  "When I knew it was you, when I realised what I had done, I had asked the Dark Lord to spare you. I did not care if he took Potter, or your son. I did not care one whit!"

  He felt disgust at his own words. The truth about himself he hid from the world, that he himself was unwilling to face, laid bare for the only person in his life that ever mattered.

  He could not even meet her eyes.

  "I was evil. I was truly evil."
