I've just recently found two of his harry potter fanfics. Wand and Shield and The Wizard from Earth.

Are these both abandoned? I see some recent updates on his other fics but I cant stress how much I loved both of these fics. Does anyone have any recommendations for anything of similar quality?

I just really start checking last updated dates before reading fics


** I mean, the only Wizard from Earth similarity fic I have is Long Journey Home and it is a classic.

I haven't read Wand and Shield, so I can't give you anything on that note. You could also just message the author directly on FFnet and ask - if you keep it non-"UPDATE IMMEDIATELY, SUCKA", then I'm sure they'll be willing to answer one way or another.

*** I haven't read this yet but I'll definitely give it a read through. I'm always looking for new fics to read through. Especially with all the free time I find myself with recently.

**** Have fun. It is truly excellent - really captures the age-gap feeling The Man from Earth movie gives, IMO.

**** Rakeesh is notorius for reeeeaaaallllllyyyyy slow updates (years inbetween chapters, to be exact) so expect to be blue-balled a lot. One of the best fanfic writers though in any fandom he/she writes in.
