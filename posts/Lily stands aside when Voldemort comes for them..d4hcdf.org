I just thought that this could be taken in so many directions:

Harry could survive, hating his mother who left him to die;

Harry could survive, with Lily raising him into a intelligent but normal child;

Harry could survive, with Lily AND Snape raising him into a cunning Slytherin;

Harry could die, only for Voldemort to keep him alive as 'neither can live while the other survives' death is a part of life so he can't die until Voldemort does and therefore haunts his ass becoming Haunting Harry/Poltergeist Potter;

Harry could die, only for Lily to do an Elric from FMA and bind his soul to something to keep him alive;

Harry could die, only to meet death and this could be the start to Harry being born in an AU (maybe crossover universe)

And I'm sure there are plenty of other things people can do with it.

Any other ideas or has anyone got good thoughts on the ones written?


** 'Step aside, girl!' Lily quickly weighed her options. If she stayed in front of Harry, Voldemort would kill her and then her son would be left helpless and alone. Nodding tearfully, she dropped her wand and reluctantly backed up a few steps towards the door Voldemort turned his back on her and redirected his attention to the baby in front of him. As he lifted his wand to speak the killing curse, he felt a solid blow hit him directly in the testicles from behind. As he doubled over, cross-eyed with pain, his last view was Lily, standing over him like an avenging goddess, as she snapped out her foot for a second time and broke his neck with a solid kick to the head.

**** Not really.

It's a trap, fanon staple of Runelord / Blood Mage Lily has set something up as usual, only this one managed to think of something that wasn't based on her dying to fuel it. Voldy isn't that hard to trap anyway, he rarely casts anything besides avada and crucio.

People forget that the nasty thing about wizards isn't what they can do in a duel when staring you in the face from a range where throwing knives would be almost as deadly. It's what happens when they're given the chance to prepare for you in advance. Particularly in a space they control.

Big deal, your favorite spell pierces a protego. There's no way you'd want to rely on that anyway when you have time to plan and can predict where someone will stand, how they will aim, and what they will cast.

You don't even need Runelord / Blood Mage Lily. Creative Applications of Charms Lily is fine. Problem is that she'd save James and Harry, vanquish Voldemort, then Dumbles would spend the next 10 years not telling anyone that he thinks Tom may have left a number of horcruxes laying about.

**** Lily and James married right out of Hogwarts and joined a vigilante army to fight off the bad guy. They would have been high on confidence without any scars from previous experience. The combination of young love and the fact that they were fighting for the 'greater good' would have undoubtedly given them a big enough rush of blood to stare down Voldemort.

Another point I'm not sure of, simply because I don't know if it's canon or fanon, is the fact that James and Lily fought of Voldemort 3 times.

For example, she could step aside to lure Voldemort into a false sense of security only to throw him off with something -- unlikely to work, but as said, tense moment.

** There's several LESS fics with this premise (in fact it's the 2nd most popular LESS premise after Peggy Sue, if you include things such as Lily being stunned, her successfully fleeing and whatnot, but that's outside the scope of the prompt), the most popular one here being linkffn(Puzzle), probably because it doesn't blatantly excuse SS' involvement in the entire ordeal (most of them bring it up at some point, but have a habit of brushing it over much too easily for my comfort).

** Maybe a Harry that survives, but doesn´t know why his mother can't stand the sight of him because of the guilt she carries to having stepped aside (something she carries as a shameful secret) instead of protecting him, and James trying to heal his family but finally seeing it as something cultural from her muggle side and complicating stuff

  Harry could survive, with Lily raising him into a intelligent but normal child;

  Harry could survive, with Lily AND Snape raising him into a cunning Slytherin
#+end_quote

Good god I can't roll my eyes harder. Those two have been done to death in all the cringiest of ways.

Howbout this:

Lily steps aside for some reason. Maybe she's pregnant again, maybe it's just a decision made in the moment. Either way, she's filled with regret. Harry dies, Voldemort lives and then he moves on to the Longbottoms. Cut to a decade later and go from there.

** ITT people ruining a completely good plot bunny with character apologism.

Lily stepping aside for selfing reasons is interesting. Lily doing the same because she had some clever plan prepared or whatever is a reiteration of what's already been done in some maner 1000 and 1 times.

** Harry dies. Voldemort wins. But there will be a new generation who rebel. Maybe there will be a new prophecy maybe the child already had born in the seventh month years ago. As we know the prophecies are easy to misinterpret.

** Deathly Hallowed immediately came to mind and I see it's not linked yet. I stumbled upon it years ago while looking for works with personification of Death and I remember enjoying it.

Don't remember specifics, but Lily steps aside after ensuring Harry's survival, both survive yet Harry ends up being raised by Petunia. linkffn(9172846)

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.
