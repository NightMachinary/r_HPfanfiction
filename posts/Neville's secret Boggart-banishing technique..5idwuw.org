"Finish it off, Neville!" Professor Lupin cried.

Neville strode forward, eyes glinting with mischief.

With a ~pop!~, the Boggart transformed back into Professor Snape, who raised his wand threateningly.

"/Riddikulus/" Neville intoned with confidence. There was a flash of light.

Nothing happened, save for the Boggart-Snape looking befuddled.

"Concentrate, Neville." Lupin urged.

Neville threw the professor a smirk, "Oh, I did, professor."

Then he stepped up and viciously kneed the Boggart-Snape in the balls.

--------------

Professor Flitwick stopped conducting the Frog Choir's practice for a moment and listened.

"Um, excuse me, just a moment," the choir stopped and looked at the professor curiously, "Does anyone know if anyone is practicing opera upstairs?"

There were murmurs and shrugs all around; the answer was clearly no.

Flitwick looked thoughtful, "Strange. For a moment there I thought I could hear the distinctive high-pitch of a countertenor."

--------------

"You see, I figured that if we can force the Boggart into a shape we find funny, we can also force it into a shape that has, well," Neville shrugged, "shall we say, a weak point."

Professor Lupin looked at the writhing, slowly disintegrating Boggart lying on the ground, and slowly nodded, "It was definitely effective, that's for certain...but please don't repeat it on the real Professor Snape."


** /Nice./

Now excuse me while I go sympathy puke.
