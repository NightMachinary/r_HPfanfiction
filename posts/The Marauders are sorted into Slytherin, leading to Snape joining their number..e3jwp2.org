I've seen a few Dark!Marauder fics, but I'd like to see one where they are sorted into Slytherin and befriend Snape. This leads to the existence of five Marauders who have really embraced their dark side. Bonus points if Lily let Snape color her perceptions of the houses and gets herself into Slytherin to be with her best friend. Anyone who insults the "mudblood" of Slytherin gets tormented by the Marauders.

Alternatively, Snape asks for Gryffindor because Lily was sorted there, and still ends up friendly with the Marauders, though not as dark.

Ron is like, my brother told me snape, they say he is a hardass in class but they say he caught them setting up a prank once and he then awarded them points for how creative the prank was.

Sirius and snape becoming close to both sharing abusive families.

Snape wanting to murder an escaped sirius because he thought sirius killed both lilly and James.

** Not exactly what you ask for, but in linkao3(18697885) the time-travelling Severus Snape (respectively returning to fix his screwed up life) decides to apologize to Lily and befriend Marauders (up to hiding in the Gryffindor Common Room, when Slytherin pre-Death Eaters tries to kill him).

*** While probably the most polished SS Peggy Sue fic overall, it falls victim to the common theme of essentially making him a Gryffindor disguised as a Slytherin. This is why I prefer The Peace Not Promised (although neither fic fulfills OP request).

** I could see that. The mauraders shockingly being sorted into Slytherin and being outsiders for different reasons like James being the heir of a light side family or Sirius refusing to be like his family despite still being sorted into the same house. They all refuse to support the dark lord and don't interact with any of the other Slytherin students because they do support the dark lord either for their own personal gain or because their families made them. Severus is an outcast as well because of his sickly image, being poor, and a half blood to boot with only Lilly to keep him company when they have the time to hang out till the marauders recruit him to their cause of chaos with wanting to utilize his talent in potions making. First he waves them off because he's not some troublemaker like them, but he ends up changing his mind for some reason later on.

Because he's also an outcast in Slytherin - he's visibly poor and has a Muggle surname. His best friend is a Gryffindor Muggleborn. Plus, Lily is probably less likely to think of the Marauders as cruel bullies if they aren't targeting her bestie for no apparent reason.

** I'm still hoping for a fic in which Lily is in Slytherin and basically ends up going more Dark than Snape, because the way you survive in Slytherin as a talented Muggleborn during Voldemort's first rise is by making yourself too dangerous to antagonise.

"I didn't enjoy using that curse on him, Sev, but you know how it is. Between your Potions skills and your mother being a Pureblood, you can always make nice with them. I don't have that option."

"You didn't enjoy it at all?"

"Well, maybe a little."

"Lily!"

"OK, a lot. But he had it coming. I got away with it, didn't I?"

** I've been trying to find something like this too. I only found a very shitty SI fic, where Severus became the inside man for the Marauders when they learned he wanted to terrorize the shit out of most of Slytherin as well.

I personally don't like Snape as a person, I find him revolting actually. But what he could become in a role like that, or what the Marauders could become, could be very interesting.

** This would create an interesting dynamic with regards to Lily. Remember, Lily was Snapes "best" friend basically prior to Hogwarts and he was the one who introduced her to Magic. Houses separated them sure, but there is no doubt she was influenced with regards to her view of Snape by the anomosity between the Marauders and Snape himself. So if the Marauders included Snape, and they were friends... how would Lily have percieved them.

And this then brings up another interesting possibility. How would James's view of Lily have changed with Snape as a friend who knew Lily prior to school. Would she have still dated James Potter eventually? Or perhaps would Potter have possibly stepped aside and then would she have dated Snape eventually instead?

This is of course also ignoring the whole house change thing that the OP brings up (aka Lily going to Slytherin).

Regardless, the whole dynamic of the Lily/Snape/Maurauders relationships change on SOOOOO many levels with what the OP "prompts".

*** What other way around? The OP lists essentially the 2 big changes you could make to canon. Snape and the Marauders being in disparate houses isn't a change, even if you somehow make them friends (though hypothetically you could do it, you would just have to really put thought into the inciting incident to make it seem natural.)
