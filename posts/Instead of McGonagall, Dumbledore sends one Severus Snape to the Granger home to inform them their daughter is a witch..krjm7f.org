If yall know any fics like this that would also be great. I at first pictured it like a joke and pretty funny but then I wondered how this might change anything about Hermione (I always thought she had a nice bit of Slytherin in her- but she doesn't have to be Slytherin for this promp obvi ) and how that will also change the story as a whole. (Also any Slytherin!Hermione fics would be neat)

Just a warning. It takes place in early 19th century.
