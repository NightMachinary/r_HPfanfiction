At first I didn't know what to expect with a fanfiction dedicated to Professor Binns' life, but it was certainly not a story this touching or beautiful. It seems that not many people go searching out for stories about him, so I thought I would give it a promo here.

** Oh, wow. I really didn't expect that. It looks like I have a new headcanon to work from. I never gave Binns much thought before, but this is heartbreaking.

  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.
