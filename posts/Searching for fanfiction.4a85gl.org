** I think I know the story you are talking about, and I thought it might have been by Watermelonsmellinfellon, but now I'm unsure. I've tried searching for what I remember, but no luck.

In the graveyard Magic appears and forms a bond of some kind between Harry and Voldemort, which makes him sane. Harry at that point was in a semi serious relationship with Viktor, and so they continue to exchange letters. In it is the letters Harry finds out about the arranged marriage, but (I think) before the wedding the girl is killed either by Harry or maybe Tom? I don't remember Harry getting pregnant, and certainly not being raped by Dumbledore so it may be a different story altogether.
