Harry and Daphne, is in reality an limitless idea to expand off of. While this has spwaned a few tropes about the couple, or others, there is really no information, or at least solid information, about Daphne. Thus, we can explore and mold her to our liking. In this I ask for your favorite, of best stories with this pairing. With of course, understandable criteria: at least 100k words, doesn't follow canon like a lovesick puppy, and with half-decent writing at the least. Also, please no female Harry please. Other than that, everything really goes.


** It's not quite 100k words, but the following is my favorite.

​

linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent)

** Harry/Daphne is present, but not the focus, in linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House) and sequel.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
