:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
For the life of me I cannot find this particular fanfic. I remember stuff like Harry connecting with a number of students that either can't or won't return home over the holidays, and that it's almost like a healing experience for him over the course of the year where he comes to terms with things and grows. I think it was pretty soon after the war, if not right afterwards. I thought it was by one of the main postwar writers but I cannot find it among the ones I looked at.


** linkffn(All Was Well by femmedefoi) was about this! I don't know if that's what you were thinking of, but it fits the bill

*** The link isn't coming in, but if it's the one shot compilation of the 18 months after, that's not it. It was a dedicated story about what I was talking about.

  The war is over, so where are Harry and Ginny now? Harry's finally settled into a position that's made for him, and Ginny is thriving as a chaser. Life is normal. Life is good. All is well. A one (maybe two) shot on where Harry and Ginny are post-war, inspired by a tumblr post and its responses.
