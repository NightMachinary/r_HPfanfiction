i'm fine with wrong bwl/twins, girl who lived, orphanage, raised by others, even time travel

but i'm looking for a MC who has been through it and is (probably) slytherin and might be OP but is not supported by fellow slytherins or "dark" mages b/c he hates muggles, they are bullied for being a halfblood and are definitely not Heir to the Ancient and Most Noble House of (insert op "lordship"), he does not immediately become friends with or adopted by Malfoys, his experience might be similar to tmr or snape but they do not sympathize with him immediately. TMR is probably pissed b/c MC dislodged his spirit for ten years and the Slytherins are mad b/c he killed their parents leader.

also interested in "not a Potter" (or not a 'pureblood') fics (as in MCs father is not james or a different notable pureblood)
