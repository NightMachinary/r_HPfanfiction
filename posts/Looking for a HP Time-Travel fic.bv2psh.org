:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm looking for a Time-Travel fic, however, I may have gotten multiple storylines mixed. So what I know is this:

1) Harry is currently in the marauders era, but elder to them. I believe he is the DADA professor. He frequently trains with Rolanda Hooch, running around the Black lake. There is a scene where Minerva thinks he likes her and he clarifies that he only sees her as a friend and colleague.

2) Dumbledore knows that Harry has traveled back in time. He realizes that he needs the Elder wand to defeat Voldemort. They organize a duel on the Quidditch pitch so that Harry can disarm him and win the allegiance of the Elder wand.

I don't know if both the descriptions I have given above relate to the same fic or not. Any help would be appreciated!!
