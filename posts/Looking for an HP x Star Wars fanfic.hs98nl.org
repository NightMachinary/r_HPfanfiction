:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for an incomplete fanfic with Harry in the Star Wars universe. The only scene i remember when someone comments on his ships maneuverability and calls it a Marauder Class ship and Harry simply chuckles at the irony of it.

I know it's not a lot to go by but anyone have a clue which fic this is?


** I think it's The havoc Side of the Force by Tsu Doh Nim.

** OK, so I know 19 stories that are star wars/Harry Potter crossovers. The problem is when you read it, because the story might have been updated since you read it. I'll link all the ones that haven't been updated in a while or have been updated recently and maybe you might find the story you're looking for. Also other people might find a story they like.

** Imo, the best HP/Star Wars crossover I've read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]. Unfortunately its incomplete and hasn't been updated in years, but its still a good read up to that point.
