Ideally fics that are fairly long. It can be time travel, dimension travel AU whatever.

I've been enjoying Phoenix Corrupted quite a bit and now I kinda want to read stuff where Tom Riddle isn't a murderous asshole. linkffn(12177140)

I've also read Rectifier and I thought it was interesting. linkffn(2595818)

IMO the writing is better for Phoenix Corrupted than Rectifier but the characterization of LV is much better in Rectifier


** linkffn(Realignment) Tom Riddle finds himself to be the target of a mysterious dark wizard. Luckily, his mentor Dumbledore agrees to help him defeating the unknown threat.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

#+begin_quote
  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.

  The summer after her fourth year is the worst one yet and Harry knows with grim certainty that her Uncle is going to kill her before she can even reach her fifteenth birthday. So she leaves. Finds herself by the edge of an forest - knows that no one is going to look for her out there.And she's content on her own - finds the rhythm of survival. Learns.She knows that the day she meets Nagini that she should have left. She's had dreams looking out from those exact slitted pupils - knows that she puts her life in danger every day she stays with Voldemort's familiar. But it's hard to be scared when Nagini huffs about her 'silly speaker' and complain about him working too hard and praises him for his toasty winter bed.But then, it's not Harry Potter who Tom meets that day in the clearing.It's Nagini's 'Little Wolf' - and that changes everything.

** In Rogue's Bet, he was given the Defense Against the Dark Arts position when he first applied, and is still teaching by 1997 when the story begins. He's generally viewed as a good teacher, but his methods are comparable to Moody's; not afraid to dive into the nitty-gritty of dark magic. I think the worldbuilding of this fic is really interesting, including how Harry still got orphaned by dark wizards (not saying more because of mild spoilers).

** Here are a few long fics that you might enjoy.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws][Benefits of Old Laws]] - When Voldemort gets a new body at the end of the Triwizard Tournament he regrets the madness in which he led his alies to decimate wizarding society. He returns to his original goal of protecting the magical world, and he pursues this goal with magical innovation and intelligent political maneuvering rather than violence.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October][October]] - Harry, as Death personified, changes the future after meeting 11 year old Tom Riddle on the train to Hogwarts. This Tom Riddle eventually embarks on a new path, never pursuing the misanthropic goal of becoming Voldemort.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]] - Hermione is pulled into an alternate universe in which the roles of Dark and Light magic are switched. Tom Riddle was the leader of a failed Light rebellion against a tyrannical Dark regime led by Dumbledore. (Riddle doesn't become a major character until Ch 25.)

**** Before I read the fic I was confused by that pairing tag as well, but it makes sense in context. There is no smut, and the two relationships don't happen at the same time; in fact they are separated by many years. The plot is mostly focused on other things. Basically, Tom develops unrequited feelings for Harry during their years at Hogwarts, but they never get together. Years later Tom meets Lilly Evans and falls in love with her, though he has no idea of her relation to Harry.

** In linkffn(7613196) Voldemort is a politician instead of a terrorist. I don't know if I would say he isn't /evil/ or an asshole, but he isn't a murdering asshole at least. The point where canon diverges is where he kills Myrtle, actually, but regrets it.

It's also REALLY long and has great writing and characterization, IMO. Riddle (as he's known there) doesn't start physically showing up in the series until the second book, though there is a small appearance right at the epilogue of the first book.

** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/what-wicked-warthings-harry-potter-rwby.614516/reader][What Wicked Warthings]] has Tom be Chief Warlock as well as Harry's mentor. It's a HP/RWBY which only uses the setting details of RWBY, such as Grimm and trick wepoans, without the actual characters of RWBY. Summary: "Magic is a curious thing, capable of creating beings that are the embodiment of human emotion; the Boggarts who are Fear, the Dementors who are Despair...and the Grimm, shadowy creatures who feed on pandemonium and Turn those they kill. The Grindelwald Plan has spared us from annihilation, but this war will only end in one of two ways and I'm not one for dying." -Tom Marvolo Riddle

Linkffn(The Other Side of the Coin by Zennith6) has Grindelwald be tho one who killed Harry's parents with Tom being the defense teacher and Harry's mentor.

Linkffn(On the Wings of a Phoenix by makoyi; The Well Groomed Mind by Lady Khali) have Dumbledore be the true villian of the series with the Death Eaters being considered the good guys. I usually can't stand that premise but these fics are at least written well enough to make up for it.

*** Thanks for these recs. "The Well Groomed Mind" is one of my favorite fics because of the excellent world building, but I wish that the author had written it without such blatant Dumbledore bashing. Dumbledore would be a more compelling antagonist if he weren't so transparently evil that the Order members look like idiots for not noticing.
