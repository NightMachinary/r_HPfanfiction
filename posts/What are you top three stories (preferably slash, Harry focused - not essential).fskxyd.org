Looking for new stories to read that I haven't before. Please tell me the top three stories you've ever read. The stories that you can read over and over again and not get tired of it. Please and thank you.


** One of my favourite stories is Harry/Draco (and I do not ship this pairing, so the story /has/ to be good for me to read it!) is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378][Running on Air]] linkao3(3171550)

I also recently really enjoyed [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22256608][Be With Me Always]] (but check the tags before you read) linkao3(22256608)

And it's completely different to the other two, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22103842/chapters/52754038][Dear Mum]] had me giggling all the way through! linkao3(22103842)

  Harry's words spiraled out through Remus' mind in dangerous fractals. What exactly did â€˜gone' even mean? He had thought Peter was gone for a dozen years, only to find that he was alive. The entire Wizarding World had thought Voldemort gone until he had returned! Why should he assume the permanence of Sirius' death when that line was blurred, when that line was as fragile as the flutter of a Veil? Could fabric not be torn?     In which Remus Lupin must come to terms with third chances coming at a very dear price.*Written for Fireside Tales 2020*

** *Browncoat, Green Eyes* - Want to read a fusion style crossover done right? Here you go. I've read this at least a half dozen times, and would happily pick it up again tomorrow. A completely unique plot that ties both fandoms together in a way that fits pretty much perfectly, most of the banter is comparable to a Whedon show and it can be read while knowing only the basics of Firefly.

*Of A Linear Circle* - This one satisfies your slash requirement, and while it's still in progress (updates on Fridays!) I've found myself rereading the earlier installments because Flamethrower is a goddamn genius. I've seen it pop up a lot lately, and dude. I don't care if you hate the pairing or if you hate slash, you still need to read it!

*Stages of Hope* - This one was harder to choose, not because the story is bad but because... well I couldn't decide between this and a couple other ones. Highly recommended, and bring tissues.

He also had no idea that his mom's ex-boyfriend would have an axe to grind, the most eager girl would follow him around like she'd been hit with a Permanent Sticking Charm, or that the handsome man in his bed that morning was his boss, Tom Marvolo Riddle, Head of Spell Damage.Like I said, Harry Potter is screwed.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

******* Yeah don't worry this looks cool! Tysm, the reason why I asked was because we both already read similar fics and I just based it off that if you know what I mean? So I've figured the stories would be great! Again thank you
