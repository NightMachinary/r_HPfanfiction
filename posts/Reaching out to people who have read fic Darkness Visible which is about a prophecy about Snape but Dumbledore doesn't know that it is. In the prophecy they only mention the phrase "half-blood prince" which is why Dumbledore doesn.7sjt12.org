Now that you know which fic I'm talking about, my question is whether or not it is worthwhile to read. I, personally, thought it was an interesting concept, when, in the second chapter I was attacked by a phoenix bond. The story is 123 chapters and I don't want to dive into it if it has phoenix bonds no matter how interesting it seems. So, without spoilers, can someone who has read the story tell me if it is worth my time despite phoenix bonds?


** I don't think it is. For the good parts, Snape's characterization is decent and without spoiling anything, the author spotlights some interesting characters we didn't see much of in canon. It also has some interesting and creative magical concepts. However, the characterization of some characters is weird, like Dumbledore, Sirius and Harry, which borders on bashing at times. It's also way too long for the story it was trying to tell and could have easily been cut in half. What clinches it for me is the ending, which is infuriating and what I thought was being edgy for the sake of edginess. It's quite dark and there's no real payoff in the end. If you're into that kind of thing, particularly in a long fic, go for it.

*** I agree with this, although I would say it may be worth reading if you can ignore the occasional bad parts and don't mind a dark ending. I read it and I liked how Snape was portrayed. It had some enjoyable dialogue, interesting scenes and a creative plot line. I even liked the phoenix, he was entertaining and made an interesting contrast to Snape who wanted nothing to do with him. The Dumbledore and order bashing was really annoying though and drove me crazy. I thought the fic really picked up the pace towards the end and reduced the bashing but the end was just brutal. It was well written and fitting but just so dark, abrupt and depressing as hell.
