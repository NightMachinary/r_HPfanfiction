It might be because WBWL stories tend to be hot garbage but even in the good ones we have names like "Julian" mainly because people are fucking idiots and name Harry "Hadrian" because they like Rome or something.

Why not use normal English names some of the berrable WBWL stories learned this, using things like Jacob, James, John, Adam etc. But most still just stick with Outlandish names its strange...

***** Well this is just supposition but I think it has to do with people wanting a more "regal" or "aristocratic" name than Harry, which is decidedly common as names go and not fitting for their "lord of 16 houses prince of atlantis and the fae realms, lord protector of mars" Harry, thus they would go looking for names that are suitably old and important. From here they would quite quickly reach the name Hadrian and think "Hey, that's the name of an emperor and is 2000 years old, that's a great name for my Harry".

Personally I would rather go for Harold in that case as I prefer Anglo-Saxon British history to Roman British history, and Harold Godwinson was the last king of England before the Norman conquest (also Godwinson has similarities to Godric so there's a slight connection there)

***** As Tantum said, it's an aristocrat's name. Y'know, the kind of name aristocrats or people who feel like or wish they were aristocrats give their kids. As for location, I don't see most people really complaining and names like that I know for sure to be pretty common around latin america and the carribean as well as not insignificant portions of mainland europe. Based off general reputation and a few english aristocrats' names I'm going to assume it's not that uncommon in the UK either.

** “My name is Harry James Potter. My father's name is James Fleamont Potter. Mum's was Lily Evans. Thank God for Mum...She's probably the only reason teachers at primary school could get it right at roll call.

“You see, names are...different...here. My best friends are Ronald Bilius (isn't that some kind of stomach condition?) Weasley and Hermione Jean Granger. If those names aren't odd enough, my rival/nemesis is called Draco Lucius (my parents wished I was a Roman emperor) Malfoy, my godfather was Sirius (at least my animagus form works here) Black and the guy trying to kill me is Tom Marvolo (my name's only purpose is a convenient anagram) Riddle.

“My favorite teacher's full name was Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. I guess that one's pretty normal now.”

In all seriousness though, canon names are weird, but some fanon names (Yes, I'm looking at you Lord Hadrian Jamesus Jesus Sirius Severus Albus Potter-Gryffindor-Peverell, of the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black-Slytherin-Voldemort) are downright absurd. If you're going to read a certain type of story, I think you just have to roll with it.

** normal-ish, conceivably realistic ones i've seen for Harry, at varying levels of frequency: Harrison, Henry, Hari, Hazel, variations of Halley/Hailey/whatever, Holly

somewhat okay ones i've seen for the sibling: Jennifer/Jen, Julian, Jim, John, (why are they all J's? i have no mcfreakin' clue.)

names i've seen that are either super uncommon for that time period in Britain or just plain off-putting/"weird": Skylar (shift the setting up 20 years and it might have worked,) Xander, Xavier, Melantha, Hester

names i'm sick of: Harriet, Hadrian

ones i've never seen but would like to, and should probably write: Hera (since the wizarding world has a lot of canon characters named for various gods,) Haritha/Harita (broadly means "nature," "greenery," or "garden.")

as a South Asian person, i'm a huge fan of the ongoing trend of writers portraying Harry as brown; one of the main points for this in fanon is that "Harry" is a relatively common Anglicized version of the Indian name "Hari," which means "lion" and is not an uncommon name.

"Henry" is also a realistic choice because it's so easily commonly shortened to Harry, and has been a popular name on and off through British history. "Harrison" experienced a brief surge in popularity in the late 70s, so it would also make sense in context even if it's a bit stuffy-executive-bowling-alley-manager sounding.

but... like... would you /want/ to be named "Hadrian"? if i were named that i'd call myself Harry regardless of if the trope-y Goblins thought it was childish, effectively rendering the author's effort to give him a grown-up name pointless.
