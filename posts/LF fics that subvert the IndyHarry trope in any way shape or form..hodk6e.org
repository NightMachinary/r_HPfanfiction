What the title says.

Harry gets the summer revelation, but misunderstand everything and thinks everybody is out to get him while people are actively working to help him. It snowballs from there.

** There are two main ways to "subvert" tropes, I think.

1. Use the tropes, but try to do them "better". Example: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory][A Cadmean Victory]]. Almost always, these fics are much less subversive than the authors think they are, likely because the authors are so immersed in the tropes that even small variations appear significant to them. So generally, the tropes are played 99% straight, with the "subversion" being just some minor variation which the author perceives to be earth-shatteringly different.

2. Openly mock the tropes and/or take them to absurdist conclusions. Example: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]. These fics can be entertaining, but they are fundamentally crackish in nature. As such, they will never feel like stories of substance with genuine stakes, satisfying character arcs, or a world you can lose yourself in without your immersion being repeatedly broken.

There is a third way. +A way between the light and dark, between Dumbledore and Voldemort; the way of grey.+ That way is to tell a serious, substantial story which deploys the /themes/ of indy!Harry without using the specific tropes/cliches.

If you're interested in that third option, I recommend /[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c18s9z/perfecting_the_independent_harry_genre/][this thread]]/.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

** The Good War linkao3(23747950) has a female!Harry who's a natural Legilimens (like TMR). Her reaction to abuse by the Dursleys is to become extremely introverted and reticent. No becoming an expert politician or acquiring a fortune.

  Despite her best efforts, Elizabeth Potter is repeatedly drawn into situations she wants absolutely nothing to do with. People just refuse to leave her the hell alone.
