I don't mean simply being able to read the chapters, but actually remembering what the characters were like, the plot etc.

It's really frustrating when you know you like a fic, but don't know what's actually in it.


** If the fic updates quickly enough - usually up to about every fortnight or so - I'll usually remember most everything myself and be prompted to remember everything I don't by the new chapter. I have a good memory for other people's stories.

If it updates less regularly than that, that's when I usually need to go back and start rereading (assuming it's not a 2-million word epic, anyway) and I usually go between one and five chapters back, so it works pretty well on keeping me up to date.

*** Yeah. There's a few that I have saved that update very sporadically and I have to go and re-read them....

**** Exactly. Part of the fun though, innit? Always nice to go back and revisit your old favourites. :)

** Some fics are easy to remember because they are really different from the rest (hello "The Shadow of Angmar"), but good luck remembering what happened in Slytherin! Harry NÂ°45.

With some tropes (WBWL, Grey! Harry . . .), it feels like you are always reading the same story again, and again, and again . . . but you keep going in the hope to find /the/ gem of this trope.

*** Yeah this is what I'm afraid of- just started writing a multi-story fic and I know I'll probably struggle to find encouragement. At this point I figure I'll publish only when the first book is complete so people know I'm committed and they can read the first fic in one go without waiting for updates.

**** That's what I do. I write an entire part before doing daily chapter updates for as long as it takes the story to be fully posted. Seems to work pretty all right.

***** Great thank you! It's a bit intimidating coming into the HP fanfic scene this late, I can only hope my work brings joy to at least a few people!

** This is why I try not to follow incomplete fics unless they're actively updated, especially ones that are significantly AU or have a lot of OCs.

** There's generally two kinds of I'm subscribed to: the kind that has good writing, solid characterization, and a new take on ideas, or the kind that's a decent read and mildly interesting. If it's the first kind, I'll reread the last 20k or even start from the beginning. For the second kind, I reread the previous chapter.

** 17 years ago when the fanfic community was at the beginning I found it quite easy because there were not all that many fics that peaked my interest (a lot was just crappy smut and few overall well written stories). During the lockdown earlier this year my interest returned and what I've found is that there are so many good fics that are complete that I don't even bother with WIPs.

** I am currently following 103 fics that are activly updating. (And an additional 256 that haven't updated in 6+months) of the 103 wip's i only read 10 of them when they update, while i wait for the rest to finish. I just simply cannot keep having to refresh my memory every 1-3 months of what happened in all of them.

If someone doesnt update for 3 months, ill stop reading until they finish the story, because i will have forgotten too much :(

** With my favorites I will remember them, sometimes I just read the summary or tags to reconnect the plot to the title and other times it comes to me as I start to read the new chapter. Occasionally I'll go back a few chapters and rarely I'll unsubscribe if I can't remember and the new chapter seems boring.

** It's not personally an issue for me because I almost /exclusively/ read completed fics. If the fic in question has not been updated in the last three months, I will usually give it a pass and I absolutely refuse to read anything that is abandoned, simply because I despise the disappointment of investing myself in a story only for it to never resolve. As such, it takes a special fanfiction to draw me in as it updates. I am currently only following three (/Harry Potter, Squatter/, /the Prince of Slytherin/ and /Blue/ which is an Avatar fanfiction).

** I tend to recall quite quickly what was happening by the context if the story's name doesn't jog anything.

If it's been more than a year than the details can run together a bit though it probably helps that the 100-ish fics i follow are spread over 5 or so fandoms and generally distinct from there within.

** I know, it sucks but that is the reason why I only read complete stories. I am writing fanfictions myself but it is just way too risky. I don't want to wait too long or start reading a fanfic and never be able to finish it.

** I just cannot read updating stories, realistically even if they take a week to upload, ive already jumped over a few dozens of fics or so and i barely remember the plot of the one which was being updated. And i have a very active imagination so my mind jumps over so many possible situations over the week or more, that i stay distracted most of the time. While i understand that authors stagger the chapters to gain a following or are uploading as they write, in my opinion it would be easier for me as a reader to read the complete fic at once. Also when the author is updating as they write and then for some reason or the other the fic gets abandoned or months go by before updating, the excitement for the story goes down and i end up not bothering to finish it.
