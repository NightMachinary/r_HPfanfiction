I'm looking for recommendations for really good HP stories. Harry has to be either the main character or one of several important characters. I'd prefer straight pairings for Harry, but if the story's good slash is fine.

Just a quick few I've already read that I see given often so they don't get recommended again: Methods of Rationality, The Sacrifices Arc, Delenda Est, Prince of the Dark Kingdom.


** I can offer you the following. Harry is the main character. It's set roughly 50 years after the Battle of Hogwarts. Fully canon-compliant.

*** I've never known how to navigate fanficauthors. Is there a trick to it or is it just random browsing?

**** Those 25 authors are all that's on the site, as its invite only. It wasn't designed as a site for readers, it's a site for writers so they can host their works in one place. It's all explained in the FAQ.

To find a fic, click an author's name then at the top left corner select fanfiction then select Harry Potter or whatever XO you want. All fics by that author show up, sorted by pairing. There's probably less than 500 stories total on that site, and most of them are also on ffnet or the other archives such as ao3, ficwad, and patronuscharm.

***** No, I know the site, I mean how to find good fics, as you said there are around 500 and no way to sort them.
