Hey guys, I'm looking for a story I read a while ago about Harry's twin sister being the girl who lived while Harry was raised by Remus and neither of them know about their relationship. They then attend Hogwarts together and become friends along with Hermione and Ron. Later I think the female OC realizes that she and Harry are brother and sister and decide to go to the Triwizard ball together (as siblings not that anyone but Hermione and Ron know) much to the horror of Sirius and Remus who think they're actually in love. I think that's how the story went. Or it might actually be completely the other way around lol Anyway any help finding this fic would be awesome!


** Looking for this too
