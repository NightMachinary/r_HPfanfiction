Harry, becoming Master of Death, is visited by which ever incarnation of Death you prefer with a reward for killing Voldemort. Harry can, through time travel and indirect manipulation, now save Seven lives. So, through which ever magically induced Rube Goldberg-esque phenomenon, seven souls can be saved.

This can be very light hearted, very hilarious and so forth, but it can also be very dark and deep. Sure a sudden mishap can cause a random magical item of substantial weight to careen right into Bella's muff just before she offs the good ol' dog father... But there could also be a very lethal version of these events as Bella is already fated to die at the wand of Mama Molly-wabbles and killing her ahead of time might fall within which ever rules that could be instated.

If we want to be really heavy on Temporal Causality and its abuses, saving those lives could change the time line and the events after meaning who knows what happens. Saving Sirius might end up with Hermione or Luna dying in Malfoy Manor. Then again, saving Sirius might mean saving Remus and Tonks. And with those three, who knows, maybe Fred or Colin might make it through the battle of Hogwarts. Saving Moody? Who knows? Saving Lily and James would probably send the whole thing out of whack if you so choose to go that route, who knows what can happen then.So yeah, just a little idea I had after seeing a movie clip on youtube and checking if there were any fic, (very few)
