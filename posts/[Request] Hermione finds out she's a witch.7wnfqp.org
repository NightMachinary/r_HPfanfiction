More realistic to JKR's writing style the better. Just thought it would be a fun few-hundred word chapter to read if it exists.


** old-crow's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4571803/1/The-Dentists-Daughter][The Dentist's Daughter]], linkffn(4571803) -- Canon-compliant. More about the Grangers' reactions than Hermione's.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence][Perils of Innocence]], linkffn(8429437) -- Very AU. 5yo Harry is abandoned at an orphanage and the teachers and doctors help him control his accidental magic. Later, the Grangers bring Hermione there too (in-patient, not abandoned) because of her accidental magic. Eventually letters arrive that explain everything. Slow work-in-progress.

#+begin_quote
  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
