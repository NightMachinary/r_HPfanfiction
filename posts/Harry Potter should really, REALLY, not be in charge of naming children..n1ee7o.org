So I know that videos don't generally count as fanfiction, but I saw one recently called [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIexDBVjpic]["Harry Potter Family Names",]] and it is basically a crackfic but in video form. This video starts with Albus Severus Potter but then starts getting weirder, with stuff such as Minerva Bellatrix Potter, Wingardium Leviosa Potter, etc...

My prompt is this: It's time to go to platform 9 and 3/4s again, and Harry now has to send "Blank Blank" Potter to school, and /Blank/ inevitably asks "But what if I am put in Slytherin?" What is Harry's reply?

I'm just sharing this so that more people can see this masterpiece and possibly get some inspiration from it. The rules don't seem to be against sharing videos as part of prompts, but if this is against the rules please let me know.


** "Arthur Rubeus Potter, you were named after only two paternal figures in my life that didn't have hidden agenda or turned into dogs, no way you will get sorted into Slytherin"

**** It is point of joke - normal name taken from normal people (with slightly wacky hobbies).

** linkffn(12542863) */101 Names We Could Have Used/* play with this idea. It's Harry and Ginny trying to come up with names for their second son. Some of the suggestions are really good (better than Albus Severus) while some others are completely cracky. It's very funny to read and I recommend it.

#+begin_quote
  101 names and the logic behind them that Harry and Ginny could have used, because if there's one thing most of the fandom agrees on, it's that Albus Severus Potter was a horrible name for Harry's second child. Names are Sirius, serious, and silly. *Complete*
