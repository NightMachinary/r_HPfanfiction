** Ummm, are you looking for a specific fic that you've forgotten? Or just any where he doesn't try?

If it's the later, linkffn(Muggle-Raised Champion) is a good (in-progress) story.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

*** A note to anyone who plans on reading: the author intentionally hammed up the H/Hr and Ron bashing to poke fun at other authors who do so. The first chapter is basically unreadable unless you realize it was done intentionally.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

  What if Harry's rebelliousness started a year earlier, because Dumbledore wouldn't let him go stay with Sirius in the summers? What would a rebellious teenager who was entered into the Triwizard Tournament do? H/G
