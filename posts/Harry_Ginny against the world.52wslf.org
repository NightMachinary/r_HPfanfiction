YO ! I would like to read a fic where Harry and Ginny take on everyone else.

I am not really a Ron and Hermoine fan either so if they dont play a large role that would be great !

** *Hail Odysseus* and *My Slytherin Harry*, linkffn(10645463;6160345), are H/G vs almost everyone. Severe Dumbledore bashing.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

*** Except they really don't spend all that much time working together in canon.

Harry hunts down horcruxes and Ginny helps run a rebellion with Neville in Hogwarts. They're both fighting the good fight but they aren't working together to do it.
