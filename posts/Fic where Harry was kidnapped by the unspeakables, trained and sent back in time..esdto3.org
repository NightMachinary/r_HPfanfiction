Don't remember much except he was kidnapped and trained in a time chamber or something like that before being sent back in time to stop Voldermort.


** This hits the mark but might not be what you're looking for.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** I don't remember the name but that sounds like a Harry/Bellatrix fic I read a while ago. Can probably just search with ffn tools to find it
