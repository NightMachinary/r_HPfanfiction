** In Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by Eliezer Yudkowsky linkffn(5782108) Harry stands up to Snape and later they publicly apologize to each other, which is a strategic win for Harry.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
