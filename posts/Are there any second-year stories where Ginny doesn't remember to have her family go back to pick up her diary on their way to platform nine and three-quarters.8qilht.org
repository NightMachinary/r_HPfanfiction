Maybe her parents find it and are curious why she has a book with some guy's name on it, realize there's some fishy Magic in it, and Arthur takes it into the ministry to investigate.

*** A fuming Riddle, from within the Diary, does /everything he can/ to influence people to get him back to Hogwarts to Ginny Weasley. No one believes him, or when they do, they insist he's in love with her.

Meanwhile, at Hogwarts, Gilderoy Lockhart falls madly in love with Sir Cadogan, and the Basilisk, left to roam free, dies from chocolate overdose after finding a passage to Honeydukes.

**** Now I want to see this as a fairly lighthearted fic with an aged up Ginny and lots of romance. Except Riddle takes out Gilderoy, either because he is a buffoon that endangered Ginny (before the romance reveal, possessive enemy type) or because Lockhart is a perv. Maybe not so lighthearted...

** It doesn't /quite/ fit your request, but there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4755852/1/Where-Does-It-Keep-Its-Brain][Where Does It Keep Its Brain?]] / linkffn(4755852) in which she does shout about her diary but her parents decide to owl it to her later instead, which leads to something similar... A pretty good what-if one shot in my opinion. :)

  What if, instead of going back for Ginny's diary, Arthur decided to owl it to her? What if he discovered it wrote back? What if he took this knowledge to Moody and Dumbledore? The Chamber of Secrets has NOT been opened. Enemies of the heir, rejoice.
