Written mostly in Lily's perspective but switches to others as well. I think it might be called Friendship or something similar?

Some highlights:

The marauders and lily get arrested during a protest for the MFP

Lily's first boyfriend Luke Harper has a brother named Logan who was a Death Eater

Snape joins the death eaters from snape's perspective

Lily attends Vernon and Petunias wedding

These should be big enough points to know which fic I'm talking about if you've read it. Would really appreciate a link because I can't find it for the life of me.

Thanks!


** Linkffn(the life and times). It happens to be my all time favorite Fic.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.
