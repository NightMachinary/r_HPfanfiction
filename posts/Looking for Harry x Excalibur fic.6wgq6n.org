I recall reading this fic where Harry is a descendant of Arthur, and Merlin's spirit comes to train and help him along his path.

Also one where Harry is the descendant of Merlin, and basically the same story but no Excalibur.

They were both 100k+ and at least one was M

Edit: Harry w/ Excalibur, not a damn pairing hahaha, i understand the confusion


** every time i think to myself "i havee seen every possible pairin", another one emerges.

** there was this one fic where Harry was thrown back in time by about a thousand year or so by the time of Merlin. He gets blood adopted by him, later by Arthur himself and Morgana. The world building was awesome but the plot itself was about average. Don't remember the name of it though.

** I came here for one really weird Souleater crossover where Harry pairs with [[https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/souleater/images/3/39/Excalibur_Render.png/revision/latest?cb=20141205042152][Excalibur.]]

I'm simultaneously relieved and disappointed.
