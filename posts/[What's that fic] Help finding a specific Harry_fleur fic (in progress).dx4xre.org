:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember coming across an M rated Harry/Fleur fic where Harry essentially leaves the dursleys and moves with Fleur into an apartment in diagon. He slowly subverts her into 'his.' I only remember it being a couple of chapters. They move into an apartment and he sleeps in her bed making her aroused. The last thing I remember is Fleur going to gringotts to remove the trade from Harry's wand and finding some runes by Dumbledore on the wand. The fic may be sitting discontinued in it's infancy stages.


** This one? Though Tonks is also there.

  Harry wakes up bored and realizes that he doesn't want to listen to anyone right now, so he adopts and "Ok and ..." mindset. Then he sees something he wants and decides no matter what, he is going to get it. Take this story as or not as all. Rated M for dark thoughts, language, and eventual sexual content
