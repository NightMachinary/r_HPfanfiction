*** I HATE self inserts where they take over a body and get none of the knowledge. What is the point of a self insert? She never finished the books either. If you self insert without knowledge then you should self insert as an 11 year old at least.

So this means that she took over the body of an old man that is going to die soon with no knowledge of the horocruxes how to dispose of them and she is well past the prime while taking out the best magical on the good side.

If he can somehow get ANYTHING right then it would just piss me off more.

This is also one of the Self inserts where the main character refuses to tell someone there knowledge form the books. so no knowledge from the books past the fourth no magical knowledge and he will be stuck in a four year old body while harry is 11....

**** I don't know I thought it was just absolutely hilarious and absurd. And the author does finish it kind of and the character did tell someone.

***** I understand that I guess but I just want one serious SI where they use their foreknowledge to make themselves prepared like practicing wandless magic and occulamancy at a young age or maybe jumping into an adult and actually absorbing there knowledge and then preparing yourself to hunt the horrocruxes

And I want these to actually end and not just putter out in first year or somthing.
