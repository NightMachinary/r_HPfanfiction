:END:
I'm looking for a fanfic, where it starts off with Harry rescuing Ron and Hermione from Voldemort and then going into slytherin where they are then forced to speak to Snape about what happened to them. Dumbledore had said that rescuing Ron and Hermione was pointless I think. It was a slash fic of Harry/Snape.

Thanks
