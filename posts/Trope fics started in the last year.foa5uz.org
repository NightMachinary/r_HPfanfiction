Looking for trope fics that's been started in the last year. Tropes that I'm looking for is betrothal, time travel to the marauder era, marriage contract, lord potter/black, Harry being Sirius son, good Dursleys, good Malfoys, manipulative Dumbledore, Black family drama and politics, pureblood politics and customs. No other tropes than what I requested please. The story has to take place during Hogwarts era. I can't really stand Snape so please no Snape fics. No slash pairings, and no Harry/Ginny or Hermione/Ron. At least 40k wording.

Thanks! :)
