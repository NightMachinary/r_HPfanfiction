This seems like the sort of thing there would be tons of, but I haven't found any well written fics that do it.

I'd like any Hogwarts or First War era fics that see Snape becoming friends with the Marauders. I'd prefer if they became friends later in their schooling, but first year is okay too. Ideally it would deal with Snape's home life and/or the affect the bullying has on him.

Please no time travel or second life fics.

Any pairings are fine but canonical pairings preferred.

  Sirius shuts his mouth, hides his views and does all he can to protect himself and his brother. This is why the hat put him in Slytherin. (In another life, perhaps he was more like Andromeda. Perhaps he rebelled, lived his life bright and loud and brave and Gryffindor. But in this life, Sirius Black decided that surviving was more important to him than living, and he adjusted his actions accordingly.) Sirius Black is a Good Pureblood Son, and everything changes.
