I've recently started writing fanfiction, and I am again and again struck by how little I know about British culture and lifestyle. I'd like it to be as accurate as possible in terms of slang, behavior, etc, and it can be a bit hard to find specific answers online. Therefore, I'm looking for a resident of the United Kingdom that I can send questions to at all hours of the day (or night) and that will usually respond within a 24-hour time period.

Questions will include topics such as names (British enough or not), food (do people over there eat this), and traditions (is this a likely thing that can happen), and probably more. If you're interested, leave a message and I'll PM you to work out the details.

Thanks!

** I'm always open to answering questions about England. I've lived here for about fifteen years, but I'm not a huge traveller, so I might not always be accurate.

Edit: Oh, and I'm on Reddit all the time, so spam away!

** For names, you can just google most common English/Welsh/Scottish names (depending on where the character is supposed to be from) and combine first and last names from those lists.

You can do the same for any other nationality but let me tell you, Lithuanian names are a bitch because they have gendered forms of the same name and the female ones are further divided by marital status.

** I'm British - it sounds like you have a few dialecticians who will probably be more helpful with accents and obscure language, but I can answer questions on odds and ends and even some things about the 90s (although I was quite young then and my memory might fall short)~
