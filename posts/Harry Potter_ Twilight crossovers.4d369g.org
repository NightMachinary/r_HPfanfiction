Ones where Harry is paired with a female from that world


** I am normally not into crossovers, but i had never considered this concept, which to a surprising degree actually works due to the simple fact that there are vampires in the world of HP, and Twilight leaves a lot of open wiggle room for myth and magic being real.

Ive never seen any crossovers of these two before, but I would also be interested if anyone has come across any.

*** It's one of the more popular crossovers. If you filter by amount of fics on ffn it is actually the most common with over 3000 fics. Now finding a god one is kinda hard. Especially as someone who doesn't like slash fiction.

**** Is it really? I enjoy HP fan fiction, and have read some Twilight ones (but not much and usually its terrible), but I have not come across any crossover ones outside of complete trash (smut) ones.

***** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/crossovers/Harry-Potter/224/][Here]] is a directory of every type of crossover for Harry Potter listed on Fanfiction.net. The number next to the series is the number of fics in that series. So Harry Potter/Twilight currently has 3,746 crossover fics. Most of those would be terrible. But you can use the filter to narrow down to most popular fics, completed fics, etc.

*** Tread with caution. It's a strange mix of capable HP writers straying into other fandoms, incapable HP writers combined with a terrible plot line, and absolutely incapable Twilight writers destroying our fandom too.

Some are great. Some... not so much.

** Theres one where Leah imprints on Harry while he's dating Ginny that's not too bad. I can't be bothered to find it but if you just put Harry and Leah into the characters section, its the longest one there I think.

** There actually are a few good HP/Twilight crossovers.\\
This genre is infested with lots of bad slash and Mary Sue wish fulfillment, but there is some good stuff there.

Actually one of the better fics I've read is called Harry Potter and the Forks Massacre. Warning it's abandoned but the story does a good job of characterization and dialogue.

There's also a few others that are pretty decent, but they're slash.

Good luck finding what you're looking for, good HP crossovers are few and far between.

** linkffn(9397304) isn't terrible, it's on a bit of a hiatus though until the author finishes their other story.

  More to the teaser for my next story (still not done) "Harry has left the magical world to seek a place to recuperate from the tough war with Voldemort. Escaping Britain and the magical world as a whole, he finds a place to rest and make new friends though he finds out that some may be as strange as him." -AU after OoTP for HP, set during AU New Moon-Eclipse books. Harry/Alice.
