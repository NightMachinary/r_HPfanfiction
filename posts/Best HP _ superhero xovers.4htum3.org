  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

Harry crosses into Marvel (comic) universe and curbstomps everything

The story is at the moment over 1 000 000 words

Ps. this story isn't anything magnificent, just a decent wankfest

*** TPF is a good read, it's better written than a lot of trash out there. Even if the plot isn't super deep, it encompasses a lot of material and it keeps me interested.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6093972/1/Thinking-in-Little-Green-Boxes]]
