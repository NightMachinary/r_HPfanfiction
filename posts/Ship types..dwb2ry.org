I noticed that the straight and m/m slash parts of the shipping fandom can be very toxic, with slashers and het shippers regularly fighting over ships, but the f/f shippers are usually quiet and you never see any ship wars here, almost no wars over het ships, and none between m/m and f/f, despite the somewhat-disagreement over the superiority of yaoi or yuri. The most obvious examples would be Drarry/Dramione and Romione/Harmony. You don't see massive groups of f/f shippers disagreeing over ships that much. Two of my main ships are Lucissa and Cissily, and even then I haven't seen anyone arguing over which is better. Is there anyone else who agrees? Do you yourself have a femslash ship you enjoy?


** F/F doesn't catch heat in this fandom because it's a relatively small, overlooked minority pairing type.

And that's because the HP source material lacks major notable female characters. If you count them up, most of the main plot-relevant named characters are men. Whether you like it or not, men drive the plot. Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, Draco. They're all first-tier central characters, and all have distinct personalities, motivations, backstories, flaws, goals, and mannerisms.

When you look at the women in the series, you hardly get as much material to look at. Hermione is the most well-developed female character, and then after her you drop into secondary-tier characters. Ginny (the instigator of the much-maligned "Chest Monster"), Luna (a victim of fanon), Bellatrix (a horrible person you have to work hard at to write a relationship around). And then after that, you get tertiary characters like Molly Weasley, Professor McGonagall, Dolores Umbridge, Rita Skeeter, Lily Evans, and Fleur Delacour.

Male characters are memorable with strong personalities, while the female characters often fall into "character archetypes", where their personalities are Doting Mother, Wise Professor, Hot Chick, Manic Pixie Dreamgirl, or Evil Bitch. And that's why M/M slash is so predominant - of course writers will chose the more interesting, well-established characters for their fics.

To give an example of the disparity of male/female personality development in the books, we know more about James than we do about Lily. They're same age, from the same year, both parents of the main character, but James is so much more well-rounded than Lily is.

That's maybe part of why M/M is popular, but it's pretty obviously not the only reason. If fandom actually insisted on writing interesting, well-rounded characters, [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Draco in Leather Pants]] wouldn't be a trope, and Percival Graves wouldn't be the second-most popular /Fantastic Beasts/ character on AO3, since we literally never actually see him.

I think the popularity of M/M is largely due to a combination of fanfic writers - [[https://centrumlumina.tumblr.com/post/62895609672/ao3-census-about-you][who are largely women who are attracted to men]] - writing what they find hot, and internalized misogyny leading people to insist that women are [[https://whetstonefires.tumblr.com/post/185793877230/i-know-i-know-i-knooowww-i-knowww-that-women-in][just naturally harder to write]].

*** Small question for [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]]

Was this fic specifically written so that it could be brought up whenever people have heated discussions on (relation)ships?

It's pretty awesome but the concept is so outlandish that it seems to be tailored specifically to parody the most heated discussion topic in the fandom.

**** No, I merely wanted to write a Harry Potter/Shipgirl crossover story. At the time, the Kantai Collection fandom was quite active, but I didn't want to use that cast of characters (Why use the IJN instead of the RN if you're writing a HP crossover set in Britain?). I wanted to use my own ideas and characters for the concept.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

** I don't think this is strictly true. It's just that F/F is so much rarer than M/M or M/F.

Also, I always got the impression that "ship fighting" had little to do with the orientation of a ship, but more about personal feelings on who "deserves" who. I figured it almost always boiled down to one's personal OTPs and NOTPs [a person's "(no) one true pairing", the latter functioning as antonym, rather than every ship that isn't one's OTP].

Thankfully, ship wars in this fandom seems to be somewhat rare. While I haven't been in this fandom fanfic-wise for long, I always imagined these to be the most prone to shipping wars: Hinny vs Harmony vs Romione, Drarry vs Harry/non-Slytherin (Ginny or otherwise), and (shortly after DH was released) for a while Jily vs Snily. At least those are the ones that tvtropes like to bring up when it comes to HP shipping wars -- I've personally not really seen the worst kind of this, apart from the occasional arguments.

IMO, personally the worst trait in this community is ship shaming. This is less about what ship is better, and more the "your preferences are bad and you should feel bad" kind. I haven't seen this happen for F/F ships, but this is mostly because those are rare, and because there's far less female Death Eaters (the thing that evokes most shipshaming are Order/DE including Snape and Voldemort pairings of any kind).

** In my experience, the issues that plague slash fics (m/m in particular) is that often the slash is the /purpose/ of the fic rather than simply an aspect of the overall story. And just as often, authors seem to think that if they are going to go slash, they might as well go all in and make everything orbit that. As a rule, I have found that fics that center around pairings - no matter what the pairing, type or problems - are in general lower quality as well. And stories that aren't just smut (i.e. have a semblance of a storyline) only really work well if the pairings are ancillary or well-integrated into the plotline.

As an example, despite the emphasis on romance in HBP, its almost always a side aspect of the story and has no real effect on the overall storyline. Harry gets together with Ginny, then dumps Ginny. Harry still likes her, gets back together off-screen. In other words, you could remove the whole romance subplots with Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, Lupin/Tonks, etc. and the major plot is unchanged. The counter example would be Bill/Fleur, which is somewhat important to the plot of DH because it sets up the wedding situation and the place for the trio to stay and plan away from the other Weasleys.

TL;DR: slash fics are more often than not written solely for the slash, and this makes them poorer fics overall. Bad stories reflects badly on pairings, regardless of sexuality or believability, and makes people very strident in their opinions.

** Top comment made a great point on why there isn't as much discussion in general (and therefore not as much toxic discussion) over f/f ships. I'll just say that I really like reading Bellatrix/Hermoine.

** Ship fighting is incredibly dumb. Sure, I might find some ships really strange and/or disgusting, and some may just make me vomit, but honestly it's fan fiction. You're the god of your own world. Nobody can stop you from writing a ship, and conversely, you can't either.

like who the fuck cares if you like Ron better than Harry? They're not the original characters anyway, they're your own creations wearing their names. We don't even know the character of most people in canon, they're just there, mostly because JKR can't write them.

Sure I'm disappointed when a good prompt turns into tomarry, but at that point I stop reading it and add it to the Black Book, not flame the comments or challenge the author to a fistfight

Have to say though, being an asexual aromantic, I don't exactly care for either of that stuff in the stories I read. Mostly I just wish fics would finally get to the cool shit instead of dicking around with awkward "romance" scenes written by someone even more alien to the concept than myself.

Ugh, speak English FFS. This is why I usually avoid arguing about the so-called "ships". People always seem to have some kind of a secret code talk I have to figure out. I'm not a fan of (fem)slash stories for two reasons.

First- they often pair a good guy like Harry with bad guys like Draco/ Snape/ Voldemort. I don't mind the gayness, I mind pairing the hero of the story with the bully and terrorist wanna-be, the abusive teacher that's old enough to be his dad or- best of all- the crazy terrorist that killed his parents and is old enough to be his grandfather. Just to be perfectly clear I find "ships" like Draco/ Hermione and Harry/ Bellatrix equally as repulsive even though they are heterosexual.

The second reason is that the sexual orientation of the characters often becomes the main plot point. I want to read about wizards/ witches and magic and stuff. If I wanted to read smut I'd just head to Literotica. Make some characters gay or bi- if you want but don't turn that into their most important characteristic. Try to write it in as part of the plot.
