I've only read a couple that looked interesting, the life and times (James and lily in school), the dark lord exposed (voldy's life) and the promises series (unbroken and remembered). Hopefully that can help any HP FF experts in here point me to a few I may enjoy? Thanks! This is turning into one of my favorite subs!


** There are so many fics that you're gonna have to be more specific as to what kind of fic you want or else you're not gonna get a good answer.

** Linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) is one of the best comedy fics out there.

Linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) is brilliant as is JBern's other stuff.

Linkffn(A Black Comedy) and Linkffn(Where in the world is harry potter) is also fun as is the rest of nonjon's stuff.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?
