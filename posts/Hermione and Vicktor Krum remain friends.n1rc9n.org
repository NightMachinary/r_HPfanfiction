After fourth year, Hermione and Vicktor stay in contact as friends via owl.

Vicktor and Hermione visit eachother during the summer holidays, and become closer friends.

When she and Ron get married, he's there as Hermione's ‚ÄúBridesmaid‚Äù. He's not very amused with the ‚Äòtitle', but takes it regardless.

To her children he becomes ‚ÄúUncle Vick‚Äù. (Or uncle Vicky to his embarrassment) He's definitely the cool uncle, being a Quidditch star. The children absolutely love him, especially when he teaches them how to play Quidditch with Ron.

He becomes a very close friend to Ron as well, and he's basically the family friend that's so close to the family that they're a part of it.

A small wholesome prompt I wanted to share :)


** /Uncle Vicky, Aunt Fleur and Uncle Harry get into a vicious tournament for the title of favorite aunt/uncle. Uncle George comes out of nowhere and easily wins the title/
