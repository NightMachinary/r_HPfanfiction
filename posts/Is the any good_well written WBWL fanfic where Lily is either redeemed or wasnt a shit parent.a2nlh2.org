I honestly give 0 fucks about James, he could be a douche or nice guy, I don't care either way.

But I just can't read a fic where Lily is negligent. Just doesn't fit in head.

NO Slash! Thanks.


** I've toyed with the idea that !DarkDumbledore obliviated the love for Harry out of Lily and James. When they realize what happened Lily literally blasts the gates of Hogwarts down as she marches to end Dumbles.

** Harry Potter and the Other Boy Who Lived. Abandoned, but one of the better stories out there....No bashing of the Marauders, Dumbledore, or Snape but mild Weasley bashing.

Pretty much all WBWL fics treat Lily and James as the devil incarnate and Snape/various Death Eaters are angelic saviors with occasionally Sirius thrown in as being a good guy. So, completely the opposite of canon of two people who died to protect their only son. There's an interesting story whose title I forgot that again, didn't have any bashing really, that involved as semi-redeemed Peter and Harry's parents love him and try and understand him, but have difficulty connecting, as he's a particularly cold/socially odd boy compared to Neville, whom they are also raising.

*** I'd be really interested to read it. If someone knows the name I'd appreciate.

Are you sure that's the name of the fic? "Harry Potter and the Other Boy Who Lived" Cuz I haven't found one with that name on google.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry has been through a lot yet there are some perks to being as gifted as he is. So he's not going to just sit back and let the world shit on him. He's going to best the absolute best. First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better. Also, I know the beginning sounds very cliche. It's explained later so try to stick with it. M for bad stuff

*** How the x-over works ? Harry goes to MCU or Nat goes to Hogwarts? Or just a complete mix of them, as if the Wizarding world is just another "realm" like Asgard?

**** Nah, typical earth with muggles and wizards ignoring each other like in canon. Harry runs away while young and becomes an assassin/thief who eventually ends up interacting with Natasha. I don't remember when he joined the wizarding world properly though, either with the letter or with the tournament.
