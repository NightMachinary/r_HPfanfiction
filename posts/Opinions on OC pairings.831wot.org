I've been planning a fiction on and off for quite some time now and have finally reached the point of actually going ahead and writing it. I've written a lot of other things, some of which has been published, but very little fanfiction. I do, however, run a forum-based RP site aimed at helping members to improve their own writing. The reason I mention this is that it occurred to me while planning that one of the original characters on that site would fit into a particular role far better than any canon character that I can think of. In fact, none of the canon characters would work at all, hence my wider consideration. But as the title of this post would suggest, part of this plot involves a canon-OC pairing.

Now, this character is pretty well balanced. She's not a self-insert as the stereotypical OC seems to be. She's not the centre of the story, has agency and it is quite genuinely a plot-driven decision. There's no canon pairing for the canon character, nor are they particularly major. But I am a touch concerned that potential readers will see the initials and avoid it like the plague. I could not mention it at all in the description, but that seems like something that would be annoying to some. So I thought I'd ask here to see if, presuming the description interested you, it actually would put any of you off?

Thanks in advance.


** The problem with a lot of OC romances, in my opinion, is that the OC often doesn't get much of a personality and is conceived as a romantic interest first and a character second.

This really is a problem with a lot of OCs, as they often end up being... pretty boring as characters, being either extremely bland or just a display of "better than the canon characters." Most of them, I couldn't even begin to tell what personality they're supposed to have.

So I would be mostly interested in seeing what sort of person this character was, more than who they end up with.

You hit the nail on the head!

*** Of course. This character has actually been developed over... must be three or four years now. So I can at least say that she's a well rounded person with weaknesses and she certainly won't be replacing or outdoing anyone. But yeah, I get it. I've seen some terrible, terrible characters.

** Depends on the pairing. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco, and probably Neville require care to sell the relationship. But if it's, say, OC/Sally-Anne Perks, you don't need much caution at all.

*** Yeah, it's none of those people. He's fairly minor, with no canon pairings, which kind of makes me think it'd be Ok. On the other hand, there's been a downvote already just for asking the question. Sigh.

** I think it really depends on how well developed the OC is. If he/she fits in naturally, and has a purpose, then I think you should be fine.

There are some people that don't mind OCs and some that do- can't please everyone. Write the story you want to tell! :)

I would recommend cross-posting this to [[/r/fanfiction]] also!

** Why? Characters are characters! If you need a character, write the character in, and that's that. :) It doesn't matter if they're OC or anything else. :) There shouldn't be a distinction, or any special consideration BECAUSE of the distinction. And definitely don't weigh the character being in the story or not based on what READERS would think of them! It's your story, and yes if you need a character, make them that character. :)

** You must write the story you need to tell with the characters you need to use. Some people won't read stories with OCs. They aren't your target audience. Forget about them.

You will never please everybody and if you try you'll end up with a mess.

** I don't personally read OC-centric fics, and many people have a similar limitation, so you might notice a few people not reading it for that reason alone. In the HP fandom, however, there's a great number of people who absolutely devour OC-centric fics, so you may not need to worry in the same way you would in another fandom.

Don't think of it as a personal attack if someone says they don't read OC fic - some people just want to focus on canon characters when they read fanfiction, and by no means is it a declaration on their part that all OCs are bad, et cetera. Just down to personal preference.

** I don't read OC romance stories mostly, but then there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-With-Me][Grow Young with Me]].

In the end, it's all about the first chapter, I guess. If it feels like OC is replacing a canon character, most readers would leave the story immediately.

*** Understandable. There's no replacement in this case, though. There isn't a canon pairing for this person. I'm not sure I'd really call it a romance, either. It just happens to have a relationship in it.

**** Imo the relationship, and it's effect on Harry's recovery, is the entire plot of the story.

***** Ah, apologies, I should have been clearer. I was referring to the relationship in mine. It's there but it's there for the sake of the plot and there are other things going on, so it's not just focused on fluff. If that makes sense. I've never actually read the one you linked to.
