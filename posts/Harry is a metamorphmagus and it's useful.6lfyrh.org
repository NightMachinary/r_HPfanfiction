I mean, in many fics it's just a useless feature and Harry just, for example, dyes his hair and forgets about that (or this feature exists only to drag Harry and Tonks together).

I want Harry to really use it and even play with it. Have you seen many pictures-jokes about Tonks's being a metamorphmagus (for example [[https://goo.gl/mo3RVY]]) ? I want Harry to do just that. Or just for usual usefulness as he can use it for disguise (and maybe do some work for Order like Tonks? it's really useful for spies).


** The most useful use I saw was HP morphing functional gills for the 2nd task. (Which required extensive study of gills, and he only managed to pull it off because he was able to just copy his lung tissues for the most part).

This doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about gills to contest it.

**** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/q1jev/whats_the_difference_between_lungs_and_gills_that/c3tzr2q/]]

On a technical level they are similar. Gills have a lot more surface area to compensate for lower oxygen levels in water and don't work outside of water due to dehydration of the filament-like structure causing collapse and impaired function. Lung tissue is kept moist by the internal location and is supported by the muscle.

**** I'm in the same boat.

EDIT@DZCreeper: IIRC, the fic said something along those lines.

** Gives me a passing idea for "The Megamorphagus"

Olivander's second phoenix feather wand was stolen as a spare by Voldemort. Harry was not successfully matched with a wand. It's rare but it happens and there is protocol for this. He is excused from all wand related classes at Hogwarts. He latches on to his inborn abilities especially the shapeshifting.

He becomes very skilled but it's not enough. He begins to question why his ability has limits. He learns of Obscurials which he sees as a squib unlocking something inside themselves due to a state of mind. He determines he is limited because his mind is limited.

He starts doing anything to expand his mind. Things like having his friends freeze him with Petrificus Totalus and leave him in his bed while he strains against it as hard as possible. Forcing himself to endure unnatural levels of the emotional spectrum via various potions. Divination rituals that let the spirit temporarily leave the body. Basically anything he can think of that won't kill him as long as he is stronger for it.

You eventually wind up with someone who is combination of Tetsuo and Martian Manhunter. He would even learn the Obscurial transformation eventually.

** In my story(darkness ascendant) he's a minimal skilled one. He can affect the 'dead' parts of his body: hair and nails essentially and he's learning how to make his nails into pseudo-blades, using a potion to strengthen them so they don't get torn off when he has to use them as such in third and/or fourth year. When his friends learns about it one asks what he can do: he demonstrates the nail growth which is easy for him while hair growth is difficult for him and changing hair color requires him to concentrate on it and just looks like a thin sheen of the color on top of black hair.

** Not a Metamorphmagus!Harry fic but Teddy makes a good use of his ability in linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided) and it's an important part of the plot. Great next gen fic additionally.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** linkffn(Altered Histories by Acaykath) I have no idea if it's useful in this one, but it has a Metamorph!Harry.

linkffn(A Cloak and Dagger State of Affairs by Sage Ra) Alternate identities, at least.

linkffn(Nobody told Me the rules by Zaxaramas) Original Character instead of Harry, but useful metamorphing happens.

  They say that history is written by the victor. Harry finds that this is not the case, history is actually written by the manipulative old coot behind the victor, and this Harry is not going to let himself be stepped all over, unless of course Luna tells him to.
