** It'd be twisted if this reverse-trope actually makes those vulnerable more appealing in a veela's eyes: they get to dominate, control, and dictate the relationship.

...Ouch. Makes me wonder if this sort of thing has a department in the Ministry somewhere -- underfunded and understaffed. Or maybe it'd be a rarely seen DMLE thing.

** If it affected only a few people, it wouldn't be known as Veela allure. It would just be a Veela fetish, and everyone else would consider it weird.

*** Harry hustled away from Fleur, flushed, as Ron trailed behind him. As soon as they turned a corner, he whirled. "Did you see that? She used some kind of Veela magic on me. I could barely control myself!"

Ron looked bemused. "Harry, there's no such thing as Veela magic."

"But you just saw it." How could Ron be so blind?

"Look, she's attractive. I get it. But maybe you should, you know, tone it down a little around her." Harry looked at him, indignant.

"Ron, I'm telling you, she did something to me. As soon as I looked at her, it was like I couldn't think about anything else." Harry was desperate to make him understand.

Ron only looked uncomfortable now. "Maybe it's the Veela thing." Harry felt hope stirring. "Just look at Hagrid, you're obviously not the first bloke to have a thing for non-humans." Harry's mouth fell open, hope gone.

He tried one more time, half hearted. "There's got to be some kind of Veela magic. An allure of some kind?"

Ron looked at him incredulously. "I'm telling you for the last time, Harry. I grew up in the wizarding world, there's no Veela magic, no allure, nothing." He paused. "You're just a freak," he finished with a shrug.

Harry flinched. Maybe his Aunt Petunia was right, though she clearly never meant it in this context. Now that he thought about it, he'd never seen women of another species before. Gringotts only had male goblins that he knew of, and hags were, well, hags. Maybe he did have a thing for other non-humans. Intrigued in spite of himself, he slowly began walking down the corridor again, realizing they'd stopped.

He vaguely remembered seeing a dirty magazine with some interesting possibilities, one he'd ignored at the time. Maybe it was time to revisit. "Thanks, Ron," he said absently.

Ron just shook his head, muttering about "Of course he has a fetish" and "Can't do anything the normal way." Harry ignored him, thoughts preoccupied with more important things.

**** Harry warily approached a corner and peeked down the corridor. /Empty/. Exhaling in relief, he hurried along. Just a little farther, and he would be safely back in the common room.

Sneaking around had become routine after he so foolishly tried to ask Fleur out in the Great Hall and puked up his breakfast from sheer nerves. As she gaped at him in shock, he ran off without even offering an apology. Since then, he avoided her like the plague.

To make matters worse, she developed a disturbing tendency to linger in the vicinity of Gryffindor tower. Almost as if she was stalking him---but no, that would be absurd. He still dreamed of her every day, of her fair skin and glimmering hair and sky-blue eyes, but if she ever thought about him, it would be with disgust and contempt.

A hand touched his shoulder. "'Arry?"

He jumped. There she stood, the last person he wanted to see. "Fleur!" he cried, clutching his chest. "I---I didn't expect to see you here."

Even her frown was beautiful. "I 'ave been trying to find you for days, but you always disappear somewhere! I really need to talk to you, 'Arry."

"Oh." He swallowed. "Is this about what happened a week ago?"

"/Oui/." Her slender hand returned to his shoulder, as if she were afraid he would run off again. "I keep remembering it."

He ducked his head. "I'm so sorry. I must've eaten something bad---you must be totally disgusted---"

"Disgusted?" she asked. "/Non/, /non/. It was... um, how should I say... the 'ottest thing I've ever seen."

His head jerked up. "Wait, what?"

Fleur fidgeted, looking as nervous as he felt. "The other boys... they pay me compliments, bring gifts. But no one ever proposed to me as boldly as you, 'Arry." She bit her lip. "It was so manly."

He stared at her with his mouth ajar. She was still beautiful, but now that he looked from up close, there was something distinctly bird-like about her face.

"Er, manly?" he asked, shaking his head.

"/Oui/," Fleur breathed, her eyes locked onto him hungrily. He didn't recall her moving, but she seemed closer all of a sudden. "It's a bit embarrassing, but the veela 'ave, you could say, unusual standards. And you /certainly/ qualify, 'Arry. My answer's yes."

"Yes?" he asked dumbly.

"Yes, I accept your invitation." She glanced over her shoulder; something rustled under her robes by her shoulder blades. "/Zut/, you made my wings come out!" she said, blushing. "We better 'ide."

"Meep," Harry said as she yanked him bodily into the nearest broom closet.

** Veela are alpha /domCreatures and looking for their subs (which are rare) which is why they havean allure. Only Subs at affectedby it. At the World Cup the Veela there touch something in Harry. It wasn't until Fleur walked over to ask for food when Harry feels the need to submit to her. Which surprised everyone in Hogwarts because Harry won't submit to Snape or Dumbledore. Harry does everything for his Mistress and can't lie to her.

"Harry did you put your name in?" Fleur asks as Dumbledore and the four head of house was waiting for an fuck off when he answers no. Fleur explains that Harry is her sub and can't lie to her
