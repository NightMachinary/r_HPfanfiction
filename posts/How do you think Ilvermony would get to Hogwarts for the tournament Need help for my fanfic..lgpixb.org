** They'd be flying on bald eagles while red, white and blue fireworks would be exploding in the sky. When they'd land, they'd all simultaneously pull out a bacon cheeseburger in one hand and a gun in the other and proceed to take a bite out of the burger and shoot the gun in the air.

** I think you can honestly justify basically anything - a carriage is not /really/ particularly french to me, nor is a ship German/Scandinavian/Balkan/Eastern European (depending on how one views Durmstrang). So from canon, not really a huge deal to go with whatever you think would make for a fun entrance.

If you want it to be particularly american, a bus or car would make some sense. Otherwise, you can work it inot what you think Ilvermony is compared to Hogwarts (eg - what's your major differences between the two? Then pick a mode of transport that emphasizes that the most).

** My initial thought is that they would arrive in flying cars. I feel like when Rappaport's Law was lifted, the wizards of America would be very interested in No-Majs and their inventions, and would probably adapt quite a few to magic. And since we've already seen magically enhanced cars in the series, why not?

But do I think Ilvermorny would be part for the Triwizard Tournament? Probably not.

The Triwizard Torunament has historically been held between Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons, which is stated many times throughout the books. It seems like it's a very European thing. That, and you have the name Triwizard (a trio of wizards), so even the name would have to be changed, which feels unlikely for something that has been around for centuries. Europe is big on traditions, after all.

There is however the Wizarding Schools Potions Championship, which is the setting of the Wonderbook: Potions game. In the game the competing schools are Hogwarts, Mahoutokoro, Koldovdtoretz, and Uagadou, but is never mentioned that it's only those schools competing. Maybe that could be something?

Alternatively, maybe create a whole new sort of competition? Maybe something between just Hogwarts and Ilvermorny, like an Old World vs New World sort of thing?

** Thunderbirds, my friend. Thunderbirds can be found in Native American lore from One coast to the other. Maybe have a Hogwarts style train cart pulled by thunderbirds. Trains were the backbone of the country for a century.

** Flying sleds, pulled by bisons, a Native American magical form of transport?

Giant bald eagles, LOTR style?

Flying Ford Model T? Whose paint colours follow the principle of indeterminacy, only when you look at them they have a random colour, but always look black to Muggles?

** I always envisioned that there would be some international competition between the schools. For example, magic schools competing to see which schools were the best with academic games. I am not sure if North, Central and South American schools would be able to compete with the European schools for the Triwizard tournament. Just because that seems to be something that is more traditional with the three biggest magic schools in Europe.

But I suppose for fanfic that is exploring the possibility, that you could make some sort of magical method for the American school to get to England. Beauxbatons used a huge carriage pulled by Abraxan horses and Durmstrang had a magic ship. I tend to find that Americans are very showy... and I don't mean that in a bad way.

They would definitely want to leave a good impression, but they would also like to show off.

I always imagined that there would always be some light competition between the Americans and Canadians, though. And my head canon dictates that there would be a magic school in Canada... And I feel that North American schools would have some sort of games to play against Central or even South American schools.
