:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find a fic where Lily survives and leaves the country with Harry and Sirius. They eventually come back and Harry has an OC friend or a mentor who is a lord of an OC house. who is older than him, he is involved in a scene with Narcissa and i think with daphne in future chapters as well. Lily and Sirius are married I think. Potters are arranging parties where Harry is introduced as new Lod Potter and many ladies of Ancient houses meet with Harry and they interact. I know there is alot of vague descriptions but this is all I can remember. Hope somebody recognizes the fic
