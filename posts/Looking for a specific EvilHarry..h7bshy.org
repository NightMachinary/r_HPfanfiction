This one was crazy dark. Harry was evil an lead some sort of evil army made up of other Hogwarts students. Ginny was some sort of jester and killed Arthur and had his skull. There were some sort of beast tamers and people with flaming acid guns. They attacked Beauxbatons.

** Sounds like a pretty edgy "oooh, look how dark I can beeeee ! also pliz don't look at how OOC each and every characters I'm writing are" fic. I probably wouldn't have gone past the first line.

*** Yeah it definitely was. I read it when I first started getting into fan fiction and before I had standards. Was wanting to read it again to see how I remembered it.
