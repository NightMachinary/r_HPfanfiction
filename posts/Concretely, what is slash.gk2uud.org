I get the gist that it's linked to man/man, but is it just any kind of male main character ending up with another male or is it... something else?


** it's just gay male relationships

** If you're asking where the term comes from, it's from the early days of fanzines (printed fanfics that, yes, used to be sold in the days before the internet). The two character names were written as Kirk/Spock (one of the earliest slash pairings), etc. Eventually "slash" became shorthand for gay relationships because of the slash that was used between the two names.

** For me it's canonically neither gay nor bi male / male. If the canon doesn't provide enough or any information about character's preference, I assume them to be het.

** Slash is gay but from the time when it was neither taboo nor mainstream so (i) it was kinda edgy to have gay pairings in fanfic (ii) there wasn't enough queer representation in media so people tended to satisfy the need through fanfic

To some degree, this is all still true but less so than in the 00s

Doesn't matter if in canon the character fit under the LGBTQ+ umbrella or not.
