Like, instead of looking like James Potter but with Lily's eyes maybe its the reverse? Or an even blend of the two. Stories can also have James not being the father, but I just really want to read fics where Harry looks more like his Mum.

Any genre or ship is fine.

Thanks in advance!

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.
