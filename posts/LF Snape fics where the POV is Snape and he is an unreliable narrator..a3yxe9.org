I'm looking specifically for Snape in all his glory. His pettiness. His ability to hold onto grudges way past thier expiration date. His compulsive lying. His rage. His ability to shift blame onto everyone other than himself (except for the one time he owned it, too late though). His ability for snark and verbal bullying. And his utter contempt for anyone he believes to be magically and intellectually inferior to himself.

1. Snape has to be an adult and canon went the way it did. Potters dead. Snape realizes he was a dumbass, mourns Lily, doesn't change in the slightest other than swearing venegance. Story can start at any point after the Potter's death.

2. Either the POV has to be Snape in 1st person as an unreliable narrator (Rationalizing all his decisions to be an utter ass as they deserve it) or in 3rd person with a tounge in cheek humor, that also acknowledges that Snape is an outright ass, though he believes he isn't.

3rd. I'm fairly positive Snape is a Lily Sexual. As in is only attraction was to her, which was why he clung to her memory so hard and couldnt accept she "settled" for James (My headcanon)

4th. So I'd prefer it to be a Gen fic. If it comes with a pairing it CANNOT under any circumstances be Snape/Harry or Snape/Draco or Snape/Hermione and Snape/Ginny. Other than that go wild.

5th. It can be a oneshot or anything in between. Just so long as his characterization is consistent. You'll probably only find fics with Snape's core character like this to be in a comedic/humor fic, but that's perfectly fine.


** Bonus points if he believes, or comes around to believe, that it is Harry's fault that Lily died.

*** Drawing from his days after being personally summoned by Voldemort after 4th year and actually having to lie every day step of the way and convince the other Death Eaters (and Voldemort) he was truly loyal to Voldemort.

You don't think every time he was at a meeting he and the others (that escaped prison time) weren't getting routinely tested for loyalty? He'd have to be lying his ass off at every oppurtunity Voldemort commanded him to talk (Especially considering Voldemort knew he was in Dumbledore's confidence and knew many many many secrets) and spill the beans on the Order's plans while routinely doing the same thing to Dumbledore about Voldemort's plans. Too little information given about either and they suspect him of being divided in his loyalties and too much given and they suspect him of his loyalties.

Hence the lying he must have been doing. However, if this is before 5th year Snape then carry on. The only lying he'd be doing would be to himself.

** This fic was written pre Half Blood Prince so Snape's background is different, but it fits your main criteria otherwise:

linkffn(In Blood Only by E.M. Snape)

Snape's dialogue and inner thoughts are spot on. There is the sarcasm, pettiness and the dark dry humour that make Snape such an entertaining character to read about. He is quite an unreliable narrator who often makes morally questionnaible decisions. The interactions between him and Harry are hilarious even if they don't always end well due to them hating each other.

It is a Severitus fic, but it doesn't follow any of the usual cliches and has aged very well despite having an AU background for Snape.

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]
