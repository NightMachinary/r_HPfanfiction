Parvati seemed like a cool minor character and I want to read something that pairs her with Harry. Anything from if they got along well at the Yule Ball and decided to continue it, or whether they reconnect later in life.


** There's way too much Parvati/Padma bashing going on in several Dramione fics though. Why a good character must be villified in order to have a negative character become good, I have no idea. If nothing else, there's always old Voldy waiting to be included, folks!

*** Wait, there's legit bashing of background characters that have ten lines in 7 books?

I mean, you could write a split due to Indian marriage practices (one twin accepting that fate while the other rebels) or clashing friends but actually bashing both? Even if you don't like Parvati due to her fondness of Divination, that still leaves Padma. What is a believable scenario that gets her bashed? Potion Queen Molly has the tiniest bit of Canon background, but Padma says like three sentences. Just how?

**** So where is the background for Potion Queen Molly, also I think that sometimes people bash Parvati because she hangs out with Lavender. I haven't read many fics with Padma bashing though. Usually Padma is against her sister.

Edit : fixed a weird error with a question and an I.

Also edit : I'm pretty sure Molly and Arthur were joking when they were talking about love potions.

***** There was one scene (in GoF I think) when Mrs. Weasley was telling Ginny and Hermione a joke about love potions. Since love potion is just a fancy term for rape drug she was telling two underage girls (one of them 13 at most) jokes about rape drugs the conclusion is that she is comfortable with them. And I remember reading a line in German (I only read the books in German, I have not read a single fanfic in my native tongue so it has to be the books) in which Mr. Weasley is glad that Molly used a love potion on him to give him a "nudge in the right direction".

The fandom conclusion is that if she used them on her husband then she might as well help her children along. (And if you want to take things further: Since she is already brewing one type of control potion, why not several more?)

As for Parvati, it is probably due to her fondness for Divination and company of Lavender since they both come across typical teenage girls while Harry is fighting for his life.

  Harry's attraction to Parvati leads him to take his Yule Ball preparation much more seriously and his night is changed as a result. Includes an awesome Ron, an interesting Parvati and a drunk Katie Bell. Oh, and what's a Yule Ball fic without a little Fleur Delacour?

** This one is old, really old. I never see it recommended. I remember really enjoying it, however way back in 2003(!!!) when it was first written.

I'm going to go contemplate how old I am now.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/aerie22/DWMH.html][Dance With Me Harry by Aerie22]]: COMPLETED. During the summer after his fourth year, after Uncle Vernon beats Harry, the only thing that keeps him going is thinking about Hermione's kiss at the train station. But once the authorities intervene, he is sent to live among the Muggles, where he learns about life and love. But will this help him win Hermione's heart? Or will Voldemort strike first?

  What if Parvati didn't want to go dancing with that boy from Beauxbatons, and dragged Harry onto the dance floor instead? A simple action leads them both into a much darker destiny filled with romance, danger and prophetic visions. AU, Complete.

  Slightly AU, post-GOF. A Harry/Parvati epic. Civil war is coming to wizarding Britain, and Harry's role will be a complicated one. Very manipulative Dumbledore, with some revisions to early canon. Harry will have a backbone in this one. Rated M. Enjoy!
