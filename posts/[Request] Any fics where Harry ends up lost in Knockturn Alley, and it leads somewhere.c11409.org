I was just watching The Chamber of Secrets scene where he uses Floo Powder for the first time, and says "Diagonally" instead of "Diagon Alley". Ends up in Knockturn Alley, where he could have been taken by the criminals there if not for seeing Hagrid. It seems like a premise that could have lead somewhere.


** So... it doesn't exactly fit what you're looking for, but The Pureblood Pretense tackles the alleys that go beyond Knockturn Alley with a whole slew of different things. It's not the focus of the story by any means (it's a gender-bent Harry that has to switch places with her cousin to attend Pureblood-only Hogwarts). But the author does a good job of fleshing out the "lower alleys" and it's a pretty solid read. So far four books are out. Very slow updates, if I'm being honest. I think the Knockturn Alley stuff starts with the second book.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
