I was aware that most stories recycle ideas, but to read it all in one comprehensive list puts it into perspective how much plots/ideas are reused again and again. It also serves as a decent checklist for story quality or idea feasibility.


** Lucius Malfoy canonically not being on the Wizemgamot was a legitimate surprise to me. I think I'd just absorbed fanon for most if the Wizemgamot, including it being a legislative body. I like the idea of him not being on the Wizemgamot a lot though: it makes his close relationship with Fudge make more sense (since that's his main avenue for influence) and contributes to the idea of the Malfoys being noveau rich

******** Most of my issues with it are kind of petty - I hate the idea of the Sacred 28 and the reason for why the Potters aren't included, I hate the fact that historically all Potters are Good and all Malfoys are Bad, I really hate everything Rowling says about North America. It's stuff that doesn't directly contradict canon, but that I don't think meshes with canon very well at all.

And I'll just put it out here - I found Lupin's article insufferable. It read more like an idealized eulogy than anything else. Lupin in the book is one of the better adults, but he still has serious issues, and I felt that the article about his backstory purposely glossed over those flaws in favor of presenting the annoying pure fanon version of him. Pottermore has that problem a lot, actually. Rowling's world in the books feels textured and complex, but Pottermore feels like a post-Voldy War II propaganda version of the Wizarding World.

** tvtropes is great for stuff like this. But... not to sound like a smart-ass... but originality is kinda overrated. There's only so many places a hp fanfic can go and if it is truly completely original (at this point after years and years of millions of fanfics) it probably has very little to do with HP. Not to mention that these "I'm so clever"-fics never go anywhere after the first chapter(s). They often just exist for the unique idea and nothing else of substance.

*** The "I am so clever" fics are a trope or ten on their own. There is so much possibility for "original content" in the HP fandom by taking inspiration from other fandoms.

For example, Reaper artefact or Prothean beacon equivalents from Mass Effect, a Borg- or Flood-like antagonist, turning Harry into an Anakin-like tragic (anti)hero. Mind-controlling aliens like in Freelancer, predecessor civilisations, hell turn Ginny into a Shepard equivalent and have her kick ass with Harry in a supporting role against the Order of the Assassins.

You don't need to come up with plots that no human ever thought of, but you can write very creative HP fanfics by combining other, rarely used ideas.

I was working on a "Late to Hogwarts" type fic, but while I admit my OC may be pushing it being a spell inventor and everything, I think my idea was quite decent because it was set 5 years after Voldemort (properly) died and his parents had escaped from England because his mother was Muggleborn. So I wanted to explore that aspect of the story, his guilt that his parents didn't stay and fight like the parents of the other students, even if nobody directly bullies him about it except perhaps a Gryffindor or two...
