Basically, the overall plot of the Red Dwarf episode [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Echoes][Future Echoes]], but tweaked to make it happen at Hogwarts. Bonus points if one of the echoes seen involves an older Harry and [insert potential love interest here] locked in a deep and intimate embrace for all to see and be embarassed by.


** "Shit Daph, I thought you said the Great Hall would be empty at this time of day!"

Daphne scrambled for her clothes, one hand trying to give her some semblance of modesty as she muttered curses. "It's supposed to be! Everyone's supposed to be in class, and the rest of the parents are stuck in that meeting with Professor McGonagall!"

"You're the bloody potions teacher! You're supposed to know! Bloody hell, if Rosey and Queenie find out, you know we're gonna have to buy them that pony they want, right? And that's so our darling girls would even speak to us!"

She chucked his boxers at him, leaving them to catch and hang on his ear. "At least we can say they'e gonna be big sisters?"

He froze, one hand half-raised. "You mean---?"

The scene abruptly vanished.

Across the Great Hall, Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass stared at one another, but contrary to the typical looks of irritation or dislike they shared, both looked on the other with disbelief and horror.

** Eighth year was supposed to be normal.

Emphasis on the words ‘supposed to be'.

Harry wasn't supposed to look up from his charms textbook to see himself standing in the front of the room. He jumped, nearly knocking over a bottle of ink all over Greengrass, but caught it at the last moment. Greengrass looked up from the parchment she'd been drawing on, frowning, but did a double take as she noticed the second, older Harry.

“What the hell,” she breathed out.

Even if he could answer that, anything he would have said died in his throat as a second, older Greengrass suddenly appeared, leaning back in the chair Flitwick would usually have a stack of pillows to sit on. Soon enough it wasn't just them seeing these...ghosts didn't seem to be the right word here...visions (?) as everyone else in the room looked up as the older him started speaking, “I don't know how Skeeter found out, Daph. I came here as soon as I saw the bloody article in the Prophet.”

/Daph?/

The older Greengrass pinched the bridge of her nose. “But not before the Howler I got from Tori. Which ensured that everyone in the Great Hall knows now.”

The older Harry frowned in confusion. “Your sister is angry about us? Draco and I aren't still-“

“Oh no, she wasn't angry. She was thrilled. I believe the phrase ‘it's about time' might have been used, but it was hard to hear over Narcissa's scream of rage.” Despite the general tiredness in her voice, her mouth pulled into a smile and woah, Greengrass had a nice smile. “I expect to get a gift in the post from Astoria any day now. Tori loves anything that makes her mother in law lose her mind.”

Harry thought Malfoy made a strangled sounding noise but he was too busy staring at the older versions of himself and Greengrass to notice. The older him slowly smirked and said, “Still I'm sorry it came out that way. There must be something I can do to make up for it, Professor.” Older Harry's voice sounded husky as he said ‘Professor'.

Greengrass tensed next to him and he couldn't look at her.

The older Greengrass arched an eyebrow, though not before giving the older him a look that made his face feel like it was on fire. “I'm sure I can think of something by tonight, Mr Potter. I'll see you in detention.”

“If that's what it takes, Professor,” the older him said, before bending down to kiss older Greengrass, who deepened the kiss before the two blinked out of existence. There was complete silence for a long moment before the class broke out into laughs, wolf-whistles and commentary like ‘Damn, Harry' and ‘Go Daph'.

Greengrass leaned forward and rested her head against the desk. “Kill me now,” she moaned.

“Only if you kill me first,” Harry echoed.

I thought the point behind prompt posts was to encourage the creation of new stories, so yes.

** Lily Evans sat quietly in the library doing her Transfiguration homework. She didn't think the fifth year could be that difficult, and she had had problems with this particular subject from the third year anyway. Sighing, she picked up another ancient-looking book about turning man into animal. She knew they didn't really write about an Animagus, but there was nothing in the library that didn't mention this ability to a small degree, and still most of the ones she found described exactly how to become an Animagus, not how to turn a human into an animal for a while.

Frustrated, she almost hit the table with her crap, but was interrupted by loud footsteps and Mrs. Pince's scream ("Young man is not running in the library!"

She looked at the newcomer, and this was none other than Marlene McKinnon. Despite the fact that they had shared a dormitory together for a long time, they had never become great friends, so she was surprised to see him standing over her, her cheeks flushed, panting as if she had run a mile.

"You have to come with me Lily!" she said, "And it's really fast. Something is happening in the hallway."

Sighing, she picked up her roll of parchment and tried to tuck it away, but Marl shook her shoulder.

"Never mind. Seriously, it'll be over soon and you won't have anything to report.

The girls ran out of the room to the accompaniment of the annoyed grunts of their colleagues and the indignant gaze of the old librarian.

Honestly, Lily didn't know what she was expecting. Fights between students? Another Marauder joke? Or maybe another, God forbid, Potter and Black's abuse of Severus?

But she certainly did not expect what she saw.

She didn't know what it was. The people didn't look like ghosts, but they weren't particularly alive either. It was like a hazy memory from a Pensieve. The crowded students stared at it, held still and, surprisingly, Evans also found that she could not move.

But the ghost memories kept moving.

"Honestly Harry!" she screamed, a brunette with bushy hair and long front teeth. The redhead noticed who the girl was talking to and if she could move, she would freeze.

The boy looked like a younger and decidedly lower version of James Potter with her eyes. She was absolutely sure of it, even though she would never come closer than three meters to Potter.

The boy grimaced at her and sighed in exasperation

"We've already talked about this, Hermione." he replied calmly, "No, I won't go over to Ron. It's not my problem that he can't contain his jealousy for something I haven't even done!"

Hermione-girl rolled her eyes.

"Yes, I know. But you both miss each other, and besides, First Assignment is approaching! What if something happens to you? We haven't even started getting ready.

And as if nothing had happened, everything was gone, and Lily's eyes blurred and then cleared.

She didn't know what it was, but something had certainly /changed/.

---------------------------------------

I honestly don't know any fic that would fit this, but I had a pretty good time writing this. I apologize in advance for any mistakes, repetitions etc. English is my second language and I am still learning it.
