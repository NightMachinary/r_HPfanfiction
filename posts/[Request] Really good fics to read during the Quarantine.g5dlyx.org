I'm looking for any good fics (doesn't matter whom, what, when, where) as long as it's entertaining. I'm indifferent to most ships.


** Not sure what you are looking for, but my standard list recommendations is:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11517506/1/][Northumbrian series]] starting with linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian) and then go on (you can return to the earlier ones later, but they are mostly not as good as his post-war works)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/White_Squirrel/pseuds/White_Squirrel/works?fandom_id=136512][White_Squirrel]] both the large series (Arithmancer and The Accidental Animagus), but don't miss the smaller works, they are excellent as well.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]]'s three stories ... it is very much adult writing (not porn, but I don't think the theme will be of interest to teenagers)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]] ... on its face it is Dudley-has-a-magical-daughter story, but it is a way different from anything you read in the post-war world.

  Over fifty people died at the Battle of Hogwarts. There are dozens of stories of loss, betrayal, heroism and sacrifice. These are some of those stories.

** Fate is a four letter word by Philo linkao3(4267422)

It is a story about 40+ year old Harry with adult kids. Harry has a career as a carpenter, Lily is still in Hogwarts but Al and James are graduated. To outsiders he is happily married to Ginny, but it soon becomes clear in the story that their marriage is long over and that Ginny has somebody else in her life.

Ginny gets murdered and Harry and his friends and family need to catch Ginny's killer. To the ministry it is an old tale of jealousy and a love gone wrong, while Harry and his friends quickly suspect political motives.

Many are put-off by the main pairing and while I was aware of the fic, I generally hit the back button myself for years, especially seeing the length and the fact that at the time it was unfinished. But this is unjustified.

Normally threesomes are written bc the author could without considering whether they should, thus they tend to be an utter disaster. Not in this case.

It actually helps push the plot along, it gives a valid reason for Kingsley to be there and explains some changes in Snape. Snape is simply not the person he was at the Battle of Hogwarts, he had time, reason and opportunity to change. In this regard you could call him a bit OOC bc he is not the hateful bastard, but it works.

It is a great "who-dun-it" and "catch the conspirators" with plenty of plot twists, but I absolutely love it for its portrayal of the characters as real adults with real adult problems.

Over 525k words and completed. Slash.
