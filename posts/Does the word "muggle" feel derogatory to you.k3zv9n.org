Just wondering, as I've seen so many fics preferring terms such as "mundanes" or "non-magicals".


** Tbh mundanes feels more derogatory to me.

non-magicals and mundanes might just be a new phrase people want to try out.

But could also be like you are used to seeing maybe in fic purebloods avoiding using mudblood but say muggle in a derogatory or demeaning way. So prefer using a word you have seen used like that less.

** I don't and, honestly, it's tiring seeing people thinking a word which is explicitly said to be the pc/correct term being derogatory. The whole point of the word is that it's universal for non-wizards but complete gibberish for those not in the know because the magical world has this small thing - insignificant, really - that's called the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.

*** I heard someone say that one word becomes offensive because of the attitude to what the word suggests at, and it's not solved by removing the word. The word is not the problem. It's our idea of what the word means. So we think changing the word changes our attitude, but we just replace the word, and eventually, that becomes offensive or "not as polite". So we keep replacing the words while our attitudes are often not changed.

*** Hagrid practically used it as a slur in the first book, though.

#+begin_quote
  "A Muggle," said Hagrid, "is what we call nonmagic folk like them. An' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on."
#+end_quote

The way he explains it makes it sound that "Muggle" stands for "non-magic person that hates magic." He could be referring to Vernon's weight, but that wouldn't make sense about Petunia, who's stick-thin. And he said "like them," no doubt referring to their bad attitude about magic.

**** To be fair, it was used correctly in this instance.

It means non-magical, which has economic, cultural and social implications stemming from differences between the two societies. Dursleys being so rigid and fundamentally opposed to supernatural, I'd not be surprised if they triggered an 'uncanny valley' effect in Hagrid. After all, physically you can't tell a muggle from wizard... Usually. And then you see the Dursleys, almost robotic.

​

Add in the look of the house in Privet Drive, compare and contrast with other magical locations... And you basically get a white room in a hospital, possibly a mental one.

** No worse than the word "black". As in, yes it can be used in a derogatory way, but can also used neutrally as a simple descriptor.

** I feel that it is normally used when wizards(/witches) are comparing the magical and non-magical, and so for me has become associated with that prejudice in some ways. In the same way that there is the conveyer belt of what is a racist slur, words pick up subtext from the context that they are commonly used in. It also just feels a bit condescending the other 5 billion + (depending on the date) humans in the world have no say in their own name.

** Honestly, I use "mundane" or "non-magical" in one of my fics because it sounds fancier and more appropriate coming from certain characters. Muggle sounds kind of...almost slang. Not derogatory, but, yeah, slang is the best word I can come up with to describe that.

*** That's because it /is/ based on a slang term, and a vaguely derogatory one. "Mug" means "gullible person".

** No.

It is a word an insular society uses to call outsiders. As an outsider, I will not hear it unless I am trespassing, so they could call me a Pink Huffalump for all I care. Add to that, Muggle as a word does not have any other meaning than "native non-magical" and is much less of a mouthful.

Besides, if Amish can call every non-Amish "English", regardless of country of origin, ethnicity or anything else... Why could the wizards, whose communities work in a similar enough manner, not? Fair's fair, and since they mostly keep their business away from muggle folks, it's none of mine.

** I honestly don't. Of course if someone's saying it in a way it's obviously supposed to make the person/people feel/seem lesser (such as a death eater talking about muggles) then that's another thing but the word itself isn't too me.

** I don't find Muggle offensive at all. Maybe i just have a thick skin. Muggle honestly feels a bit like being called a ‘Muppet', which is someone who makes a silly mistake, and there's no real harm in it. Example, my old maths teacher used to say to me ‘Ach yer a muppet' of I'd copied something wrongly. As a few others have pointed out, Muggle comes from Mug, a gullible person, but in my experience, it's never been particularly derogatory. There are much worse words you could use, that have worse implications. It's why i don't like terms like ‘Mundane' or ‘Non-magical' or ‘No-maj';

Where once there were terms that were derogatory in the weakest way, but they were also vaguely affectionate, now it feels cold and clinical, and its worse.

From my own experience,

Its like you can call me a ‘spaz' ‘spastic' ‘autistic' ‘disabled' because I am an Autistic Spastic Diplegic. The words aren't offensive to me. Doesn't mean you should use them as a slur, but they aren't inherently offensive, its all about tone.

Whereas, I would get offended if you called me ‘Handicapped', ‘Crippled' or god forbid the new one that seems to be popular in certain circles ‘differently abled' and not even sure how to feel about the term ‘neurotypical'

** I personally don't like the word Muggle. It feels like not human. but then we use wizard and witch words so there isn't much difference.

it would be better if they use non-magical and magical. then use man - woman as describing non magical human's sex; wizard - witch when describing magical human's sex.

Muggle does feel derogatory and otherizing (is that a word?). we often see magical people sayibg muggle as if saying animal, we even see light wizards and witches like Molly, McGonagall, maybe Hagrid saying muggle like that.

** Yeah. "Non-magical" sounds better and is more respectful. It's the n-word vs coloured vs black vs African-American debate. They all mean the same thing, yes, but it's the difference between being called "old-fashioned", "PC" or "racist".
