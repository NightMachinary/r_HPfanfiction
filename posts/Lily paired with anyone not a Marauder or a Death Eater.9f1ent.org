Basically, any story where Lily is paired with someone other than one of the Marauders or someone from Voldemort's camp (that includes Riddle, Malfoy and Snape).

I am sick and tired of the James/Lily fics which follow the basic rom-com plot where misunderstandings and denial are half the plot or stories which paint Snape as poor, misunderstood kid and not the weird +gun+ dark arts boy.

For example, something like "Rune Stone Path" would be nice, just without Harry having a harem as the main plot.

Resurrection, Lily/Flitwick, femslash, hell incest is fine with me, just give me something with Lily and a rare pairing.


** linkao3(They Didn't Know We Were Seeds) is a good fic but Lily's romance is in no way the central focus. Also, Snape and Lily are together for a couple chapters but it doesn't last.

  'I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--?' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all?'
