Nefarious uses of the polyjuice potion.

The imperius is forbidden for a reason...

And once we get info fanon territory... Oh boy.

When we were kids we dreamt about receiving our Hogwarts letter.

Can you get me fics that make me happy it doesn't exist?


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10561940][The Lost Children]] gives a darker spin on Hogwarts that is both scary and facinating. I wish this were longer; I'd like to explore the idea a little more. Another fic that has an interesting spin on the Castle's magic is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/319257/chapters/513333][At Your Service]]; the mystery and the romance blend together to create a really compeling story if you don't mind slash.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/][The Eyes]] legit scared me, so I think it fits the whole "happy it doesn't exist" thing.

*** Oh, I read the eyes. Cthulhu has no business in the Potterverse. Luckily.

The other two are new to me, thanks!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]] gets rec'd a lot, but it is both good and dark.

If you're a muggleborn in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/][Patron]] then things are going to suck once you get your letter.

Speaking of things sucking for muggleborns (and everyone else), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]] has got mind-controlled child soldiers, Grindelwald running around doing.... things, and some other nasty things that I won't reveal here.

The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/][Firebird trilogy]] is.... weird. Like really weird. It's got that proper grimdark going for it, though.

Out of the fandom, I would also recommend [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/bonds-1-1/][Pact]] by Wildbow. This story gets both ridiculously intense and ridiculously dark. It is one of the few stories I have ever had to stop reading for a while just because of how much the writing (specifically the Abyss arc) affected me as a reader. Magic in it is less wand-waving and more Lovecraftian demon summoning, and, like any proper heir to the O.G. H.P., Pact magic is dark, creepy, and filled with deep, existential, and psychological horror.

** First thing that comes to mind is Lazarusquince's [[https://lazarusquince.tumblr.com/stepfather][Stepfather AU]], which goes into the dubious ethics of love potions. It's a rather poorly formatted tumblr page, but the links are arranged in order :/
