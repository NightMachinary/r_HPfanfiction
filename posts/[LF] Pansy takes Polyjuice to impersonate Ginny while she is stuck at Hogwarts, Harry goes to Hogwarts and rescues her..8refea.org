Pansy takes Polyjuice to impersonate Ginny while she is stuck at Hogwarts, Harry goes to Hogwarts and rescues her. I think Harry saw her on the Mauraders Map and that's why he knew to save her. Pansy impersonates Ginny on the Hogwarts express while over the Yule Holidays and is discovered by Ginny's friends.

This is the only scene I can remember and its driving me crazy. Thank you in advance!
