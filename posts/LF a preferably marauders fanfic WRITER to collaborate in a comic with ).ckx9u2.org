Hi! I'm Waloph, i'm a comic artist and i'm looking for someone whom writes marauder fanfic ( Jily and Wolfstar ) to make a comic together. Preferably a short fic ( 1 to 5 ch). If you want to see my stuff you can look in wallopthewicked.tumblr.com Hope someone want to collab, i swear it will be fun !!

I'm open to doing other kind of ships or times :) Thanks for reading


** Nice art. What do you mean by collaborate? Write a story to order, or would you base a comic on a preexisting story?

I wrote this little canon-compliant Marauders one-shot, but you might not like it since it's not Wolfstar:

*** I can work with a preexisting story but it should have wolfstar cause i draw that a lot and the few people that follows me like that ship. We could make a few modifications tho, if you are willing, of course :)
