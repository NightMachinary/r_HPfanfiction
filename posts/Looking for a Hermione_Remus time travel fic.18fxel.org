I'm looking for a fanfic I read months ago but that I unfortunately can't find anymore. I found it on [[http://www.fanfiction.net/]] and it was a fairly long one with the pairing Hermione/Remus. It was a time travel fic, but I'm not sure how the time travelling happened. A lot of it is very blurry for me, but I'll mention the things I'm almost totally sure about:

- Hermione falls in love with Remus in the past, and ends up pregnant. She is still pregnant when she comes back to the present.
- Remus doesn't really remember Hermione in the present, or rather, deliberately has "forgotten" about her. I'm almost completely sure that he keeps a box of memories or sorts in the attic, but I'm not 100% sure. I have a faint memory that Hermione finds this box and among other things an old shirt that belonged to Remus..
- Remus is marrying Tonks and she is also pregnant, but later it turns out that it is Kingsley's child.
- Sirius is alive in the present and remembers Hermione, and when he returns and hugs Hermione he can feel a small baby bump and asks Remus when the bundle of joy is due, and he says something (but he's speaking about Tonks, not Hermione). Sirius gets confused before he realizes that Remus doesn't remember Hermione and is together with Tonks.
- Eventually it all clears up somehow and I think Tonks gets married to Kingsley.

I realize that this might be difficult, but perhaps someone knows what I'm talking about and can tell me the title of the story or maybe just details from the story. I'd be extremely grateful.


** I don't know what this fic is, but I'm willing to help search for it!

Can you give any more information?

Was it completed? About what rating would it have been? Was it popular/did it have many reviews? Were there author's notes that might help identify it?

Do you have any idea when it was published? Do you remember how you found it? When you say "fairly long," about how long do you mean?

Anything you can add can help! No guarantees I'll find it, of course, but I'll give it a shot. Sounds distinctive enough to be fairly easily found.

EDIT: could this be it? I see mentions of a box, and Kingsley and Tonks are together... [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3765145/1/To%20Let%20You%20Go]]

EDIT EDIT: I'm almost certain it's what you're looking for.

  But pressing herself so close to him, her belly is pressed into his stomach and his eyes widen as he feels the hard curve of her stomach. His arms hold hers tight as he lengthens her grip around his shoulders and pulls her upper body out in front of him so that he can look at her face.
