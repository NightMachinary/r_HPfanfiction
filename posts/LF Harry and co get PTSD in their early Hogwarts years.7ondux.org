So I was thinking, would a eleven year old (especially one who came from an abusive family) really be able to handle the events in the first two-three books without some scars? Basically looking for fics where Harry (and to a smaller note Ron, Ginny, and Hermione) are plagued by the fact they were in many near death situations (especially with the basilisk and dementors).

Not a chance lol.

The double faced man with red eyes? Swarm of giant talking spiders? Giant serpent hunting and hissing about how it's going to kill you? Literal swarm of flying soul devouring misery /demons/?

It's a normal trope, and honestly: Every fic that ever did it got very boring very fast, at least to me. I love some personal drama, don't get me wrong, for example Exile was a very good story in my opinion - however, therapy as portrayed is just bland to read.

** An average 11 year old? No. Some 11-year-olds? Yes. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience][Psychological resilience is a thing.]] It's not really fully understood why, but yes, some people are able to come out of traumatic situations essentially emotionally unscathed where a normal person would be a basket case. Harry certainly counts as such a person.

In so far as psychological resilience is based on possessing certain coping mechanisms to process your experiences, as well as the development of certain mindsets (such as the belief that no matter what happens to you that is beyond your control, you are still capable of choice and the exercise of free will), Harry having grown up in the environment he did was probably actually what made him develop those mechanisms and mindsets before he got to Hogwarts. (Of course this is not to say all people from an abusive environment are psychological resilient - they aren't).

Ron and Hermione are harder to explain.

*** *Psychological resilience*

Psychological resilience is defined as an individual's ability to successfully adapt to life tasks in the face of social disadvantage or other highly adverse conditions. Adversity and stress can come in the shape of family or relationship problems, health problems, or workplace and financial worries, among others. Resilience is the ability to bounce back from a negative experience with "competent functioning". Resilience is not a rare ability; in reality, it is found in the average individual and it can be learned and developed by virtually anyone.

** Literally watching a man dissolve into dust then having the spirit of your parents murderer run straight through you body should've been enough to screw Harry up for years. Same with fighting and killing a basilisk and being possessed by a diary. Same with having your parents murderer turn out to be your godfather and innocent, then watching him start to die, go back in time, and save him, only to watch him leave your life again.

The events of every year should've fucked up the main characters beyond belief. Unfortunately, I've never actually seen a fic that shows this well.

** To be fair, I'm pretty sure Harry living in a cupboard for 11 years should have psychologically messed him up really bad anyway. I don't know much about child development, but I know enough that a child that has limited socialization and interaction for the first few years most likely will become mentally and socially stunted. Of course... then there wouldn't be much of a Harry Potter story (and it was written for a younger audience).

I do think it would be interesting to read a fic like you're suggesting, though.

**** I haven't read that yet. It's been in my bookmarks for awhile, though. x_x I skimmed it a bit, and it seems like it had that premise, but... not quite hit the realities of it? I mean limited people interaction from 15 months to around 5-6 years old is a huge gap of learning that's missed. Not to mention if Harry was withdrawn and didn't socialize with other class mates during school, that would also have a negative effect. Plus, the trauma of seeing your parent murdered in front of you seems like it would have set back his development a lot. (Some sources if anyone is particularly inclined, thought doubtful... [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702123/][first]], [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800115/][second]], [[https://academic.oup.com/bmb/article-pdf/53/1/185/802675/53-1-185.pdf][third]]

But again, mind you, this is a fiction story. And I have personally never known anyone that was as deprived as Harry in the story (on the surface and what can be interpreted), so this is all my assumptions based on what I know and based on my own assumptions of how bad Harry was actually neglected. (I think fanfiction as a tendency to make me think it was worse than it seemed in canon.)

** The only fic in which counseling and therapy are mentioned in early years is the non-magical [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. For example, because of its setting, the Troll was replaced by 12 armed assassins split in 4 teams. Teachers and the securities were contending with 3 other teams, while the Trio faced the last one. Ron hacked one guy into two pieces with a fire axe, Harry killed one with a combat shotgun, and Hermione blew the last guy's head off with an assault rifle at point blank range.

They had to take part in intensive counseling for the rest of the term.

Hermione in this story got into Hogwarts not because she had some special powers, but because she turned vigilante to avenge her murdered best friend and drove a serial killer-rapist into suicide via [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting][Gaslighting]]. However, she made a mistake and left evidence behind, so the government gave her the option to attend an elite spy school named Hogwarts, or go to prison.

Throughout the story, she often questioned herself whether she was truly a psychopath, given her lack of remorse for the people she had killed over the years.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
