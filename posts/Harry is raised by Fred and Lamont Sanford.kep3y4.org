Harry helps smooth out Fred's ugly, sharp edges and helps Lamont put his life in perspective (working in the junk business and having an annoying dad isn't that bad compared to being an abused orphan). Fred teaches him how to wheel-and-deal, and Lamont teaches him how to stand up for himself and recognize value that other people would ignore.

I can just imagine Malfoy making a racist comment and getting his face beat in.


** Tell Voldemort with his snake looking ass that he is one big dummy. And another thing you see that Malfoy you tell him I'm gonna put 5 across his lip if he keep talkin.

** Given it's Britain, [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057785/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1][Albert and Harold Steptoe]] are more likely (they were the inspiration for Sanford and Son). However, as that series is too early, perhaps it would be Harold and his son, instead. I can still hear Harold saying, "Why, you dirty old man!"

*** Well, the "Vernon takes a business trip to America" is a pretty common trope in my fanfictions.

**** I actually enjoy that trope (and the "Dursleys go to Japan" one for anime crosses). It was more of a "why would you need to take Harry to be raised by US junkmen when there are quite satisfactory British junkmen available" question.

For a while, Norman Lear had a habit of making successful US versions of popular British comedies ("All in the Family" was another one he "borrowed"), but he's not the only one. Related, I find it amusing that the Japanese show that America's Funniest Home Videos was inspired by only lasted about 6 years, while the US show has been on the air for more than 30.

They're not junkmen, they are "salvage and recovery" people.
