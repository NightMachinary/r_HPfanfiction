We are working a satirical Harry Potter album ranging from rap to celtic, to metal styles.

This one is about the Dumbledore meme when he "asked Harry calmy" about the goblet of fire. However in the movie, it was not asked so calmy. Look up the meme if you haven't seen it before xD

That is the third result I get on youtube search if I type Dumbledore

** Top notch video, flailing hands almost made me spit my drink.

Also, I'm a big sucker for rhyme so here's what I think might have rhymed better...

--------------

Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire\\
Did you put your name in Harry?!?!\\
Did you know your life would be in serious danger\\
Cuz these challenges are batshit *scarry*

[Bonus points if you pronounce the -arry in scarry exactly like the one in Harry. It's a pun on scary, on scarry (scar-like) and rhymes with Harry.]

Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire\\
Or was this just an anomaly\\
Did you put your name in the ******* goblet\\
I'm asking you calmly

[Closest I could get to rhyming calmly]

*** Haha, good I'm glad you got such a good laugh out of it!

That is a nice rhyme too! Don't think I'll be redoing this one anytime soon, but I love input for future ideas, so thank you üé∂üòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èüé∂
