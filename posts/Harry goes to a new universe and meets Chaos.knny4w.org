:END:
I believe this was a fic set in the Percy Jackson universe, where Harry had left his universe after the final battle and went to a new one, meeting Chaos when he got there and becoming her Order. I /think/ that in the King's Cross afterlife he was sentenced by Death, Magic, and Time, but I'm not sure about that. He essentially was the creator of the universe.


** When you do find it, please link, that sounds great!
