I was reading linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion) and it was hilarious! Are there any more stories like this? Or similar, like someone else's name comes out because Harry took steps to prevent his name from coming out?

Crack fics, regular fics, etc?

** The unfinished, but slowly progressing "The Scourge from the North" by Cal aka doghead_thirteen on the yahoo group CaerAzkaban has this as a continuing background plot. Don't think he's posting it anywhere else, but they're pretty lenient about who all they let in to read and post.

** Linkffn(Weres Harry) he placed his own ward line around the Goblet to change any slip with his name on it to say Draco Malfoy, and then rigged it so each school got three champions.

Since Dumbledore couldn't prove it was Harry who tampered with the Goblet, his "punishment" was to be the host and master of ceremonies.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

** Any other suggestions? Something like Were's Harry idea of Harry rigging the goblet so his name doesn't come out would also be cool!

  When Harry offered himself up to Voldemort, he discovered the people in the Ministry of Death are not happy with him at all. To make up for his years of blunders, Harry is sent back in time to correct everything that went wrong and to get some revenge. Harry/6 girls, Bashing of Dumbledore, Snape, and certain Weasleys. Written for humor only. Lots of cliches. Reviews welcome.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
