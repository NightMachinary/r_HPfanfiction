What are your thoughts and headcanons on sex toys, paraphenalia, spells, pornography and the like in the wizarding world? How do you think they feel about sex, culturally?

Where the fuck do these magic kids get their sex ed? From their parents? McGonagall? Snape? A special autumn tutorial from Molly Weasley?

And what fics do you feel have the most imaginative and interesting approach to wizarding sex and the culture around it?


** I'm sure there's lots of stuff to consider on this topic, but I ended up thinking about Portkeys and sex a while back...

I've wondered about whether Portkeys can take secondary passengers. At the start of GoF, everyone had to touch the boot to the QWC -- nine people, squeezing around -- suggesting that each individual has to have direct contact with the Portkey, but at the end Harry is able to take Cedric by only holding his wrist. Is this because Cedric was dead, so the Portkey registered him as an inanimate object, like clothing and the bags everyone had at the QWC? If it is possible to travel by Portkey just by having contact with someone who touches the Portkey, what happens when two people are having sex and one of them touches the Portkey?

How much contact do the two people have to have for the secondary person to get pulled in? Harry only holds Cedric's wrist, which suggests not very much. So two people engaged in penetrative sex are probably both going to get pulled along.

What about for oral? Assuming mouths and genitals are the only things in contact, is that enough to for the Portkey to pick up the second person? Does it work for fellatio but not cunninglingus? If so, how far in someone's mouth does the person receiving fellatio need to be in order for it to work? Does it work for cunninglingus if the giver is pressed close enough, perhaps if they're pushing their tongue inside? What about fingering? Again assuming fingers/genitals are the only point of contact, how many fingers, or how deep do they need to be, for the Portkey to pick them up?

How does using a Portkey during sex (with both parties coming along) affect pleasure? I imagine it'd be really weird, but maybe there's a certain pleasure in it. How does it feel if a condom or sex toy is the Portkey? Can a person be brought to orgasm purely through the sensation of a Portkey on their genitals? Is there a sect of witches and wizards using Portkeys for masturbation?

If a Portkey doesn't pick up living secondary passengers, how weird must it feel to be having sex, of any sort, and then to suddenly not be?

** As far as sex-ed is concerned, they likely get the talk from their parents at some point, but it is also probable that the school nurse may give a one time lecture at some point (likely at least by the start of 3rd year when puberty has kicked in and students would likely start dating) just to make sure they are all on the same page. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised by her teaching/providing contraceptive spells/potions.

As for wizarding attitudes towards sex: Hogwarts is a very big, mostly empty castle full of horny teens with little adult supervision. Combine this with the likelihood that wizards have probably had effective contraceptive options for centuries, the fact that they culturally diverged from muggles long before the relatively prudish Victorian Era, a female population capable of effectively asserting their equality, and all the kinky bedroom possibilities magic would provide, you get a culture that is in all likelihood very sexually liberal and non-discriminatory even by today's standards.

That of course doesn't even begin to address any potential physiological differences that being magical my have on one's sex drive, performance, puberty, etc. Something interesting to think about is what is sex like in a world where magicals are capable of sensing magic and magic is closely tied to emotions.

** I think that there are a lot of issues in wizard sex that aren't present in normal sex.

1. Consent - Whether love potions, imperius curse, etc., the wizarding world has methods that, at least on the surface, seem to violate consent more readily than roofies.

2. Partners - there is some potentially cross-species breeding going on in the wizarding world, whereas it doesn't happen, or at least it doesn't produce viable offspring, in the normal world. There are half-giants (Hagrid), half-goblins (Flitwick), and part-Veela (Fleur). For normal humans, there aren't any non-human sentient species that are regularly subjected to sex acts. I know the jokes about certain cultures and kilts and sheep...

3. The potential for trying new things - It seems very possible that the use of polyjuice during sex could be a thing in the wizarding world, likewise with charmed sex toys

** As far as Hogwarts is concerned, I'm mostly convinced that the pumpkin juice includes anti-pregnancy effects, possibly including a horniness suppressant. Otherwise, having every teen in your culture trapped in one place for ten months of the year would lead to regular population booms and a lot of young pregnancies.

Instead it seems like everyone starts getting married right after leaving school, but having babies is sometimes delayed by a few years -- as if the pumpkin juice had to work its way out of their system.

*** A large part of the sexual liberation in our world can probably be related to reliable and more ubiquitous methods of contraception - especially for women (the pill).

If contraception is as simple in the magical world as you - and many other fanfic authors describe it - (also it probably has been like this for a long time) I doubt there'd be lots of (if any) stigmatisation of sexual relations. Why would they want or need to dose their children without their consent? Considering that their culture would also lack most of the sexual repression through the Christian faith why would they be opposed to their children exploring their sexuality in a more or less controlled setting? Especially the older pureblood houses would probably encourage them to use their sexuality as political capital.

** For starters there is of course a charm/potion to prevent unwanted pregnancies. This even has some historical background, given that mixtures preventing pregnancies were called witchcraft in medieval times. There also got to be some kind of masturbation spell(s). Animation charms come to mind.

Sex toys is a subject deserving of its own fic. Just with the aforementioned Animation charm, there is so much potential. Literally anything you can think of, its possible, from the mundane to the bizzare. Just go onto an online shop for this and imagine all of its products on magic-steroids. Paraphenalia is just the same.

For spells I can see some hypersensitivity spells, the already mentioned prevention-spells, Levitation charms, Transfigurations,...................... Crucio for Bellatrix (thats got to be her kink).

Pornography however, is a topic where I think the wizards are a bit behind. I can imagine some sort of Playboy magazine, but nothing more. However, I imagine prostitution to be a huge market. Starting with non-human prostitutes and ending with polyjuice drinking ones - bring a hair and you can fuck whomever you want (I think there was one fem!Harry fic where she finds out that there is a business at Hogwarts involving her hair and an establishment offering "The Girl Who Lived" as a polyjuice prostitute).

When it comes to sex culturally, I can see the wizards historically being very open with sex used for magic. Its kind of my headcanon that lesbianism is alright, while a gay wizard is discriminated against. This has its roots in the Covens. While Sorcerer circles were academic only, I imagine Covens to have been a tight knit group as they were the more hunted and the more "working class" of the two (once again, headcanon). I can also see the ideological side of Dumbledore to be against homosexuality (as they moved closer to muggle ideology.), while the more traditional magicals still accept lesbianism to a degree. Dumbledores side would also be more prude, while I have it in my head that the traditional wizards and witches are very open with their bodies due to Fertility rituals and the like. Its also my bit of headcanon that the lack of children from the purebloods is caused to a big degree by these rituals being outlawed.

Sex Ed, I imagine, is practically non-existent. Due to the casual way in which some spells are used, I can totally see Hogwarts just dosing the children with a bit of potion to prevent pregnancy throughout the seven years and then leaving them to their own devices. I would imagine that its a bit of a mouth-to-mouth thing in the houses, the older years telling the younger and so on. A lot of experiments. I could also see the girls having a session with Pomfrey in second or third year where they learn the prevention charm. Because its obviously the girls-only responsibility to prevent consequences. We're still just in the middle of second wave feminism, and I'm sure that not even first wave feminism completely hit the wizarding world.

Oh, EDIT, before I forget: "Holy shit, can you imagine sex with Tonks?" isn't a much asked question in fanfiction for nothing.

that's a strange assessment. In the source material I don't remember anything that would even hint at inequality between the sexes. (assuming you are using feminism to mean equality rather then female superiority).

In no part of the books were girls/boys ever treated or evaluated differently.

I disagree. The wizarding world culturally diverged from the muggle world with the creation of the statute of secrecy (and possibly even before that). They are behind the muggle world only in a technological sense. Culturally, they are just as advanced, merely different. They have their own prejudices and cultural practices. You touched on this with your theory about covens, but then contradicted yourself at the end of your post by assuming they adopted feminism from muggles.

When you consider the origins of feminism in the muggle world where greater involvement in the workforce led to greater demands for rights and equal treatment and compare this to the wizarding world it becomes clear that the wizarding world has likely never discriminated by gender. Going back to the founding of Hogwarts, witches have held an equal place with wizards, learning the same skills for the same jobs, very few of which would be affected by physical differences between the sexes due to the nature of magic. Not to mention, I don't really see a society being capable of oppressing half their population when said half carries around a lethal weapon with just as much ability to use it as the other half. The only reason muggleborns are effectively discriminated against is that they are a small minority with distinct disadvantages in terms of magical knowledge and economic power.

**** I doubt that muggleborn witches were able to shrug off the first ten years of living in a man's world at any time in history, so inequality would have to be unlearned, but it certainly would have been well known.

I agree that the wizarding world adopted equality more readily and earlier than the muggle world. As to 'how to oppress a gender when they carry weapons' the obvious answer is 'don't allow them the weapons'.

As a tangential thought: perhaps the long history of magic in Europe being associated with witches in muggle literature relates to the idea that the wizards disappeared to enclaves to be trained while the witches were left in the muggle world to their own devices, but without wands. This is why hedge witches were associated with herbalism and extensive rites and rituals; they couldn't whip out the speedy spells.

In such a world it would make a certain sense if the adoption of the Statute of Secrecy was the endgame of a witch uprising, wherein they insisted that enough pissed-off girls with stolen wands [or wands smuggled to them by sympathetic pureblood witches] could make everyone's lives miserable, so they should all get to disappear from the world.

Or not. It's just a notion.

Indeed. However, I was talking about the wizarding world's attitude as a whole, not the attitudes of that small minority that is muggleborn witches.

True, but I wasn't really asking that. In any case, they have them and I reckon taking them would be bitch. Not to mention you don't strictly need a wand to do magic what with potions, enchanted objects, rituals, etc. all of which are powerful in their own way if not necessarily in a duel but in a more strategic application.

#+end_quote

This is more a result of the attitudes held by the authors of such works. Most literature of the time was commissioned or created by the church or nobles with deeply held beliefs on the subject. Take Shakespeare's Macbeth for example; it is well known that the king at the time (James I), who was one of The Bard's primary patrons, had a thing for witch-hunting, hence the portrayal of the three witches as meddling old crones. Other examples would be to compare the portrayals of magic as used by Prospero and Sycorax (good wizard compared to evil witch) in Shakepreare's The Tempest, and the portrayals of magic in the King James Bible. These works and others like them have colored the perception of the subject in subsequent works up through the modern era where that perception has only just begun to change in reflection of our modern attitudes. What I'm trying to get at is that muggle literature would not be a reliable source for learning about what magical culture was like, especially since all the accurate sources would have been confiscated upon implementation of the SoS.

Despite the obvious really cool ways magic could be used in the bedroom, sex in the HP universe seems pretty puritanical.

** I'm not sure it would be as much of a sex-fest as some people think. Although obviously having a bunch of horny teenagers all living in the same castle would lead to some teenage sex, you have to remember that muggles spend so much time thinking about sex because of how much of it we see in the media.

It may be that wizarding culture is quite prudish and sex isn't something to be openly talked about, even if behind closed doors they're more adventurous than muggles. The reason alot of muggle kids feel so comfortable talking about sex is how much of it we see on the internet/tv/etc and the fact that we're exposed to it at such a young age.

If wizarding kids receive little to no social learning in regards to attitudes towards sex, they might be less comfortable exploring it until they're older.

**** More puritanical social norms can develop independently of religion.

Lots of kids, many of whom don't have the maturity to handle sex, living in one place without any limits on sexual activity is bound to cause problems at some point, which could have motivated teachers and parents and society at large to develop a hush-hush attitude towards sex to discourage underage sex and the problems that come with it.

Like I said above, even with the desire to have sex, they have to have the knowledge, and since kids are shipped away from the parents at 11, and assuming parents don't spend much time talking to their pre-pubescent kids about sex, the only real source of information they'd have is older kids.

Wizarding children may also never /see/ sex, like, ever, until they have it. Muggle kids have access to porn and see sex simulated on tv, which again makes us more comfortable talking about, and presumably, having sex.
