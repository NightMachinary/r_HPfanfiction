** No. Queerbaiting, by definition, has to involve actual baiting - that is, repeatedly hinting at or teasing an eventual queer relationship, but never actually delivering. The classic example of this is John/Sherlock in BBC's /Sherlock/, because the show often included lines about they resembled a romantic couple, and the creators were well aware of the ship's popularity and were eager to milk it, but they clearly never intended to follow through.

/Cursed Child/, as far as I'm aware, never implied in the lead-up to the show that Albus and Scorpius would be more than friends, and there aren't any wink-wink-nudge-nudge moments about their relationship in the play, either. I think not making Albus/Scorpius a canon ship was a missed opportunity, but that's not the same thing as queerbaiting.

** The creators never promised to deliver a gay relationship, never marketed it as a gay relationship, or were quoted in interviews as interpreting it as a gay relationship during the writing process. (Jack Thorne /did/ say he projected his own daddy issues into the story, on the other hand.)

Albus Severus had some pretty big hints given that he was into girls from the beginning, with his attraction to Delphini, kissing his Aunt Hermione, and insinuating that they should have more babies together while under Polyjuice. There was no textual evidence that he was into guys, so any evidence that he and Scorpius had something I attribute to the actors' chemistry on-stage. (Disclaimer: I haven't watched it, and am not planning to spend ~$1000 on flights, hotel, and ticket price to see it.)

If you're going to complain about queerbaiting, the Dumblewald relationship in Fantastic Beasts 2 is the real deal, with that /"We were closer than brothers"/ line and JKR's behind-the-scenes statement on their "emotionally intense" relationship with added "sexual dimension".

** I've never really had an issue with 'queer-baiting'. I enjoy comedy in many formats, and I'm queer, so by faulty logic, no. I find such jokes rather humorous.
