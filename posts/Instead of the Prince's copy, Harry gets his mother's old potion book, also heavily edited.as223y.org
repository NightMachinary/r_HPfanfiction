*** Based on Slughorn's personality, it doesn't seem unreasonable for him to repeat his lesson plans, so he has more time to spend planning dinner parties and accepting invitations to pro Quidditch games.

In fanfic author fanon, Slughorn has been using the same lesson plans since the days of Tom Riddle. Because every other Riddle-era fic I read usually has some form of competitive brewing lesson and an introduction to Amortentia.

*** I mean, there's a question of how often potioneering changes. Perhaps frequently, but the level at which students need doesn't really change all that much if at all. Or consider also that a lot of progress made in potioneering might be all concealed as trade secrets. Alternatively, Slughorn might just be rather fond of the textbook, and thinks it's one of the best around, even with modern changes, and would rather just explain the changes then switch books (it's a bit like using a book written by Euler for math; old but still good).

The changes were very small, the biggest one being the switch from STP to SATP, and the discovery of a number of elements. It was minimal enough that any qualified chemistry teacher could easily point out a difference between mom's edition and mine

Also, my mom has been teaching for 30+ years and has used the same textbook for more than half of that because the newer ones aren't as good. They have worse examples, the wrong pacing, they're missing information that integral for how she teaches. Sometimes an older book is exactly what you need, free of whatever dad is sweeping the industry at the time.

Slughorn has just been thrown bodily out of retirement and probably hasn't been keeping up with school level textbooks, given his Mastery, so he likely dusted off his old lesson plans, found where his old books were stored and got to work!

*** This is very strange - many textbooks do print out revised editions every few years and have schools prescribe those newer versions, but the core part of the books won't change.

Senior high school students were learning integral and differential calculus 30 years back, and they're still learning it today. Why would they change that? Same goes for physics - classical mechanics (Newtonian) is taught in schools, even though we have more complete theories. In fact, schools will just teach the basics of classical mechanics, and not even go into Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics (unless maybe the student is in an advanced course) , even though they're the "complete" version.

  “Hang on,” said a voice close by Harry's left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn's dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them. “Did I hear right? *You've been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book*, Harry?”

  She looked *alarmed and angry*. Harry knew what was on her mind at once.

  “It's nothing,” he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. “It's not like, you know, Riddle's diary. It's just an old textbook someone's scribbled on.”

  “But you're doing what it says?”

  “I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, there's nothing funny ---”

  “Ginny's got a point,” said Hermione, perking up at once. “We ought to check that there's nothing odd about it. *I mean, all these funny instructions*, who knows?”

******** Poorly-written? Nah, can't agree. I think Hermione's reaction is very believable and fits her character perfectly.

(Besides, your first two emphasisted parts are said by/referring to GINNY, not Hermione. It's GINNY who is angry about Harry obeying orders that someone wrote in a book, which makes sense because of her experiences with Riddle's diary... which Harry is quick to point out that this isn't anything like that.)

While Hermione does value learning for learning's sake, she isn't a cold, detached intellectual... nor is she a particularly scientific-minded or imaginative person. Hermione's actually very closed-minded (which is why she doesn't get along with Luna), and she distrusts "unofficial" information sources and things that haven't been properly verified.

There's also the fact that Hermione HATES unfairness. People having unfair advantages really irks her, and with the textbook here, Harry does have what she sees as an unfair advantage... what's worse is that he has an unfair advantage over HER. Hermione is used to being the top of the class, and all of a sudden Harry (whom she KNOWS not to be a Potions prodigy) surpasses her thanks to some dodgy written instructions in a book. He doesn't even UNDERSTAND the instructions, he just FOLLOWS them. He's become the top of the class, surpassing HER, without having done anything to earn it. SHE'S had to work hard, do all her homework, spend an ungodly amount of time studying. She's WORKED for success. Now Harry just follows some extra instructions on a whim and ends up doing better than her without actually putting in any work, and she's MIFFED about it.

So when Ginny brings up Riddle's diary, Hermione is all too happy to take the opportunity to spread doubt that the instructions are on the level. This isn't about intellectual curiosity, it's about Hermione feeling unfairly surpassed.

I don't call that poorly-written, I call that three-dimensional.

And after all, she knew from personal experience that Harry DID have a talent for Defence Against the Dark Arts. This wasn't someone showing her up without having earned it through hard work; this extra-curricular activity did in no way threaten her status as Top of the Class.... quite the contrary; it made her status as a brilliant witch even clearer because SHE got to do a lot of fancy organizing and using clever spells.

She wouldn't see that as unfair, because one, it was HER doing it; two, she was using trusted and verified sources; and three, the members of the DA were putting in actual work and PRACTICING.

*********** Ugh love this analysis of Hermione and I think you have a great point, also many forget that Hermione pretty much had no friends when they first started Hogwarts and most likely didn't in the muggle world (look how easy it was for her to leave it behind). I also think that part of her character is that she listens to the 'qualified' people and the people who have more experience and know more things...I mean look at Lockhart it took her ages to concede that he actually didn't know what he was doing. The only time she went against and authority figure was Umbridge and that was because Umbridge had given them a book that Hermione didn't believe was going to teach them to the best of their abilities so she found a way around that. I believe this has everything to do with Hermione's childhood and how she likely relied on books for everything so the second a book that comes around that is not an official copy she distrusts it.

Also difference between book Hermione and movie Hermione is that she's incredibly insensitive to other peoples emotions in the book...to the point that Ron is normally the one who is actually the trios emotional support person. Wether it is Lilys book or Snapes she would still say that Harry is only using it for sentimental reasons and she would still dislike it and the advantage it gives harry over her.

*edit - she also went against the school rules on many occasions so my entire argument may be a bit of a moot point lol

******** To try to rescue the characterization...

Hermione has a huge amount of respect for authority. Contradicting the authority's instructions is anathema to her earlier character, and while she's changed her attitudes toward personal and political authorities, she still has similar instincts about academic authorities.

She's also seen time and again, thanks to Neville, that Bad Things happen when you don't follow instructions with potions.

So she's not keen on following the hand-written notes, and doubly not keen on experimenting in potions. It might go just fine 90% of the time, and then sometimes the note-taker wrote something down carelessly that doesn't reflect what actually worked for them, and then it's off to the infirmary with tentacles growing in your lungs.

***** The thing is, Harry Potter is primarily a mystery series in a magical setting. Whereas the early books have only a single major mystery (who's trying to steal the grubby package, who's the Heir, etc) HPB steps it up with three main mysteries: what's Voldemort's origin story, what is Draco up to, and who is the Half Blood Prince.

Removing that mystery would require either a greater focus on the other two, hiding Lily's ownership (simply having her initial it LE could work) or inventing a non canon mystery that the book is a key part of.

** Well, let's take a look, shall we?

- /Sectumsempra/: Yeah, that's definitely something only a kid with an unhealthy fascination with Dark Magic, or someone who really wants to /hurt/ people, would come up with. Lily is neither, so we can definitely say that one would not be in her book.
- /Levicorpus/: A spell that lets you suspend someone in mid-air as if they're being held up by the ankle. Eh...I dunno, that's a little bully-ish, doesn't seem like something Lily would come up with either, so let's remove that one. If anything, if not Snape I can see James or Sirius coming up with something like this.
- /Liberacorpus/: Counter-spell for /Levicorpus/. If we remove one, we have to remove the other
- /Muffliato/: Much more practical little spell, one that lets one have a quiet conversation unnoticed. I could see Lily coming up with that in case she didn't want to be overheard, though I'd imagine she wouldn't be using it in class
- An unidentified Hex that causes the target's toenails to grow alarmingly fast. A little spiteful, but I could see perhaps Lily coming up with that one if there was a particular student who was the bane of her existence, like James was to Snape or, a generation later, Malfoy to Harry. Hell, I wouldn't put it past Lily to hit James with it as payback for him bullying Snape.
- +An also unidentified spell+*EDIT:* */Langlock/* - *a spell* that caused the target's tongue to get stuck to the roof of their mouth. Bit mischievous, not particularly bullying or dark, and again something I can totally see her using on say, James or Sirius to shut them up.

So some of the spells might also have been something she'd have come up with, others not. That being said, let's set aside the Prince's spells.

Lily was established as particularly brilliant in Potions, so she's someone whom I can totally see scribbling notes for improvements to Potions recipes/instructions that she might have come up with. And she's definitely not the type to give herself a pompous little nickname, so she would have signed the book in her own name. Either way, all of a sudden Harry's the best in his year in Potions, with the added bonus that instead of being some anonymous "Half-Blood Prince", the help he is receiving is from his own late mother, in a way. This is going to be /huge/ in terms of how it affects his character and his attitude towards the book, I think.

Finally, the bathroom confrontation with Malfoy. Instead of Harry stupidly using a spell he found scrawled in his Potions book when he has absolutely no idea what it does, he falls back on his pre-existing arsenal of spells. This means the likeliest counters will be /Stupefy/ or /Expelliarmus/...frankly, I'm leaning towards the latter. So instead of carving Malfoy open, he either Stuns or, more likely, Disarms him. And here we have Malfoy, who was about to use an *Unforgivable Curse*, duly Disarmed. Enter another teacher, Malfoy is expelled and probably sent to join his father in Azkaban, because even Snape's not thick enough to try to cover for Malfoy attempting to murder a classmate for no reason.

With Malfoy foiled before he's able to mend the Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement, no Death Eaters can enter Hogwarts. For the same reason, there is in all likelihood no need to get the Order involved at Hogwarts, so Bill isn't mauled by Greyback, since neither of them is present. For that matter, the former DA gang probably don't get too involved either.

This leaves Snape the unenviable task of obeying Dumbledore's orders and killing him, forcing him to go on the run /immediately/. Also, nobody sets Hagrid's hut on fire.

Oh, and last but not least: /"This book is the property of Lily Evans"/ on the inside cover? Hermione's got nothing she can say to that, so her objections to the mysterious "Half-Blood Prince" and her determination to identify him(or her) become nonexistent.

I may just steal this idea for when/if I get 'round to actually writing this HP fanfic I've been trying to write for the better part of two years...

It sounds like a useful combat spell tbh. Not worse than taking a good ol sword and going to town on magical Nazis, Jack Churchill fashion. Perhaps not useful against the average Hogwarts prankster, but against a Death Eater it is one of the better spells to choose. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the spell selection in the bathroom fight. Self-defence covers any amount of force as long as it is proportionate to what you are attacked with (at least in most legal systems). And against an unforgivable, it is appropriate to resort to any amount of force. I mean, look at the Longbottoms if you want to see its effects.

The one loss is Muffliato. That one is dead useful.

**** Not saying there was necessarily anything /wrong/ per se with Harry's decision in the bathroom - as I agree it was a legitimate case of self-defense. But I still think using a spell when you have /no idea what it actually does/ is a stupid idea. Nor am I saying that it's not something that'd be useful in combat.

I was really speaking in terms of the kind of mindset one would have to have to come up with a spell like this at /fifteen years old/. Let me elaborate a bit on my thought process there: /Sectumsempra/ is explicitly established as a Dark spell: it is identified in /Deathly Hallows/ as the spell Snape used which severed George's ear(accidentally, I'll allow), and it is mentioned that the ear cannot be grown back due to having been cursed off(a characteristic of Dark Magic).

For a 15-year-old to deliberately create a Dark spell designed to cut your opponent open would require IMO a real desire to inflict pain greater than what I would consider typical of a kid that age - to say nothing of an interest in Dark Magic that goes beyond the theoretical or the interest in self-defense.

So if we accept the premise suggested by OP that Harry finds Lily's old book instead of Snape's, there is absolutely /no way/ that Lily(who strongly criticized Snape's association with Mulciber and his defense of the latter's use of Dark Magic on a classmate) would have come up with a spell like /Sectumsempra/ - which is the main point I was trying to get across.

To be fair, it said "for enemies" in the instruction. That sounds like something you would want to use when the other guy is trying to cast the torture curse. Preferably you would want to try it on a dummy first, but a spell for enemies will hardly fix their hair.

** Ah, heck, I'll write it.

--------------

Harry and Ron muttered thanks to Slughorn's offer to lend them some old textbooks. There were a half dozen copies of /Advanced Potions Making/ in the cupboard. Ron grabbed the nearest one while Harry selected a copy near the back, in the corner.

"Right then, well Harry and Rupert, was it?" Slughorn smiled jovially, looking all the more like a walrus. "We have four potions here, all of which you will be studying throughout your N.E.W.T. year."

--------------

/Draught of Living Death/ Harry opened his textbook and began to read the instructions. All around him, the room was filling with blue smoke. Out the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy looking more engaged in his potion than Harry could remember.

Harry squinted at his book. Whoever had owned it before him had written in the margins, though in usually in a lighter color of ink. It took a little getting used to, but it wasn't that difficult to differentiate between the instructions and the original owner's notes.

Harry began chopping his Sopophorous beans when he noticed one of the notes read "Crush with edge of blade for more juice." Cautiously, he pressed the flat of his blade against the bean. Juice splurged out and it took him by such surprise

"What are you doing?" Hermione hissed. Her own beans were chopped neatly, but barely half as much juice had been produced.

"Crush the bean, it'll work better."

"No! That's not what the instructions say!"

"Oy!" Ron snapped in a voice barely above a whisper. "Keep it down, I'm trying to concentrate. These Vaderian roots have to be perfect squares!" Ron's potion was black as tar and even thicker, judging from how his stirring tool appeared to be cemented in place.

"Here," Ernie passed Ron a small tool Harry didn't recognize. It looked vaguely like a pair of scissors. "This is what I use whenever I have to chop something in a specific shape."

"Stop it! That's cheating!" Hermione's face was growing red with fury.

"Eyes on your own stations, now." Slughorn chortled. He smiled at Harry's potion, grimaced at Ron's and gave Ernie's a brief, polite nod.

Harry looked further in the instructions, and noted a second alteration from the previous owner. Instead of seven counter-clockwise stirs, the previous owner had written "five counter, one clock, one counter."

Curious, Harry wondered if it would work. The advice on crushing the beans had worked quite well. He did as he was told--the potion paled to a light purple, very nearly matching the book's instructions of lilac.

"How?!" Hermione's voice shook with frustration--her potion was still dark purple. Ernie's potion was navy, the ideal stage of the halfway point and Ron, thanks to Ernie's cutting tool, had managed to stir his potion to a smooth consistency, though it was nowhere near .

"Let me see now, let me see." Slughorn

"Excellent, Harry! Excellent! Why, this potion, it reminds me very much of your mother! Ah, sweet Lily. The number of times I saw her practice potions in here. Always experimenting!"

"Mudblood lucky she didn't blow herself up, more's the pity" Malfoy muttered.

"I heard that!" Slughorn whipped around, far more quickly than Harry could have expected. "Twenty points from Slytherin! I will not have any student, past or present, be disparaged in such a matter Malfoy. You've been warned."

--------------

"Harry, that was cheating and you know it! You should turn that book in!"

"Are you mental? It was great!"

"I don't see what the big deal is," Ron shrugged. "So Harry beat you one time Hermione, and if the potion is better, I don't see why that's bad."

"Am I the only one who values doing the work myself?!"

"While that is a virtue, Hermione, I'd advise caution not to let pride get in the way," Ernie said cooly. "Ron needed help, and I assisted."

"How long have you been standing there?"

"Since we left Slughorn's class. I wouldn't recommend following alternative instructions Harry, since it can be dangerous, but a classroom is probably the safest place to do so."

"Well, this conversation is private!"

"Oy," Ron interrupted. "Ernie works at our table too. What if Harry was standing next to him instead of me? Then he would have noticed Harry following those other instructions anyway."

"Who owned the book anyway Harry? If they're a practiced potioneer, then Slughorn might want to know about those alterations."

Harry looked over his shoulder to make sure they weren't being followed by Malfoy or any of the other Slytherins, and quickly opened the book to the inside cover. The previous owner has written, in what was clearly their very neatest handwriting:

"/This book is the property of Lily Evans./"

Ernie also strikes me as someone who isn't completely opposed to following alternate instructions, since in an attempt to outshine Harry he once tried to invent a potion from scratch. It wound up curdling into a dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron.

2. I don't think Hermione would throw as much of a stink over Harry using it. She'd still call it cheating, but she'd understand that he wants to feel closer to his mother.
3. Harry could use some other spell in the bathroom scene. /Expelliarmus/ has served him well against Voldemort, why not Draco as well?
4. Harry would let Ron use the book too and Ron wouldn't degrade on his previous signs of maturity. They'd both be doing well in Potions.
5. Lily would probably have hexes to use against "traitorous little liars like Snivellus."
6. James would probably help her in the potions/hexes ideas, since his father was a Potions Master, and it might hint to their romantic development.
