I'm planning to write a fic for this (set in the future). Can it work?

*2080: Mars is colonised

*2164: United Nations Space Command is formed, defeating the Rebellion. Insurrectionist movement begins.

*2165: Traces of magic are found and noted by Office of Naval Intelligence agents. However, it remains a top-secret data.

*2291: Shaw-Fukushima drive allows Faster-than-light travel

*2321: Project ORION-I [failed project]

*2491: Project ORION is re-launched, resulted in overwhelming success

*2511: John-117 is born

*2517: Project SPARTAN-II is initiated

*2525: First Contact with the Covenant. War erupts.

*2527: Notes about "magic" are found with some minor skirmishes on Outer Colonies between Planetary forces and the Covenant

*2528: The existence of "magical world" is confirmed

*2531: Shield World Battle [Halo Wars]

*2530: Rise of "Lord Voldemort" on Earth

*2537: Hermione Granger is born on Earth. Project SPARTAN-III is launched

*2538: Harry Potter and [OC] are born on Earth. "Lord Voldemort" is neutralised by an unknown method. Harry Potter is sent to the Dursleys'

*2549: Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and [OC] joined Hogwarts school and quickly became friends. Mystic Corp is formed by ONI to consider the use of "arcane-tech" to battle against Covenant and the Innes. Progress is slow due to the lack of information

*2550: After the issue of the Philosopher's Stone [Book 1], the Trio decided to leave Hogwarts. The "smart" intervention of Dobby allows all three of them to join the Mystic Corp. The entire [British] magical community is baffled by the disappearance of the Boy-Who-Live

*2551: The Trio, being a part of "Bravo Battalion", is sent to Reach for training. The information they brought along when leaving proved to be highly useful with ONI. Each member of the Trio becomes more specialised in their own professional. "Lord Voldemort" is re-surrected and quickly subdued by Dumbledore [Book 2]

*2552: Battle of Reach. "Bravo Battalion" assisted the evacuation effort, only 3/400 [The Trio] men survived and recovered (but save over 10000 civilian). Only 1/6 member of Noble Team survived, the AI Cortana, the ship Pillar of Autumn and Master Chief were able to escape. Battle of the Ring [Halo].

*2553: Battle of Earth (1 year late of the original). The Trio assisted defence at the British Isles. Sound victory of human. The Trio got lost and mingled at the "Quidditch World Cup" and able to repel Death Eaters' attacks without being seen. The dead bodies left behind baffled the DMLE.

And then, we have the Tri-Wizard competition and Harry is pulled back to Earth
