So this is something I've noticed a lot in the last few fics I've read. It is by no means meant to be disparaging and probably not even entirely accurate. Just my opinion based on what I've recently been reading.

What it boils down to is this:

1. Voldemort is more competent than all the good guys put together (Usually including Dumbledore, but not always)
2. All of Voldemort's plots usually succeed, including all the murdering, raping and pillaging and no one ever makes any kind of stand or puts up a fight, except Harry at some point.
3. The good guys, never learn, adapt or adjust to whats happening. No puts up new wards, or learns new skills or does anything really, because Harry and Dumbledore will save them.
4. Throughout the whole pic the good guys keep losing ground and people keep dying
5. Harry is constantly training, but is always "years" behind in experience and training and he knows he'll never stand a chance of beating Voldemort and then at the end, all of a sudden, all the bad guys are incompetent, all the good guys can suddenly fight and Harry miraculously wins, even though he is poorly trained expects to die fighting.
6. This miraculous breakthrough obviously always comes after reading 100+ thousand words on the dark taking over the world and winning. In one day the light wins

Now I'm sure that this isn't true for a lot of fics.

But its just something I've noticed.


** Because plot.

It's the same line as "why can't bad guys hit their target?"

** I agree with all of the above. Definitely think that's what is happening. Makes me wonder why a "good story" can't have a bit of seesaw. Good wins a battle, bad wins a battle. Etc until the "war" Not everything has to be one sided right till the end. I'm not saying they bad stories at all. I enjoy alot that are like that. It's just something I've noticed.

** Poor writing.

It's easier to up the stakes and increase the dramatic tension by having the protagonists be incompetent than it is to have the villains be competent. And then, at the finale, reverse that for a happy ending.

** I think you may be missing the forest for the trees here, if you'll pardon the idiom. First let's look at how Voldemort operates:

1. Voldemort is competent and intelligent. More than that, he has decades of experience and previous conflict (First War) to draw on and learn from. Even without his charisma and name-recognition, he knows what will work and how his enemies act.
2. The way Voldemort and his death eaters operate is functionally equivalent to modern terrorist cells, rather than as say the French Revolution or Red Revolution. Terrorist cells succeed because their aims are far narrower than the institutions they fight against. The Death Eaters don't target the government itself or get drawn into open conflict. They are outnumbered and they know it. Rather, they pick off key individuals one after another, going after their strongest opposition and intimidating or enthralling others. Its not about killing everyone so much as crushing dissent and fear of the unknown.

By contrast, think of the limitations of Dumbledore and the Ministry more practically:

1. Unlike the Death Eaters, they are larger organizations with disparate chains-of-command. Moreover, they are not really fighting the death eaters as organization, but rather the terror and intimidation that they inspire. The Joker's line in 'The Dark Knight' comes to mind for this: "You know what I've noticed? Nobody panics when things go "according to plan"... even if the plan is horrifying. If, tomorrow, I tell the press that, like, a gang-banger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blowing up, nobody panics, because "it's all part of the plan". But I say that /one/ little old mayor will die... /well then everyone loses their minds!/ Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos." Governments need the faith of the people to function, since once that is lost people lose all desire to maintain them.
2. Their methods are far more constrained as well. Setting aside the use of the Unforgivables, which are a hax-setup if I ever read one, the government is restrained very much by their own laws. The death eaters act outside the law and they know how to use it. Despite what you believe, Aurors can't just go house to house and intimidate people into submission.
3. Besides this, there is the obvious fact that the MoM and to a lesser extent the OotP are /known/ for the most part. Everyone knows the major players in the Ministry, who the heads of departments are, etc. By contrast, the names of Death Eaters are not. While some can be guessed (such as those who've done time in Azkaban), its still seemingly innocent until proven guilty.

What it boils down to is the bad guys have experience and one of the most competent wizards and revolutionaries working as their head with absolutely no real boundaries, while the good guys are restrained by a combination of morality, multiple competing goals, and operational anonymity.

As for the stuff about training Harry...this has been dealt with ad infinitum, but to paraphrase someone else: Harry is a fairly talented wizard with a handful of notable skills, but he is no master prodigy. Besides, magic is a lifelong training experience that cannot be crammed into a child in the time at Hogwarts.

Besides which, you have to remind yourself of Rowling's own statement - that when it came down to it she has a set plot and she alters the worldbuilding, characterizations, and skill levels of characters for whatever end she needs to. Not a knock on her per se, just pointing out that this is how most children's stories/fairy tales are actually written as well.

** In part because Rowling took the story through multiple genres and did not make it consistent. The first few books are children's tales, where the adults are foolish and the children have to save the day. The latter books are young adult, where the plucky teenagers have to triumph over impossible odds and much angst.

In story, the incompetence of British wizardry can be laid at the foot of their politics - the old families running the Ministry impeded any effort to train the citizenry above anything than household maintenance because they didn't want anyone strong enough in skill or will to challenge them.
