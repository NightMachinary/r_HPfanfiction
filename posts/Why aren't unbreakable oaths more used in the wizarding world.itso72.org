I mean, why didn't the ministry force the Death Eaters to perform an unbreakable oath in which they swear they won't be committing crimes? It's just so easy to do...


** Unbreakable Vows are defined in spoken language. Language is insanely ambiguous (some words have dozens of definitions, some words have conflicting/opposite definitions, etc.). Anyone who has ever dealt with a legal document, or watched a tv show about lawyers should know this.

My headcanon is that anyone who has ever sworn an Unbreakable Vow can be killed just by talking to them. Possibly without even knowing the precise wording of the Vow.

#+begin_quote
  In my opinion, it isn't immoral to make people swear not to kill or torture people willingly.
#+end_quote

And how do you define these terms? To a pureblood elitist, perhaps killing a muggle isn't "killing" (and you probably meant "murder"---you see?), but "euthanasia" of tortured animals (they don't have magic, their lives must be horrible, death would be a release for them). Are Healers now forbidden to conduct painful procedures when the patient is allergic to palliative potions, because saving their life would effectively require torturing them? What if someone is in pain and asks you to kill them---killing them breaks your oath, but not killing them is torturing them which breaks your oath (thus, anyone can kill you by putting themselves in pain and asking you to kill them).

If you define these terms in law, laws can be changed and your Vow is now subject to the whims of each new Wizengamot law or Ministry interpretation of the law ('Today, the Wizengamot redefined the legal word "kill" to mean "refusing to obey any instruction by the Minister of Magic".'---thus, all citizens who had sworn not to kill have now sworn never to refuse any instruction by the Minister of Magic: instant dictatorship). If the laws can't be changed, or the Vow references a specific version of the law, then you're stuck with whatever people swore at the time even if you messed up the wording in some way (and much of legal history is realizing how we did in fact screw up the wording in some way).

If these terms aren't defined in law, then they can mean whatever you want them to mean. Perhaps before taking your oath you confund yourself into believing that "to kill people" means "to hop on one foot for over 24 hours", and that's the definition your Vow is stuck with even when you end the confundus. Whelp, I definitely won't be doing that, no sir.

If you think I'm just being "tricky" with words, this is what I came up with in ten minutes---wait until people's /lives/ depend on language definitions and see what they come up with. The real world is much more complex than any Vow could hope to address. There's a reason that we have not only laws written using terms that have been debated and defined over /centuries/, but a judicial system to /interpret/ the laws and determine what they actually mean, whether they have actually been broken, and sometimes whether it would actually be justice to enforce the law. Relegating that interpretive process to magic would probably result in a massacre.

EDIT: A Vow which puts multiple conditions on people (don't kill, don't torture, etc.) inevitably can be used to set up trolley problems (I suggested a few above) where all choices lead to breaking your Vow---another way to kill people who have taken a Vow. You say that can't happen because /everyone/ has sworn the Vow and thus can't use it against each other? Well, just everyone in Magical Britain. Which means it would be easy for a foreign nation (or a foreign dark wizard) to conquer us.

EDIT 2: My computer's dictionary says "kill" can mean (other than the obvious) "cause the defeat of" (kill a project), "overwhelm someone with an emotion" (the suspense is killing me), and "pass the time" (I've got an hour to kill.).

** Outside of the obvious problem of "should a Government litterally enslave a part of its population by the use of a Magical Oath?", I think you should ask yourself 2 question before saying "It's just so easy to do".

​

*1) Who are the Death Eater?*

Canon made it pretty easy for reader to determine "Who" are the Death Eaters, because he saw most of them in the Graveyard. But one of the reasons why the 1st Blood War was so terrible was because you could never trust anyone by fear they were on the other side.\\
The reason why some Death Eater like Malfoy got off so easy the first time was because tens, if not hundreds of people came forward to the Ministry with the same excuse of "I was under the Imperius". And in the end, the only "condemned" Death Eater were the one either caught red handed, or who were sold off by other Death Eater.

So what should the Government do in this situation? Ask all the person previously under the Imperius to swear the off? It's not just a handfull of guys anymore, but tens, or hundreds of them, most of them in position of power because they were "usefull puppet". No sane population would, or at least should, accept to enslave several innocent in the hope of catching a guilty, especially since the "innocent" one may be their friend of family.

Also, asking the "Death Eater" to swear an oath does not end the problem of Blood Purity. People like the Black Sr or Umbridge were 100% for Voldemort, yet did not take the Mark and would still be free after the oaths.

​

*2) What is a crime?*

Let's directly use Godwin's law so it's out of the way, but the Holocaust was legal in Nazi Germany while the people resisting against it were criminal. In the same way, everything that happened during Voldemort's rule in DH (from the imprisonment of Muggleborns to the use of Unforgiveables) was legal, while Harry' actions were considered criminal.\\
Something moral is not necessarily legal, and something legal is not necessarily moral. Umbridge was a monster taking a (barely) human form, yet most of her actions in OotP were legal (only the Dementors attack, and the use of an Unforgiveable is she had truly done it were truly illegal. Even the Blood Quill could fall into a grey area depending of how the law is writen).

Not to mention "Never do a crime ever again" is just a terrible oath to swear. It's so vague that someone could unknowingly break an old, forgotten law and potentially die. People would live in fear to die for unknown reasons and never do anything.\\
And such an oath would also give the Ministry of Magic way too much control over a part of their population. It's just an invitation to turn into a dictature.

​

So yes, asking people to swear an Unbrekable Oath is morally wrong from the start, but that Oath is also flawed from the start and the Ministry wouldn't even be able to discern the Death Eater among the population, forcing them to either drop the idea or enslave a loooot of people.\\
Oh and also people like Dumbledore would oppose the idea, and he wouldn't be the only one, far from it.

**** Define "kill or torture willingly".

During the first war, Moody killed several Dark Wizard who refused to surrender. With your vow, he would have died after the 1st one because he willingly put them down in the end.

In HBP, when Hermione sent birds at Ron face, she willingly hurt him. Does it count as torture, should she have droped dead?

​

Also, how do you force the whole population to swear an Unbrekable vow? Do you use the Auror to force people to comply? But in that case, who will force the Auror if they refuse to submit themselves at the end? As the only one in the country not under the vow, nobody would be able to stop them.

And in your post Vow society, how do you handle foreigners? What's stopping the French Wizards to invade now that no British wizard can fight them anymore? What about an American criminal who decide to move there? And are you even sure that every British Wizard is under the vow? One could have stayed hidden under the fidelius or another protection. Or maybe, 20 years later, the child of a Dark Wizard raised in secret will rise and make the Government fall.

Oh and how do you care of public order in such a society? Not killing and torturing still leave the thief able to do their job, but it stop the Magical Patrol from arresting them (since they can't do anyting if he resists).And, as it has been mentioned before, how do you handle the Government now that nobody can rise against them? In the canon situation, Ministry has a line he can't go beyond because it would make the people rise, but if you take away any mean from the people to resist, sooner or later they will go beyond that line, and it's called a dictatorship.

​

Violence is rarely the answer, but the menace of violence is extremely usefull, even today. We live in a pretty peacefull era (compared to the past) only some countries are able to rise others from the map in case of conflict, and nobody want to take the risk.

** Because an unbreakable oath not to commit crimes is unworkable.

Think of it this way: would you take an oath that will cause you to die if you missed a sign saying that the road speed went down?

Limit it to felonies? Still not workable. Google "Three Felonies a Day" by Harvey Silverglate or "Go Directly to Jail" by Gene Healy. Silvergate estimates that the average professional commits three felonies a day, completely unknowing. (One example, IIRC, is an importer who went to jail for years because they accepted a shipment packed in clear plastic bags rather than cardboard boxes - which was against the [unenforced] law in the country they came from.) Silvergate was talking about the USA, but I cannot imagine the situation would be much better in the Wizarding World, with centuries of laws that have been passed and modified and later fallen into unenforced obscurity.

Vow never to harm anyone except in self-defense or the defense of others? Your surgeon is dead the moment he makes an incision. So are legions of others who hurt others in emergencies--did you know there you have about a 30% chance of breaking someone's ribs or sternum if you have to administer CPR?

Any general oath like that would have to be hedged with so many conditions and exceptions that not only would it take an hour to say, it would be utterly useless because those same conditions would make it useless.

  "Okay, let's start with the simplest points. Your claim that you are not the Heir of Slytherin could be interpreted magically in many ways. You are a Parselmouth, which is Slytherin's most well-known magical power, so you can be considered an Heir of Slytherin in that sense, either striking you down for an oathbreaker or stripping away your Parseltongue to comply with the oath. Moreover, as a Potter, your family intermarried with other families frequently, and there may be a distant relationship between you and Slytherin to make you /an/ Heir of Slytherin biologically. And your claim that you have no information about who is committing these attacks would most definitely not be accepted by the oath because you have information on who is /not/ committing the attacks, namely, yourself."

** If we're talking about convicted Death Eaters, I feel like the person making an Unbreakable Vow would have to be completely willing. So forcing them to do it wouldn't work (unless you were to offer them a choice between that and Azkaban, then some might willingly take it).

As for the ones who got away, well, there's no reason to. They managed to weasel their way out of it. I would argue that it would be a rights violation to make someone perform an Unbreakable Vow in order to be declared innocent, and that you should presume innocent until proven guilty, so if they can't actually prove that you're guilty you shouldn't have to prove your innocence, but all things considered the wizarding world doesn't really care about things like human rights most of the time.

But their question was why not have them take a Vow to never commit crimes, and in order to make that work they would have to choose to take the Vow rather than be forced. The only way I could see that happening is if they had the option to take it rather than go to Azkaban. I mean, they'd die if they attempted to commit any crimes, so they wouldn't be a danger to society. Alternatively you could lessen their sentence rather than give up on Azkaban as a whole, or offer them a nicer prison with no Dementors if they took the Vow.

Although it does raise a question - is the power of the oath absolute or does it work in an "as far as I know" way? I.E. is magic omnipotent, or is the person 'judged' by their own magic?

Like let's say Harry killed Quirrel in year 1, and was so traumatized by it mind healers had to erase the memory from him. Would him swearing that he's never killed anyone kill him?

Or even another scenario, Voldemort returns, but Fudge is completely, without a single shade of doubt convinced that he's not back. Would Fudge die by swearing that Voldemort hasn't returned?

Would Snape die if his bullshit would somehow cause Harry's death?

This uncertainty might actually be why it's not used more widely - I highly doubt there's ever been a peer reviewed study on how the oaths actually work.

** Off-world my guess is that JKR only came up with the vague concept at book 4 and then only developed it book HBP.

In-world there could be many reasons. First of all you gotta think about how safe and efficient the oaths actually are. If they take the letter of the vow instead of the spirit then they are simultaneously almost ineffective and very dangerous. The law as a whole is fundamentally murky in every society -hence the need of judges to see the specific situations to decide if it fits in the situations stated in law and if there are factors that make it more or less worthy of punishment (for example, in my country technically insulting someone is a crime, in practice however it only is actually punishable in very specific circumstances that are verified and decided by the judges)- so any command so general or abstract as /'follow the law'/ or /'don't hurt anyone'/ would be almost impossible to follow as pretty much /anything/.

By contrast specific promises would be much too easy to find loopholes on. Let's suppose for example that the DE swear to not follow Lord Voldemort, in this case they could potentially have continued their terrorist activities without a hitch as Voldemort is technically not an actual Lord by title, having just decided to use the word. Besides it, as Voldemort is not the actual name of their boss, the DE would also be able to carry on with no problems. And if neither of those were enough then Voldemort would need only to change his name (/again/). These loopholes can be found in any sentence given enough time and effort, I for one firmly believe that if Dumbledore wasn't dying Snape could have used any excuse to just postpone killing him until one of them died of natural causes.

If the oath binds by the spirit of the vow then it opens a whole new can of worms, namely, who's the interpretation that actually counts? If it is the bound part then they would just need to find /any/ reason -no matter how farfetched- to believe they were following the spirit of the law, namely to not fight against the government or in favor of Voldemort, which would be relatively easy as a case can be made that the purebloods are a form big part of the government and the DE would be fighting on their behalf, plus then following their ideals of a perfect world instead of any actual military leader that merely organizes the fighting.

However, if it is the binders interpretation that is enforced, it would potentially end up being merely a round-about method of execution as being a DE is a quality of the person and not an act that can be started or stopped at a given moment, so the oath would immediately strike because the person only agreed to not be a DE anymore, but didn't actually do anything to change that state of being.

And then if we go deeper there is actually what is probably the most relevant point, the freedom of the people. Yes, the DE movement was racist and overall terrible, but it was something the people choose to participate and make opposition to the government. Living in a world in which you have to bend your head and accept anything that the government imposes to you without the right to protest or be heard at all would be at least as terrible as living in a Voldemort-ruled world. Freedom opens the door to many dangerous and terrifying possibilities, but it is /always/ better than the alternative.
