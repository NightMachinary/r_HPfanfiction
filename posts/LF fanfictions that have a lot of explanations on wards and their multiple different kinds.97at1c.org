** linkffn(A Black Comedy) has a surprising amount of talking about wards and how they work. It's not the main focus but it's pretty important.

I'm still at the beginning, but it explains a lot of ward stuff so far.

#+begin_quote
  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

**** Not.. at all? I don't know how you got the impression that this is a harem story, but it's the furthest from a harem ever. Those female characters mentioned in the description are mentioned because they play a large part in the story not because they're romance interests(although I don't know yet if any of them would be in the future.)

***** Oh no, I didn't even read the description. I just heard of a story with a similar title and basically thought that was it. I just took a closer look and I think I vaguely recall the difference now. I think this is the one with a character called Eleanor Rose or something?

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
