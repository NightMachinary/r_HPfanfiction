I remember that Harry was trying to make a new school. It was in Italy, I believe. McGonagall eventually followed, along with Pomona and Flitwick, though I might be wrong. I do remember it bashed Dumbledore a bit, but more bashing his decisions, not the person. The Bones women were also a part of it and the school was open to all beings. Other than that, I'm drawing a blank, though it was completed

  Despite how impossible it seemed, Harry was sure his dad had saved the three of them from the dementors. After Hermione's time turner took them both back three hours, he was desperate to discover if who he'd seen casting that patronus was truly his dad. Harry certainly wasn't disappointed when his mum turned up instead, and changed the entire course of his life. Harry/Hermione

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.

** Is this the one where it had a crude acronym from the name? PISS (Potter International/Italian School for Sorcery) or something to that effect, I think?

I can't remember the name of the fic, but I remember a fic with a Harry-created Italian school like that.
