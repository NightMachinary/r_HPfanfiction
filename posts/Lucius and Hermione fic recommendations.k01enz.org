So far, I have read Masterchef and The Catfish, which are both lumione fics that were written well, had humor, and were very accurate in terms of lucius's character. I was wondering if anyone had any other well written lumione fics that stayed true to both their characterizations? I would prefer it that the fics aren't dark and are more on the lighter side, like The Catfish and Masterchef. Also, I would like if the fic was longer, and not below 10-15 chapters.


** omg I just read through the whole tag on AO3 and have some recs but I'm really sleepy, so do you mind if I just link my [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/gladheonsleeps/bookmarks][bookmarks?]] hopefully that works but if it doesn't because I'm the worst with tech, here's my [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/gladheonsleeps/works][profile]] and you can scroll down to see the bookmarks

The Luciusx Hermione fics are right at the top :)

edit: I just saw the last line and unfortunately most of the fics I saw ended up being about 7 chaps long
