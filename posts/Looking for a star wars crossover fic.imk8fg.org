Revan is reborn as Harry potter. I don't remember who Neville was but he tells Revan to “stay out of my head sith”

** Is it linkffn(Broken Chains by Darth Marrs)?

I didn't read enough to know if it was Revan because it was kind of bad and I'm not a fan of Harry but not really Harry stories.

I do remember Harry's being mourned for jumping into the Veil then he shoots back out of it 90 something days later with a broken body. He wakes up with him being a Sith that's been replaced into this body in a hospital bed and kills Umbridge as she tried to attack him then he collapses on the floor. That's about as far as I read.
