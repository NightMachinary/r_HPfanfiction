The Malfoy Woes

Hogwarts had seen better days. It's walls were crumbling, having been the victim of barrages of vicious curses and foul hexes. The astronomy tower was aflame, tendrils of fire wrapping around it. Professor Sinistra gazed up at it, watching helplessly as one of the places she loved the most was devoured by the inferno. The Great Hall has been smashed apart inside, and all that remained was an empty chamber, cluttered with piles of rubble and blood soaked corpses.

The courtyard was full of the lucky few, the survivors. People were huddled over the dead bodies of their loved ones, mourning the lives that were so tragically was cut short by a lunatic's insatiable thirst for power. Those with talent in the healing arts could be seen bustling around and tending to the wounded. House Elves and humans alike were working around the clock to clear spaces for the injured, as they kept being levitated in. One teen was Draco Malfoy, sitting next to the dead body of his loyal friend Vincent Crabbe.

He felt like an intruder. Here were the bodies of those who had spent their lives fighting against the Dark Lord. Draco had wasted his youth sympathising with the very people who were responsible for the tragic demise of the people who were being mourned. At one point, he had even fought at their side. He had raised his wand in the Dark Lord's name, and in doing so, marked himself as an enemy to Hogwarts and its supporters. Yet here he was, in the courtyard, crying over a lost friend, with all of the other forces of good, being accepted as one of their own in light of their shared troubles. They cried with each other, they consulted each other, they helped get each other back on their feet, and Draco was a part of it.

Had the Dark Lord won, the Death Eaters certainly wouldn't be letting a Weasley grieve alongside them. However, a Malfoy was accepted here, even if he made questionable decisions in the past. Draco wouldn't have blamed them. They could have, maybe even should have shunned him. Merlin forbid, each death was a stain on his conscience - yet he was being accepted. He wasn't sure how that made him feel. Like a trespasser? Yes, but also he felt grateful. Grateful that these people, who he had despised for so long, had forgiven his mistakes so easily. That was the difference between the Dark Lord's forces, and the defenders of Hogwarts. The former were hateful. The latter were forgiving. As he reflected on that, Draco knew he had, for the first time in his life, made the right choice.

As he was pondering all of this, Draco's father approached him.

“Come now, Draco. It is about time we depart,” Lucius said.

“No, father," Draco said, speaking the words that he had never spoken before.

Lucius was seething. How dare his only son defy him? Remaining in these wretched ruins and mourning showed weakness. Malfoys did not let weakness show.

“What did you say to me?” Lucius said quietly, his anger barely bubbling to the surface.

“I'm staying here,” Draco said, rising to his feet.

“What?”

“I said I am staying here,” Draco said. “I will not let you drag me around while you try to bribe your way back into the good graces of the Ministry! If you haven't noticed, I am my own person and I can make my own decisions!”

Lucius had his wand out, but a quick glance around stopped him from raising it against his heir. It would be difficult enough to appease the ministry already - his petulant son would only make things worse. The house of Malfoy had lost its reputation. It would certainly be losing most of it's fortune. Lucius would not allow it to lose the loyalty of its heir.

“You are coming with us Draco,” Lucius stated firmly.

“No Father, I have made up my mind. I shall support the right side, the side of the light.”

Lucius turned on the spot, and a crack resounded through the air as he disapparated away. Draco remained at Hogwarts. He had made too many enemies in his time. Now it was time for him to make amends.

Should be /Its/, not /It's/.

Might want to give it another proofread. Even within just the first paragraph, your verb tenses jump all around.

*** It's as in belonging to it - Dave's hat would be correct, so it's would be too, no?

**** No, it's/its doesn't follow that trend.

Its = possessive / belonging to.

It's = It is
