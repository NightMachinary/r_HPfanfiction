I can't remember the title for the life of me, but the basics that I can remember are that Harry is sent to another dimension and takes over another version of himself (I think that's died). This Harry's parents are alive, and Sirius is married with at least a daughter that's a year younger than Harry. Harry himself has 2-3 younger siblings (and I think that Neville is the boy who lived) who his alternative self was a dick to. I remember a scene where Harry cooks breakfast for everyone near the start.


** There are tons of fics like that.. this one is probably the longest:
