Read the one where Harry comes back as Jamie Evans, replacing a broken fem!harry. Loved it, was wondering if there were any more like that? The sequel was unfinished.

  Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three. The sound of shedding skin crackled loudly in his ear as he got up to look over his new body, he was a girl this time, maybe eight or nine years old. Time travel fic Tom RiddleX Harry potter

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  I took a flying leap through the Veil of Death. Gonna' be honest, not the smartest thing I've ever done. It doesn't help that Death seems to be a bit of a prick... and what's this about me being sent back in time? OOC, fem!Harry, dark!Harry. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash. Rated M for language, violence, and mature topics.

*** I wanted so badly to like this story, but everybody is written... weird. People yell at strange times, and everybody cries in conversations where they were laughing. It's written like everybody is on the verge of a mental breakdown at any moment. Stressful to read, and no doubt stressful to write.

Honestly it makes me a bit worried for the author, that she's writing characters whose normal state of affairs seems to be in a constant state of intense anxiety.

**** Author of The Unbroken Saviour here. Your analysis blew my mind from its accuracy. There was always a strange tightness in my chest whenever I was writing most of the chapters, but I never realized what it was until i saw your comment.

Thank you for your concern, and I will try my hardest to separate reality from my written work in the future.

  Harry Potter gets captured in his 6th year, only to die and get sent back in time.. with a twist. He is reborn a girl with wild and uncontrollable magic as he tries to stop Voldemort's first rise to power with the help of Dumbledore. Can he change the future? Or is it set in stone?

  Built like an assassin. That's how most would stereotype her. Unfortunately for her superiors, with the qualities of a killer come the qualities of someone who doesn't like to follow orders, and she was never one to conform with the darkness of Konoha anyways. Not even if the prodigy with the Sharingan tries to stop her. Of course, she never anticipated him taking her side. AU.
