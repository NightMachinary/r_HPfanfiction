Voldemort strolls into the ICW headquarters and holds the entire planet hostage, many seek to obliviate him, but he enjoys torturing the brave few who dare to try

also, any Narnia crossovers?

** Well, within Narnia lore, Charn magic explicitly doesn't work on Earth. So even, if he uses the word, nothing would happen. :D

​

But assuming such magic would work for the sake of the story: the best move would be to get his location and nuke it.

Hmm...by that logic, if the Deplorable Word for one world doesn't work on another, you could get a story out of the heroes either trying to banish Voldemort to another world (since the horcruxes stop him being killed outright), or themselves trying to evacuate as many people from Earth as possible before he uses the Word.\\
Who knows, it could be double-crossover material, if it's not Narnia that Harry & co. flee to.

*** I feel as if the ICW headquarters are going to be unplottable, muggle-repelling, and secluded with protective enchantments to boot.

**** The good thing about nukes is that "aiming" is sort of optional. You don't need its exact location, just bomb the city it's in.

***** The secluded part would imply it's not in a city. Protective enchantments would nullify the blast if the nuke even detonated. Electrical interference means nuke safeties would kick in. The list goes on. Probably easier to just unleash Nundu's breath.

****** Well I'm assuming there will be wizards in on it to help handle the magical side of things like breaking these enchantments or bewitching the nuke to still work etc.

** I'd rather see what would happen if Harry had suddenly found out how to make the “Brown Noise” with his wand, but making sure that he wore earplugs to avoid having it happen to himself...

And yes, I'm referring to the South Park episode...

** Plot twist: the book he learned the deplorable word from used a transcription system that he was unfamiliar with so he fails to realize that the word contains a series of nasalized retroflex clicks with a dipping tone followed by a cluster of ejective consonants.
