Petrificus Somewhatus has earned a new life long follower in me and i hope you all give this fic a read its fucking brilliant.

**** I doubt I would be able to write Harry/Luna well because that pairing has never resonated with me. Luna is brilliant but her personality is so unique and different from Harry's I personally can't see them being together romantically.

Harry/Tonks would be interesting though...I can see a reality where they would be a couple. They have a lot of things in common, similar humor and Harry could do with someone who could help lighten him up a bit.

** It is one of the all time greats but what I loved most was that it doesn't go down the route of Daphne making Harry more Slytherin because Slytherins are better than stupid Gryffindors etc. etc.

Instead, for perhaps the first time ever, Daphne comes to appreciate how much better being a Gryffindor is and becomes a better person for it. She becomes more open, direct and friendly. It is a fantastic reversal of the standard tropes.

It just sucks away all narrative tension when it reveals--in the context of a school presentation, no less--that they've already defeated Voldemort

I just don't like that in the first 500 words we already know how things will end.

I guess the tension comes from how the romance develops, but I don't find this particular ship so captivating that I'd want to read a story on the strength of its sails alone.

I wanted anyone hoping for action scenes and exciting battles to know that this probably wouldn't be the story for them. I wanted people to know from the off the scene when Voldemort was defeated was 'boring'...the presentation was the best way I could think of to do that.

Cause I believe that not knowing how they are going to play it out is the best way to build up a story.

Dude, Harry Potter and the Betrothal Contract was innovative in its own way by having a different approach to defeating Voldemort and held me quite on the edge for more.

I wont spoil it but thats my #1 for HP/DG pairing. I'll link it down. Give it a try and as you said, To each his own.

For some retarded reason I could never get past the first chapter, I really didn't like it. But once I got in there, I couldn't stop reading. Very well written, good character interaction, slow romance with a believable flow of events and a nice touch for side characters. Probably the best newish Harry/Daphne story, and certainly one of the best including the oldest one.
