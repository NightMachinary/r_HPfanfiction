#+TITLE: Harry was sat in the common room with a ball of... Something, floating above his hand. Every few seconds, the ball would take different shapes. A pencil, a feather, a small chair.

When asked what the ball was, Harry replied "what do you mean 'what is it'? It's a rock I transfigured into fabric of reality. I assumed you of all people would know that, Hermione."


** Commenting just for more people to see this.

Honestly this will either be a huge power-wank or extremelysmart!Harry

** When asked what the ball was, Harry replied "what do you mean 'what is it'? It's a rock I transfigured into fabric of reality. I assumed you of all people would know that, Hermione."

Hermione of course scoffed, muttered something about obviously she knew but could he explain it to others, then quickly excused herself to the library.

Truthfully the lessons with Dumbledore had been going entirely too well and the wizard had posed this as a challenge to Harry in an attempt to slow him down. How was Harry to focus on ending the war when he was too busy exploring the truly mind bending limits, or lack there of, of magic.

Unfortunately Harry was inexperienced and could no more control the constantly shifting ball of all realities than a common house kneazle could control the weather, which was to say more than you'd expect, but less than you'd hope. This meant that it became a staple attraction anywhere Harry went, following him from the time he woke up in the morning until he fell asleep in the evening.

Needless to say Dumbledore was ecstatic his ruse had worked.

That is until that fateful afternoon when a curious Dean Thomas, an avid Indiana Jones fan, recognised the wooden casket that the reality ball had become. His best mate Seamus, with his powers of Catholic guilt, advised against opening the Ark but Dean was not to be deterred.

In total seven students faces melted, three exploded, two disapparated never to be seen again, and one Harry Potter's scar disappeared.

Sybil Trelwaney was let go that summer after being unable to get anyone to believe her that the Dark Lord Voldemort had come and gone due to the events of that year.

Whether or not this was a cover-up by Dumbledore, only Ron Weasley would ever know thanks to his eventual time travel shenanigans in an attempt to save the Chudley Cannons' chance at a Quidditch cup. He was, obviously, unsuccessful.

** I had a friend that would always bring up a guy from the third movie. Sitting in the bar reading a Stephen Hawking book and stiring his drink with wandless magic.
