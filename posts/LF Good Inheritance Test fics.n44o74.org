I'd like to read some longer Inheritance test fics. I prefer no Hermione/Ron pairings but otherwise am open to anything well written and interesting!


** I just read Rewriting Destiny By mayawrites95 on ao3. Inheritance tests aren't a primary focus, but it has some interesting pieces about family magics and muggleborns claiming their ancestral family magics. Its a dramione where the pair are sent back to marauder era and covers the full 7 years of their schooling. It was a really enjoyable read
