I would like for the fic to be focused on the magic side of things, if possible.

Also, Harry Must Be Main Character.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was.

** Well, damn... I've read a few fics I really liked that had Harry descending into being a very dark wizard, but aside of already mentioned Blood Crest they tend to put more focus on relationship aspects rather than worldbuilding..

Maybe some of Lomonaaeren's works will be to your liking, they have a very characteristic style of writing that does not fit everyone's tastes, but I always found their take on the magic of the HP world interesting, and they do have some darker stories, from what I remember...

If you don't mind Tom/Harry you could try Horror of Our Love by Leontina, it's been a while since I've read it but I remember Harry making a horcrux. I really liked the dark feel the story got in the later part, but it's sadly unfinished, and like I said, more relationship than magic focus, plus the pairing might push some people away.

"Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived" by The Santi is focused around dark magic curriculum, but that one is well known enough that you've probably tried it already.

"The One True King" by SharaLunison also has a very dark feel through it, but it's very AU (Harry is James' brother, for start) and also is relationship-focused...

​

It's sad that I don't have anything that fits what you're looking for better, but I'd love to read some of such fanfics, so I'm going to keep an eye on this thread~

** Can't link as the material approaches Ludicrous levels of inappropriateness (and overwordiness) but search for the Enter the Silver Flame series by SamStone, probably best found on hpfanficarchive.com. The original story was known as Harry & Kiki: Tales of the Boy Necromancer.

If you weren't wedded to the idea of Harry as the MC, I'd suggest trying the Black Queen series by Silently Watches. Main character is Jennifer Potter, the abandoned (not)squib sister of the boy who lived, Danny Potter.
