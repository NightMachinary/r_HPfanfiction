I'm looking for a story, where Harry uses brutal, even vicious methods to get rid of dark aligned people, without care for human life. Either be it Slytherins/other students, Death Eaters, and other people. One condition, he himself can't be evil.

Bonus points if he's still in school, and the story isn't filled with porn (I'm looking at you "For Love of Magic").

*** I absolutely loved this story except for one small section: when he's murdered on the train. It totally ruined my suspension of disbelief. I just thought to myself: what school kid just up and decides to murder Harry Potter? It must have been a spontaneous decision and not planned since the next time he takes the train he doesn't get murdered. I was also a bit baffled that Harry wouldn't have wanted to find out who did it because kids and teenagers who spontaneously decide to kill for any reason have some serious issues and Harry might want to have that kid committed or something. Anyway, sorry about that rambling. It was just one moment in an otherwise great story that bothered me. I highly recommend it.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

****** I'm not actually of the "Heroes should never kill" school of thought. While I certainly admire heroes who don't more, I get that sometimes villains are too dangerous to let live. Like if Batman had ended up killing the Joker, that wouldn't make Batman evil because nothing else clearly works on the Joker. (Of course, there's no way he'd actually stay dead either, but still.)

I just think killing should be a last resort, not the default one.

Someone who kills without a thought, whose first impulse when deciding that someone is evil is to not only kill them, but BRUTALLY and VICIOUSLY kill them... that person has crossed the line to evil. Then it's not about stopping someone dangerous anymore, then it's just about causing pain, suffering and death to people you have decided deserve it.

******* Sometimes lesser evil is needed to get rid of the bigger one.

And usually, those that mercilessly kill criminals don't do that because they decided they deserve that, but the law and overall human morality decide. No anti-hero kills for jaywalking because that would make them a plain old villain, and I think we can all agree that murderers, child rapists, drug lords and in the case of HP Death Eaters deserve the "flying led poisoning". And if before kicking the bucket they'll feel a bit of pain they caused to the innocent, it won't keep me awake at night.

******** That's vengeance talking, not justice. The innocents aren't going to be any more or less dead if you torture the villains before killing them... and the dead can't be called back to life just because you kill their murderer in a particularly brutal way.

I already agreed that in some cases killing is justified -- but killing as the first and only solution isn't. Taking a human life is sometimes the only way, but it's never something that should be done lightly, even if said human life belongs to the worst child-murdering rapist ever.

Elating yourself to judge, jury and executioner is a dangerous game at the best of times, and going up to "brutal and vicious" is seldom a sign that you're at all fit for that role... and going straight to "killing" as soon as you've decided that this person is part of a group you don't like? That's the act of a villain, not an anti-hero.

Like I said in my post above, I'm not saying that I think killing automatically makes you evil. I AM however saying that I think "brutally murdering" DOES make you evil. By the time you've reached that point it's not about stopping dangerous people anymore, it's just about making them suffer.

A hero might sometimes be forced to kill, and be no less a hero for it. But a hero shouldn't care MORE about killing the guilty than about making sure the innocent live.
