Since Rolling doesn't talk about them that much I wanted to know you guys interpretations about them from the books and movies. Oh and when I say Mermaids I mean the warmer water Sirens, not the ones in the Black Lake.


** No opinion on Mermaids, they are more or less sapient animals, but Vampires are problematic.

I don't like them. I think it was one of small jokes by JKR which cannot be developed fully, because it really doesn't work with the rest of the universe. To the realistic bourgeoisie world of more or less rationalist down-to-earch craftsmen, shopowners, ministry officials, you suddenly get a creature which works in completely different world: much more mythical, unearthly, etc. Every fanfic story which tries to involve vampires more fully ends with disaster (Northumbrian has his Auror Camelia Tepes, but I think she doesn't exactly fit into what proper vampire should be).
