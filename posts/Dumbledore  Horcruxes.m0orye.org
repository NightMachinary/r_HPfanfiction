Hi all! I was wondering when Dumbledore KNEW for sure that Tom made Horcruxes. The reason I ask is that we know he suspected after the Diary, but he doesn't seem to take any action to destroy them until HBP. Is it just that he waited until Voldie came back (not that that really makes sense) or did it take him 3 full years to figure out what the Diary was?? Along those lines, when did he figure out that Harry was a Horcrux? Some people say that he knew Harry had to die from the very beginning, but how could he know that if he didn't know he was a Horcrux?? And if he DID know that Harry was a Horcrux right from the start, then he must have known that Tom made them. But if he knew that...why did he wait 15 years to start looking for them?

I may just be overthinking this, but it's bothering me a bit. Lmk what y'all think.


** I think we're supposed to believe he spends that 3 years gathering info and looking for them, which I guess is believable given that he has to track people down and get through 50+ years of someone's life

He knows Harry is Horcrux by the end of CoS.

  “You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,” said Dumbledore calmly, “because Lord Voldemort --- who is the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin --- can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm much mistaken, he transferred some of his ownpowers to you the night he gave you > that scar. Not something he intended to do, I'm sure. . . .”

  “Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?” Harry said, thunderstruck.

  “It certainly seems so.”

** I think he knew Diary was serious shit, but not what kind of shit until Voldemort return. The discovery of Harry's connection played a big part in that, but, with the Ministry role in year 5 and having his hands busy his progress was little. Probably he gathered those memories and made conjectures in year 5, but didn't put them into use until summer of 1996

** My head canon is as follows:

Voldemort's defeat until COS: Dumbledore knows Voldemort survived and is out there somehow, but he doesn't know how. He spends this time researching and may have come across horcuxes in his studies, but isn't able to confirm anything.

COS: Harry brings Voldemort the diary and horcruxes are confirmed. Dumbledore also highly suspects Harry is a horcrux. Not sure when exactly Dumbledore considers it confirmed, but most likely when he realizes Harry's scar hurts when Voldemort is up to something (which I believe is about midway through GOF). Now that he knows what he's looking for, he starts theorizing about other possible horcruxes in his spare time - keep in minds he's still headmaster, Supreme Mugwump, Chief Warlock, etc.. Tom is still a disembodied wraith, so there's no immediate rush.

POA: Dumbledore is a bit preoccupied making sure Harry isn't killed by Sirius Black to do much searching. Unfortunately, all things considered. This was Harry's safest year.

GOF: Preoccupied hosting the TriWiz and dealing with the curveball of Harry being entered. Not much time for horcrux hunting. Dumbledore immediately realizes how Harry may survive when Harry explained how Voldemort returned using his blood. Later gives Snape orders to have Harry let himself be killed by Voldemort specifically.

OOTP: Shit hits the fan. Voldemort is back and the Ministry is doing worse than nothing about it. Dumbeldore's time is spent running the Order.

HBP: Dumbledore's backburner research has paid off and he finds the Ring. And he's also dying. Fuck. On a clock now, Dumbledore lets his other duties suffer and concentrates on horcrux hunting. He sends Harry to get a number from Slughorn. He begins to provide Harry with information on Tom's past in the hopes it'll help him find the remaining horcruxes. Notably, Dumbledore correctly identifies all but one, the diadem

** Depends on what you think of Dumbledore as a whole.

Me personally? Albus found out How Riddle remained alive after the Diary showed up, but didn't do anything about it until he got poisoned/cursed. Now living with a literal deadline, he had to rush to let someone else finish the job for him. As to when he realized Harry was a Horcrux, during GoF would be my guess. iirc Harry mentioned the dreams to Sirius, I don't see Sirius keeping that to himself.

*** I think Dumbledore realized Harry was a horcrux in COS when he got the diary and realized that was how Tom was still 'alive'. GOF is when Dumbledore realized how Harry was going to survive. When Harry explained how Voldemort came back using his blood, inwardly Dumbledore was thinking 'Yes! That's it!'

** I think most things are as other people said but I believe Dumbledore suspected Voldemort had latched, even if unintentionally, a piece of his soul to Harry from the start because he expresses his concern that Voldemort might have survived right in the first chapter. He has very little to go off but I think that he might gotten some form of confirmation when Harry is revealed as a Parselmouth because he is happy to learn Voldemort had used Harry's blood in his resurrection at the end GoF. It's then when he gets his confirmation that Voldemort had created multiple Horcruxes when he says that he'd gone down the path of immortality further than anyone else. I believe that's when he starts his research on Voldemort. The final confirmation that Harry is a Horcrux I believe comes when Harry has the dream through the eyes of the snake and he does that thing with his device which tells him that Harry is not possessed.

** I think he suspected it from the beginning: 'Scars can be usefull" he said when he left an orphan to what he later acknowledged to be dark years at the Dursley's.

** He didn't know for sure Voldemort intentionally made multiple Horcruxes right after CoS. He knew it wasn't like Voldemort to leave something so important to someone else to guard unless he had a back up but remember, there was no precedent of someone ever making multiple Horcruxes so he only had a vague suspicion. Even if he wanted to act on that vague suspicion:

1) he couldn't have known what to look for. Remember, thematically the diary is entirely different from the rest of the Horcruxes. With the diary and Harry being the only known horcruxes, the possible other horcruxes could be literally anything. If Voldemort had given say, the cup to Lucius he could have probably won the war because no one would suspect Voldemort would consider his school diary to be the same value as the founder relics or his family ring

2) couldn't have known where to begin the search. I think there is no evidence in canon that Dumbledore knew anything about Voldemort's parents at this point, he probably only found out about them after GoF when Voldemort bragged about his muggle father to Harry.

Visiting Little Harlengton would lead him to the Gaunts and eventually by the end of OoTP to the ring, and by following Merope's tail he finds out about the locket- and when he figures out the last known location of the locket he finds out it went missing along with the cup, estabilishing a pattern of founder relics.

I believe he only found out about Nagini being a horcrux after Harry had that vision about Arthur getting attacked.

Also his suspicion about multiple intentional Horcruxes only gets confirmed after the graveyard scene (Voldemort said something along the lines of venturing farther into the path of immortality than anyone else) and he gets the final confirmation of the intended number from Slughorns memory.

TL;DR he didn't know before GoF

** Yeah, he could've destroyed the horcruxes after James and Lily Potter died, when Voldemort was most vulnerable
