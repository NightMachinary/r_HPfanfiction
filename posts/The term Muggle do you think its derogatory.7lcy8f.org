What if it isn't just a regional slang term but a derogatory one? It became even more apparent after seeing Fantastic Beasts that in the Magical USA they use the term No-Majs. Considering that Magical Britain has a huge Pure-Blood movement and believe they would a derogatory term for those lessers than them (ie. Mudblood, Blood-traitor) what are your thoughts of this?

*** Wait, but if "Mudblood" is a slur, then "muggle" absolutely is a slur because they're saying that what makes the person's blood "dirty" is that filthy, stinking muggle blood. "Muggle" is the "mud" in that term. Saying it's not a slur is like saying "Being (ethnicity A) isn't bad. What? You're half (Ethnicity A) and half (Ethnicity B)? Your blood contains (Ethnicity A) blood? Unclean."

** My first thought was that there's no evidence in canon that muggle gets used as a slur. But then I flipped through /Philosopher's Stone/ and realized I was wrong. Some wizards, though not all, do use "muggle" as a derogatory putdown. Specifically, Hagrid.

His first usage of the word "muggle", in his second line of dialog, is to say "but I got [the infant Harry] out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around." For context, the muggles were "swarmin' around" the near destroyed Potter house in Godric's Hollow. Given how things work in the real world, this means police officers or firefighters, maybe some concerned neighbors*. But Hagrid sees this as swarm behavior.

That one is a bit of a stretch, but a pattern emerges. Later, Hagrid cries and expresses upset: "But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead -- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles --" Hagrid has just arrived at Privet Drive. Unlike McGonagall, who had been there for hours, he had no knowledge of the Dursleys. So he wasn't upset because he knew that they were terrible people who would put Harry in a cupboard. Instead, his objection is entirely in the fact that they are muggles. It's clear that he thinks of muggles as lesser.

Fast-forward ten years and Harry gets his first exposure to the term "muggle". Hagrid, a very large and physically imposing man has just kicked open the door---"the door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges"---of the Dursley's rented abode. They are staying at a shack on a small island in an attempt to avoid the persistent, and unwelcome to their eyes, harassment by Hogwarts acceptance letters. This half-giant of a man has taken Vernon's gun---his only hope to try to protect his family should this man attack them---and bent it into a knot with his bare hands. He then has a little conversation with Harry, telling him he's going to Hogwarts. Vernon puts his foot down and says he won't let Harry go there. And then the m-word gets dropped.

#+begin_quote
  "I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him," [Hagrid] said.

  "A what?" said Harry, interested.

  "A Muggle," said Hagrid, "it's what we call nonmagic folk like thern. An' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on."
#+end_quote

To Hagrid, the badness of the Dursleys is tied up in their muggleness. One only has to call them muggles and it is made clear why it's bad luck to grow up in a family of really muggly muggles.

Later in the scene Hagrid commits a hate crime against an eleven year-old boy via a botched transfiguration.

* Because the Potter house had been under a /fidelius/, what the neighbors saw that day was a partially destroryed house suddenly appearing where they had previously not seen a house. They were right to be concerned.

*** You definitely hit the nail on the head here! I love Hagrid, but he's a bit of an anti-Muggle bigot. It's also pretty unfair of him to give DUDLEY the pig's tail when it was VERNON who spoke against Dumbledore... Dudley was for once completely innocent.

Yeah, the readers know Dudley is a nasty bully, but Hagrid didn't know. So it really comes across more as a "you're a Muggle and you're fat, so I'm going to try turning you into a pig Just Because."

I also found McGonagall to be very anti-Muggle in that opening chapter... a lot of people seem to think she's warning Dumbledore that the Dursleys won't treat Harry well, but in actuality she objects to leaving Harry with them because they're "not like us" -- her entire argument seems to be that Harry shouldn't be left with the Dursleys becausr the Dursleys are Muggles. (And because Dudley, who was just one and a half years old at the time, was throwing a temper tantrum, because wizard babies are always perfectly well-behaved?)

There is certainly a disdain for Muggles that's pretty common among wizards. "Muggle" is used as a degoratory term a few times, for example in "Goblet of Fire" when Hermione begins receiving hate-mail. One of the nastier letters says "Go back where you come from, Muggle."

So yeah... there is some canon presedent for wizards using "Muggle" as a slur or at least as an insult.

*** The fact that someone uses it judgmentally does not make something inherently a slur. Faggot is a slur, while gay is not. Nigger is a slur, while black is not. With neutral terms, like black or gay, the intent is what makes them potentially offensive, not the word itself. He'll, it doesn't even have to be on something so polarising as black vs white, gay vs straight etc; oh, you're from (insert town)? You're a (insert profession), are you? You do (insert any arbitrary pastime)? - all can be derogatory if that's the speakers intent, without being inherently derogatory.

** Yes and no. I think wizards (of all nationalities, and /especially/ the USA) consider /being/ a Muggle rather ghastly, and so it's not the /term/ that's derogatory, it's the thing referred to.

I'd draw a comparison with the word "poo". The word isn't considered rude but the thing it refers to is not something you want to think about, and certainly dinner table conversation.

That's how derogatory slurs often work. "Faggot" is a slur because it is the thing being referred to---a queer man---that is seen as abject. Which is why it's a derogatory term.

**** I think faggot is a bad comparison to muggle since faggot IS a slur yet gay isn't; much like how muggle isn't a slur but mudblood is. muggle can be used offensively/as an insult yet can also be used in polite company and is the accepted term just like how gay can "that's so gay" etc but gay isn't inherently offensive and is the accepted term just like how muggle isn't inherently a slur in the same way mudblood is.

** Well....for the most part I'd argue no. I can't help but relate to a previous experience. I was young and lived in a tourist town where there was the very rich and the very poor. One of my best mates was with his Mom. We were all in the car, and I was in the back seat. They started talking about the "aliens" in the town. I couldn't help but be offended. I am a U.S. citizen, but one of my other best mates was El Salvadoran. Being young, idyllic, relatively new in town with a dislike in labels, I vehemently mentioned my offense. They then declared that it wasn't at all meant to be derogatory...it was simply how they were described. Politics aside, my offense derived from semantics or at its essence the meaning of the word alien and the connotations of it. By describing a person as alien, it could also possibly connote or convey a sense that they don't belong...foreign...that they are figuratively yet obviously from outer space. In the small community in which I found myself to be a participant in, I declared it offensive. Like others that have already commented, it is the intent and the circumstance that could make the word derogatory, not simply the application of the word. Regarding J.K. Rowling's world, the word muggle in its essential definition without cultural, political or personal connotations, quite simply means people who do not possess magical capabilities. Therefore, at its essence, the word muggle is simply a classification of biology, and thus to an extent a situation of contrasts: magical folk in comparison to non-magical. So, again, is the word muggle derogatory? For the most part, I'd argue no.

** Hmmmm, I'm never sure about this.

I think maybe all magical people who have grown up in the wizarding world will have some degree of internalised prejudice towards muggles. Obviously, you have wizards like Arthur Weasley, who try their best to unlearn prejudiced views about muggles, but even Arthur Weasley talks about muggles almost as if their are children, or as though they are some fascinating creature nothing like him that he wants to study, which is kind of dehumanising. I feel like wizards like Arthur Weasley and Hagrid portray what in real life would correlate to something like casual racism/sexism, which they think is harmless and often is said with good intentions, but comes from a place of prejudice all the same.

So yeah, I guess I would say muggle is kind of a slur. Also, their are enough witches/wizards in the series that /do/ use muggle negatively, that imo it would be better if everyone simply said 'non magical persons', which is simply stating a fact and doesn't have the same history and disdain around it as 'muggle'.

** Anyting and everything is derogatory if it's used in a derogatory way.

Personally I see it as just a contraction/corruption of "magicless". As such, it's just a simple descriptive term that carries no positive or negative conotations with it.\\
Then again, so was N****r at one point.

So it depends on how the word ends up being used by the majority of people over an extended period. At the time of canon HP? Probably not. Though I am sure that some of those who used it definitely did mean it in a derogatory way. In the future it might very well become such though.

*** In my opinion it makes more sense to use new-blood or first-blood, 'cause there are purebloods, mudbloods and halfbloods all terms with blood, therefore muggleborn should be switched with a term with 'blood' in it. Personally I like reading fics with uses of the word muggle more often than other because first-gens mundanes etc. are ridiculous. The term muggle/muggleborn is not a slur but often used as such.
