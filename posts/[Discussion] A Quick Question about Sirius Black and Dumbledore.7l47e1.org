Just a minor detail for a fic I'm writing, but perhaps a meaningful one. Do you think (present-day) Sirius would refer to Dumbledore as "Albus", as "Professor", or as "Dumbledore"?


** Depends. Is he talking to fellow adults/Dumbledore himself or to Harry and company? Because the former would probably be Albus or Dumbledore depending, and the latter would be Professor Dumbledore/Headmaster Dumbledore.

**** Albus, most likely. It is the man's name after all, and they are adults who get along well.

** I read a funny fic some time ago, and there the Marauders pick each day one of Dumbledores first names. This one then stuck for the day, even in front of Dumbledore. But to your question, I think to Dumbledore it depends on the familiarity between them but in most fics it's either Albus or Professor. In front of Harry (without Dumbledore present) I think (because Sirius is immature) he would call him Albus or one of the other first names.

If you post your story, can you link it here, so we can appreciate it too?

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, secrets are uncovered, and loopholes are delightfully abused.

** I think he'd call him Albus, since I think Dumbledore would prefer to be addressed like that.

** If talking to DD alone in an informal situation, I would say Albus. In mixed company with kids around, maybe Professor.

** Probably "Dumbledore." Most adults seem to address him that way. I think the only one to call him "Albus" was McGonagall.
