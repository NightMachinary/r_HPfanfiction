  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** I just realised that a society of free house-elves would likely be a communist one: they feel compulsion to work, so everyone will perform according to their ability; and they have very modest needs, so providing each according to their need is easy.

Unfortunately, I would expect them to develop a currency in order to allocate available work: a house-elf earns "money" by resting and spends it by bidding on the chores that they would get to do.

** Wouldn't it be more interesting for a "communist Harry" story for Harry to decide that he was too weak on his own to defeat Voldemort and his death eaters so he, Hermione and Ron would work to create participatory magic that required many wizards and witches to cast together to create a magnification effect and that magic required empathy and group practice to pull off. The power that the dark lord knows not would be.... magical communism!

The danger of it might be maybe that this magic could be corrupted by a individual who tried to utilize the power of the group to his or her own ends and that the magic when it was at it's strongest could suppress your individuality.

Maybe something like this would be more interesting. What do others here think?

*** The workers seize the means of production. Typically they organize a government and economic system together that prevents the accumulation of capital. This is rather vaguely defined, but (for instance) a wealth tax with a 100% bracket would potentially qualify, as would an economy in which money automatically expires, or one in which all economic activity is the sole purview of the state.

***** Careful saying that out loud if you live in America. There's a lot of people here who have very strong feelings against communism - or anything even remotely resembling it. The reasons why are a bit too complex to go into on this particular sub (since there's a ton of historical context you'd need to know), but suffice to say that you could get beat up if you said you liked communism (or "socialism", for that matter) in front of the wrong crowd. And they wouldn't care if you actually knew what it was or not.

We don't know yet how good a government we can make, communist or otherwise.

All communist countries to date have been dictatorships, and dictatorships suck. (But then, most governments have been dictatorships or oligarchies of some sort.) Communism was good for Russia because it replaced the Tsars, who were brutal to almost everyone, with a government that was far less brutal to most people. But it was still a dictatorship, and it still had a lot of problems. It also got Russia to become an empire, and countries benefit from being empires, at the expense of all the countries they're being empires toward.

Russia tried to get a central planning office to tell everyone what to do to make the economy work. This wasn't great. On the one hand, they built up their ability to manufacture goods very fast. On the other hand, people could game the system in ways they couldn't in capitalism. For instance, a factory had to make a certain number of shoes per year. But they couldn't get much leather. So they made shoes too small for anyone to wear, just so they could make as many shoes as the central planning office said they should. Another factory had to produce tractors, but the planning office only checked how many wheels they made, so the factory made wheels and not tractors.

All the other communist countries were also dictatorships, working closely with Russia and trying to use the same sort of economy.

What we learned from Russia is that planned economies are hard. What people say we learned is that communism doesn't work.

Once Russia stopped holding up its empire, the remaining communist countries struggled to find trading partners. It's hard to be prosperous without trade.

******** Wow there buddy, you might want to recheck some of your facts. Firstly the Bolsheviks didn't replace the Tsar's, they replaced the Provisional government in a bloody coup, who had peacefully demanded the Tsar step down. Not to mention that Tsarist Russia wasn't as brutal as you say, some things were very backwards but they were certainly on the right path before the war started.

Now with the Bolsheviks ousting the Provisional government this is a much more murky mess as the PG was making progress, they were setting up a democratically elected system and moving towards a more western style of government, of which the Bolsheviks were a political party in. Their major failure was not pulling out of the war when they took power, a reasons the Bolsheviks used as an excuse to take power. Hell the PG even let the Tsar and his family live in exile, where the Bolsheviks had them killed in the home, even the dog, I mean really bit far with that one IMO.

Now in regards to what they did after taking power, they plunged the country into a bloody civil war, and then set up a system that directly led to Stalin taking power as a brutal dictator who had over 20+ million people killed. As far as I know only really eclipsed by Mao with his 50+ million killed in the dictator kill list, also communist btw.

Empire wise, the USSR didn't turn Russia into an empire, it already was and it also owned the majority of the land they took back after WW2. Might be wrong but I'm pretty sure the Russian Empire under the Tsar's owned more land then under the USSR.

Just wanted to add on to the end though that while I don't even believe that Communism could ever work, I do avocate for a hybrid Socio-capitalist system similar to what is currently used in Scandinavia and parts of Europe, and as a European (for now at least) I don't really get much flak for this.

******* It's a type of government that has the potential to work in theory, assuming that every single person in a country would be on board with the idea, but how it has ended up working in practice - historically speaking - has turned out quite different. Places that have adopted communism, such as China, Cuba, the Soviet Union (which has since split up into Russia and several smaller countries), and North Korea, haven't been very good places to live - but at the same time, we should note that they've followed a modified version of communism that is different from the system as it was originally theorized (by someone named Karl Marx, whom you may have heard of).

As to whether any form of government is "bad", that really just depends on how well its people implement it. Nothing's perfect, and anything will reveal some internal flaws if it's left to develop long enough. Is the Ministry of Magic a "bad" government? Depends on who's running it. Under Fudge, not that great. Under Voldemort, even worse. Under Hermione, pretty good. There's still plenty of people out there who think that communism / socialism has only failed so far because the previous countries who tried it got Marx's ideas wrong - and there's plenty of other people who are anti-communist because they think Marx's idea just can't ever work in a way that would produce an enjoyable life for people.

***** Why? Because communism does not scale well.

At the 'commune' level, it works well enough. There are plenty of examples in all sorts of places, where groups of likeminded people join. The problem comes when you start scaling up, once you get beyond the 'everyone knows everyone else on a first-name basis', or when people with a different set of values are forced to join, it all breaks down.
