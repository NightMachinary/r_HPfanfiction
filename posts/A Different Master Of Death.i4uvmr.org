What if when someone brings all Deathly Hallows together, instead of gaining the title "Master of Death", their body/soul are taken over by an other-worldly entity named The Master of Death.

I'm imagining that sometime during Harry's 6th year, Dumbledore gains possession of the cloak and brings the deathly hallows together. Eventually Harry and Voldemort have to team up to stop The Master of Death from opening a portal to the underworld/summoning leagues of undead.


** "I am...the Master of Death!"

Harry and Voldemort shared a look of confusion, "Who?"

"THE MASTER OF DEATH!" Seeing Harry and Voldemort's puzzled expressions, Dumbledore's face fell. "You know, Death's master, the story of the three brothers?"

"Nope never heard of it" Harry replied. "I was muggle-raised, remember?"
