Hey all, I'm looking for some fics that focus on female characters in the series, either well-known or relatively unknown women. I prefer longer stories, don't necessarily have to be complete, but most importantly just not centered around Hermione. I'd also like them to focus more on the character being out of school, so not at Hogwarts fics, but I'll give them a chance if they're strongly recommended. Thanks so much everyone :)


** *Classic and superb examples of Ginny:*

- linkffn(Seeking Ginny by Casca) (Best HPFF Romance fic bar none IMO)

- linkffn(Changeling by Annerb)

- For more of Ginny, check out hpfan1111's work if you can find it.

*There's always fem!Harry fics:*

- linkffn(A Long Journey Home)

- linkffn(Holly Potter and the Spiral Path)

- linkffn(4040192) (The continuation of SilverAegis's classic, but poorly aged "Harry Potter & The Girl Who Lived" fic)

- Any number of fem!Harry fics listed in various threads such as this one: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/44dfef/]]

*OC fics of fantastic quality, all written from the perspective of Muggle women:*

- I'd be surprised if you hadn't heard of linkffn(Grow Young with Me)

- Classic, but slightly more obscure linkffn(Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss)

- linkffn(The Strangers at Drakeshaugh)

*Some slightly off-base ones, but interesting otherwise:*

- This has a fair amount of POV changes (some male) but offers some fun and unique Luna POV if you don't mind some NC-17 situations. You have to register to read it. [[http://mujaji.net/%7Emujaji/repository/viewstory.php?sid=173&index=1][http://mujaji.net/~mujaji/repository/viewstory.php?sid=173&index=1]]

- I'm strangely, if a bit shamefully, driven to rec my own fic, but it meets all of your requirements besides "longer stories" as it's only a single short chapter. It's from Luna's POV, post-Hogwarts, but enough to get a taste. The fandom is sorely lacking Luna POV, so I don't feel too bad. linkffn(Poison and Cure by Blandge)

- If you want more of Luna there's a chapter of linkffn(C'est la Vie by cywscross) that is excellently written from Luna's POV.

*I'd also recommend looking in Lily Potter and Victoire Weasley fics if you are still unsatisfied.*

Edit: At the request of hpff IRC: linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) and its sequels.

** linkffn(10535109)

Post Hogwarts story about Parvati discovering her identity and place in the world. It is also a bit of a murder mystery fic, and has an interesting portrayal of the post-Voldemort wizarding world.

linkffn(3037156)

This is as convincing as a Voldemort/Luna story gets. The premise is reminiscent of The Arabian nights. Every night, Luna has to find a way to persuade Voldemort to let her live another day.

** I got a few that might work for you: "Breath of Life" linkffn(11038778) which is about Hannah's journey to motherhood and then, "The Unfixables" linkffn(11262352) which is a Barty/Luna fic, and while it's very Luna POV heavy, it's not entirely from her perspective, finally I'd suggest, "The Matron of Hogwarts" linkffn(11933058) which is about Poppy Pomfrey's career at Hogwarts so depending on how anit-Hogwarts you are, you may not like it and it's also a shorter fic, so...
