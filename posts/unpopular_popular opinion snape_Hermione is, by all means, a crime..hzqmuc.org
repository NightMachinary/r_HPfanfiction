** I don't mind Snape/Hermione in time travels, as I very much enjoy Harry/Bellatrix in "Delenda Est".

But Snape grooming Hogwarts Hermione is fucking pedophilia!

** Technically, any Teacher/ Student pairing is a crime. The fact that Snape could litteraly be the father of Hermione (or Harry, or any other child used for the pairing) does not make the thing less creepy.

I guess the pairing could get a tentative pass when the story happens post Hogwarts (not a teacher anymore + adult love interest), but I still find this pairing disturbing. Can't say anything about Time Travel (technically, they would both be around the same age, I guess?).

** I mean, it is fanfiction. Draco and an Apple is thing, for crying out loud. everything depends on context. And even if it is underage, teacher/student or whatever is the issue, is actually harmless to explore it in fanfiction. If SSHG is crime, then so is Harry/Tonks(it doesn't matter that the age difference is smaller), Snarry, Tom Riddle/Harry, Hermione/Sirius, Hermione/Remus, Ginny/Lucius(it is a thing apparently), and many of the multitude of pairings ou there. I've seen Harry/Minerva for fucks sake.

I don't enjoy Snape perving on Hermione from a young age(under 17) so I don't read it or give up the fic if it ever appears, but I do enjoy SSHG. Pedophilia is bad but not every fanfic has those elements, actually most of them don't or if they do they are not explored in a positive light. And hey, torture is also bad and a crime and we have it by the loads, murder is a crime and is the basic premise of this children's book. We have spells that take the will out of someone and all their ability to consent, we have death eater revels full of murder, non con/rape, torture and all that jazz. Don't like it, don't read it, but don't go shitting on someone else's favorite trope or pairing.

(On the age difference thingy, my parents are 15 years apart and happily married, Hermione and Snape's age gap is 19 years. Is really not that big of a deal. And the parents of my friend actually met when he was teaching her on junior and senior year. Also happily married.)

** Guys... don't like, don't read. It's fanfic, it's meant to be fulfilling people's fantasies, matters not if it's Harry outsmarting dumbledore and Voldemort or Snape/Hermione.

You can dislike it but going around telling what other people fantasise is wrong... that's just, idk, wanking on a moral high horse

*** I don't get what is wrong with people. Now I've seen so many posts along the lines of oh how can someone like Harry Hermione, Remus Sirius or something else. But what business is it of yours what people like? Then someone got upset when people told them that you should let people ship whoever they want to ship. I mean, if you come expecting people to just agree with you an be astonished at how horrible the shippers are and don't get it, you should have thought about this before saying everyone is crazy for liking what they like.

*** See in time travel situations i'm fine with Snape/Hermione, I just don't read them because Snape is a repulsive sack of shit, but it kinda disturbs me that their are fics where Snape actively flirts with 15 year old Hermione or grooms her from age 11 up. It's disturbing and shouldn't be a thing.

**** If you find it disturbing then just don't read it. It is that simple. But what should or shouldn't be a thing is not for you to say.

Yeah, pedophilia is bad. But having fantasies that involved minors is not a crime, reading fanfic about it is not a crime, acting on them is.

Kindly divert your attention to something else and let people fantasize in peace.

  reading fanfic about it is not a crime
#+end_quote

Actually, according to German law it is if the depictions are both explicit and realistic while an involved party if under 14. That applies to fiction.

** Ok, I'll say it. I like Snape/Hermione. I also like Hermione/Lucius and some Snape/Harry stuff. I'm a monster. I know. You don't need to tell me. Though I will say that I'm not down with under age stuff though.

The thing is it's fiction, not real life. I don't need to hold the stories I read (about magic and witches remember) to the same standards that I expect in real life.

Yes there is the dynamic of power play, he's a teacher and she's a student. And here is a way to explore these concepts in a safe way through fiction. And who here hasn't ever had a crush on teacher?
