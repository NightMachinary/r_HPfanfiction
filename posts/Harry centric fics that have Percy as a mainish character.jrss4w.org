Pretty much every fic I've ever read is really dismissive of Percy or is just straight up Percy bashing - and I totally know that in canon he was kind of a cod, but so were Snape and Malfoy and honestly Ron too half the time but we still get so many fics where they're spun in a positive light. I was hoping for some Harry centric (preferably slash) fics that involve Percy as a kinda mainish/prominent side character?


** This is a really good story with a focus on a sibling relationship between Harry and Percy: "Project Management For Beginners" by Snuffly22

  Harry had never really properly planned anything before. The fact that his first ever plan was risky and filled with assorted dangers was not actually deterring him as much as it should.In other words, this story explores how Harry's third year at Hogwarts might have played out differently if a little project management and an ambitious plan had been thrown into the mix.

  Percy is given an untidy and absent minded assistant named Audrey Larrabee to help promote himself in the Ministry. Will he be able to handle her seemingly complete apathy for the Ministry? Or will she be able to help him in ways he never dreamed of?
