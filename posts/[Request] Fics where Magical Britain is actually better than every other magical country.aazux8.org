***** Well for starters William wasn't exactly French, the Normans were originally Vikings (North man>Norman, well it would be more like the words we get north and man from, but you get the idea) who were given land in what's now France, so he'd probably have some pretty strong Norse blood, given what we know of magical society I'd reckon they cared quite a bit about ancestry like that.\\
Then again it's not like anyone in our society actually knows/cares about that and odds are wizards have an even worse education in this area, so who knows.

*** Are you saying a lot of people in the US actually hold this opinion? Or is it just a fanfic thing you hate? I'll grant you that I've never actually had a discussion regarding the merits of Britain as a place to live, but I don't think I've ever talked to anyone that seemed to hold the UK/Scotland/Ireland in poor regard. I mean, everyone on here says it's always overcast which would be depressing, but it's not as if anyone thinks it's, like, Siberia or Mississippi or something.

If you're just talking about the idea's prevalence in fanfiction, then I totally agree. For being the premiere magical school in the world, fanfic Hogwarts sure seems to churn out a buncha morons, who then go on to be government officials.

** I don't know about /better/, but in linkffn(The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope). Britain is home to many of the most powerful witches and wizards in the world. The story is an OK read I suppose.

It get's pretty trite and annoying by the end in regards to how it handles magic and stuff if you ask me though. Mostly just the author coming up with a 13+ letter name for each spell/ability that people posses or use and it just comes off as the author stroking his on dick over how "interesting" his magic system is. When really, it's probably one of the less novel magic systems to appear in fanfiction. Actually, calling it a magic system at all is a misnomer.

But if you can put that tediousness aside, then it's a decent read. Though there is not too much in terms of politics or countries' governments interacting together.

  It's funny how the world works. There are too many things near and dear to us for a wand to be drawn at every occasion. Everyone has a story, and the lines and points come together to form a web of something too ephemeral to measure. Harry thinks that the strands are snapping a bit too quickly. A rewrite of The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope. Added to the DLP Library.

** linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution)

Magical Europe is ruled by Purebloods, treating their Muggleborns like second class humans. When Hermione becomes the British Minister of Magic and Harry becomes Chief Warlock, the French Duc and the Russian Tsar declare war. Soon, more Wizards die across Europe since the times of Grindelwald, while the Muggles don't notice anything. Except for the Prime Minister who desperately tries to get the Magicals under control.

** Wizarding Britain is definitely distinguished in linkffn(Th Marriage Stone). This is one of my favorite depictions of the Wizarding World. The thing you probably won't like is the pairing and that it's a slash fic but I still think reading the fic is worth a shot, since there isn't much explicit romance between the main pairing, just a lot of tension. I'm not a fan of the pairing but there is so much world building and adventure based on Britain being a legit magical place and I really enjoy that the main plot is Harry slowly being set up as a King Arthur-like King of the Wizarding World figure. This fic was started before HBP, so there are plenty of assumptions made by the author that ended up not being canon.
