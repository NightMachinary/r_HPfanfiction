Just before the final battle the muggles are reported of having cctv footages of magic and few magical places were blown up. Voldemort and Harry teams up to find that most of the muggleborns' relatives are in the secret society created by the muggle government, including the Grangers and Dursleys. After a few days of deliberation, within which most magical places get blown up, both Dark and Light decides to protect Hogwarts and basically tightly wards up the forbidden forest,hogsmeade and Hogwarts. All the shops in Diagon Alley are moved to Hogsmeade and Hogwarts is basically cleaned up, more subjects introduced, one part is opened up to living quarters (so many abandoned classrooms) and Harry finds The Alcove of Strategy by Ravenclaw, Hollow of Battleship by Gryffindor and Cabin of Camaraderie by Hufflepuff. (In my mind the alcove is a big, big room on the seventh floor with lots of books and a watchtower and different strategy boards; the Hollow is a long tunnel ending somewhere middle of the topmost and ground floor to a big armoury and training ground; the cabin is basically a den or hangout place with lots of calming plants; and the chamber of secrets is actually a hiding place with lots of bunks inside it and a connection to the alcove, hollow, cabin and room of requirements).After some spying the muggleborns supply the magicals with muggle weapons and seek refuge in Hogwarts, the squibs join the muggle government and full scale war is declared. Voldemort's attempt to reabsorb horcruxes backfire, the horcruxes returning except the one jn Harry's scar who is the Master of Death. The ministry and most wizard manors are destroyed ,Diagon Alley is bombed and Hogwarts is the only safe place


** Well you're on good track to write your own fic, but I don't think harry and voldemort could team up if Dumbledore is alive in your fic, it would be probably a 3 way agreement between Ministry/ICW , order of Phoniex and death eaters. And if Dumbledore Is dead then I guess order of Phoniex would be useless because ministry was in voldemort's grasp in less than 2 months after Dumbledore's death and voldemort would look after that threat himself never thinking that order of Phoniex or harry potter could help him in anyway.

*** Hmmm...how about before the flight of seven Harry's? An death Eater finds out where Harry lived and Voldemort appeared there with the intention of/talking/ with Harry. Some death eaters are with him but as soon as they apparate there muggle armies start firing at them. Few DEs are dead and Voldemort himself was shot.He can't heal himself and grows wary with the muggles. Again instead of DEs muggle armies attack the seven Harrys. Snape acts as a messenger and Voldemort proposes that Harry becomes the Headmaster of Hogwarts and Voldemort the ruler( somehow, I can't imagine either Voldemort or Tom Riddle in the minister position, because it was mentioned many times that he could have been a minister but became a Dark Lord) with Hogwarts outside his influence. Voldemort himself collects all the remaining horcruxes and Umbridge /gifts/ him the locket........ How is that?

**** It would take time for harry to build any sort of trust worthy relationship with anyone on the dark side if they were being charitable. Harry was a powerful angry teenager with unshakeable grudge. He was an orphan. It could've happened if the fight between them continued beyond Harry's supposedly 7th yr and muggles got involved because of in going civil war among them just at edge of their eyes. Harry needs to grow up a lot before anything like this happens. He is still at 'I'm just harry stage."
