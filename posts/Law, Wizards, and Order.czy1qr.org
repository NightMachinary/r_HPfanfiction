While reading in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/czq36a/lf_harry_potter_fic_mixed_with_lovecraftian/][the other thread]] about linkffn(gentleman usher of the scarlet rod by Heather Sinclair) I got an idea (completely unrelated to Lovecraft), which goes against a fandom trope. In all Muggles-meet-wizarding-world I know about (e.g., linkffn(Long Live The Queen by offsides;Operation Wandless by LadyDunla)) it is always “smart muggles save hapless wizards”. It is surprising how little there is “smart wizards save muggles” stories. I know the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, but as these stories show there are ways how to go around it without dismantling it completely.

One particular plot which comes to my mind. Dudley Dursley, who after his partial humanization is of course a police officer (it would be stupid to waste those boxing skills on selling drills), is a liaison officer for Metropolitan Police in contact with DMLE (and particularly his cousin Senior Auror Harry Potter). For the muggle colleagues, he is X-Files type of guy, who investigates non-sense, but in fact he gets help in his investigation from wizards. Kind of similar to [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/104579]] just from the other side of the divide.


** A related unexplored angle is people actually thinking about *why* the wizarding world might have more extreme and harsh justice than the Muggle world.

I think the reason why this is unexplored - and the proliferation of "wizards are lectured in health and safety culture" fics - is the way magic in the dominant fanon is rendered significantly more mundane, more static, more point and shooty.

Most readers don't see magic as something genuinely mystical or arcane. They imagine there to be a defined set of magical causes and effects and that if you protect against the known causes, you are immune to the effects. They consider all the "one-off" mystical phenomena we see in the books to be unique deus ex machina rather than evidence of magic's mystical nature. So they consider it perfectly feasible to create effective wizarding prisons without dementors. All it takes is a clever application of some charms.

But if you take a more mystical view to magic, a more flexible view where "magic finds a way", then even disarmed wizards, given enough time, are likely to devise some magically inventive means of escape, or otherwise have their magic provide them some opportunity. No set of static defences, no matter how powerful or clever, are likely to prove effective -- not against the creativity and determination of the human spirit. Dementors are unique, so far as we know, in their ability to suppress a wizard's magic.

So if you take a more mystical view of magic, you see wizarding justice through the lens where you could never successfully keep a powerful witch like Bellatrix Lestrange contained unless you had dementors. The horrors of Azkaban become a necessity.

A similar theme was developed in the Dresden Files series very well. In that series, it is forbidden to use magic to harm another person directly. Doing so is an instant death sentence, no matter how minor the crime.

For most of the series, our POV character considers this a great injustice, an example of draconian rule, and the reader is along with him. Then later in the series a different perspective is explained to him: the rule isn't about /justice/, it's about /power/.

A single dark wizard, if left unchecked, could use unscrupulous means to achieve such power that they would become unstoppable by other wizards. Killing all dark wizards in the early stage of their development is the only way to prevent one of them one day rising to power and becoming a law unto themselves.

I think a similar reasoning can be applied well to the HP wizarding world. An HP wizard, left unchecked, could probably take over the entire Muggle world single-handedly. The damage a single wizard can do is horrifyingly massive. Harsh rules are therefore justified not by principles of fairness or justice, but by necessity - because it would only take one to cause massive amounts of destruction.

The important thing about all of this is that it doesn't make Azkaban right - that's a value judgement based on people's feelings about the importance of human rights vs. the safety of society etc. The point is that there is a debate to be had. And that is the key to good worldbuilding - if one group is just plainly in the right, then you're probably doing it wrong.

*** With regards to the law in Harry Potter there is always [[https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=829344]] ... some of these papers are truly scholarly legal articles, so not exactly a bit of light reading (unless your name is Hermione Granger), but for those who can read it (and I have two legal titles from two countries), it really is interesting. It turns out, Mrs. Rowling is not bad only with numbers, some of her legal ideas in the wizarding world are truly quite horrendous. This dialogue:

#+begin_quote
  [Dumbledore] “... In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.”

  “Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely.
#+end_quote

Changing law to achieve punishment of accused is something so horrible that even Stalin or Hitler never (at least openly) admitted anything like it.

***** Just that I think she is as bad with numbers as she is with her Civics. The very basic concepts like rule of law, Habeas Corpus, division of powers (yes, that's slightly more complicated in UK), are very obviously missing in the wizarding world. I wondered whether somebody should ask Fleur to introduce to the Wizarding Britain Montesquieu.

******* That is /a very/ disturbing possibility. But I really don't think so. These are really kids/young adults adventure stories, she would have to add a lot more social criticism to make that meaningful.

  Harry Potter has no idea what to do. His new Auror recruits are nothing short of hopeless. Then an idea hits him... "So, let me get this straight: we're supposed to show some wand-waving weirdoes how to do our job?" "Yes, that is the general idea." Or: failing Auror recruits get dumped with MI-5 to get a lesson in how spying is really done.
