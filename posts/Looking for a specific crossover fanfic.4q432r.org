Harry Potter is raised a Stark, and once he learns of the wizarding world, they try to force him to stay. In one of the later chapters dumbledore imprisons him at hogwarts and steps close to the bars. Harry brakes dumbledores wrist and takes his ward, stuns everyone else in the room and escapes. If anyone has any idea, feedback would be nice.
