(I'll preface this by saying I'm really just brainstorming and trying to put together a few plausible plot points for my latest project. Mainly, I'm looking for thoughtful discussion.)

So, as we know, the Grindelwald War not-so-coincidentally occurs around the same time as WW2, and there are obvious parallels between Grindelwald's and Hitler's utilitarian philosophies. The muggle and wizarding wars ending simultaneously is a ridiculous fluke imo, but as far as I've researched, Rowling's never elaborated on the matter. Look at how coy she's being [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm][here]]

SO- what are some ways Grindelwald and Hitler's agendas could have been connected? Rowling agrees that the muggle and magical wars â€˜feed each other' -- any thoughts on that? Do you think Dumbledore played a role in ending WW2 as well?


** Well, its very hard to say. We don't know everything about the second world war, and we know /very/ little about the wizarding one.

I think it is an interesting idea. Rowling states that the wars 'fed into one another', but as seen in HBP, the wizards have pretty much full control over muggle governments. The Ministry could redirect the president of the USA, no questions asked.

So what does that say for World War 2?

We do not know if whatever wizarding factions located in Germany had the same levels of control over their muggle counterparts as in Britain. For that matter, seeing as the Statute of Secrecy was enacted in the 18th century, there was no Germany to be spoken of.

Did wizarding territories of the time mirror the muggle city states? Was there a wizarding Prussia? *Is* there a wizarding Prussia?

Bulgaria, however, /is/ a magical country. In the 18th century, Bulgaria was Ottoman. Is this an inconsistency? Maybe. Nations are dynamic, however. Just because Wilhelm and Bismarck united muggle Germany, it doesn't mean it happened on the wizarding side.

/(Side note; personal head-fanon is that Grindelwald is both wizarding Bismarck and Hitler - he united Germany, and he lead it to war.)/

The HP Wiki implies Grindelwald is Hungarian, or born somewhere in Eastern Europe. It doesn't seem very plausible, with him having very strong German themes, and sharing a last name with a Swizz village. Gellert is a Hungarian name, but that does not necessarily imply him being Hungarian, especially as a Wizard.

/If/ there was indeed a wizarding force behind the German government, as seen in Britain, it is a very broad topic to try and theorize what this means. How much did the wizards there actually care for muggle matters? Did they have anything to do with the Great War?

Personally, I like to think they didn't, but they played into WW2 because they saw how a great industrial war wreaked havoc on the world and the natural states of things. Did perhaps the great catastrophes a great modern industrial war like WW2 brought upon the world bring forth modern anti-muggle tendencies?

I can see wizards being wholly unconcerned with muggles pre-Industrialization (See; laughing at the effort of witch burnings.) but the tune changing once they could see just the spread of muggle madness. Hiroshima/Nagazaki? Certainly.

While Tom Riddle is implied to be /evil/ because of his conception and his youth in an orphanage, I could very well see his anti-muggle feelings growing from growing up in London and experiencing the war shortages and the Blitz. As a matter of fact, I cannot see any wizard experienced full-scale muggle warfare and going away with anything but decisively negative feelings. Maybe the level of governmental control seen in HBP arose after the war, and it wasn't in fact things like NATO and the threat of M.A.D that brought about /Pax Americana/, but rather wizarding control?

It certainly seems plausible.

I've rambled a bit, and lost the original thread - Grindelwald. Let me try to get back on track.

Let's head to the /big bad/ first.

*The Holocaust*

I've seen in a story I've now long forgotten, where Grindelwald was searching for some sort of artifact that had fallen into Jewish hands, and the Holocaust was used as a way to efficiently search for it. This, to me, seemed rather contrived and extremely shoehorned.

The idea of the Holocaust itself is very, *very* touchy. Either way, this is not the time nor place to debate the reality of such an event, so I will just consider the common /"6 million"/ story a fact in the wizarding alternate reality.

How does that key in? As far as I can tell, Grindelwald did /not/ consider muggles something to be exterminated, rather something to be enslaved by a superior ruling class. You could use the Holocaust as a method to being exterminating muggles. World population at the time appears to have been somewhere around 1,5 billions, which does make the supposed dead in the Holocaust rather inconsequential. For the amount of resources required for this operation, and the time invested, it does not seem worth it from a pragmatic wizarding view.

On the other hand, I once had a theory that the Holocaust was some sort of morbid industrialized /"human sacrifice"/, and that it was a wizarding ploy used for.. whatever you wish, really. You'd just need an appropriate /Ritual/ that required human sacrifice. Personal power for Grindelwald? Massive scale thought control? Maybe a /Bloodline Curse/ (ala /The Dresden Files/) keyed to possible every muggle, thus requiring the large numbers of subjects?

If you somehow needed a power-up for your WW2 era wizards, this certainly could be a way to do it. You'd probably (read; definitely) offend someone, seeing as you'd essentially call the nazi's blameless and blame everything on wizards, but someone would probably be offended if you were to mention this Era in the first place, but that is just the way of things.

*Grindelwald*

Where does he fit in? Was he just a /Voldemort/ of the times? People in the HP stories constantly imply that Voldemort is the darkest and evilest Dark Lord there ever was. Maybe they are exaggerating, because Voldemort is now and relevant while Grindelwald is old and imprisoned, but it still seems rather silly. If Grindelwald was, essentially, Wizarding Hitler, you'd have to do something with the term /Dark Lord/ to make canon not seem rather faulty.

Maybe a Dark Lord is a term for the head of a magical terrorist organization? Maybe Grindelwald didn't actually use Dark magic? Either way, if Grindelwald indeed /was/ a Dark Lord, he couldn't have been Wizarding Hitler unless most characters are vastly over-exaggerating Voldemort. It'd be like comparing Bin Laden to Hitler - although neither of these were actually powerhouses of /personal/ power, like Grindelwald and Voldemort. That is just the difference between a muggle and a wizarding leader, however.

So what if Grindewald was Wizarding Hitler? He'd have to be the leader of the German(?) wizards. Did he unite Germany? Did someone else? When? Did it fall apart after he fell? Why did everyone else not interfere when Dumbledore(?) /possibly/ wanted him jailed in Nurmengard? Surely Wizarding Hitler would have been executed as his defeat, or assassinated prior to imprisonment / in prison by someone he had wronged.

Dumbledore only interfered and fought him after /supposedly/ five years of war. We can't know if the wizarding war lasted as long, or was as spread out. Dumbledore was not the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards at the time, nor did he hold any important positions but teaching at Hogwarts. As such, it was clearly a personal interference, against his old friend gone /bad/.

Did Dumbledore act against his country, attacking a foreign leader? Or was England involved in the war at the time? If it was, why didn't he interfere earlier? Surely personal problems must have been set aside for the good of the country? Dumbledore's own ideological stance certainly wouldn't allow him to do such a thing - he and Grindelwald developed the /"Greater Good"/ philosophy together, after all.

*Britain*

Perhaps this means Wizarding Britain didn't enter the war until 1945, ultimately allowing Dumbledore to act openly against Grindewald. Fanfiction often portrays Wizarding Britain as weak and backwards, but seeing as the Statue was established in the 18th century, Britain was a very powerful empire.

The Statue of Secrect was enacted in 1692, 80 years before American independence. Does this mean the territories are still under British control, or do they follow a Bulgarian example and are now, too, independent? Did the wizards there follow their muggle counterparts, or would they remain content with English rule? Why wouldn't they? They wouldn't have grown so detached from the home country with the ability to create Portkeys and Apparition, and with a much smaller population, I could see it feasible that the American territories remained British in the magical world. That could very well be the case for other colonies, also.

Or, Wizarding Britain never had any colonies at all. Australia is mentioned in DH in connection with Hermione's parents. There are no special inclination that it has a deeper connection to Britain, and its likely Hermione only sent them there because they had wanted to go there, and it is an English speaking country. You could take this little connection and make it so that the colonies still remain Wizarding British, however.

If this is the case, the British Empire would be very fierce. The Union of the Crowns occured in 1603, while Great Britain was not formed until 1707, which is post the establishment of the Statute of Secrecy. One can say with reasonable security that there is no such thing as a Scottish wizarding government, however, and can reasonably conclude that it is a part of Britain. In fact, the Wizarding world is said to be British, so this is a confirmed fact.

*The War*

So why did the wizards allow a muggle war on this scale to escalate? It could have been a reasonable way for nefarious wizards to cull the population, or it could have been a matter out of control that they could not reign in. Alternatively, the muggles could have been mere puppets that possible wizarding factions threw at each other. While a magical war would be fought swiftly and in the shadows, a muggle invasion of Poland would probably be very distracting to possible Polish-Lithuanian wizards.

The land would scorch and burn, supplies would be cut of - it is reasonable to assume wizards get their food from muggles, as there doesn't seem to be sufficient infrastructure to allow otherwise. As such, a muggle proxy war could certainly be a viable strategy. It could also have been banned by the ICW post WW2, to go back to the point of a wizarding enforced peace. Either way, there are too many possibilities to be considered.

*** (Continued because stupid max post length)

*Conclusion*

Ultimately, I think there are a great many ways the wizarding and muggle war could have been connected. Because they ended at the same time, I must believe that they were deeply connected.

I do not see a very plausible way of a muggle war starting a wizarding one. Perhaps a Japanese one, against the USA (Or the British Empire!?) after the nuclear attacks.

While firebombs and conventional weaponry would be too slow to kill wizards by much other than chance, the annihilation of two cities probably killed a great deal of wizards by chance. I do not know the formula of wizards:muggle in Britain to apply it to Japan, but I'd say it likely at least some perished in the attacks.

It's also weaponry on a scale that seems unlikely for muggles to have, so it could have been suspicion of a magical attack. I have fondled with the idea of using Hiroshima/Nagazaki as a catalyst for a wizarding war with Japan, I must admit.

Either way, based on my previous statements, I must say that it seems incredibly likely that the War started with Wizards. Maybe it was started because the Magical Voivode of Rzeczpospolita KrÃ³lestwa Polskiego spilled pumpkin juice on.. Emperor? Chancellor? Fuhrer? Grindelwald's robes. Maybe it was a territorial expansion of Magical France into Magical Germany.

Maybe Grindelwald just felt like a particularly evil villain and decided to assassinate the Grand Magical Archduke of Austria and bring War because.. why not?

Alternatively, to line in with Canon a little bit, its possible that Grindelwald began establishing his Greater Good policies in Germany and enslaving the muggles, and other Wizarding nations interfered out of the good of their hearts (Read; to preserve the Statute of Secrecy).

Possibly foreign powers declared war to topple Grindelwald and stop the utilitarian plan. Maybe Grindelwald's /reich/ (empire? kingdom? a god damn republic? WE KNOW TOO LITTLE, J.K!) declared war when offended by foreign interference?

Possibly the Greater Good plan succeeded in Germany, under the guise of a National Socialist fascist government, and war was declared because Grindelwald needed to control the wizarding population in a location before he could begin enslaving the muggles there.

/Note; Another theory is that the relative ease the Wehrmacht crushed opposition with was because Grindelwald's wizards had already conquered the enemy wizards there, and used their funky mind magic to make a muggle conquest relatively easy? Then the turn and consequent defeat of the Wehrmacht could be attributed to when foreign Wizards at last managed to make a stand against Grindelwald. Perhaps Russia could be large players?/

In the end, its impossible to say something for certain, and the events surrounding WW2 are vague and broad enough to be twisted to almost whatever the fanfic you write requires. If you need super!evil Hitler-is-literally-Antichrist Axis from a modern perspective, there certainly is enough evidence and misinformation to support that. If you want a Blamed-by-the-Allies ala WW1 setting, there certainly is enough evidence and misinformation to support that, too.

WW2 was such a massive event, and there is too little known about it to even establish everything about the real one. With the little worldbuilding outside of Harry's life J.K did, almost everything about Wizarding WW2 is pure guesswork and estimations.

Either way, I'd love to hear some comments and further discussion on this. I'm sure I have some silly points, and some wrong ones, but hey, that's what Reddit's for, right?

**** My thoughts on the subject of Grindelwald is that, as far as involvement in the Third Reich goes, he was not the power behind the throne, so to speak.

See, my headcanon when it comes to Grindelwald's reign as a Dark Lord was that, whereas the other Dark Lords sought to attract the pureblood elites into their ranks, Grindelwald went the other way.

One thing that truly struck me in canon was the fact that Durmstrang was pureblood only.

Now let's assume that as far as the European continent is concerned, Beauxbatons basically took in students from west and south of Germany-France, Holland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal to name a few. Given that this is prior to World War two, you can also make the assumption that Beauxbatons offered schooling to wizards and/or witches from French colonies such as Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, the Mauritius Islands etc.

Switzerland, given that it's the Helvetian Confederation, would either have its own hilariously over-defended and secretive school (muggle Switzerland takes its home defence /very/ seriously, hence nigh-on universal national service, the obligation to own & maintain military-grade weapons in everyday households and enough mountain shelters built to withstand direct hits from nuclear weaponry to house and sustain a substantial percentage of the population in case world war three breaks out. Do NOT fuck with the Swiss) or would have the choice of either Durmstrang or Beauxbatons.

Beauxbatons is about as inclusive as you can get. It routinely accepts Veela, has a half-giant headmistress in canon and is known to also accept muggleborn though whether or not there are selection criteria is very much not commented upon.

Durmstrang, on the other hand, is commonly thought to service Northern and Eastern Europe. Germany, Austria, Russia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary are some of the countries you'll find in that part of the world. It is also known for two things-first, it teaches Dark Magic as part of the curriculum. DADA would be mistaken as a muggle artistic movement by your average Durmstrang graduate-if said graduate happened to have any knowledge of the muggle world because this school does not accept any muggleborn at all.

Think on that for a moment. The most prestigious magical school in Eastern Europe leaves the muggleborn out in the cold. They get accepted into lesser schools where, presumably, their education suffers as a result. They then enter magical society at a distinct disadvantage due to their heritage and cannot, in theory, fight back against Durmstrang graduates who have had seven years' worth of training in the Dark Arts before they even enter the magical world.

Downtrodden, kept from moving up the social and economic ladder at every turn, the muggleborn aren't in a good spot to do anything about it.

Which is where Grindelwald comes in. He has, in this lot, a ready-made army with which he could conquer Europe provided they are willing to follow him. In exchange for further training and better positions in his new regime, he would have them do just that-conquer magical Europe in his name.

There is only one problem, namely his army's origins.

The Nazis had no qualms in labelling Eastern Europeans as inferior. Jews, Gypsies and Slavs were well known targets for their ire from very early on in the history of the Nazis, though Hitler did tone down the slav bit at the start of world war two-at least until the Wehrmacht moved into Russia.

The problem for Grindelwald would have been that most of the muggleborn in his army would have roots in the muggle communities affected by the nazis and would, therefore, blame him if they did anything nasty to their relatives (which they certainly would have).

So, if Grindelwald wanted to keep his army happy enough to do his bidding, he would have had to distance himself from Hitler's views. A select few of his army would have been German and they would have liaised with the nazis in order to ensure cooperation, but I think that that was as far as Gellert's cooperation would have been able to go under the circumstances. Do a job for Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels or Goering every now & then and be repaid with extra armaments, passes for Grindelwald's men around the Reich, maybe some possessions 'liberated' from captured countries etcetera. An easy, but definitely hands-off relationship.

In the meantime, he was free to follow the German advance with his own Army, catching the wizarding governments with their pants down as they tried to keep the nazis from butchering their muggle counterparts and ruining the magical society that depended on trade with said muggles to keep their economy going (money goes some places, but gold goes everywhere as they say). He would slaughter the wizards fighting the Nazis, using the subsequent goodwill to gain access to weapons or goods he could then deploy against a now defenceless wizarding enclave, raining /nebelwerfer/ rounds and 200 pound bombs down on the heads of the panicking citizens while his troops massacred anyone who did anything other than submit.

This way, when the Russians rolled in, he could also strike the same deal with them whilst posing as a resistance fighter-help in subduing nazi collaborators on the magical side in exchange for killing nazis. And if said nazi collaborators happened to prance about in robes and pointy hats? Well, they were wannabe nazis in Eastern Europe. Kinda strange to start with.

Of course, he didn't count on the war actually ending. Which is when, in my mind, Dumbledore would have pounced.

** This is something that gets floated around the HP fanbase quite a bit.

Personally my favourite theory and the one I could believe is that as Grindelwald was rising to power, he imperiused a young rising star in Germany and the rest as they say is history...

However, another theory that I myself have is that perhaps Grindelwald was one of those Eastern European collaborators who rose through the ranks of the Nazis and had his own reign of terror but unlike most of his collaborators, his campaign of fear almost exclusively waged against magicals?

These are just theories though. Nothing concrete because there's no real canon evidence to prove anything.
