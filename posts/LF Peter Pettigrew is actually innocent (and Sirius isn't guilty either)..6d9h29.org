Either by neither Peter or Sirius being the Secret Keeper, or Peter was imperiused, confounded, or otherwise tricked/forced into giving up the secret, are there any fics where Peter /isn't/ guilty of willfully betraying the Potters? Preferably ones where Sirius isn't guilty of betrayal either?

** An idea off the top of my head, the reason Pettigrew transformed and stayed as a rat was because the animal instincts dulled the pain of torture and grief and by the time his mind was healed he'd regressed to a point where the idea of changing back seemed wrong (associating human as pain vs rat as good - fed by Weasleys).

*** Maybe that's why Fred & George never saw him on the Marauder's Map in Percy/Ron's company? Because up until Sirius Black's first break-in to Gryffindor tower, Peter didn't identify as himself, so the map didn't register him as anything but Scabbers?

** obviously spoilerific, but

[[/spoiler][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]

and the very long series of this author [[/spoiler][https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave]]

Clarification of the above that is a spoiler to them: [[/spoiler][Be warned that in one, that entire thing is a couple of throwaway lines, and in the other it is very much not.]]
