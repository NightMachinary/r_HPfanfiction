** I feel like a kid who spent the majority of his childhood in a cupboard under the stairs, and being emotionally abused by his relatives.. Isn't likely to make a very good Therapist. Then again, he would likely need a lot of therapy, and maybe thats where he finds the desire to do it for a living.

*** it happens all the time, doesn't it? people get motivated to help other people the way they were helped. people in shootings go into those school assembly talks, suicide prevention, etc. i think a harry who did get help and grew up better would decide to try helping other kids like him later.

This one is post-war, Draco lives as a “muggle” in New York and is a mentor/therapist for troubled teens. Also eventual Draco/Harry, but I'm recommending it because the Draco mentor/therapist role is central to the plot and many of the teens he looks after are major characters. Not to mention it's well written.

** This is a crossover with Star Wars, but Harry has terminal degrees in psychology and social development. He even mentions a thesis: "An in depth theoretical examination of psychological impacts of long term youth exposure to a reclusive pre-industrial society through an examination of response to high stress situations, with a focus on concern for mortal peril."

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

**** Yeah there is a reason it's so divisive (and I'm getting downvoted just for mentioning it) the tone is all over the place and it's pacing is not exactly masterful. It did introduce me to a lot of interesting concepts like game theory and heuristic research so it'll always have a special place in my heart for that, but I just wished someone with a better writingflow had written it.
