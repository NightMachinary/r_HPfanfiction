So the basic idea of the story is Hermione tries to go back in time to try and fix -insert bad thing here- as an adult. She aims for either when Harry is dropped off at the Dursley's or if not slightly before to prevent the Potters from dying. She misses her mark and ends up back in time about 5 years after Harry is given to the Dursley's. She creates a fake identity and becomes a teacher at Harry's school to look out for him and try and prevent -insert bad thing here- from happening.


** As an idea (and please forgive me) is nothing spectacular. Mediocre time travel, raise Harry, fix the world thing. Right? However even mediocre idea can be made into fantastic and captivating story with good enough writing and twists. So why not give it a go? "Insert bad thing here" - what would that be?

Here's an idea: how about her going back in time actually caused the "insert bad thing here" to happen in the first place? What if without ever realising it she had already been part of Harry's life and his teacher? Now that might be a a story with twist worth reading. Just imagine the final climax scene where she would realise it was her meddling all along that cause "Insert bad thing here" :D

*** Now that's cool. Kind of like the Game of Thrones theory that everything is Bran's fault.

You're going to need to specify that. If it's Voldemort, then she can bring enough information to Dumbledore to make him a non-issue. There was an earlier thread ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6t1jum/hermione_was_thrown_back_25_years_to_1976_what/]]) where it was discussed; and many of the plans described apply to post-Voldemort-discorporation as well as to pre-Voldemort-discorporation.

** I have a similar idea with her going back to Tom's era. She killed Tom and other usual suspects easily, but dealt Magical Britain such big losses that Grindelwald had it a lot easier. Magical Britain, reeling from the carnage she had inflicted, retreated into a shell and refused to aid others on the continent.

After WW2 began, she watched in horror how easily Beauxbaton fell to Grindelwald's horde, how Hitler's army crushed the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk, how RAF slowly but inadvertently lost the Battle of Britain, and the Operation Sealion succeeded under Grindelwald's assistance. Magical Britain, under Albus Dumbledore and Armando Dippett, put up a valiant defense, but was hopelessly outnumbered. Both of them perished in the ensuing fight, although Grindelwald decided to imprison his old buddy Albus in Nurmengard and tried to persuade him to join for the time being.

Hermione managed to evacuate Fleamont Potter and a few others to America, where she turned everything she knew about nuclear weapons to President Roosevelt and the Manhattan Project. As a result, the US was able to build the atomic bomb one year earlier....

** I think it could be good. The premise might be a bit bland, but it could make for some great character interaction. I'd love to read about the relationship she establishes with young Harry.

Honestly, a lot of my story ideas start with a premise that isn't really all that interesting in itself; I usually come up with interesting twists later.
