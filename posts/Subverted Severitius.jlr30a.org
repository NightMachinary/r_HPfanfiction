So, the challenge is to write what starts as your classic "Snape adopts/mentors" Harry, but it leading to Snape facing consequences and Harry not staying with him. Some guidelines: 1:Must like all fics of the genre have an inciting incident in which Harry needs a place to stay

2: Dumbledore must force Snape to look after Harry

3: Snape being a petty, terrible person to children must occur, but it doesn't need to be, like an excuse to torture Harry for chapters.

1. Someone must realize the situation isn't good and end it. This is where a lot of creative freedom can happen. Maybe Dumbledore admits he is wrong and takes Harry away and fires Snape. Maybe Snape realizes he needs therapy and is a bad person and decides to move out of the country to seek help. Maybe another family or law enforcement or Sirius intervenes. Regardless Snape must face consequences for not just treating Harry bad, but for being a teacher that was abusive to many children.
