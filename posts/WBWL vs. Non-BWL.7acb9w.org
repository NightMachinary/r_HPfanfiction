When you read a certain amount of fanfics, you notice that WBWL is a rather interesting genre of fanfiction. However, you then come across a set of fanfiction where Harry never is/was/will be the BWL. Personally, I like the second category where Harry is not the BWL for some reason. (Why aren't there many of them anyway?) Which of these two do you prefer, and why?


** I prefer Non-BWL I have yet to see a WBWL without bashing ruining it

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

  Spinoff to 'HP: The Lone Traveller'. The story of Harry James Potter, the brother of the supposed BoyWhoLived, and his friends... My take on the old 'Harry the brother of the BWL' & 'Harry the Slytherin' plotline.

** Non-BWL is almost always better since it doesn't have the bashing requirement that WBWL ususally does. Non-BWL fics also don't have to focus on the BWL plotline, so they can take more chances.

** I prefer Non-BWL while still making Harry the most important person, a good way of doing it was done in what little of No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim by Eternal Payne. The idea is that yeah Voldemort chose Neville to reinforce the Pure blood aspect, but he ends up leaving Harry in the same position Riddle entered the Wizarding world in, Poor with no Guide. It's a great example of why Harry and Riddle chose different paths
