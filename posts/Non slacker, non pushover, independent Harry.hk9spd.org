I really don't know how to explain this but I'll try. I want stories where he doesn't befriend Ron just because he is nice to on the train. Or hates Draco right off that bat. I always getting annoyed in fanfics when he hates Draco because he is a bully, yet it was Ron's reaction to Draco's introduction that set the whole thing off.

There is also how Harry doesn't seem to take school seriously, now its been a while since I read the books but in most fics, he slacked off because he doesn't want his relatives mad for him getting better grades then Dudley, so I always felt him going off to Hogwarts would give him a chance to explore and learn without that worry. So stories where he actually likes things other than quidditch and sneaking around the castle would be nice.

I guess I want stories where he actually is amazed at the world he is now living in and wants to learn more and be apart of it. Where he makes more than two (maybe three) friends since he had been denied any friends cause his cousin. I love stories where we get magic lore and different kinds of spell casting.

Umm what else, I favor slash stories but anything as long as it's not Harry/Hermione or Harry/Daphne (just not a fan of those two ships). Dark or gray Harry's are GREAT but not out right evil or cruel Harry. I'm perfectly happy with character Bashing, though I love the twins so please not them haha. Bad Dumbledore can be fun so can umm not evil Voldemort ? less evil? idk however worded.

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable, and allows him to use magic that no one's ever heard of, that no one's ever seen. But as time goes on, and he becomes more and more entangled in the webs spun by those around him, he starts to realize just how deep the magical rabbit hole goes and how dangerous power like his can be. All Harry had ever wanted was for the world to make sense.

** I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), fits really well:

- He puts the Dursleys in their place early on
- He's definitely not antagonistic toward Draco
- He's very happy about going to Hogwarts
- He doesn't like Quidditch
- He's definitely dark, but not really that evil
- He doesn't end up with Hermione and Daphne

  AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically.

  Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have a lot in common. Both of them are Half-bloods raised by abusive muggles. Both of them are Parselmouths. Both are sorted into the house of snakes. What sets them apart is that one had friends, true, loyal friends, and the other did not. The story of a cold and calculating Harry. Slytherin!Harry. Grey!Harry. OC is the son of Sirius. No slash

**** nah, it's a sub-genre, so to speak. If you're on AO3, just use those tags; if you're on FFN, then if you see those tags (indie!Harry, independent!Harry, Gray!Harry, Pureblood Culture, etc.), it likely has what you want. Alternatively, just look for 5th year summer independent!Harry fics. Alternatively, just look for Dumbledore/Weasley/Hermione Bashing fics; those usually have what you want too.
