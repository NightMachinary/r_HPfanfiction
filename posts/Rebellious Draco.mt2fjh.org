When Draco is a teenager he goes through a phase where he rebels against his parents. He hangs out with Gryffindors, befriends muggleborns, is kind to house elves and even turns away from dark magic and uses pure light magic instead.


** Interesting idea- being good out of spite.

** There's a few fics where this happens. I can't think of them off the top of my head bland I don't think I bookmarked them, but it's always quite endearing

One is when he finds Sirius' old diaries in grimmauld place. Another he is enamoured with a pink-haired queer punk Remus Lupin and thinks he's just the best thing since sliced bread

I don't think I've seen any that weren't a)drarry and or b) were him coming up with this rebellion of his own rebellious and contrary volition, which I assume Sirius did, and a lot of other kids of bigots also manage; so it's possible if very hard, and I'd like to see more of it

** This gives me the amusing idea of him obsessing over the only form of light magic around, Lumos.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle]]: Draco gets his head removed from his ass in 5th year. His personal growth isn't a major part of the series, but he participates heavily in deradicalization efforts.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1555645][Ever Upward]]: Draco is inspired by queer punk Remus Lupin and becomes a hero of the elf rights movement. Seriously worth reading for a nuanced take on other sapient species.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11326149][Under the Surface]]: WARNING, REALLY DARK FIC. Draco evolves from being a bratty kid raised by bigots into a good friend for a rather broken Harry.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1305209][Evil is Not a Trait]]: Draco (and others) learn empathy at Hogwarts and do their best to keep children alive and safe as the second war kicks off.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22684597][Getting Out]]: Draco runs away when his parents decide to introduce him to the family bonding activity of torturing muggles.

** The fic I am writing at the moment ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29828895/chapters/73391850]]) is an adult rebellious Draco where he voluntarily leaves the wizarding world after being introduced to heavy metal and drugs by a muggle boy he meets in a bar. It's been a lot of fun to write.
