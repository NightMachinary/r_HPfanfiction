Just wanted to give some hope to many fans of what look like abandoned fics - I did some editing this week, and am due to post the longest chapter yet on a long fic I haven't updated in over a year and has been sporadic since about six months in in 2015.

Also, quite seriously, people reviewing my fic are to thank. It reminds me how much I love my stories and gives me mojo to keep writing. Thanks to the incredible folks who still review.


** What's your fic?? (Thank you for this post. It really did give me hope)

*** I feel a bit embarrassed linking it, it's hardly the best fic ever. Please don't judge me!

Just super chuffed that people still review it and it really is so encouraging, and wanted to pass that on to folk on here!

  Cassie Derehart lives to play Quidditch. That, and play pranks with her friends, the Marauders. But, now in their seventh year, the gang are having to grow up and settle down - and Cassie is starting to realise that there are more important things in life than finding a Golden Snitch.
