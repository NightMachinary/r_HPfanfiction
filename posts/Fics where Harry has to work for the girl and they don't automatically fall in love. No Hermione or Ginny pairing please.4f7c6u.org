** You've probably already read this because it's such a well-known fic, but on the off chance you haven't, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] features (but it's not the focus of the story) a romance between Harry and Fleur that takes actual time to develop.

**** Here are a few:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10649604/1/The-Legacy-Preservation-Act][Here is my favorite]] The legacy preservation act. It's still a WIP I believe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][This one is ok]] The pureblood princess. I enjoyed it, but that may be skewed because I enjoy the pairing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5087671/1/Runic-Animagi][This one is fun]] Runic animagi. A bit off, but in a good way. I normal frown on adding things like drugs into fanfiction, but it fits with this story

***** What did you not enjoy about pureblood princess? That fic tends to get a lot of love out of Harry/Daphne fans

****** sorry I typo'ed. Meant to say my opinion is skewed, as I am a fan of the pairing. As in, I like the story, but someone who isn't a fan of the pairing might not.

*** Yeah, most HP/DG meet this criteria. She needs to be established in the story before we see her fall for HP. Also, there's some obsession with making her a cold, calculating girl before Harry breaks through her icy exterior.

**** Yeah. I like a few of those, but the real gems are basically OCs that are slytherins
