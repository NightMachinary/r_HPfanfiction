I'm all caught up with Grow Young With Me and Harry Potter and the Elementals Power.

I would add links but i'm on my phone sorry.


** linkffn(2095661) It's a bit angsty but this is by far my favorite HP/OC. This author does a great job at building the relationship and really delving deep into the OC, rather than just introducing a shallow one-dimensional OC like many fics do.

** linkffn(4776013) There's three parts in total, and the last is unfinished. But it's basically a whole new story, and everything Voldemort-related is resolved by the second part.
