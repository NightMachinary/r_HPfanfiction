Like mabye Slytherin mellowed out of the last 1000 years and He Gryffindor and Hufflepuff have just been on a 1000 year world Tour mabye somethings de-ageing them selves and going to the other magic schools. Mabye have him be happy about his descendent that founded Ilvermorny.


** Well, there's linkffn(Revival) (although it's a heavy AU as a /HPMOR/ fanfanfic) where Slytherin is still around and secretly becomes Snape's mentor while under the misconception Snape is his descendant. linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance) shows a good!Slytherin coming back to life in the body of Hermione, and it's pretty good.

There's also another one but the presence of Slytherin is a spoiler, so ask me if you want but ---

  Severus Snape decided to revive the dead ones he cared about, and tried to prevent the end of the world by Harry Potter. In the meanwhile, a certain disappeared lord had his own agenda. Note: This is a Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality sub-fanfic, HPMOR compliant except for the last paragraph in Chapter 121.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...
