So I remembered that in the books, harry was asked to the ball by a older student and he mentioned she had a mean look about her like she would hurt him if he rejected her. Is there any fanfics where he does get asked to the ball by an older student and he decides to go, because he wants too or doesn't see anyway he could get out of it?


** I've always wanted something like this too. Despite the somewhat negative opinion of Harry where many still believe him to have entered himself into the Tournament, he is still the Boy Who Lived and I bet there would be lots of girls interested in him, even older ones even if just because of his fame. I'd love fics where Harry tries to deal with popular older girls asking him out. I know he hates his fame but hes also a teenage boy who might be swayed by that.

Kind of cracky, but worth reading IMO.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.

** YES that was the girl Ron said looked part troll! It was to be mean probably, but what if she actually was? :) And then Harry went with her and they had a good time! :) :) And then Hagrid was happy with Harry for dating a part human. :) Harry always does want to make Hagrid proud of him. Yes it could be so wholesome and maybe a one shot!
