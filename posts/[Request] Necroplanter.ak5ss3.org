** It's not as good as I'd want it to be, but it's 1 AM and I have work tomorrow.

"...The griffin's paw is a rather useless flower. An orange puff on the end of a long, thin stalk --- if you saw one in the wild, you wouldn't pay attention to it. It's not even good for potions, unless you want to give some a rash --- in which case, curse them. It's cheaper, or so Uncle Alfard says. Combine it with being demanding and you'll understand why most people will never see griffin's paw. I think I'm the only person in England who had one --- right here, on my windowsill.

My name is Neville Longbottom. I'm ten. And exactly nine years ago my parents have... left me. And Gran thinks I need to talk to someone about it. She says I'm bottling things up and it isn't healthy. But I am in the middle of something, so I decided to write this instead.

You see, I have a secret. I can feel death. Not like a Grim --- actual death. And I can tell a lot about something by its death. The table in my room is a husk of a proud old oak that once stood on the cliff near our house. The vulture on Grandma's hat is called Orliff and he loved hunting rabbits more than anything in his life.

I can also touch the death inside the things. It doesn't always work but sometimes I can remove it from them and let them live again. Only small things, of course. The most I can do is a rat, like the ones Samson brings.

The dead don't want to come back --- that is what Gran says. They belong beyond the Veil and we will see them again one day, when we cross it too. But Mom and Dad aren't dead. They are just... beyond any help, or so the doctors say. And, you see, I have a plan.

There is a plant in Northern Africa. The Pul'Ma, a small, delicate thing. Takes four years to grow. Al Shatur wrote that the locals use it to treat the diseases of mind and strengthen their soul. Of course, nobody saw Pul'Ma in decades, and I can't keep something alive for more than a month... but I have a plan. And something tells me, I'm gonna be alright."

** I read that as Negroplanter and I will sure to have nightmares now. Good Lord, my mind works in very fucked up ways.
