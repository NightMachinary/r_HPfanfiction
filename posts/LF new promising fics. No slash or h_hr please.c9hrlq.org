** Linkffn(The Granger Principle)

Weekly updates, author has a very good track record of about a dozen completed and very well written stories. So far only three chapters but it's looking very promising. Why did Crabbe attack Hermione? Why wasn't she scared when she got a gun pointed at her face? Who killed Scrimgeour? Why did she recognize Yaxley? And what is a quantum mirror cage anyway?

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

** I'll give a recommendation for the "Sarcasm and Slytherin" series over on AO3, starting with linkao3(12608820). I'm always a sucker for long fics, and 600k in less than two years is quite nice.

*** If you like Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, this is a similar concept, but the author moves at a much faster pace plot-wise. Less world-building though.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

Eh what does this mean? Talk about vague criteria.

Is less than a year but more than six months since being published old? Because these four are pretty nice: linkffn(13103526; 13052940) linkao3(15430560; 17268434)

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend". But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle. (1930's Childhood Friends AU)

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. Heavy on Remus/Sirius friendship. Some Black family dynamic; Harry/Sirius family dynamic; Sirius PTSD exploration. Tonks is a major player but not til halfway through. No bashing. Harry is present but not primary; these adults prefer not to ask teenagers to save the world.
