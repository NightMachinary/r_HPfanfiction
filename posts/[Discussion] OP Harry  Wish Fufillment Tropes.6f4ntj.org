** Make sure you add animagus, if you're trying to go for OP Harry. And for bonus points, acquiring the Hallows is another possibility for OP stuff. Absorbing the horcrux in his scar, stealing magic from death eaters, etc.

Even time travel, if you're so inclined.

Edit: for absurd crazy bullsh*t, go for wandless magic.

I'm sorta depressed that I can list all those off the top of my head.

**** He did say 'wish fulfillment.' I give the people what they want.

In all seriousness, I really can't stand fics with even half the tropes I listed.

** Pet phoenix or taming the basilisk gives him an op pet. That or they're his animagus forms, heck why not both?
