** I know of one where Voldemort ended up becoming a woman. Not because of the flesh, but because Mrs. Riddle got buried with her husband.

I think it was a bit of a crack fic, because a big point was that Voldemort ended up being really petite and pretty (movie-Luna with red eyes, basically), so Death Eaters kinda stopped being overly afraid of him.

If anyone knows what fic I'm talking about, please link.
