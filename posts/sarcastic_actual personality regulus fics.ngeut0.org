So I just finished Blackpool by thedivinecomedian and it's by far the best regulus fic ive ever read. I keep finding fics where regulus is just super timid and quiet and shy and even pretty bland but I want something more like Blackpool or the snarky, funny, and sarcastic regulus of As Soon as He Can by Trex_patronus. Any recommendations for Regulus centric with an actual personality? lol


** A study in choices and second chances is pretty good in my opinion. It is Harry/Reg (they're the same age), sorry if you're not into that[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23486791][A study in choices and second chances]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23486791]]

** he's autistic and has opinions in my fic likao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18485104/chapters/43800589]]) but also doesn't feel like he should have to tell people things so it's been fun to write (it's from his POV so you don't need to worry about him not talking) it's just that I see him as being really quiet but and thinks he's being very excited with his ten shades of blank stare but he really isn't expressive at all (but has opinions. So many options)

  If Hermione were honest with herself, this was largely her own fault. There was no blaming anyone else, much as she had tried to do so. Voldemort, Dumbledore, everyone and everything was just an excuse to hide from the fact that she had been foolish, had believed where it was hopeless and had taken risks where the price was betrayal and death. Time travel fic. Regulus/Hermione.

  Surely, any wizard who knows pureblood circles, knows you're nothing to someone unless you can name their second cousin three times removed, as well as know exactly who in their family not to mention at dinner. Who was this Dark Lord's second cousin three times removed? And why was he clearly not mentioning any of his family at dinner? Regulus means to find out.
