I am looking for a story where edgy lord indy Harry is being a little cunt and in full ranting mode. But then he is shown what is wrong with his behavior and that there are always two sides in a story. But in a loving and positive way. Not a slap and a "stop right here"


** It's not Slytherin Harry but linkffn(9977668) does that.

Harry is being a bit of a dick - he's partly justified - but the story's love interest basically tells him to move on, even if he doesn't forgive those who wronged him.

#+begin_quote
  After Sirius dies, Harry is isolated and feels betrayed by everyone who's been around him recently and leaves to figure out what he should do. An "old friend" is sent to look after him and try to bring him back. Together they search for a way to kill a Dark Lord and maybe fix society too.
