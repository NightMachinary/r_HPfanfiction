*Me*: Okay, that's at least /different/, I'll give it a read. Oh, hey, wow, the writing is actually pretty decent too ... And it's got a good update rate.

*Writer*: Wait, I haven't told you the best part! After this completely different upbringing that should utterly change his worldview, Harry goes to Diagon Alley and -- get this -- ends up with the /same/ wand.

*Me*: That seems ... contrived. Shouldn't he have a different one after all that? Wands are supposed to match the wizard.

*Writer*: No, no, it makes perfect sense. You see, Harry goes to Hogwarts and gets into the same house with the same friends, but this time -- and here's the real big difference from canon! -- he befriends Draco and Luna too because he's all about inter-house unity now, and --

**** It seems like everyone is adverse to original plotlines though.

For example I just made this up. Lets say Bartimus transfigures Harry into a pebble to sneak him out of hogwarts. He uses polyjuice and imperio on Ron to pretend to be Harry while Barty sneaks the pebble out of Hogwarts.

Hermione gets mixed up in it somehow and ends up in the trunk with Moody. She overhears about a meeting in Hogsmede. Bartimus doesn't realize she has a time turner. Moody decides to intercept Barty in Hogsmede before he can hand Harry over to his contact. Hermione lets Moody use her wand but only if he agrees to take her along.

Hrm... what else. You could just think up things and figure out how to mix them in. Like maybe Barty keeps his polyjuice in the trunk. Hermione dips her hair in it and manages to get Moody to use some. When he turns into Hermione he has to shrink considerably which makes his bindings easy to wiggle out of.

  Training montages, in all forms.
#+end_quote

Now I want to see an actual training montage. Protagonist starts playing the Rocky theme song, spends two seconds jogging, two seconds jumping rope, two seconds on a punching bag, and then shouts "Yo Adrianne I did it!"

Or maybe a training Montague:

#+begin_quote
  "Turn thee, Benvolia, and look upon thy death!"

  Tybalt's wand twitched in complex patterns, a different curse flying with every gesture. Benvolia parried and blocked and shielded as best she could, just barely escaping unscathed. She lacked the quarter second required to even turn a spell back on Tybalt. As the duel wore on, her desperation showed through and her arm tired, and even her last-ditch defences were not enough. The curses edged their way through -- a bone-vanishing hex that left her off hand dangling, a cutting curse across her cheek. She knew she couldn't keep this up for long.

  With a roar she threw herself at him --

  and collided with Princess Margaret. Her glare was fit to set the world on fire.

  "Rebellious subjects, enemies of peace!" she began, but Benvolia didn't hear her. Tybalt had stopped for now, but the Capulets would not let the conflict lie -- even if she could convince the Montagues not to be the aggressors, which was likely beyond her.

  Fighting was inevitable, and she was determined that next time, she would be the victor.

  That night at Madam Rosmerta's, she found Mercutia. "Train me," she said.

  Mercutia looked her up and down. "Thou'rt sugar, Benvolia, pure sweetness and light. The fire and spice of battle is no place for thee."

  "The worst burns come of melted sugar," Benvolia pointed out. "I ask that thou train me."

  Mercutia leaned back in her chair and took a swig of firewhiskey. "The Princess posted an order not an hour past. Dueling is forbidden in England and Scotland."

  "My aunt has a house in Wales. Wilt thou train me?" She'd practically grown up there.

  "Those delicate hands have worked to forge peace. Why stain them with the callouses of conflict?"

  "Callouses or my own heart's blood, Mercutia! I've asked thee three times."

  Mercutia broke into a grin. "Then to lawless Wales, and battle!" she cried, tossing her tumbler away. "If Apparation be the food of training --"

  "Wrong play," Benvolia hissed, but Mercutia gave a Gallic shrug and Apparated on the spot, still seated.

This is why I almost never read those popular independent/powerful Harry stories. Even if they are mostly good, they almost always contain scenes like that and just make me angry at Dumbledore/Snape/McGonall for not being in character and completely putting the annoying independent Harry in his place.

** Dumbledore and Weasley bashing.

I really like Dumbledore as a character because even though he's initially presented as an all-knowing figure, the later books show us his flaws, which he acknowledges, and his tragic past. This notion that he's a manipulator doing everything for the "Greater Good", hellbent on making sure Harry's life sucks is just stupid. Dumbledore never got off on making Harry suffer and it's clear that he cherished him. Thing is...in a war, /very/ difficult decisions have to be made and very few people have the guts to do them.

In regards to the Weasleys, while I can understand if someone finds them annoying, they're a very loving and accepting family. Molly may be overbearing but she /is/ the closest thing Harry had to an actual mother. The fact that her boggart included Harry's corpse shows that she views him as one of her sons. Not like a son, but an actual son.

Ron's a bit of a jerk and a dick but people forget, he's a kid for most of the books. Why judge him as an adult when pretty much everyone at that age was a brat? I look back at my own adolescence and I groan in embarrassment. Ron has issues but that doesn't make him an asshole, he's a freaking teenager. We all sucked at that age.

Ginny is someone I don't really care for but it's because I always found her underdeveloped and her romance with Harry always felt kinda forced. That being said, some fics make her as being a brat that feels that she's entitled to be Harry's soulmate. I don't remember the books making a big deal out of her hero crush yet some authors make it a central point for their disdain.

Full disclosure, I'm a H/Hr shipper but I'm always annoyed at how authors treat Ron and Ginny. They take out their frustration that their ship isn't canon on them, looking for any flaws in their characters and exaggerating them to absurd heights. That's why it's really hard to find /good/ fics for this ship. A majority of the stories don't organically make Harry and Hermione fall in love. They just bruteforce them into it by making Ron/Ginny/Weasleys to be stupid fucks that don't really care for them.

I also see Ginny bashed occasionally in Harry/Luna fanfics, so I sympathize. In the best H/L fics I've seen, Ginny is completely supportive, and why wouldn't she be? After all, Luna was her best friend and she always looked out for her, so it makes more sense to me that Ginny would be happy for Luna than the idea that she'd be all "You stole my boyfriend! How dare you?!" (I started [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6jje5j/request_harryluna_fics_where_ginny_is_actually_a/][a thread]] on this very topic a month ago.)

*** Weaslty bashing is kinda dumb because god damn Ron is still a kid but Dumbledore bashing is kinda of ok with me because he is an asshole with a god complex at best. Snape has no excuse, no matter how you dress it, even in cannon what he does is god damn child abuse. It shouldn't matter that he saves Harry or whatever else good things he does.

On the pairing things I hate both Ginny and Hermione pairings because honestly I don't see how Ginny is even a thing other than her being forced because "Big Weasley Familly" and Hermione to me is completely unimportant. What irks me the most is the Fleur/Bill thing, Like she's 18 and hooks up with a 28 or something year old. Fuck that.

** Fics where Ginny is the worst most evil bitch in all the universe because she /gasp/ had a crush on a celebrity as a kid.

No one has ever experienced that, especially not preteen girls so clearly she must be a psychotic stalker who wants to steal Harry from his true love. She is also clearly so obsessed that she has also managed to (presumably with the aid of time travel) fuck every man who ever lived going all the way back to Adam because if we're going to show what an awful person she is of course she must also be a massive slut.

Fuck that trope.

Say what you will about Ron bashing but at least there are actual canon moments of him being a loud mouthed schmuck. Good bashing fics exaggerate canon characteristics to hyperbolic proportions. Awful bashing fics make up characteristics to justify the author's hate.

** I love when authors point out that it's a bashing fic right there in the summary, kindly letting me know that I should skip a terrible story probably written by a 12-year old.

If you need to smugly, constantly point out how much you hate a character I really have to question your maturity. The unfortunate truth is though that too many older and experienced authors still do this for some reason. The audience should make their own evaluation of a character, instead of being fed your own, bitter commentary on canon and how it should have been so much better.

Aside from bashing, authors really need to learn the miracle of starting a story at the point where it's relevant. Basically every decent AU starts several years into Hogwarts, skipping over the whole sleep-inducing rigmarole of canon transcription with a minor shift. There's pretty much zero reason after all this time, to start at first year - learn from stories such as Hogwarts Battle School.

** James harassing Lily and asking her out every day, Lily hating James with a passion until one day she just doesn't. IMO it's pretty two-dimensional; James was a teenage boy who had a huge crush and a lot of bravado, so of course he's gonna act like a dumbass, but it's kind of... shady to stage big scenes on a weekly basis to get her to go out with him. Who's to say SWM wasn't the /first time/ he actually asked her out? Lily's proud, but considering it took until fifth year for her to cut it off with Snape when he was showing signs of interest in the dark arts prior, it's fair to say that she wants to keep her relationships intact for as long as possible. Why couldn't she have been exaggerating whenever she insulted James when she was with Snape? That kind of thing. I just wish the general idea of James and Lily was a little more broad and "allowed" for more creativity -- not that fandom is the judge and jury for what is "right", but fanon is a cruel mistress.

Also not as much what I'm tired of reading so much as what I wish was more popular, Quidditch player Lily.

That fic has awesome OCs (they're not Calypso Rosier but they're still awesome). Desulgon is ridiculously OP but complex and I think you'd enjoy him. It introduces new branches of magic but there are too many child prodigies. Character development is mild outside of Albus, too.

The plot twists are great and so are the mysteries. The first three books were a bit...meh but the fourth one is where things really started.

That was a MAJOR misconception. Both she and Ron wrote Harry regularly during that summer. But Dumbledore told them not to write anything about the War, Voldemort, and the Order.
