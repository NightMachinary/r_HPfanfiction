  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?

** There's one very very old fic on that theme, in which Harry becomes another kind of wizard and is severely persecuted because of it. Can't remember the name, the author, or anything significant, but I do remember that it was very long, had him being sent to Azkaban, meeting another person there with the same ability, escaping, returning to Hogwarts and going for the lodestone/leylines that underpin the school's magic. I think he also goes blind for a bit, not sure. There's also a nice parallel plot thread in Hogwarts, where Hermione and other try to rally for him.

Really old, really long story. I remember it fondly, if very incompletely.

Ps. The story was written long before adding Daphne as badass Slytherin came into vogue.

** That's not what you're talking about, but Harry ends up with completely off-the-bat magic (combined Phoenix and Basilisk) towards the end of the really good linkffn(Harry Potter: Dark Memories)

  Voldemort didn't just give Harry some of his powers that night. He gave him all of his memories. With them, his allies and friends, Harry shall change the Wizarding World like no one ever before. LightHarry. GoodDumbledore. Chaotic magic. COMPLETE!
