I can't be the only one here who thinks it's super weird that in most time travels a 30 something year old goes back in time and immediately integrates themselves with kid version of friends and loved ones.

Honestly I'm just harassing the time travel tag on ao3 and just looking for recs of something a little different

Any character traveling to any era just looking for some good fics.

Thanks!


** I've been thinking of a plot where Harry travels back in time, but can't stand being 11 again:

- no muscles or body coordination to speak of, clumsy AF.
- way too skinny and small.
- squeaky voice he absolutely hates.
- bored to death of being in the castle again, doing same events, same classes, reliving same life again. He was planning to move on, become an Auror, have new and exciting life and adventures ...
- all his magical powers are gone, reset to the way he was at 11, knowledge alone is not enough, because magical training needs "muscle memory" to work properly. And now he needs to re-train from zero again.
- his once friends are all annoying brats whom he can't stand to be near anymore. And now doesn't feel like repeating his life, because no matter how similar Ron would be, he'd never be what he remembers him to be from first time, and would always hate Ron/himself for not matching the expectations.
- in his mind he is a man, used to .. ehm, we know what I mean, and his 11 yo body is absolutely not ready for that yet. Not to mention Ginny is 10 which is absolute EWWW and GROSSS ...
- speaking of which - he is grossed out and feels like a bloody pedo every time he needs to shower, or see himself naked, or whatnot. Doing puberty thing AGAIN absolutely is horrible.
- feels painful grief and is utterly depressed for loosing EVERYBODY. All his friends, people he grew up with, went through so much pain and shit, diffcult choices, bad and happy moments. To him it feels as if everyone he has known had died.

Yeah plot I have in mind wouldn't be a happy re-do everything.

** The story A Little Child Shall Lead Them by White Squirrel came up with an interesting way to solve this "adult in child's body" issue.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

** That's why I really like fics where a group of people (preferably the classic golden trio) go back in time (and return to their child bodies) instead of just one.

** Are you talking about a time traveler who goes back as an adult or someone who goes back into their younger body? I mean both are creepy but it would narrow it a bit.

**** Well since I have the same issue as you, I tend to read a lot more "adult time traveler" fics. Hope these help. [A storm across time by Overlocked

]([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12576408/chapters/28645596]]) in this one Harry goes back to 1981 and hangs out with the Marauders, Snape and the Order mostly.

[My Name is Cameron Sage by

thesewarmstars

]([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1648439/chapters/3495167]])

[Hallowed King by SpicyReyes

]([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23634469/chapters/56723518]]) this is one of my favorites since Harry travels back to his Hogwarts years as an adult and there are some pretty great interaction with the Hogwarts professors.

** Technically speaking this is dimensional travel, but it is effectively time travel (with a few differences thrown in) for the protagonist. And it's really good regardless. It is a crossover, but I can personally attest that knowledge of Bloodborne isn't required to enjoy it. linkao3(19328290)
