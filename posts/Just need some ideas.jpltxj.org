James grew up there was a difference between him at 15 to him at seventeen. Did he someone pass away? Did a family member get killed in action (It was war time) did he go through a mental stage we don't know. Hope we get a marauders series soon to answer these questions so we can see what made Lily like him. Those are just a few of my theories :)
