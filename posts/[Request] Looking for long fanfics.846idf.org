400k+ words please , can be in parts like "Purebloods pretense" Or "Saving Connor"

I would Prefer that it would be either completed , or actively updated and no main character male slash ( Unless the fic is really really good written / good story)


** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] is a famous one. It is an /amazing/ AU. It's not completed or updating, sadly, but it's insanely long and satisfying nonetheless.

linkffn(3766574)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]] is another one I enjoyed, but it hasn't been updated since last year. I don't think it's completely abandoned, but who knows.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] (Completed), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10093402/1/Initiate][Initiate]] (Completed), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10858061/1/Identity][Identity]] (Completed) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11732213/1/Impose][Impose]] (Ongoing) by MarauderLover7. It's long and well written. And regularly updating.

  Nearly two and a half years had passed since Kreacher had woken up to find Harry Potter asleep on his kitchen floor, and Grimmauld Place had changed dramatically since then. Sequel to "Innocent".

  It was still called the "Noble and Most Ancient House of Black", though it had been years since any of the Blacks that approved of that name had lived there. Sirius Black would be a disappointment to his parents, but Harry Potter - the home's other resident - was a credit to his. Both were proud of that. Sequel to "Innocent", "Initiate" and "Identity".

  Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy, even among wizards. The most noteworthy thing about him, however, was his talent for getting himself into trouble, which surpassed even that of his godfather. Sequel to "Innocent" and "Initiate".

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
