:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! I am looking for a fic I red long ago. Dumbledore hires Harry, who goes by a different name, James Evans (I think) to be the DADA teacher. Everyone thinks that Harry is dead, but he just disappeared after the defeat of Voldemort. He went to a magical University, where he became friends with Draco. In this fic Abeford was his University advisor. Harry hides who he is until some new evil attacks. It has a Snarry pairing. There is a scene where Snape and Harry dress up for a ball as Clow Reed and Yue.


** Ghost of a Memory by Phoenix Boy linkffn(2114791)

Except for the Clow Reed and Yue part. They dress up as Salazar Slytherin and Wulfric Ravenclaw.

  Harry is going to be the new Hogwarts Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Unfortunately, he finds out Draco Malfoy is also going to be starting as a Hogwarts professor. Their rivalry is, of course, not budging. But since they're teachers now, they're not allowed to fight. They become terribly competitive and their students start to get a different idea about their relationship
