*** I second this recommendation one of best HP/DF crossovers, start out with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][Denarian Renegade]] then [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3856581/1/The-Denarian-Knight][Denerian Knight]], and for epic grande finale [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4359957/1/The-Denarian-Lord][Denarian Lord]]

*** Circular Reasoning isn't a DF crossover. It just borrows the Summer and Winter Court stuff.

Anyway, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7779108/1/The-Master-of-Death][The Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4183715/1/Awaken-Sleeper][Awaken Sleeper]] are some great ones.
