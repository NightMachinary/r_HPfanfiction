  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** I /highly/ suggest reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7145549/1/Duality][Duality]] by Anda Faith. It's such a shame it hasn't been updated in two years. I assume the writer either outgrew Fanfiction, or life became too stressful with their career as a doctor. It is my all-time favorite Fanfic. There is a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6881563/chapters/15699223][smut version]] available on Ao3, and a few other sites. It's an incredible story, involving Harry getting into a 'no-strings-attached' sexual relationship with Daphne Greengrass, but the smut actually plays quite a small, but necessary part to the actual plot. Later on in the story, it's Harry's path through becoming an impromptu interrogator for information on Voldemort. I love the way there is actual psychology involved, and that the story has so much information from actual sources weaved into it. The Slytherin's are devious, intelligent, and have plots inside their plots and contingencies for their contingencies. The suspense is amazing, and the writing is incredible. I particularly love the journey through discovering what a Horcrux even is, and the implementation of the Unspeakables being an actual secret, not some infinite resource for Harry and co. to farm from. Add to this the fact that there is actual /lore/ behind occlumency, but it isn't written out like a step-by-step guide comes together to make one of the best stories I've ever read. Sincerely hope it is finished. I'd suggest someone adopting it, but this is the type of story that I think would be destroyed by a different writer.

If you like brilliant character-development and incredibly well-thought-out plot read this story. If you're into greyer!Harry's, this is an excellent fanfiction as it actually has his /journey/ into that lifestyle instead of just him instantly changing from canon.

The story was a blast though. Would highly recommend whatever she's posted of "Blaspheme" as well, which is the Daphne-centric spin-off of Duality.

Anything by TheEndless7 but especially linkffn(Vitam Paramus) and linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre). Plus his meisterwerke linkffn(Letters by TheEndless7).

One or two Starfox5 stories have already been mentioned but not linkffn(Patron by Starfox5).

And White Squirrel. linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) and linkffn(The Arithmancer) are excellent, although the sequel to the latter is taking forever to get to the fucking point.

** Started last year, so it's possible everyone's already read it, but I've seen very little in the subreddit about linkffn(realignment) and it deserves your attention.

Grindelwald-era AU in which Riddle is attacked during his 6th year by a mysterious assailant and ends up caught in a power triangle between the assailant, Grindelwald, and Dumbledore. Great world building regarding Grindelwald's War and the magic societies on the continent and the relationship between Tom and Dumbledore is believable and very entertaining.

  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

**** It does a pretty quick but interesting dive into ginnys's first few years at hogwarts as a slytherin, with how they view her after the diary. Later, she begins to come into her own with a group of powerful women in slytherin who make a place you can thrive if you're different. The sequel has a trans character join them that is so wonderful and well done. Gradually, ginny and Harry start to interact more, but then you see how she deals being left in the castle, and there's inter house unity that isn't in Canon. Harry/ginny is believable in the sequel.

** Let me see... linkao3(Unforgiven Pride by Laziza) is one I've recommended before. It's an in-progress SS/HG slowburn that deals with post-war politics and stuff.

linkao3(Other People's Choices by Lomonaaeren) is a Slytherin!Harry fic with a twist: Harry's originally put in Gryffindor and resorted into Slytherin when the Sorting Hat falls on his head in CoS. It has some insanely good characterization of Blaise, Theodore Nott, Draco, and Ron.

linkao3(That Awful Boy by paracosim) is a fifth year AU with slowburn Snupin. The best parts of it are definitely those that deal with Snape - he's full of dickishness while at the same time being someone who is deeply determined to do good.

linkao3(A dealer, not a Death Eater by Jaxon) is a Snily AU where 1) they're together and 2) Snape's a drug dealer who's slowly getting sucked into the Death Eaters. Featuring a lot of grey on grey morality and political shenanigans.

linkffn(Courtship by bluemeanies) and its sequel linkffn(Voldemort Wants You to Eat Your Vegetables by bluemeanies) are both hilarious. The first involves Dumbledore, Snape, and a roller disco. The second involves McGonagall being stressed out about the consequences of the first one.

linkao3(Picketing For Peace by Chuksha) is just amazing. It deals with a real event (the 1984 Miner's Strike) and shows how it affects the Wizarding World, whether they want to acknowledge it or not.

Finally, With Nothing On My Tongue by ms_anthrop ([[https://snapecase.livejournal.com/50627.html]]) is an amazing piece with some incredibly deft characterization of both Snape and McGonagall. Also, RIP Alan Rickman and Leonard Cohen.

  Post-war politics is just as deadly as ever, when you are called Severus Snape and you are accused of war crimes... But when past students who should hate you prove to be your staunchest allies, you might just decide that life is worth living. Many canon characters. Adult themes. Slow build. EWE. Continuation of Unforgiven Love but can be read independently.I'm not JKR, I don't own anything about Harry Potter, and I don't make any money.

  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after.\\
  Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical.\\
  After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Leaky Cauldron.\\
  Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

But when news of the 1984 Miner's Strike, and subsequent sympathy picket in Cokeworth, hit the Daily Prophet front pages he couldn't help himself, even if that meant facing his estranged father.This story was a submission for Age range category 3 (20-30 years old) in the 2018 Snape Showcase over on LJ which has been publishing Snape!centric fics to coincide with Sev's birthday and #SnapeWeek.

** The fic I'd like to add is Seven Names by angelholme linka03(5265569) which is an AU postwar fic. In terms of why I recommend it, there are admittedly a couple Doylist reasons I should mention first.

It's a fic on A03, which is fine in and of itself. The fact of the matter is though, with some exceptions due to containing rare pairings/scenarios, fics on A03 get /much/ less play than their counterparts on ffn. This is a good sized fic (73.5K words) finished a bit less than 3 years ago and outside of my own mentions of it the only time I have seen it brought up was the random mention of it that introduced me to the fic in the first place. So, IMO it seems to be just the sort of thing these sorts of threads are for.

Moving on toward the Watsonian side, it isn't a perfect fic I will admit. Personally, I think the UAC could use some shoring up in its moral justifications. Not in that those justifications don't exist, but that they weren't articulated by dialogue and chosen plot details as well as they could have been. There is still definetly moral ambiguity in terms of who to root for, but I think fair or unfair the reader leans more one way than the other, and shoring up the (even if only slightly) weaker side would serve to make the fic even better.

But apart from the style of the piece (which I like but as with all aesthetics is a matter of opinion) what it does best is depict war, and it excels in a couple different ways. First is that it goes down the the dark places of humanity, without turning into the grimdark "every likeable person is either killed, tortured, raped or all the above because the world sucks" almost parody material many fics can turn into. But rest assured, it does actually go in and show the nastiness that occurs during an actual war.

Because Book 7. to be honest, did NOT depict that. This isn't a knock on it, not at all. But what it was was a dangerous camping trip mixed with spy thriller that culminated in one final action packed fight. Seven Names shows, in retrospect, pieces of actual campaigns, and more importantly (and the area where I think it shines) is showing the consequences that people have to live with from it, whether individually or as a society.

Because, ignoring everything else, Book 7's "war" made reconciliation relatively easy. The main figureheads of the winning side only particpated in one battle, any harm caused in that battle can easily be argued to be self defense as it was an attack on Hogwarts and even in the heat of battle no "light side" witch or wizard is shown to be doing anything morally dubious like casting an Unforgivable (unless you're a complete pacifist I suppose, but that argument will hardly win the day)

Seven Names shows how, for both people and peoples, reintegration after an actual war is much murkier

After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

Brilliant perspective of how Lily and James got together. I think I've read every non-slash maruaders fic there is and this is the best one (or at least top two, tough to beat the unfinished 'The Life and Times'). A recent fic, 2017 I think(?), and incredibly well written. Interesting takes on Remus and Peter are probably what make me love it so much. A few lemons, but they are for the most part skippable plotwise, but it isn't gratuitous. Fantastic story, and the author even responds to reviews!

** All right, here we go!

/The Chessmaster: Black Pawn/ and /The Chessmaster: White Knight/ by Fly Autumne.\\
linkffn(12578431, 12746586)\\
An engaging in-progress series that not only puts Harry, Ron, and Hermione into Slytherin, but fleshes out the Harry Potter world even more while adding several extra-Hogwarts plots. Some involve familiar characters while others involve some rather intriguing and mysterious new characters. I really recommend this series because both the Hogwarts bits and the greater wizarding world bits are interesting. Updates regularly, too!

/Victoria Potter/ by Taure.\\
linkffn(12713828)\\
Female Harry, but actually done fairly well. It's still early in the fic, and it updates rather irregularly, but it's good so far.

/The Half-Blood Romantic/ by Sophprosyne linkffn(12627473)\\
I'm not one for romance fics, to be honest. I rarely read them, but I do quite like Fleur and this was recommended to me personally by a friend, so I gave it a shot. I'm glad I did. It's definitely a romance story, but it's well-written and interesting. The author avoids most of the more annoying romantic cliches, which is a huge plus. Still updates, but somewhat slowly (once every month to every couple of months).

/Weasley Girl/ and /Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past/ by Hyaroo\\
linkffn(8202739, 9932798)\\
Female Ron. It's an interesting idea, and it's done fairly well. First two years of Hogwarts are done. Follows the canon plot to a certain extent, but increasingly less so as the story has gone on, and I have a feeling based on the events of the second story that it will diverge quite a bit from here onward. I like the characterizations, and the writing is good too.

/Harry Potter and the Master's Ball/, /Harry Potter and the Chamber of the Unknown/, /Harry Potter and the Lord of Sevii/, /Harry Potter and the Grand Trainer Tournament/, and /Harry Potter and the Order of Moltres/ by Mr. Chaos\\
linkffn(9305868) just linking the first one to avoid ffnbot spam\\
A Harry Potter-Pokemon crossover. The writing is a bit ragged, especially at first, the author has the odd spelling and grammar issue (nothing a quit proofreading wouldn't have fixed), and the author sometimes doesn't check spellings of proper names (e.g. 'Treverant' instead of 'Trevenant'). Other than that, though, it's a great series. The story is mostly set in the new Pokemon region of Avalon, which just happens to be where Hogwarts is located! Characters, events, and a good amounts of the Harry Potter world have been Pokemon-ized, and it's very well done. The plot is engaging, the characters are (for the most part) very well-done, and it's interesting to see what Pokemon each character has. I think Voldemort, Hagrid, Barty Crouch Jr, and a few OC's are particularly fascinating.

Those are my main recommendations for this year. In the words of Marcus Kincaid, "Don't have too much fun!"

  Sequel to The Chessmaster: Black Pawn. AU. Tensions continue to rise both inside and outside Hogwarts with the announcement of the International Scholastic Quidditch Tournament. As international influences begin to creep into British politics, Dumbledore isn't the only one worried for the future. Thomas Gaunt is concerned as well, but for very different reasons...

I just read this and had to come here and recommend it. It deals with Hermione trying to change some laws regarding Muggleborn's rights in the Wizengamot/wizarding world.

It's quite short (2,999 words), but I found it good nonetheless.

** "Goodish" young Tom Riddle:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14357283/chapters/33140037]])

It's Luna Lovegood/Tom Riddle and time travel. I like it.

One that focuses on young Severus Snape and Lily Evans, but also does a great job on the Marauders: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5803846/chapters/13376221]])

It's a Snily, but a realistic and really well done one.

One more: Albus Dumbledore/Gellert Grindelwald, somewhat canon compliant before Beasts. Very unique writing, that actually does justice to this horribly sad love, that lasted an entire lifetime and yet never enough. A somewhat tough read, but worth it. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2428940/chapters/5375627]])

  Sometimes all that's needed for enormous differences is a small change, as small as the order of a few sentences in a heated fight. Lily Evans unconsciously makes one such change while arguing with her best friend, and the magnitude of consequences her actions cause hold the potential to reshape not only herself and the people around her, but their world's very future. A What-if AU that explores the questions of how much we know ourselves, how much we're truly influenced by our surroundings and how much we do so in turn, whether unexpected consequences arising from the choices we make are our responsibility, and ultimately, whether truth is truly an objective axiom of existence, or only what we make of it.

Of my reccs, I think two of my favorites are linkffn(4172226) and linkffn(5318441)!

A Hero is a great oneshot where dudley gets his redemption arc a lot earlier than canon. it's interesting watching someone so young have to face facts and try to come to terms with what he learns, and grow from there.

Box on the Stool is possibly the only Kretcher-centric story I've ever come across, and almost unaccountably the best. It really makes you feel something for the little guy and the potter family.

** Instead of the obvious I'm going to mention two more obscure fics...

I've recently stumbled upon "Loopy Lovegood", which is an abandoned Harry, Hermione, Luna time-travel fic, with a unique twist:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9072648/1/Loopy-Lovegood]])

IMHO it's worth it just for the premise, but I'm a huge sucker for -Ron +Luna, so I'm biased.

I also quite enjoyed Catharsis:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4347702/1/Catharsis]])

Time travel fics are usually quite trite, but I often notice that it is easy to make them interesting again by adding something special.

** Linkffn(The Little Veela That Could)

It was one of the first long (300k) fics I specifically remember. I'm reading back through it, and it holds up pretty well.

Good action, interesting politics, and a main character that's sweet enough to rot your teeth, yet strong enough to make its enemies have nightmares.

I never hear about the story on here, so I'm interested to see what other people think about the story

** The Definition of Normal and its sequels are fantastic. They start with the rather heartwrenching premise that at a young age, Harry figures out that the dursleys want him to be "Normal," and they will treat him better in the name of that ideal. It's brilliantly fucked up, and the author has a /magnificent/ touch for making every character in the series- including *Voldemort* into an actual fleshed out person with goals and desires of their own. It also has a tremendous amount of worldbuilding, really getting into the fact that wizards are literally an entire alien civilization, with their own culture, traditions, and religious beliefs.

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter)

This fic is an Alanna the Lioness take on Harry Potter that was really refreshing to read. I really loved how independent Harry was in this fic. In this Harry is technically an oc but is still Harry Potter and female. She's trying to pass as her male cousin to attend Hogwarts as this is a pureblood only school in this universe, and her cousin is passing as her to attend the school she was supposed to go to. I don't want to give too much away but I really enjoyed it and I think anyone with an open mind would enjoy it too.

** Why read the following stories? The first two are quite unique, both in writing style and plot. The third is the sequel to Fake-a-Smile's 'Taking Control', written with his permission.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129984][Splinters]] by GHL

*Summary:* In the secret mists of time, a truth has been shattered. The path to victory has been cursed with despair... and nobody realizes it.

It is 1995 -- the summer of their discontent. Sequestered within the grimy walls of Grimmauld Place, Harry and Ginny begin having strange dreams of an era long past and events yet to come. Are the dreams somehow real? Is fate taunting them with tragic visions of doom, or are they being granted a precious chance to survive... and fall in love?

Note: this story presumes canon until Chapter 4 of OotP... beyond which things begin to go haywire.

*Words:* 175,693

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130225][Fires of Time]] by GHL

*Summary:* All space and time is relative. The only constant is the speed of... fire. Victory in tatters; great deeds undone; the world is unraveling, and Ginny has vanished. Yet somehow, with the shared strengths of a cadre of highly implausible allies, Harry finds the will to persist through a bewildering tangle of centuries and realities, all hurtling toward an explosive, time-bending eruption. An impossibly charring sequel to the utterly fractious Splinters.\\
*Words:* 64,675

[[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129801][The Prevailing Counterpoint]] by GHL\\
*Summary:* "We can prevail," Ginny whispered. "I mean sooner. Not later. Not months and months of people dying and lives being torn apart..." As the summer of 1997 draws to a close, Harry and Ginny return to Hogwarts to forge unlikely alliances, protect the innocent, and dispel the encroaching darkness. Propelled by powerful convictions and enlightened by a reclusive pair of mystics, they glimpse an unlikely path to victory.

Making the most of every day in a race against the clock, our two protagonists move all of the pieces into place: teaching, learning and refining their way toward a perfect strategy to quell the mounting threat. But one sudden disaster tips their world on end: armed with love, humour and steadfast friendships, they careen wildly toward the ultimate clash.

*This is a modest attempt to explore where Matt Fake-a-Smile's thrillers 'Taking Control' and 'Free Life' could have taken us if the stories were extended.*

****** As this week, Chapter 6 has been released, I can say a wee bit more by now.

The story is WIP and is updated weekly, on Tuesdays.

It's about a group of young people in London in 2002, the musicians Lee and Harry, who perform with their amateur band in such legendary locations like Camden Town stage or the Half Moon. Ginny and Mione are typical students, often in the library, where Harry also works part-time. In the beginning, Harry/Lee and Ginny/Mione don't know each other. Without knowing it, they all have something in common, they have no or only vague memories of their childhood. It's obvious that Harry and Ginny somehow knew each other in their childhood, but they don't remember. It's obvious that their childhood must have been different as we know it from the books. Oh, and at least Harry and Ginny are aware that they have strange powers (magic) but don't know what it means. As noted in the summary, they unconsciously seek to be whole again.

Oh, and at the very beginning of Chapter 1, Lee gets a copy of Goblet of Fire. I have no idea what that means, but it seems to be important since their past obviously differs from their counterparts in the books.

I can't say more at the moment. I'm waiting eagerly for the next chapter next Tuesday.

Are you interested? Then I recommend you to have a look at the review section on SIYE. If you like riddles, you're welcome to join the other readers to try to unravel the mystery. The review section of GHL is always fun to read.

  The war didn't end when Harry and Voldemort fell. Hermione refuses to feel helpless any longer, and goes back in time to remove the scar that an unloved Tom Riddle left on the wizarding world. Tangled in the pureblood sphere, will Hermione just become another cog in Tom Riddle's plans? Final pairing is a secret! But not a Tomione. Lestrange OC. Parent!Hermione Child!Tom. COMPLETE!

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

** With Strength of Steel Wings is my favorite fanfic, hands down, any fandom. And I don't even like Harry Potter. It's a 700k masterpiece of worldbuilding and intrigue, with characters who act like people and a damned good plot. And if Harry's a little bit of a Mary Sue, that's okay, because AngelaStarCat manages to make him an /interesting/ one.

** There's a series on Wattpad called “The Marauders” written by Pengiwen.

It's pretty cool although there are a few mistakes concerning timeline with characters and stuff like that, all in all it's pretty good. It also follows all seven years, so far she's still on the sixth year (she had to split both year's five and six into two parts each)

It does go into Wolfstar (Remus and Sirius) I don't really ship them but it's not too bad.

I'd say it's a lot more detail especially within the classrooms at Hogwarts then Harry Potter but it also keeps that emotional story telling that we know and love (one chapter made me sob)

It's the first fan fic I've ever actually read other than my own but it's a joy.

So if you're interested in the Marauders time at Hogwarts, give it a read
