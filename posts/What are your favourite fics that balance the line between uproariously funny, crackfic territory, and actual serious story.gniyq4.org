For me, it would have to be linkffn(Triwizard Tales) as it's obviously humorous, has a few running jokes, but treats itself as a serious story and has a coherent, reasonable, and enjoyable plot.


** linkffn(8197451; 8509020) Funny and somewhat cracky, while still having a reasonable plot.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them! Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Gryffindor isn't what Slytherin sees in it, and the reverse is even more true. The Potters don't know they look different depending on where you're standing, the Blacks know precisely how they come across and like it that way, and Severus Snape isn't quite who anyone thinks he is---least of all himself.Britain, Spring of 1980. No one cares what's fair when their people are on the line, and truth would be subjective even if everyone told it. Brute-force bloody battles are how Gryffs (and Lestranges) think; when a sane Slytherin wants power it's all smoke and smiles, masks and mirrors. Roll up your sleeves, slip into your cloak, and slap that dagger on your belt. This is war, people---pick a side! ...What the hell. Pick three.Ch. 1: Hogwarts has a history, Narcissa has a party, Rodolphus shares a fun craft activity with a friend, and Severus is left with the body a bit of a dilemma. He thinks all the mysteries he's read will help him.Aha. Ha. Ha....Ch. 72: July 31, 11:45 pm:Potter vs Snape, round 993,234,546,878. Snape vs Potter, round 1.

  It seems like fanfics have had baby Harry raised by every character in fiction except for one: Godzilla, King of the Monsters! Watch as I descend into madness trying to take this story semi-seriously, by which I mean that it will have a plot that tries to make it work logically.For G-fans, this takes place in the Shōwa continuity (for non G-fans, that means the goofy 60s and 70s Godzilla). For fans of both, or just Harry Potter, sit back and enjoy the lunacy!
