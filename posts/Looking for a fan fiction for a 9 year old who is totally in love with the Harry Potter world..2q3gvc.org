She read the first four book, so the best would be something from the past or some spin-off stories. Anything which you really liked. Thank you, everybody in advance. :)


** My number one recommendation for this would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks]]: Harry and Hermione investigate the disappearance of [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Sally-Anne_Perks][Sally-Anne Perks]], who, in the canon books, was sorted just before Potter but then wasn't called to be tested for the OWLS (even though her name would be between Patil and Potter, both of whom were called). What was probably an error by Rowling, the writer spins out into a mystery that does an amazing job preserving the atmosphere of the early books.

Another that preserves the spirit is an AU, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl]]: Simply put, Ron was born a girl, and consequences are explored.

** The following list is from my favorites. I have not read all of them recently, and so I can not guarantee that all of them are age-appropriate. I would suggest double-checking them before passing them one. (Also, I might not be the best judge of what is appropriate for a 9-year old girl, much less your daughter.) I've tried to make sure they don't contain any spoilers for later books, but, again, I can't be 100% sure. Most of them are one-shots, and they should all be completed.

******** Obviously it's inappropriate for the request. That's the joke -_-

Trolling would be recommending an inappropriate fic that looks appropriate and not giving any warning. Such an action would be malicious and could result in unfortunate consequences.

But as said, there's no chance that said 9-year-old will end up reading the story, because it's clearly inappropriate from a cursory glance. It's the most inappropriate fic in the fandom.

********* First of all, I understand the "joke", I just don't find it funny. Maybe it makes me humourless, or maybe I just have a different sense of humour than you.

Second, do you know the OP? Do you know for 100% sure he/she will review all suggestions? Are you certain that he/she won't just trust the recommendation, load the page and hand the iPad to his daughter? That he/she won't simply load up the recommendation page and let his daughter browse through the suggestions? Your assumption that said 9-year-old won't end up reading the story is, unfortunately, not 100% guaranteed.
