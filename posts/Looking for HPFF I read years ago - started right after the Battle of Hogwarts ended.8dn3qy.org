I don't recall the exact name, but I think it was in two parts. I believe one was called 'summer of X' and one called 'winter of X'. I distinctly remember one chapter where Harry is renovating Grimmauld Place and the Dursley's turn up to help.

Any help appreciated, I'd love to read it again.


** You're looking for "Harry Potter and the Summer After the War" and its sequel, "Harry Potter and the Winters After the War", by MrsGranger. I believe those are also posted to FF.net.
