Like in every fanfic I've read, but here is the most recent one from Harry Potter is a Dragon and That's OK. Harry takes out a copy of Quibbler and we get this:

"You don't honestly believe that, do you?" Hermione asked, sniffing.

Is this a British thing, or should they be instead writing "scoffed"? I've never once read an author of fanfic use "scoffed" when a character is obviously expressing scornful derision.

In my head, unless someone is sick, I automatically change "sniff" to "scoff".


** I guess for the same reason everyone is smirking so much. Lack of vocabulary.

** It's basically turning your nose up at something, as if its beneath you. Scoffing is more a sense of disbelief.

** I'd never considered it, but it could be a very British thing to do. Sniffing rather than scoffing has a certain upper-class feel to it -- a wordless noise of disapproval but less uncouth than scoffing -- and personally I can easily imagine the tone and expression someone has when they're expressing scorn this way, even if I can't explain it well.

*** I've always thought it was the expulsion of breath from the nose. The exact opposite of a sniff.

It's just not a reaction I can empathize with, at all. Have you ever seen something kinda dumb and had your reaction be to inhale through your nose?

**** I don't think it's meant to be about inhaling or exhaling. Have you heard the expression “turned their nose up”? I think that the way that “sniffed” is used is to convey this expression because that facial expression is the same when sniffing and for looking down on something. That's just my interpretation at least. Overuse is simply due to lack of vocabulary or knowledge of other ways to write a scene.

***** I don't like interpreting "turn one's nose up" as "sniffing". If you think something is dumb, you scoff at it, no matter how it smells!

****** Oh, smell has nothing to do with it. It's very much an affected reaction, something done intentionally for its effect, though there could be an underlying implication that the thing is so bad as to give an unpleasant whiff. It's also a short sniff, usually with a curl of the lip, sometimes accompanied by a 'hmph' of disapproval. And in England, it does very much have the connotations of turning one's nose up at something; someone sniffing derisively at something is saying 'this thing is beneath me', possibly even 'this thing is so far beneath me it's not even worth a scoff'.

Or do you change "sniff" to "scoff", too?

**** I also change it to scoff. Honestly, I wish more fanfic writers would understand that it's okay to just use "said". Canon HP uses "said" extensively.

***** I'm a journalist in the Navy. When we had to go through our A School to learn newswriting, almost every single one of us tried to use words other than "said". But "said" is often the most appropriate verb to use, and the least intrusive during exposition.

Most of us feel about "said" the same way we feel about seeing our nose, feeling our tongue, or breathing: if we don't overthink it, it's not an issue.
