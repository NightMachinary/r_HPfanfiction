:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm pretty sure this was on FF.net and in it lily and James survive Halloween night, but there is a fire at there house and they think Harry was killed. But he accidentally apparates away and is placed in a mugger foster home where he is passed between families and abused. At ten he runs away and lives on the street and finds a group of kids he thinks of as family but they kick him out for magic and his hogwarts letter. James and lily have another kid but they always talk about and mourn Harry. Sirius on one Halloween (14 years after I think) goes to the park and finds a sick kid on a beach and nurses him back to help and thinks he's Harry. Then he and Remus run a blood test and it is Harry. Then the story is the potters Remus and Sirius rehabilitating Harry and giving him family. Anybody know which fic this is? Or anything similar?
