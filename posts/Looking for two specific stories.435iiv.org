Hi! I'm looking for a story where Harry was the heir to one (or more) of the founders and there was a secret compartment to the Hogwarts train only accessible to the heir of the founders, and nobody believed it was real. and Ron was being an ass to Harry in the story. Can't remember anything else about the story, or the name. I think it was a Harry/Daphne, or at least not HHr or Harry/Ginny.

Also I seem to remember a story with daphne/Harry pairing where Neville and Hermione were together. All I remember is that all their parents, including Neville's gran was discussing them and what Dumbledore had done/was planning on doing. They might have been heirs or Lords.

If you know, thank you!


** I read the first one you're looking for like 2 weeks ago and I don't think i saved it but i'll try find it for you.

And I believe the second one is linkffn(Second Chances by Zaxarus) there's a surprising amount of Harry/Daphne that Includes Hermione/Neville and the whole lordship

*** Second chances is spot on. I read the one with the train compartment, but I don't have any recollection of which story it was...

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
