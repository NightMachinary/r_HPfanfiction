*** I think so. I don't remember exactly. Read it several years ago. She just had the muggle line of thinking that if blood loss is high she should just transfer her blood to save him and did it without thinking of consequences. I think people were freaking out about it in the background with regards to blood marriage bond.

***** Do you remember if it was long or short? Ao3 or [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]? That would certainly help narrow down because I know I've read it, im certain of it but i just can't seem to remember how long it was, i don't think i finished it.
