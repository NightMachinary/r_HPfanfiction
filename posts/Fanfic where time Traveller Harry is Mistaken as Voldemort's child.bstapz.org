:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It not a fic where Harry is actually LV's son nor Blood adopted of sorts. But rather plain and simple, everyone assumes that they're Riddle's kid since they know so much about the dark lord and speaks snake.

Harry also refuses to say his real name/last name and just uses Lupin/Evans "to piss off Voldemort" I believe is his reason that's why he chose that obviously fake name. So people assumes they simply didn't want to be labeled as LV's kid. The truth is that Harry is a time travel(or dimension travel) anyway,Harry creates a new timeline where LV is destroyed early.

But yeah, everyone still assume Harry is LV's kid and simply believes that the kid needs a second chance so they bring it up to him. But really, he has no relationship with Riddle whatsoever. It's just been a long time and memory is faliable so they think Harry looks like human LV but it's simply the way he carries himself, his power, and mannerisms that bleed through his stint as a Horcrux.


** There's the fic Harry time travels through dementor, pretends to be a squib, and Dumbledore is convinced Harry has hidden his last name due to his father being Voldemort. linkao3(The Second String)

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool has a fem!Harry who travels back in time where McGonagall thinks she is Voldemort's daughter because she's a parselmouth. She also takes on the name Evans to piss off purebloods.

Not sure it's what you were looking for though.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

**** So far no luck, but I have found about a dozen other fics to add to my list of things to read.

Do you remember if the fic you're looking for was a long one? short? 10k 50k 100k? Might help narrow things down a bit.
