In my spare time, I've been dabbling in a multi-chaptered work for this fandom, one that trends dark -- a murder mystery featuring a Slytherin Harry of dubious morality -- so I'm curious about this sub's view of the dark fic genre. I also have some more questions than just the one in the title.

/The Other Questions/

- What do you want to see *more* of in dark fics?

- What do you like to see *less* of in dark fics?

(For reference, a dark fic could be, depending on your definition of it, something that's simply darker than canon and/or something that deals with dark and often disturbing subject matter.)


** More of:

True cunning and plans that lead to goals that aren't whitewashed. If you make Harry a bad guy, make him a bad guy for real.

Branch out into other realms of evil. There is decidedly too little gangster Harry out there. I would love to see a Harry that truly strives within the deadly sins and the author doesn't try to make it seem ok for some trumped up reason.

Less of:

You may have guessed it, whitewashing. Its cool if Harry himself tries to justify his actions to himself, but the author should try to not make it seem like what he does is truly out of some sort of twisted morality.

Lord Potter - nuff said

Psychopath Harry. There are so many out there doing that, letting him follow in Voldemort's footsteps. Some cold and calculating evil would do the fandom some good.

The crime genre is one that I /always/ check out on FFN but there are hardly ever any new fics. The gangster Harry ones are an even smaller percentage of that percentage. /feelsbadman/

There's a certain kind of dark Harry fic I'm pretty tired of, and those are the psychopath ones. Just having him be evil for evil's sake. That gets old fast.

I's also add the Joker here. A Harry acting like the Joker would be interesting. Plus, make him a squib or something to create a similar sort of power-environment as Joker vs. [DC Superhero]. Pure violent anarchism would be one hell of a ride for Harry.

Just as a fast idea.

** - More: hidden psychopath Harry. I want a Harry that tortures small animals and then turns around and presents a near-canon personality to the rest of the world. Bonus points if the facade slowly crumbles- might be a good reason to have a semi-good Umbridge.
- Less: Lord Potter and WBWL. There are definitely some good ones out there, but the vast majority are, well, derivative drivel. If you don't have the writing and characterization chops to make it shine, it's best to just find a novel plot and work off of that.

Now /that/ would be far scarier than the average psychopath Harry fics -- a guy so repulsive and two-faced that he makes Umbridge look decent.

** More - a more social Harry, in the sense that he cultivates connections, finds out what makes people tick, how he can exploit it (and them), makes bargains, mutually profitable deals.

More - Harry being subtle.

Less - Harry ranting.

Less - useless angst. It has a place, but unless it's used for something constructive (a plot point, character development) it can easily stifle a story.

**** I love dialogue. A good conversation between characters can carry me over some very mediocre writing.

But completely agree on the ranting part. Even though Harry is probably one of the people who truly deserve to rant from time to time, its still annoying.

** I want see *more* ambiguous dark fics, fics where Harry tortures people but it can be very debatable whether he's right or wrong. Fics tend to feature either the super!evil or 'it's necessary because the good guys are so incompetent.' I want more fics where both sides are smart, both are competent, and they both have good points. Harry just falls on the darker end.

I want *more* Loyalty/Friendship/Love being the reason for dark actions. I always run into fics where it's about self-interest, revenge, or "enlightenment" ('there is no good and evil' trope). However, HP is filled with people who would lie, die, and kill for each other. I want more fics where that's what destroys everything.

*More* regular crime. Not everyone wants to take over the world. What about the aurors going after a serial rapist using the Imperius? A muggle convincing his magical kid to help him steal? A wizard on the run who uses magic to steal a powerful muggle's identity? A serial killer whose trophies are transfigured bodies they keep on the shelves or on a charms bracelet? Magic can bring up a whole bunch of disturbing subject matter.

*Less* of "bad is powerful' fics. There's no reason Harry turning bad will make him a prodigy.

*Less* dramatics with dark subject matter. I can get behind Harry becoming suicidal in fics. I can't handle him literally bursting into tears every chapter, telling absolutely everyone about the torment in his soul, and every exit including stomping and door-slamming. It's the same with abuse fics where it's labeled as abuse, but the Dursleys are really housing a freaking torture chamber. Some impactful dark themes are the ones that don't oversell it.

** More: Actual process of struggling to learn new magic, including making mistakes that affect the plot. Harry is talented, but he is no Tom Riddle. Even Tom had trouble accessing all of the knowledge he wanted, and it would be great to read about Harry meeting obstacles as well. More realistic motivations to commit evil acts. Fear, loyalty, neglect, maybe even honest misunderstandings. There is also not nearly enough regret in fanfiction.

Less: Obvious bashing and ranting. The only acceptable time for this was in this one fic that had Harry poisoning everyone at a Weasley wedding, and halfway through his giant rant everyone was so far gone that they weren't even listening to him. That was original and extremely black humor (or at least I found it kind of funny...) I'm sick to death of Harry going to Gringotts, learning Dumbledore's been stealing money from his inheritance, and then vowing to end Dumbledore's evil regime, followed by a long and unnecessary shopping trip. It's been done. Time to move on. Also getting tired of Harry being taught everything about pre-Christian rituals like Samhain and describing them in vivid detail. Yes, author, I know you did some research. More story please!

** I like Dark!Harry when he isn't the head bad buy, but more of an elite general type. linkffn(Avatar of the Occuria) This fic is a guilty pleasure of mine. Quite a few tropes that annoy me, and Harry isn't technically a bad guy in it, but he's close to what I'm talking about in there. A high-ranking official but /not/ the head honcho.

Otherwise, I'd really advise giving Harry a good reason to be evil, without making him a pure-blood sycophant or generic psychopath. I agree with the suggestion that you not make Harry a "Good" bad guy, where he's doing the wrong thing, but his intentions are pure. Maybe he could have such a skewed moral compass that he doesn't realize how horrible the things he does are. A complete lack of empathy, for example.

** More: a downright evil, manipulative and sinister MC, especially if it's about Harry. It has happened quite a bit that I was expecting Slytherin!Harry to be Voldi 2.0 and in the end he bailed out when it came to torture etc.

Less: people automatically portraying Harry and Draco as BFFs if the former ends in Slytherin. Don't get me wrong, there's reason behind it, but even so I think Draco would be an arse for a long time as he'd be looking down on Harry's mixed blood.
