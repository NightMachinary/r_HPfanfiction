As someone fairly new on this sub, this seems weird to me, especially in cases where the bot works as intended *and* the post/comment that used the bot doesn't get a downvote.

******* By sharing the link you technically support its creation, and thus are not attempting to stop it. Therefore, Roko's Basilisk is functionally a much more realistic version of those old email threads. That being said, I personally would still recommend sharing it around, the more people who know the more likely it will come to be, right?

** Trying not to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but I think it's something to do with Reddit's upvote/downvote algorithm compounded by the huge number of bot accounts that float around "gaming the system."

People don't really talk about it much, mostly because it isn't news, but Reddit has a huge population of accounts that basically repost content to farm karma for the sake of selling the accounts (why anyone wants to buy those is beyond me). Since Reddit halfheartedly tries to prevent this, accounts that don't participate get flagged. So a lot of those bots will upvote/downvote randomly to seem more like a real human being.

There are also cases where bots will downvote other replies in a thread to boost their own content, but I don't think that's relevant here.

** There are voting bots that come through and down vote various different accounts or posts, or a reddit algorithm that does it. If you look at your own posts and occasionally refresh, comments that you make will occasionally fluctuate in score over time, even in comment threads that were viewed by virtually no one else and received only one or two votes when made.

*** I'm not saying you're wrong about voting bots in general, but there's a much simpler reasoning for the example you gave: that's just how massive caching systems work.

When you're reading a page, you're not getting all of the data from one place. And sometimes those places can disagree. Nowadays, large websites that have frequently changing and public data that have to be streamed to millions of computers have what we call “eventual consistency.”
