** Eh, I wouldn't say "the best" fics get ruined by it. Not many of the absolute best authors write harem or similar things.

I would agree tho that many very interesting fics with unique premises get ruined by it. That is a trend I definitely noticed. There seems to be some kind of correlation.

Maybe the author goes with a unique concept or premise and then says, "fuck it, its weird already, lets go all in" or something? Dunno.

Also, at least in my case, when I talk about "Harem or similar" ruining it, I mean ruining it by making that story point the focus of the story as soon as it is introduced, pushing the unique and interesting story point into the background. When well done I have absolutely no problem with Harems, or pretty much anything this fandom has thrown at me.

*** I'm gonna have to blame anime, and it's influence on this generation of 'insular' guys. They grow up with that media, and it's all about fulfilling their fantasies etc, so when that concept enters fanfiction, a ground ripe with wish fulfillment, it sees a lot of use by sexually frustrated guys, and more importantly is made popular by sexually frustrated guys.

I could not stress just how many fanfics I've tried to read on certain sites that have /great/ writing and story ideas only to get bogged down in a mire of soft core porn and harems. It made me really sick of it for a while and is why I stopped reading online for a couple years.

** You know I actually had an art teacher like that. At the start of class, he'd do a quick drawing to show us how. And he'd do it better in 5 minutes than we could in 45. Only to add some weird colors or lines and make it look just slightly... off. If he'd stopped a bit sooner it would have been great. But he just kept adding to it.

Dunno why I wrote this. I'm not sure what the moral of the story is. Quit while you're ahead, maybe? Or maybe art is subjective and everyone has their own point of view on how things should be done?

For example I love Fleur/ Harry pairings, but I dislike it when Fleur is snobby/ bitchy or Harry is some sex god and hung like a horse at 14.

** 1. The influence of anime on the HP fandom is pretty significant. You can't deny that a large number of HP fans read manga/watch anime on the side. It also doesn't help that HP is a strongly anime-like story (magical school, unique main character, looming villain, etc)
2. People are horny self-inserters and want waifus.

** I've seen a good few fics with great premises... only for it to be ruined by having Harry shacking up with several girls -- usually Hermione /and/ Luna, for example.

Romance is interesting, yes... but multi/harem stories? Just "one-handed reading", if you know what I mean, and completely uninteresting.

** I mean, a story isn't ruined because it doesn't carter to /your/ taste. I think it's one of those opinions from readers which clashes with writers who are told to "write what they want to read". It's not a popularity contest or trying to make the best content but writers just genuinely enjoying a creative process of an explored idea that they wants to see.

Readers are just along for the ride and have a good chunk of fanfics to pick and chose from. If they aren't happy with how things turns out they're allowed to write their own thing or go to another story.

** I would saying there's kind of a weird correlation with really good stories and the author just feeling the need to throw in harem in their for some reason.... I would say it's just kind of one of those weird facets of fan fiction you have to if you don't like harem phase out that part of the story if you want to read the rest of it or just deal with it I guess if you really want to read the story I can see how it can get of knowing if you're not a particular fan of that aspect of the fandom.... a lot of the good world builds incorporate harem pairing for some reason.... You're not the only one that's noticed it can be kind of weird sometimes but if it's done not too horribly it's tolerable enough to where it doesn't spoil the rest of the story, For readers who aren't particularly fans of harems or that part of a pairing possibly

*** I definitely suck it up and read them anyway, because they ARE good fics.. but for example I just a read a pretty good “do it again” fic with Harry basically inventing magical space travel and had lots of interesting research and cool shit, but then the B plot was that he was a 26 year old man in his 11 year old body who was basically grooming all the main girls in his year to be in his harem using psychology to make them get used to being intimate and physical with him by constantly touching the girls (e.g. tickling, arms on shoulders, etc - all innocent/platonic stuff except that it was clearly stated that it was on purpose with an ulterior goal)... just creepy to me I guess

  Harry finds himself thrust into his four-year old body, after Voldemort killed him in the forest in what would have been his seventh year. Knowing what he did, he decided to fix some things he never had a chance to before. He'd not go into the magical world untrained this time. OP Harry. Science, magic and discovery. Harem.

** Imma be real, I don't really like harem fics. The thing that I hate is that the moment the harem idea gets introduced, the plot is forgotten for "plot". Goes back to pacing and planning. Everything is believable if you pace it well and write it right. But harem fics tend to lack pacing. There are probably good harem fics, but they are buried beneath mediocre fics.

*** My main issue with some harems is they focus too much on one of the girls.

Often Hermione.

I've seen /multiple/ such fics where Harry says straight out to the other girls how Hermione is #1, he'll always lover her the most, and so on.

I'm like: ... how is that NOT horrible to the other girls? Jesus, you don't go into relationships like that. I've known a few people iRL in Triad relationships, and that sort of thing would be the kiss of death for them, they'd eventually shatter.

** I didn't know it til recently but a harem actually means the part of a traditional Muslim house (or perhaps a wing of a palace, depending) that was female-only space, no men allowed. That sometimes meant that the multiple partners of a polygamous male lived in it, but not always.

HP and the Secret of Atlantis has a section set in a Sultan's palace in the Magical Ottoman Empire. The palace has a harem where various female characters live, and there is a subplot involving Harry and friends breaking into the harem to help a captive resident escape. But there is nothing about either Harry or the Sultan being a particularly multi-partnered romantic stud. Maybe that's not what you had in mind.

** Tbh i always thought that it's probably the readers fault, cause you as author most of the time probably don't expect to your story get noticed a lot so when suddenly you have 100 or 200 people reading your story and everyone has his own expectations, you put yourself under such pressure that you don't want to disappoint anyone, so you make the mc goes for harem, cause you can't disappoint if you choose all of them, right? The same happens when you been writing like 100 or more chapters, suddenly you don't know what to do because everyone has tips and ideas for your story so you become bored, and rush the ending or simply you drop it.

** I dont really find its "ruining" a fic unless they forced the story to completely focus on the harem. Everyone has different taste, and just as there are people who hate harem there are people who love it. If its done right, it can be really good and fun to read, its just difficult to write a good harem dynamic.
