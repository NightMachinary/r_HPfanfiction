I've tried searching every fic site I can, Google included, but I only find the places where people rec it(Wattpad, Tumblr, Live Journal, etc.) b I can't find the actual fic. Is it not available anymore or...? If the title and author are wrong, it's the After The War fic where the summery is about the Order figuring out its future, and Harry finding something ‘not quite as it should be' with records or something like that. It's technically about Draco finding himself and coping with the aftermaths of the war, though, so the summery is a bit misleading.


** Found the actual summery: The first post-war Christmas is coming to Grimmauld Place. As the Order of the Phoenix ponders its future, Harry sorts through a maze of war records and quickly begins to see that not everything is as it should be.

**** Thank you!I take it ‘died' is just an, err, metaphor?is that the right word? It's late.

​

edit: even later now. Bit confused why the didn't finish with the mystery, seemed cool. Though, I can't find it to be upset over it, it's a brill ending. And I realize the writing is terrible, but it's still late for me.

**** Also, I've been looking for Walking The Line which is a bloody classic in the fandom---it's THE Drarry fic, up there with Turn. I, unfortunately, can't find it. Is it the same? I'm on mobile right now---my laptop won't turn on---so....But the point is such: I can't find Walking The Line.
