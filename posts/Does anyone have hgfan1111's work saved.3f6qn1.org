I vaguely remember reading his/her work a few years ago and searched around for their work when I got back into fanfiction earlier this year. I only just found an older archived post here talking about their stories and how the author had purged them due to a book contract. So does anyone have his/her stories saved and is willing to e-mail them to me?

*** If anything is going to make me finally set up a dropbox account I guess this is a good reason.

But seriously Thank you very much, I'm sad that all I can offer is a measly upvote in return
