As it says in the title...

... But some further information, would like to see a story where either Voldemort mistook the information and went to kill Neville Longbottom and he survived, or did kill him and Voldemort carried on. Or if Harry went in to Slytherin and become evil and joined forces with Voldemort and Neville had to save the day.

Just interested!


** I remember one I read were Harry had been kidnapped and the world thought Neville was the 'Boy-Who-Lived'. It was a Gray!Harry (but ultimately good, in part due to his [obviously AU] younger brother and parents) and it showed Tom Riddle as a sort of dad and Draco as a good guy/friend.

I remember it being fantastic, but that's kinda it! I hope someone suggests it because I'd love to read it again.

Anyway, it fits your prompt. :)

*** Could you mean the "The Darkness Within" by Kurinoone? I haven't finished it yet, but it sounds like it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/9/The-Darkness-Within]]

**** Possibly, I'll read a couple chapter and see if it is. If not, it does look good regardless.
