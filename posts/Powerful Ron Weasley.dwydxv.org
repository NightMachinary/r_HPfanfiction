Does anyone know any good Ron Weasley fanfics.

I'm looking for stories with Ron Weasley as the main character, ones where we really see Ron as a powerful wizard or successful wizard, not just the pitiful sidekick of Harry Potter. A ture BAMF Ron Weasley.

I like variety So stories of Ron being placed into houses that aren't Gryffindor is okay

And please no Ron/Hermione relationship

If you have any ideas leave a comment.


** There's a bunch of fic by [[/u/Stafox5]] that feature a badass Ron. I think his fics are about 50-50 for HP/HG and RW/HG 'ships, so if you are very averse to RW/HG 'ships, you might want to filter on that.

** I remember liking [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][The Red Knight]].

Just over 200k words. Ron is reincarnated in an AU of Harry Potter.

** Not sure about what the pairings will be but there's The Chessmaster linkffn(12578431)

The trio all have a little genius to them and are treated more equally. I enjoyed the first year but I can't really remember why I stopped.

Theres also Fate linkffn(13170637) which probably fits what you're looking for better.

Ron has seer-like abilities which leads him to studying harder to protect his family. I was enjoying it for the most part but around year 2 there was a bit too much teenage drama it felt like they were having and the same arguments over and over again and it started getting tiresome. The writer also uses the word "Shite" /way/ too liberally. Not 100% on the pairings but it was heavily leaning away from Ron/Hermione where I stopped.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): Ron is the true hero of this story. He is the one who leads the troops and fights on the frontlines. Harry and Hermione, apart from some early actions, are mostly directing the war on the political level.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/1/Uncle-Quentin-s-Spy][Uncle Quentin's Spy]], linkffn(11102515): This is a crossover with BtVS. Ron did something truly awesome later in the story, and Lavender is very sympathetic too.

Both above fics are written by [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]]. Other than this author, finding awesome Ron without R/Hr is extremely difficult.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED
