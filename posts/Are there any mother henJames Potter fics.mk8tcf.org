Basically the title. I read an absolutely awful fic about Sparky the House Elf - if you've read it, you know what I'm talking about - a few days ago and in need of James Potter fluff. I've recently come across this idea, and it sounds amazing and so fun to read!


** Is the fic you're talking about the one with the super paranoid James who forces Harry into a shopping cart and is terrified Harry will be at harm anywhere, even destroying soup cans he thinks are threatening?

*** It was where Harry and Ginny (I think) basically adopted an abused house elf, left him alone with baby James only to come home to find that the elf made wine out of James's blood. It was disturbing.
