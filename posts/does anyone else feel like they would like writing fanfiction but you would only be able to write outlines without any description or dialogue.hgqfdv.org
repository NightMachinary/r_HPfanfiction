***** Same here. I've got like 10 or so polished fic ideas, but no ability to actually make it a story.

Heck, I've got an idea for an original story, but I can't even decide if it should be set in like the early 2000s, or in the early 1900s. One would work better in that I lived through it and therefore have a decent reference point for the culture of the time, while the other would work better on the basis of communication speed, what with a distinct lack of cellphones and all.

In that same vein, I'm basing the story off of anime romcom tropes, but with ideas of my own mixed in (ie traveling the world instead of staying in a single area the whole time). So should it start in Japan, or America? If I did Japan, I'd likely choose early 1900s since a lot of people left Japan back then to either see the sights or settle down in America, while an American protagonist in the early 2000s would likely have a similar reason for visiting Japan.

Both have a disaster involving travel that I feel would fit the story as a gut punch without feeling contrived for its inclusion.

For whatever reason, trying to write fanfiction just compounds all my self doubt because at that point my story isn't in a vacuum because there are thousands of stories using all the same characters as me, which makes it exponentially more intimidating to attempt.

+Write a version of your major scenes. Then write a second version, this time include a couple of scenes you think should be between those scenes. Then write a third version, and repeat the addition of more scenes you feel like should be between. Don't hesitate to alter or remove those scenes if you feel like they are not working.

But quite good for mapping out scenes and chapters. As well as POV characters for the chapters. We'll see if I get myself moving on the writing front after August and I can give a better estimate in how it's helped me with actual writing.

*** Saaame. I can get a great idea in my head and write rabidly, sometimes for days or weeks, then I hit the end of my 'daydream' and lose all inspiration to continue. Not because I don't /want/ to, but because I literally can't 'see' what comes next. It's like I was watching a movie and someone turned off the TV. That /always/ happens, without exception, unless the story I'm writing is literally only a one-scene joke plot. And I never, ever manage to get much past that point, because if I try, it inevitably comes out terrible.

And sometimes I'll already be writing, and a game-changing thought occurs to me, but it contradicts something that happened earlier--usually something which was pivotal to the story ending up at that point in the first place.

Only once can I remember the game-changing thought actually fitting in with the original plot. It was like I'd been writing it that way from the beginning, and it was /glorious./ (Until my inner TV shut off as always. T_T)

***** A unique idea I've never really seen one is one in which Harry chases immortality himself (but tries to do it better than Voldemort). There are a few interesting backstory reasons this might work well:

- Harry is the rightful heir to the Deathly Hallows
- His ancestors' motto was "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death"
- Harry's parents are obviously dead; he might reject death entirely as something that should be applied to good people
- As the last hope of the people against Voldemort, survival is his top priority
- Harry deflected the Killing Curse as a child

There are so many cool things that could be done here. Harry could team up with Diary Riddle into a true solution for immortality, all while battling Voldemort at the same time. There is so much room for worldbuilding and exploration, as Death isn't something you conquer in a weekend trip. I can see Harry raiding to ancient Egyptian tombs, investigating covens of vampires or other creatures that live unnaturally long, opening a portal to the Phoenix world to see what the deal is with their immortality.

There are also a lot of cool things you could do with Book 1. The Sorcerer's Stone is not something Harry would be able to retrieve from the mirror, after all... but he would definitely try. If the stone isn't destroyed in this scene, then perhaps he would later attempt to raid the Flamel estate and steal it himself (or at least try to steal the notes from which it was created). He would fail of course.

If you want morally (dark-)grey, you could do some really neat things. As the Voldemort situation gets worse, and Harry has no practical solution in sight, he might resort to making a single Horcrux out of of someone unquestionably terrible. Bellatrix after she murders Sirius, Pettigrew himself, or someone else. You could then have a very cool scene where he's very publicly executed by Voldemort, but then he's back again thanks to this Horcrux. But he would be a bit more off-kilter after this and realize that this is probably his last chance.

There would also be an interesting dynamic with Dumbledore around this.

Honestly the HP series makes /many/ references to immortality, more than usual in this category, but it's something I haven't seen reflected much in fanfic. I think there is a lot of unexplored cool stuff here.

*** There are many ideas for stories which do not require that much thought but haven't been written so far. For example, Harry asking Padma to be his yule ball date because he thought that she was Parvati from behind. Padma would probably know about the Cho thing and adjust her expectations, leading to a slightly different Yule Ball and possibly a romance down the road.

Or Harry/Lavender, either at Hogwarts (Yule Ball, comforting her after Ron left her) or afterwards (hasn't been done without bashing everyone under the sun).

***** Not every story needs to be a 7-year saga.

For the Padma one, it would basically be whatever you want her to be. Personally, I would make her understanding, add conflict between her and Cho and, without either really wanting it, having them develop an attraction over the evening.

For the Lavender one, well, it depends on when you set it. The obvious would be Harry comforting her, one thing leading to another and then have conflict with Ron, who suddenly is unsure about his feelings towards Hermione and Lav and feels betrayed despite telling Harry countless times that he had no further interest in Lavender.

** One bit of advice I was given about writing dialogue was to just write out the main points of the conversation in bullet points, almost like writing a play where its character A line, character B line and so on. And a couple of basic descriptions about what's happening. Then go back and fill in who is saying what, tweak the words to "fit" your character and add in the description around that.

So you'd start with something like this:

/Sirius couldn't believe he was free. And now he had something to ask Harry./

/-Did anyone ever tell you I'm your godfather?/

/-yes/

/- would you like to live with me?/

/- oh that would be great/

/Sirius wondered why Harry was so keen to leave his aunt's home./

So you now know the dialogue you want to write is between Sirius and Harry about moving in (yeah I've taken something v similar to PoA canon because my brain CBA to come up with something original today!) and you can tweak it to make it a "proper" writing draft:

/"Harry," began Sirius, clearing his throat awkwardly. "I don't know if anyone ever told you, but I'm your godfather."/

/"Well, I wouldn't say they told me, they never tell me anything. But yeah, I know." Harry scowled and kicked at the marbled floor of the ministry corridor. If only he had known about Sirius before. If only the man had been given a trial twelve years ago. He could have grown up with someone who, at the very least, tolerated him./

/"I know you probably won't want to, but James and Lily, that is, your mum and dad, erm, I'm not very good at this," Sirius trailed off and rubbed a hand over his gaunt face. "They wanted me to look after you if anything happened. So, if you'd like to..."/

/Harry gaped at him./

/"Leave the Dursleys? Live with a real wizard? Are you joking me? Of course I bloody want to. When can I move in?!"/

/Sirius hadn't been expecting quite as enthusiastic a response. After all, Harry barely knew him. There was clearly something else going on here, and he knew he would be having a very serious conversation with one Albus Dumbledore as soon as those papers stating his innocence were in his hands./

So once you know that you want to go from A to B to C, you sketch out the basics and then go back and fill in the gaps. There's your first draft.

Hope this helps a little.

Write a short summary of fic you want to write and your strengths: A) Plotting OR B) Writing. If you don't have a short summary, approach the people who do and offer them your services. Writing in pairs can be a good exercises and both people can learn from each other, bounce ideas off each other and maybe even motivate each other.

** I think everyone starts off feeling like that, in all honesty. I certainly did, back when I started writing. The only guaranteed cure, unfortunately, is to practice and research.

Writing until you work out how you wanna write is basically the first level of being a writer. If you're struggling with that, thinking that you're just gonna be bad and comparing yourself to the Big Names in FF that you've read or published Authors you enjoy, just remember - you don't have to be as good as them. In fact, if you're just starting out, you're almost certain not to be. But even if you can't be as good as those people, you can always, always, always be as bad as them. And remember, in the 1850s, a Portuguese-English phrasebook written by a man who couldn't actually speak English got published. And then republished several decades later.

Research is where the second level comes along. Basically, read stuff you wanna emulate and google stuff to help you. Nearly every published author 'how to get better at writing' thing I've ever seen recommends reading as a big way to improve. You might've seen the Fanfiction thing about Authors and other Creators not being able to read our stuff? This is the main reason why - Authors don't wanna read something a fan has wrote and pilfer phrasing or ways of describing stuff for their own work. And regarding research, if you find that you're struggling to write descriptions, go find stories that you think do it well, or go find resource lists of how to describe things (There are pages of websites on word and phrase resources to describe different things, like eyes, or sadness, or breakfast - and the 'describingwords' resource is invaluable [link below]).

For me, a good learning resource to develop the actual techniques came from D&D - being a player and a DM really helps teach those kinds of skills. I'm not the best at them now, by any means, but I'm definitely writing better prose than when I started, so I'd recommend looking up some tutorials on DMing and how they tell stories, describe scenery, or keep battles from descending into "Roll a D20. You hit! You do six damage. Now you roll a D20, you miss. Now you roll a D20- and so on".

The third level I forgot to mention - Editing. Even if your first draft is literal shit, you can edit it into gold. :)

** Yea. I usually only write what's essential for the story. When it comes to the details, I draw a blank - I can't even decide what details I should focus on, let alone what those details should be. If I force it, I just come up with something super contrived. But of course, without details, my writing ends up being rather dry.

** Yes, this sounds like me. Although I would say dialogue and a long term sustained plot are what I struggle with.

I've had a fic in mind for 5 years but I come to the same stumbling blocks (albeit with better descriptions) every time I try to write it. Mind you, I don't start it often.

** It's mainly how I operate, honestly. The outline isn't what gets published though so if it works for you to write a bare outline and tweak as you go along to make sure themes and plot points connect, then go for it!

My advice is, if that's how you work best then you may just want to make sure you complete the work completely before you start posting so you can go back and make sure everything winds up connecting.

My current work is an Auror casefic which makes it hard to stick to an outline 100% because you kind of have to build off of plot twists and unexpected bits that you may not have even thought of in the beginning. I actually made a detailed outline this time but still wound up cutting out scenes and adding new ones. Just get comfortable with changing directions when it makes sense.

** My #1 tip is to sit down without any written outline to stick to and write ONLY dialogue. Just the conversation. Like you are talking to yourself but you are both characters. Then add the rest later.

Also, I write fairly well on A03 for people into weird ass shit but I'd like to do something nice today/tomorrow/this week/I'm bad at schedules.

People, pop some one shot ideas or longer plots that could be summed up in a letter or address to someone else and I'll pick at least one to write for ya on A03

** That's actually how my first couple of fics were written. They were pretty much outlines that could have been fleshed out into longer stories with dialogue and everything but I didn't know how yet. Eventually I started getting more comfortable and figuring out how to add more descriptions and dialogue and all.

But even the outlines can be fun to read!

** Go for it!

I used to think like that too, but then I started writing and wrote continuously for 26 days! One chapter per day, and uploaded them without giving myself a chance to criticize myself.

That way, I got over the confidence issue, and learned through experience, writing better and better as chapter progressed!

All the best!

** I write very bluntly, without paragraphs of description or anything. Which tends to work better with fanfiction, when set in already existing places, since readers usually know what I'm referring to and already have an image for it in their minds.

That being said... I don't write very well, either, and I have many fanfiction ideas. I've actually written a few of the many I've had, and they have gotten decent reception on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] and AO3, even though it's been almost 2 1/2 years after I wrote a one-shot, people still want sequels. I'm just not sure what I was thinking 2 1/2 years ago, so it's going to be difficult.

** Okay this used to happen to me early on. (It still does but I would like to think I have gotten better. Hey let me live in my dreams...) I have been on fanfiction on around 10 years majorlynaa a reader but I write more often now. I have written pretty cringeworthy dialogues. All I can say that they get better with experience.

I just imagine the characters having the conversation in my head (of course I do not hear voices /avoids eye contact whilst whistling forcibly/ )and just think of what things they absolutely won't say. For instance a particular character doesn't curse because it's uncouth(it's just one example I actually think over a few points at least also including what that person is likely to say), the rest of it is my playground. (And I play like a messy baby)

I also have a tendency of using dialogues as info dumps. I am trying to master that art...
