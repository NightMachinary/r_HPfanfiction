"Oh... Severus Snape, yes, the headmaster will say a lot about you in the future... GRYFFINDOR!!!"

"What?!!? I'm supposed to be in Slytherin!"

"I already sent Pettigrew there earlier, a sensitive trade, you'll understand me someday..."

"Creevey? Colin Creevey?" the hat asked.

"Err... well yeah?"

"But what's the point...? Oh, well... Gryffindor... go now, yes, yes, hooray!" then, just as the boy made to the table, the hat started yelling, "Dead boy walking, I said dead boy walking!!!"


** This feels more like some sort of self-insert/isekai character as the Sorting Hat, which would still be a lot of fun.

** Y'know, this could actually be fun. Him sorting Harry to Hufflepuff or Slytherin. Him sorting Draco to Hufflepuff. Carefully moving people around hoping to change things for the better.

Eventually they reveal themselves to someone to get hands elsewhere.

*** "Tom Riddle?"

"Yes."

"The Tom Riddle?"

"I didn't know I was famous..."

"I mean not now, but.... Oh fuck it... HUFFLEPUFF!!!"

**** LOL.

That'd be a more cracky option, yes.

Or if you were doing one of the Manipulative Dumbledore tropes...

** Oh, that'd be fun.

"Well Dumbledore, the reason that I felt young Harry would be best sorted into Hufflepuff, is because he's not a fighter by heart. He cares a lot about innocent people, he can band others together better than he could in Gryffindor. Plus when the fake Moody comes, he'd have a harder time having the other students believe that Harry put his name into the Goblet"

"Wait... what?" Albus asked confused.

"Oh nothing Albus, just some musings from a old mad hat."

  It's 1998, and Tom Marvolo Riddle has apparently won, so the Sorting Hat decides to travel back in time and *try* to do something about that. Alternate Universe results. Manipulative! Sorting Hat. One-off piece. Humour/Tragedy, rated 'M' for occasional swear-words or strong language. (Punctuation corrections, 9th March, 2014)

** "You are going to Slytherin, Harry!"

"No, Not Slytherin!"

"Yes, Slytherin! You are eleven you don't know what's good for you, in Slytherin you will be great and help a lot of people. Don't let that Malfoy boy ruin things for you!"

"But what about-"

"Don't let /him/ ruin it for you too!"

"But every wizard-"

"That's prejudice, not true and /Merlin/ was in Slytherin too, the greatest wizard of all time! And Salazar wasn't bad either."

"Aren't you supposed to be impartial?"

"...I am supposed to place you in the best House for you, which /is/ Slytherin, you belong there you will see, now, you will go to that table and seat beside that nice blonde girl, Greengrass or something, just trust me. You can help them avoid darkness and be a guide to bring that House around."

"What-"

"Good Luck in SLYTHERIN!/"/
