Hello I'm looking for a fix I read a while age. All I really remember is the epilogue. It involved abarax malfoy talking to dumbledore after faking his death to become a pirate. The epilogue from what I remember took place during HBP I may be wrong about that though. Also I think I remember albums comparing harry to a young Gellert grindenwald.

If any of this sounds familiar could you hook me up cheers.


** That should be linkffn(5761261), "Little Differences."
