On one hand he's the best student of his year, full course load and top grades. On the other he's a complete moron: first he falls in love with crouch who has to be one of the least likeable people in the series, then he misses the fact that his boss is captured and imperiused for a year. Then instead of learning from it, or at least being humbled he completely betrays his family and everything they stand for and becomes the number one toadie for Fudge and Umbridge.. I just re-read that letter he send Ron about Harry after spending like three summer's together and knowing Harry saved his sister's life.\\
Then there's the Christmas scene with the new minister.

How is that guy supposed to be redeemable? I honestly have more respect for Pettigrew who at least has a realistic understanding of his own despicable character and makes the best of it.

Sorry for the rant of anyone has some insights or knows fics with interesting perspectives or gruesome bashing (or possible dismemberment) let me know xD

Ps. I know book smarts don't always translate to the real world but pfffft


** When you grow up poor, sometimes you just want to play the game and get ahead. I think that Percy may have resented his dad's stubborn refusal to play the game because it affected the Weasley family so acutely. I also think that Percy eventually gained an immense respect for that stubborn refusal.

*** I don't even think it was that Arthur refused to play the game. It's not that he wanted to advance but refused to be a kiss-ass and play the office politics. He didn't want to advance at all. He was happy to stay in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts office. If he moved out of that office, under normal circumstances, he wouldn't have access to his muggle toys.

He was promoted before /Half-Blood Prince/ in war-time, making it understandable that he'd put his personal desires aside.

Percy just didn't get him and probably even resented him a little (according to Percy's perception) for putting his hobby ahead of the family's prosperity.

** Percy's behaviour has little to do with intelligence and even less to do with academic intelligence. Percy has always been the rule follower, the "serious" one. He is ambitious. All he's ever cared about is how far he can get in life. Now, his father on the other hand, even tho he seems like an intelligent man and very capable wizard, appears to only care about superficial things, never even attempting to advance in the ministry and provide better for his family because he is happy with the position he's got. This is viewed as wasting oneself by someone with Percy's sort of mindset and priorities. Then, the minister sees this weakness in Percy, this thirst for advancement and recognition, and offers him a position he views as an honour and recognition for all his years of proper hard work. Ofc the offer is nothing more than a ploy, something that his father points out to him as soon as Percy announces his promotion, which ofc causes Percy to fall deeply in denial instead of admitting to himself that he is in fact still irrelevant. That is what makes him redeemable in many people's eyes, I suppose. This kind of mistake is the kind of mistake you expect from someone like Percy, so when u try and understand why they did all the bad things, u feel more sympathetic and forgive them much more easily at the first sign of true remorse.

** He's someone who is ambitious enough to have been a Slytherin if it wasn't for the fact that he's a Weasley. Sure, he gambled at the Battle of Hogwarts that Harry would win, but I feel like that may have been at least somewhat tactical.

That said, I love fics where he's actually a pro-Harry spy for the Order or Dumbledore.

*** Percy is the number one candidate for a Legacy Sorting if I never saw another. For Slytherin, but he didn't want to disappoint his parents. Or keep up appearances. Or, the ultimate Slytherin move: getting sorted into a different house to stay undercover.

** I think Percy is greatly misunderstood - people usually forget how young he is in many of the books.

Yes, he's ambitious, but he's also very good at being a prefect and Head Boy. He looks out for first years, assists professors, and takes on extra duties when the school is in danger without complaint. He also cares a lot about his siblings, especially Ginny, who he worries about throughout book 2.

In his final two years, the Chamber of Secrets opens (his girlfriend, younger Gryffindors like Hermione and Colin Creevey are petrified, Ginny, Ron and Harry nearly die) and a mass murderer breaks into Hogwarts (attacking Gryffindor Tower). Leaving Hogwarts, Percy probably doesn't trust Dumbledore, since his siblings and friends almost died multiple times saving the school.

Percy is 18! He gets a job with Barty Crouch Sr., who is known for his commitment to the law, even sending his own son to Azkaban. He idolizes someone who wants to make big change in the Wizarding World, like bringing back the Triwizard Tournament. Suddenly, his favorite boss stops showing up to work and just sends letters. Percy, an 18-year-old in his FIRST JOB, is basically running the Triwizard Tournament, serving as a judge and other stuff. He probably doesn't know this is normal and nobody says anything until they find barty going insane. The Ministry turns him into a scapegoat, and his entire reputation is only saved when he's hired by Fudge.

Percy believes the Ministry is good and that Dumbledore can't protect Hogwarts, based on the past few years. He's always been a hard worker (again, RAN THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT AT 18) and is upset when his family doesn't believe he deserved the promotion. He fights with his family and says things he knows will upset his father and leaves, a typical 19 year old.

Now, he lacks a lot of information on what's going on, since Fudge is his only source. He congratulates Ron, but warns him not to be loyal to Dumbledore (or those who are close to Dumbledore, like Harry). He thinks he's right, and wants the Ministry to fix Hogwarts based on what he saw in his final years there. At the end of the year, he finds out he was wrong and is ashamed, but still sees that Dumbledore has fashioned children (including Ron and Ginny) into weapons.

So, book 6 is hard: Percy probably hates himself but still tries to play reformer, working with Scrimgeour, who wants to defeat Voldemort. He goes to the Burrow at Christmas (forced by Scrimgeour) but feels like his family will never forgive him, and gets upset. He should have apologized here, so that's bad, but we know he just wants the Ministry to lead the efforts rather than support the Order.

Based on what you assume about Book 7, your characterization of Percy has to change. Scrimgeour is murdered for info on Harry, but why isn't Percy murdered for info on Harry, Ron, or Hermione, all of whom he has ties with? We know Percy abhors blood prejudice, discrimination, and wants the Ministry to be progressive, so I don't think he became a supporter of the new regime.

Realistically, he has no escape: his entire family is in hiding and wanted by the government, he's being watched and probably is in fear for his life. I personally think he tries his own resistance: might sabotage ministry efforts, create false leads on his family to protect them, or stays to protect Ginny, who is still at Hogwarts. Somehow, he does reach out to Aberforth, so we know he had contacts with the Resistance, we just don't know what he's up to in that book.

Is Percy complicit in Book 7 or a victim who survived because he was a pure blood estranged from his resistance family? I think the latter, but it's important to remember that Percy does care about his younger siblings and wants to make the Ministry better, and he came back in the end.

*** That is a very compelling explanation. Thanks for the insightful comment.

Still, I think at some point he called Umbridge a delightful woman, which is hard to defend. XD

**** He did! And that's Percy's biggest flaw: he is easily manipulated. Umbridge is also liked by the Minister (who Percy supports) and if he's met Umbridge, he wouldn't see her cruelty. Just somebody who supports reform at Hogwarts, is very friendly to Percy, and has experience in the Ministry. I think if he knew about the Black Quill, abuse of students, and Inquisitorial Squad, he'd be outraged. But we don't know if he ever learns about that.

** Why does he have to be redeemable?

He looks up to authority figures and strives to be the best. I don't particularly like him but I can understand him, I even know a few people like that. He would have been a great Slytherin or Hufflepuff, I think he values ambition and hard work above intelligence and courage.

*** I feel like he sort of gets redemption in the books, which is what I meant. And I agree on what you describe as being a recognizable/ understandable personality. Except for the fact that he has zero political instinct. It might just be that politicians are portrayed in a negative way by Rowling, but he completely exposes himself publicly by linking himself to horrible person after horrible person. I guess part of it is pride and just doubling down after he dug himself into a hole he couldn't get out anyone but he's just the kind of character that one sometimes has to rant about.
