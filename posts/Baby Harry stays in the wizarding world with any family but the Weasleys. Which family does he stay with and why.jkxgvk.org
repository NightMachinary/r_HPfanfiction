Edit: I didn't explain this clearly but I'm talking more about families that were available in the books original timeline so Sirius and the Longbottoms are out.


** Andromeda Tonks would be my bet. The Malfoys are influencial, rich, blah blah blah, but this is where I hope Dumbledore can be of use for once. There's also the possibility that the Lovegoods take in Harry. We don't know Pandora's Maiden name, do we?

*** Agree with Tonks - just because Malfoy bribed his way/imperius defence out of going to Azkaban, doesn't mean people would think he's suitable to take guardianship over Harry. Even in canon most of the “light side” were reasonably sure he was full of shit, I can't imagine they'd let him take Harry on top of everything else.

As for Pandora, while it's true that we never learn her maiden name, the likelihood of her being even somewhat related to Harry and no one ever mentioning it is extremely low.

** The Malfoys, because they are rich, influential, of good reputation, and vaguely related. Only the best for the hero of the wizarding world.

Don't fall into the trap of applying our knowledge and our standard about who is what and what is right.

** Narcissa Malfoy's Great Aunt was also Great Aunt of Harry's Godfather and was Harry's Grand Mother. And as far as the Ministry was concerned, Lucius and Narcissa were cleared of all wrong doings. Its perfectly conceivable that Harry would be placed with the Malfoy's, they're blood relatives (not necessarily close, but also not particularly far apart on the family tree), wealthy, and have a similarly aged child of their own. I imagine those 3 factors may weigh heavily in their favour, especially if they also expressed a clear desire to foster Harry. Which I imagine they might, given half a chance, since its the perfect way to rehabilitate their image in the public eye.

***** No problem, one of my gripes with canon is thst Harry dosent seek out information on his grandparents, we dont even get a name, it can be really easy to have Dorea be his grandmother. Dumbledore would of stood in the way of the malfoys getting custody of Harry, he already had a group of dedicated fighters who went against Tom and his followers

****** True, he could have put up violent resistance to Harry being placed with the Malfoys. But think about it logically. Dumbledore is the sort of man who tends to obey the rule of law, and work from within to effect change. If the Ministry placed Harry with the Malfoys following all the laws of the land, then Dumbledore would have to decide either to accept it and perhaps try to protect Harry from the background, or swoop in and kidnap Harry. He's not going to do the latter when he knows that it would result with him being branded a criminal and losing all influence.

******* Well, lol.

Isn't that exactly what he /did/? He doesn't cite it as a reason specifically -- that was all about protection (and Harry not getting a big head) --, but if I were Dumbledore, then precisely /because/ families like the Malfoys are a logical outcome, I'm rather removing him from the wizarding world entirely, before anyone even knows what's up.

Violent resistance isn't Dumbledore's style, no. Instead, he just does wtf he wants, and looks droll at other people when they try to arrest him.

******** Yes, he removed Harry from the Wizarding World. But the question in this thread was who does he get placed with if he DOESN'T get removed from the Wizarding World. I'd say its much tougher to circumvent Ministry rules if Harry is actually present.

********* Oh, absolutely. I'm just saying that was precisely why (and how) Dumbledore stood in the way of the Malfoys: By getting there first. Re: the previous comment.

It wasn't an accident that he sent Hagrid there at once.

We don't disagree. Don't mind me.

** Sirius is the best bet. When he got to Godric's Hollow, he faced an enraged Hagrid accusing him of being a traitor. He denied, and Hagrid asked him to come clean with Dumbledore, under Veritaserum and Legilimency.

***** I've said it before, Sirius is one of the most complicated characters in Harry Potter.

His first priority was Harry, and he repeatedly got screwed over by the system in the books.

Hell, his experience in book 5 being locked in Grimmauld place is life right now.

***** Sirius grows into the role of a father figure.

whose constantly thinking about if he is doing right by James and Lilly in how he raises harry.

I honestly imagine harry would become friends with Ron from a younger age

as sirius would worry harry would be lonely with only two adults for company

so he visits someone he knows due to an incident with his bike that shares his values and has a kid harry's age.

** I'm thinking Albus would probably do all he could to keep him away from the Malfoys, given he's well aware Lucius is an actual Death Eater (despite what his money says). There are other families with just as much of a claim and none of the suspicion.

Barring this AU keeping Sirius out of Azkaban (which would happen if Sirius was given custody immediately, without getting the chance to go after Pettigrew) I think the Tonks family is a relatively safe option - distantly related, a definitely-on-the-good-side family, and not currently in Azkaban.

Another option I can see being taken is the full-on disguise route. Harry wouldn't be the only child orphaned by the Wizarding War, it'd be easy enough to blend him into whichever system is already in place to take care of them and then just keep an eye out for wherever he ends up. In that case, all bets are off and he could end up anywhere.

** Assuming Sirius is still arrested for "killing" Pettigrew, it would definitely be the Longbottoms. Alice Longbottom was Lily's best friend, and it would have been their family he'd be placed with.

Edit: Well damn I read so much fanfic that I'm mixing up fanon with canon. My bad ^^"

*** There is a high likelihood that Harry would have been placed with another family that was part of the Order, right? This means that the Longbottoms are not necessarily a bad pick, though they may not want to adopt another toddler.

It's unfortunate that we don't know more about who Lily's friends were outside of James's friends. She must have made other friends her first 4-5 years considering she was not hanging out with James, Sirius, RL, and PP.
