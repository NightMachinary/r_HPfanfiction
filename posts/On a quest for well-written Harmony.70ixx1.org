Hi, I'm looking for Harmony fic suggestions. I don't particularity care about length, but longer fics are always appreciated. Most important thing for me is that the writing and characterization is top notch. No genderbend or dark!harry please. Thanks :)

** "The Sea King"

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King]])

I was asking around a while back for stories where Harry and Hermione run off into the Muggle world together, and this fic featuring Harry as the captain of a fishing boat came up.

"Jealous?"; "A Boy and His Cloak"

Probably the two best Harmony smut fics I've read. I recommend all three of these fics most highly, and I'm not even that much of a Harmony fan. Beyond this, if you want to dive in even further, there's an entire subreddit devoted to Harmony, as has been pointed out already. The fans there should be able to help you find exactly what you want.

  Hermione Granger sees it as her personal responsibility to take care of Harry in every way. So what else can she do when Luna seems to have a better method of calming him down, but try to outdo her? Slightly naughty, more than a little bit of crack fic.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry Potter put paid to Voldemort at Hogwarts; now it's nineteen years later and, as the diesels hammer on, a bushy-haired girl is still searching for The-Boy-Who-Walked-Away... Oneshot, Deadliest Catch crossover.
