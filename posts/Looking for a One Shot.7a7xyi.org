Like the title says, I'm looking for a specific one shot fic.

It's one of those stories where post-war Harry somehow gets pulled into another dimension that's still dealing with Voldemort.

It was entirely an accident, nobody summoned him. He gets taken in by James and Lily, who would very much like to get to know him. They have another kid, several years younger than Harry. Their Harry died.

It's clear that Harry suffered quite a bit from the war.

James notes that Harry seems to act quite a bit like Snape, only Harry is still polite.

Harry and Snape regularly snipe at each other, and it's implied that Harry finds some sort of enjoyment out of this - probably because it reminds him of the old days at Hogwarts, or something.

Harry expresses an interest in becoming a Healer. Dumbledore & The Order ask him to join, but they're not really pushy about it. Dumbledore is quite happy about the possibility of just having a Healer on call.

Harry's little brother person is at first resentful, but then does his best to properly integrate Harry into the family.

They don't go into any details, but James and Lily find out enough to infer that Harry was raised poorly.

Anybody know what fic this is?

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.
