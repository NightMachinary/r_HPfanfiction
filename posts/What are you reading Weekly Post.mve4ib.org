** I read something completely different for me, I tend to normally read things that are canon compliant, and I have no idea how I can across this fic either. It's based around Harry and an OC, but unfortunate events have led to this situation.

It's a fantastic read though, is written brilliantly that made me laugh and shed some years, easily 9/10.

** I read a great set of fics picked from reddit reading threads.

*Break* This is a Wolfstar longfic in the angst/drama genre with a lot of focus on mental health, introspection, discrimination. Read the warnings first! It was a good fic but it took me a couple of days to recover from it because it packs a punch emotionally. I actually think this is a stronger fic than ATYD in terms of characterizations but I can totally see it not appealing to a wider audience in the way ATYD did because of the themes it contained. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5252627]])

*73 Aberdeen* This is a Wolfstar fic. Angsty and dark but it's a great fic. Just read the warnings first! I liked the writing and Remus's characterization in this one. It's an AU done really well in just 30K words which is an amazing accomplishment. The Sirius in this fic is a surprising take on the character which works great in the setting.\\
linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987973]])

*House proud* This is a Drarry fic by astolat featuring a sentient Grimmauld Place. Sweet and funny. I really like Draco here. Since I was reading darker/angstier wolfstar fics this was a great change of pace. If you are looking for something lighter and with a happy ending definitely recommend this one! linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703]])

*The Sultan and Scheherazade are one* This is a Gellert Grindelwald fic with a lot of beautiful symbolism and references to WWI, WWII, Roman conquest of Illyria, Napoleon. I also really liked how young Gellert and Albus are depicted as youth inspired by socialism and reducing class inequality. This is part of eldritcher's brilliant Pandemic-verse which explores 20th/21st century pandemics and their butterfly effect on the wizarding world. Like everything from this author, it's definitely unusual and in a league of its own. I really like how each pandemic not only has personal consequence for the characters but also becomes a big turning point for the wizarding world in retrospect. Spanish Flu leads to Gellert's fate. Polio leads to Voldemort's insanity. HIV leads to gay discrimination in Ministry policy. Coronavirus leads to tearing down the Berlin Wall equivalent built after the Second Voldemort War. Just superb stuff. That said I am pretty stressed about how this ending for this fic is going to be. It really conveyed a sense of doom hanging over Gellert so far. Things are not looking good for him. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30478755]])

** I've been reading jharad17's guardian Snape fics, which I haven't read since probably 2011 based on when I downloaded the files from ffn. They were my first taste of guardian Snape and really set some of my preferences for it, but I've noticed upon rereading that they move a little fast for me (I prefer relationships to take longer to develop). It's unfortunate that they never wrote beyond first year for Better Be Slytherin. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1298924/jharad17]]

The author seemed a little obsessed with making a bunch of Weasleys gay which was a turn-off for me, and characterization of Molly was borderline bashing, but other than that, I loved it. Did a good job exploring grief and familial relationships. Highly recommend as a shorter complete read. (90k words, I often read 300k+ lol)

  George is already having a pretty shitty year. His twin brother died, he was too depressed to open up their shop on his own, he was having a serious nightmare problem, and his relationship with some of his living family members was becoming increasingly strained by the day. Needless to say, his dead brother's ghost that only he could see was so not what he needed this week. Or, the one where George Weasley struggles with object permanence for 90k words.

Paradigm Shift by cassiopeia721: Harry is resorted into Slytherin during 5th year, and starts practicing magic more seriously

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28392219]])

Visions of us by DeadandAlive: another Harry and Tom grow up together (Harry is sent back to the 1930s but doesn't really remember his past life). Fairly new but has a promising start.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30486165]])

Snakes keep their Secrets by SomebodySnicket: I‘ve been following this one for some time, and I've enjoyed the characterizations so far. Features a fem!Harry, mentor!Snape, inspired by Pureblood Pretense in the sense that Harry is believed to be a boy thus far.

  There is no Boy-Who-Lived; Albus Dumbledore defeated Voldemort and destroyed his Horcruxes. Harry grows up as an ordinary boy---a very ordinary boy, with barely more magic than a Squib. He sets out to prove himself, but in private, because he doesn't want to see the disappointment in everyone's eyes if he fails. And that leads him to a very strange relationship, mediated by stubbornness on both sides, with Severus Snape.

** This week, I read “Avenge” linkffn(13803457), rated T, as well as its sequel “Avenge 3: Kingdom of Darkness” linkffn(13850611), T. I skimmed the other sequel, “Avenge 2: Child of Winter”pettier linkffn(13847273), M, too.

It's a series that is a crossover of HP and the MCU. The first story is about what would happen if Severus survived the war and, somehow, ended up being a part of the Avengers' storyline.

I liked it. It doesn't jump right into the movie events, it builds up to it by having Severus meet Bruce Banner while they're both in Africa trying to help people. Severus is there, trying to atone for his sins during the war, figure out how to live for himself, etc. Bruce's reasons for being there are canon for the MCU and they just sort of fall in together. They become friends and Severus helps Bruce a little with trying to get a handle on the Hulk and that's when the events of the Avengers start to unfold.

Some stuff happens just like in the original Avengers, but other things go differently with Severus there helping. So it ends in a different, but still similar way to the movie.

I'm liking the sequel, Kingdom of Darkness, so far. Severus ends up in Asgard and it looks like he'll help Thor and Loki with the events in Dark World and that should be interesting.

I skimmed Child of Winter, but I'm not sure if I care for it as much. In it, it becomes pretty clear the HP universe is more AU than just Severus surviving the battle. Harry is a surgeon who also marries Hermione and has a brood of kids with her. This isn't that big of a deal for me, but I wasn't a fan of the fact Hermione becomes a sahm after she and Harry have twins.

That just doesn't feel like the sort of thing Hermione would do. As much as she'd love her children, I think she would also want and need a job where she's bringing help and justice to good causes, like the house-elves. Also, it's petty, because it's not very important to the story, but the names of Ron's son and daughter are weird in my opinion. They are named Diamond and Ruby. Even if some of the details aren't that great, the plot of the story itself seems pretty okay from what I skimmed.

** I've been reading Loose Cannon linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon]])

It's not at all the sort of fic I usually read- it's a post-war emotional journey kind of thing whereas I usually enjoy more plot driven stories but I'm really enjoying it. Shortly post-war Harry quits auror training in favor of joining the Chudley Cannons and starts becoming a lothario and political player. It's got a lot of the Lord Harry Potter Peverell Black Slytherin tropes, Harry is a badass mofo with ~powers~ tropes, but all skewed enough to make it unique. There's lots of OCs, all with very distinct interesting characters- his teammates on the Cannons, a string of girlfriends or one-night stands, old dudes on the Wizengamot, etc. Everything I usually loathe in a fic, but this one all comes together in a way that's making for a very compelling read for me.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** I'm re-reading Blinded by lies, It's a pureblood Hermione fic. The story is mainly the POV of Harry and Hermione, with some POV of snape and or Sirius. It's probably my favorite story because it's completely different than anything I have really read for HP fandom, mainly Harmony stories. I will say there is some extremely disturbing stuff that happens during years 1-3 but gets better as it goes. I personally think it's very well written though. Also Strong/Smart harry eventually and with Strong Hermione. I definitely know it's not everyone's type of story so I can see why some people might not like it. Definitely rated M for language, smut, and gore

** I've been trying to read Sympathetic Properties linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10914042/1/Sympathetic-Properties]]) again. I sort of get tried from the constant movement and side threads in it, but it's honestly a great fic. The world building is so rich, especially the goblin culture. It's really unique and detailed.

I also think that the Dumbledore in that fic is the golden standard for a true believer who genuinely thinks he's a good guy that ihas dedicated his life to helping the world, but is actually a total psychopath with way too much power. I've never been able to get that balance right like Mr Norell has.

It also has the type of story line I like where Harry actually has adults in his corner who are keen to do their jobs, and Harry is mostly overwhelmed and trying his best but also worried about things like girlfriends.

It's kind of exhausting for me to read (because I'm disabled and my brain gets tired) but the author decided to make it as filled with characters with their own story threads as possible and truly succeeded. Every thread is interesting to me. Hermione's family is great (though I really don't like how he writes autistic character, but you can't win everything), and the whole Harry is super rich and has lots of power thread is great because you have the bailiff and the fact that Charlus Potter gets more of a story than James, because the bailiff went to school with Harry's grandfather and didn't really know James all that well.

Anyway I hope to make it through to the end this time

  Harry Potter's tale as witnessed by a Slytherin student.Everyone knows about the story of the Boy Who Lived, about his early childhood, his times at school, about his many adventures, and his final triumph over You Know Who. Everyone knows that story.However, several hundred students attended Hogwarts during those years. Many of them went on to live quiet comfortable lives, while a few of them became famous in their own right. However, all of them have their own story to tell, just as interesting and just as important. This is one of them.

Or rather re-reading it. It is exceptionally well written and it draws you in as a reader. It is wonderful to see the progression of Harry's character and how much the impact of living with the dursley's has on him even once Sirius and him are reconnected and their relationship improves. Over all the author is very good, I almost prefer this to the original year 4.

I think 'I like it' fits into that.

So,

How does 'I like it' convey /useful/ information or encourage discussion?

If I knew OP extremely well and understood their taste in 'fic perfectly, 'I like it' might be something I could use, but even then, it doesn't have any space for a conversation. The whole point of this post is to talk about what you're reading!

Are you saying that

- [[http://null][Drarry Nonsense]] 7/10
- [[http://null][Snape eats a bullet]] 2/10
- [[http://null][Dumbledore goes shopping]] 5/10
- [[http://null][Harry Potter and the Lame Title]] 9/10

Is a worthwhile post?

******** Being condescending wasn't my intention. I'm sorry if I came off that way, or overly aggressive, at any point throughout this conversation.

That's a fair point. Only people who've read the fic could really get anything out of that.

Still, though. If you haven't read it, how do you take part in a discussion about it? Plus, 'Encourage'. These aren't really rules, more like guidelines on making life easy for people and not every fic you read has to leave an impression on you. It'd get boring very quickly if that were the case.

As a sidenote, for one glorious moment, I thought you'd actually found fics to link to. Can't have Young!Indy!Dumbledore going on an over-the-top shopping trip, I guess.

********* Sorry, I got kinda defensive there. I could have put that a lot better.

For me, at least, when I read something that makes me interested in a fic, I'll go read it and then come back to talk about it, preferably addressing whatever the OP said about the fic that hooked me.\\
I recognize that they aren't rules, honestly, if they were, I'd just report and move on. They are good guidelines, though and I really want people to do what they can within them. Not everything has to be interesting, yes, but even saying 'this fic was competent but cliché and had nothing really of note' is /something/ to work from.

(Sorry about the tease there, I wanted it to look like an actual post - and it was the first thing I thought of that didn't involve character drama or shipping fights. Now that you mention it, I'd probably read the heck out of that fic.\\

That's alright. I could have done with better phrasing myself, to start this conversation.

I still don't think it's fair to reply to every comment that doesn't fit the guidelines --- that could be taken as spam --- but I see your point. I guess there's a reason these are only changed weekly and not daily.

OK, somebody /has/ to have written this! Trying to search for Indy Dumbledore just gives me Indy Harry fics with Manipulative Dumbledore, but I really want to see it now. Maybe I'll make a prompt post?

I can see that. Honestly, I figured it was nicer to point out my issue than it would be to leave unexplained downvotes. I assume (most) people around here are acting in good faith and actually want to engage/contribute so just need a reminder.

Sure! Why not? Maybe we find a gem, maybe somebody writes something funny. :) I'd love to come back and put actual fics under those links.

*** I'm getting alarm bells because the first chapter indicates it's going to read like a standard Harry-goes-to-Gringotts story.\\
Does it follow the stations of canon?\\
Or, does it try to tell a story with the potential of a character with meta-knowledge?\\
I get the strong impression that it's going to be filled with idiotic Dumbledore bashing, would I be correct in this assessment?
