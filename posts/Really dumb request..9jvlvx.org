It's not a fic per se.

It's an Instagram post about a fic.

I think it's s Tumblr post in an Instagram photo about a crack fic Oh no not again by sarah1281.

It basically is an outline of the fic and details how funny it is and I'd what ultimately led me to read it.

I wanna recommend the fic to s friend and I think the best way is to show her that Instagram post, but I cannot for the life of me find it now.

It's been roaming around the hp insta accounts recently I think if anyone can help me find it.


** Oh I know what you mean one minute

Edit: found it
