Topic is fairly self explanatory. What's your favorite fanfic that gets a lot of hate? I hope to see some why's and who's and forasmuches :p

An aside, please don't downvoted anyone in this topic, and try to remain civil. This post was made with the understanding that the fanfics mentioned here might very well be unpopular if not outright problematic.

  Harry and Tom have been together since their fifth-year, proving once and for all that Slytherins and Gryffindors can actually get along. Fifteen years later, they are both professors at Hogwarts and more in love than ever. Harry plays Quidditch with the Weasleys on the weekends, and Tom is secretly a vigilante named Voldemort. This is the story of their friendship, their romance, and their family.

- Legitimately got my heart pounding at several points over the story

** I guess I'm going to test your "no downvotes" request: I enjoyed HPMoR.

The beginning of that fic was screamingly funny when he was doing his shopping in Diagon Alley, especially the scene in Madame Malkin's. It's one of my all-time favorite fanfic scenes. And when he points out that people are enamored of a "bad idea" of him really hits the nail on the head.

The scene where Harry berates McGonagall because the prefects were so afraid of her taking points that Hermione was killed by the troll was, I thought, a fairly accurate representation of her canon character. (One of the most unlikely things in canon, in my opinion, was when Harry lost his mind when one of the Carrows spit on McG. She was never there for him; what reason did he have to feel so protective of her?)

It's also one of the most complete explorations I've ever seen of the consequences of the "transfigurations are not permanent" trope.

Yes, the author's notes got preachy at times (especially the "final exam") but you know what? You can skip author's notes quite easily, and I often do.

Conversely most of Inverarity's characters are essentially good but he writes with such matter-of-factness in general. His neutrality and honesty towards characters is what I think turns people off. He doesn't make the same effort in writing to force you to root for his characters.

*** Came to this thread to comment this one. It's /soooo/ trope-y and /soooo/ edgy at times but it's just subversive and inventive enough to continue being interesting. It's portrayal of Harry and Tom fused as someone who accomplished good things with terrible methods really keeps straddling the line between hero and villain the entire story. It subverts the Manipulative!Dumbledore, but not before indulging it.

Then the last 200k words are just bizarre and go completely off the rails. There's magical AK-47s. Harry conquers the world. There immortal Dumbledore leading elderly Hermione in a raid. The Weasley twins are the architects of a utopia of sorts by building magical skyscrapers. There's space travel.

I love this fic; it fulfills the 'bad' requirement however.

** I feel obligated to mention "My Immortal".

This fic is . . . not good. The writing is terrible with no grammar and typo everywhere, more attention is given to what the MC is wearing rather than the plot (if you can call this train wreck a plot), and the author randomly put some AN in the middle of the chapters.

There is a theory that the whole fic is a parody, but I doubt anyone could push the joke so much as to maintain this level of mediocrity throughout the whole fic. It it so awfull that I would advice anyone against reading it, if only to save them the suffering.

But, luckily for all of us, some people made a "dramatic reading" of the fic on Youtube (even taking the trouble to illustrate it), and thanks to it, this train wreck become . . . beautiful. The fic is still terrible, but listening to someone reading aloud permit to focus on the whole crazyness of the situation and how hillarious this fic is.

French have a word, "Nanar" to describe a movie so bad that it becomes good. I wish an equivalent word existed for the books because no other fics would deserve it more than "My Immortal".

** Objectively A Black Comedy by Nonjon is neither "good" nor "bad".

For some they dont like the dark early 2000s comedy, which isn't for everyone.

But I'd prefer that then have an overly sensitive comedy that shoves "characters" to make it seem inclusive. In Fanfiction.

Wow.

I miss this type of comedy, and someone is gonna bash me for it.

The only bad thing about ABC is that Harry disregarding his family is unrealistic and a problem with most dimension travel fics.

Harry, a emotionally abused kid whose desire was to be with his family. And when he gets a chance at a family, featuring HIS PARENTS and some siblings it beciase they are not "his" family.

What the fuck does that even mean? If got transported to a AU you bet imma go to my family and treat them like my parents. Treat their children like my siblings.

I can see where you're coming from. The problem with trying to be “inclusive” is that all too often the demographics they're trying to represent end up being defined by their demographic and nothing else, being an amalgamation of all the stereotypes that are typically applied to them.

  We've all seen Harry Potter, friends and enemies read his past, but what happens when he gains the opportunity to read the adventures of entirely different Harry Potters. Completely original stories that can range from harem tales to X-overs to pairings that don't make sense. Reading stars including students, staff, death eaters and the Dursleys. Read, Review and prosper!
