Being in Slytherin, wrong BWL, just cause. Harry is treated like crap by his fellow students. Preferably this leads to a major AU, but I'm not picky

Slash, bashing, crossovers and dark!characters are fine. Please no genderbending, harems, smut/romance-centric plots, mpreg or pottercest. Thanks!


** Gotta recommend this: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11746890/1/Irisana]]) A fem!harry that sees magic and is all around a rather peculiar and quirky person (a la Luna more than Dumbledore, though they get around splendidly). I know you asked for no genderbend, but this is definitely worth a quick read, it's well done.

**** Yeah sure, the ending trying to shoe-horn a sequel that never came to fruition is extra-terrible, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. It's a really badly constructed story. Nothing in it really works.

I'd only read it for the first few chapters, because it's sort of the protoype for WBWL stories and has some neat ideas. It's all just downhill from there. I've re-read the story last year with a cool head because everyone kept saying that it's way worse than we remember.. and yeah... they're right. It's trash.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - This fic is still starting up, but has strong (though slow) worldbuilding. It's about non-BWL Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Just came out of hiatus.

Harry is currently heavily ostracized and often attacked, though that may change as the plot progress (it's still the first year, and the fic is supposed to reach beyond Hogwarts), especially considering that the plot arc revolving around a reason in escalation of Harry's unpopularity seems to be currently wrapping up.
