:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a story where Harry wrote in the Diary and was eventually convinced by Tom to take his place in the dairy for a while but was (obviously) deceived and the diary was sent to the MCU. I believe most of the action took place around the first Avengers film if that helps.

â€‹

I would really appreciate any help in finding this fic again.


** I think I remember that too! Wasn't it Harry/Bruce?

Edit: Is it Ink Stains ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9348546/1/Ink-Stains]])? I guess it's not Harry/Bruce because Harry was still a kid, but I had remembered Bruce being the one who read the diary and tried to get Harry out.
