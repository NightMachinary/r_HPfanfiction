** You might consider having a look at the fic recommendations at the bottom of the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPharmony/wiki/index][HPHarmony subreddit wiki page]]. They're divided up into length, and there are plenty of long ones. They're not all equally good, but you should be able to find at least a few you might like there.
