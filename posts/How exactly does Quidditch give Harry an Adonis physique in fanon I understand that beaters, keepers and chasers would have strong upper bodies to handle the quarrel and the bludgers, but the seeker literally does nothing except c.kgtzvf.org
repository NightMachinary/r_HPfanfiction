#+TITLE: How exactly does Quidditch give Harry an Adonis physique in fanon? I understand that beaters, keepers and chasers would have strong upper bodies to handle the quarrel and the bludgers, but the seeker literally does nothing except catch a tiny floating ball with little use of energy.

** I would assume it is the same as race car drivers. I mean, have you seen the Formula 1 drivers? They look like olympic swimmers with the neck muscles of weightlifters. They also only sit in their car and do nothing. But if a normal person that has not done it before and has not built the required muscles over time would experience those insane forces during a race, they would come out with a handful of broken bones, assuming with their lack of muscles they could even make it through the track fast enough to generate those forces, which is doubtful.

Not saying playing quidditch would give him a body like that, but to play quidditch on a high level it might be required to train into it. At least that was always my thinking when I read a fic where something like you mentioned comes up.

Just in case someone fails to understand this: Modern F1 drivers have quite a stringent physical exercise regime to be able to cope with the forces they experience in their cars.

**** Holy crap, TIL! I never would have expected that you'd need to develop muscles to drive a car. But what you say makes perfect sense. They need extra muscles not exactly to drive but to withstand the process.

*** Those brooms go at very high speeds. To stay on the broom they must use all of their muscles since they go so fast. Legs need to grip the broom, core needs to stay tight etc. Also, you have to remember that Oliver Wood was a maniac that put them through intense workout schedules every morning

** I used to ride a lot of off road vehicles, quads and dirt bikes. It was stranious even though you are sitting down a lot of the time. It was a full body workout and left you sore from your legs to your hands gripping the bars.

** If I had to guess, all those sloth-rolls(?) where he'd spin on the broom to avoid bludgers, the quick turns, and the need to hold the broom tight on those wronski feints, must have worked his core and forearms a lot. Add in his already skinny physique then it could be believable. More of a soccer player look, low bodyfat and v-cut abs.

Add in Wood being a fanatic who made everyone do calisthenics and drills whenever he could book the field and it could be possible.

BTW you spelled quaffles wrong

** In straight flight, he's getting the same upper body workout as a biker and the lower body workout of a rope climber. Add pull ups and crunches, which should be essential exercises in case you start to fall off. Then add all his stunt flying, barrel rolls and sloth grips and all else. And it's clear he's doing a lot more than sitting still.

** Avoiding bludgers, and other players while trying to see, catch up to and catch a tiny golden ball? Keep in mind that Harry does this every training session and match, so at least twice a week, and to avoid the bludgers alone he would be doing /loads/ of stunts like sloth grip rolls. All that work would probably even make one of my friends fit, which, no offence to him, is a lot of work.

** You would need a lot of core muscle for flying uside down, sideways, doing rolls and other acrobatic manoeuvres. That is even more true for chasers and keepers. I don't think they build that much muscle from the actual training, but like ice hockey, they need to build it to be able to go through the challenges the matches involve. So it's more preparation than anything else.

** It would build a certain amount of wiry strength, like yoga but without the stretching. I usually have him with a built-in need to be active; when stressed he walks of jogs around the lake to think, paces back and forth, etc. Sometimes I have him with a subconscious need to be outdoors because of the years he spent locked in a cupboard. Either way I think h'e best served with a wiry but nearly fatless build like a triathlete with comparable endurance. Endurance, speed, and skill are what he requires most, so I don't really see the need to give him some muscular build. Unless you're writing smut for bodybuilders, I guess. I mean, it's your story, give him whatever you wanna give him. My $o.o2.

** I believe it's with how much they're moving, while not running per say they has twist and turn constantly to move the broom, which most likely need strength. it's similar to surfing, by definition it's just riding on a wave, yet you need good body to become a good surfer. And I think the seekers has to do the same basic training as other teammates, which should also help their physics

** Oh, come on!" Hermione half-shouted. "You're, well, hot!"

Harry's eyebrow raised further. "... since when are scrawny, too-short guys considered 'hot'? Isn't height one of the most important things women see in a guy? And I think I'm supposed to be an 'Everyman' character, which are categorically defined as not being overly attractive."

Hermione, however, didn't appear to be listening. "Don't think all us girls didn't notice, Harry... all those quidditch practices... turning your body into a glistening, honed, drool-worthy slab of beef..." Hermione's sentence trailed off as she got a glazed look in her eyes.

"Hermione... Quidditch is a sport you play sitting down."

A fleck of drool emerged from Hermione's lip; it glistened from the light of the fireplace.

"I'm literally sitting on my ass the entire time. And... even then, I don't have to do a lot. I mean, at least the chasers are flying around while catching and throwing something, and the beaters are darting about and hitting things with their bats. I spend 99% percent of my time just lazily circling from up above the action and slowly swiveling my head. It's really not that physically intensive of a sport - if you can even call it a sport - and I'm in the least demanding position."

The sparkling fleck of drool began its slow graceful descent to the floor.

"I mean, it's like saying, 'Hey, you're part of the Ravenclaw Bowling Team? You must have a really impressive abs'...
