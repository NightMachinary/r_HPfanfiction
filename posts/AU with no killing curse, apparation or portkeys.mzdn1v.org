** Sounds interesting. Pretty nerfy though.

** Pretty interesting. So, floo grates in every room? The ministry would suddenly be a lot more powerful with their maintenence of the network. Brooms would be a lot more common. Can't see how the lack of a killing curse changes much. The Boy Who Lived would have to survive some other curse probably.

** This means Dumbledore (phoenix) and house elves are the only ones with magical teleportation . If Dumbledore the only person with access to magical teleportation (and can probably have the phoenix transport some of the more pure-hearted order members as well) and Voldemort had no killing curse I think the order would have destroyed them while they were still the Knights of Walpurgis. We are assuming everyone still doesn't care about house elf teleportation cause they didn't in canon even though they could teleport ANYWHERE though ALL magic.

** I wonder if unsupported flight like what Voldemort and Snape learned would be discovered earlier in this case. It kinda got normalized in the Order of the Phoenix film as the Order members were using it.
