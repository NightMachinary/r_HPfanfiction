  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.

  Harry gets his magical inheritance as a Necromancer on his 16th birthday, the first in centuries. Unsure of his future or even who to trust after the Light shuns him, Harry turns to the Dark, the only other side that can assist him in seeking his revenge. However, it's all just temporary. It's just an alliance until his goals are met and then that's it. Just temporary...right?Slight Dumbledore and some Order member bashing. Sane Voldemort but Horcruxes do exist. A Harry/Voldemort but won't be for a bit anyway since Harry isn't of age yet. Not really graphic in deaths at least not yet. If that changes the rating will change.

**** Ok didn't ask for your opinion but it's happening whether you like it or not we have our own reasons for shipping and you don't see me dissing anyone else's ship so could you keep it to yourself if you aren't going to at least be polite about it?

***** Every single necromancer, Master of Death, etc fic has this pairing. I'm so sick of it, because it /never works/. Voldemort doesn't have any fucking emotions. He's 60 years older than Harry. He's evil. In no concievable reality would this actually happen.

All I want is one of these which doesn't have this pairing, but nooooo, it's always that one.

** Its not finished (not even started, really) but there's a really involved necromancy scene with Lucius and Abraxas Malfoy that isn't just amateur torture porn and also justifies /why/ someone would fight death like that. In a weird way, the power of love kind of fits in here too in that Harry is a last resort for most people so its Lucius' love for his family that's driven him to seek out dark magic from sketchy sources. I stumbled across it the other day and I thought it was an interesting take on that branch of magic. I'm looking forward to seeing where the story goes and very much hoping that relationship tag doesn't become relevant for a /long/ time.

  Thanks to a ritual in his first life, he's been reincarnating for millennia. Every death has resulted in being born anew nine months later. He's always magical, always male, and always in possession of all his memories, but always in a different body and of a different family. This time, he has been born to a naive young couple with high ideals and little understanding but an enormous well of love for their son that he cannot fault. This time, he is called Harry Potter.This story is a Work In Progress. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
