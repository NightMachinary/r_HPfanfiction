*The [[https://riordan.fandom.com/wiki/Titan%27s_Curse][Titan's Curse]] is the burden of holding up the sky to prevent its weight from crashing down upon the earth. The curse can only be forced upon a Titan, though a pure-hearted hero can willingly take on the burden if they choose to, as can gods. -percy Jackson wiki

I want a fic where harry has to do something like this, either in a Percy Jackson crossover, or a separate fic.


** Potential Prompt: A young Harry transports himself, not to the roof of his school, but to the feet of Atlas, Bearer of Heaven and the Titan of Endurance. Alas seeing an opportunity, manipulates the child into taking the burden of the sky willingly. Harry's life is spared as magics older than creation rise taking the horcrux as sacrifice, protecting the boy for his fate battling the darkness. Years go by as Harry holds the sky, watching the world.

*** As long as they're not, you know, spewing rainbows stereotypically gay then it's fine

Edit: nevermind it's a harem fic

  James and Lily Potter had a secret, one which led to Thanatos saving young Harry from a dreary life with the Dursleys and changed the face of the Second British Wizarding War before it ever began.
