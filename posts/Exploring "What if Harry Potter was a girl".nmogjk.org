Hello, everyone!

I'll be uploading the final chapter + epilogue to my story, "[[https://www.wattpad.com/664331919-the-girl-who-lived-draco-malfoy-x-oc-the-chosen][The Girl Who Lived]]," in the next coming days and felt I was at a stage where I could finally share/promote it to you!

It all started as an experiment, I had the idea rolling in my mind one evening and had a giggle at the thought of 'Harper' Potter. Next thing I know, I'm dot-pointing the differences it would have made to the original story. She would be more like Lily Potter and excel in potions as she did, Snape wouldn't have reviled her as he did with Harry, we would spend more time with 'the girls' of Gryffindor and maybe the Golden Trio would have been Harper, Hermione and Ginny. The rivalry between she and Draco could take on a different nature and in my story I explore this with an enemies to lovers arc. The possibilities were endless and now I'm here, 70 chapters later.

Now, of course to re-write Harry Potter as a girl would have been a bit boring, we've heard this story before. So I play with the timeline; writing parts that are new and introducing flashbacks where needed. This means paying close attention to the dates/years at the start of a segment.

*Excerpt From Chapter 2:*

Year 6, 1996.

Harper, Hermione and Lavender walked wearily from breakfast to their first class of the year, Defense Against the Dark Arts. Now to be taught by Professor Snape. But that wasn't what had the trio down, they were feeling rather guilty for not taking Care of Magical Creatures with Hagrid this year.

“Do you think he will be upset?” Lavender asked. She didn't care a great deal for the half-giant, but the way he'd enthusiastically spoken to them earlier would have made even Pansy Parkinson feel remorse.

“He should understand, it's just simply not something we want to pursue,” Hermione thought out loud.

“That's just it,” Harper started as she fiddled with the tassel on her scarf anxiously. “He won't understand why we won't want to pursue it.”

“Let's cross that bridge when we get to it,” Lavender dismissed. “I have more important things to worry about right now. Like Snape teaching the Dark Arts.”

Harper was about to respond in Snape's defense, but something crashed into her side. It was two Ravenclaw first years, bright eyed and excited.

“Sorry!” They blurted in unison.

Harper laughed , “It's okay, just watch where you're going next time.”

They both blushed, one hiding their face behind a loose sleeve. “Actually, we were hoping to get a signature.”

“Signature?” She questioned and heard Lavender groan beside her.

Harper had always been well-known in the sense that people knew her name. The fame never idolised her, in fact it often worked against her, particularly last year when she was painted as a demented crazy person being told to check into a mental institute. Even when she was in the Triwizard Tournament she wasn't heavily celebrated, not compared to Fleur or Krum. This was the first time someone had ever wanted a signature from her.

“Yeah,” one beamed. “A signature from ‘the Chosen One.'”

Harper smiled but it wasn't completely genuine. Once again she was denied any type of normalcy. She didn't want this type of attention for what happened. She wasn't seeking glory. She just wanted a normal life and to go to school as a normal student. Nevertheless, she retained that faux smile and leaned down for the Ravenclaw's quill.

She drew a H.P. on ones arm and went to do the same on his friend when a sharp voice penetrated the air.

“What are you doing, Potter?” Malfoy asked as he stopped in his passing by.

Harper finished off the second signature with a lightning bolt before straightening up and looking over at Malfoy and his pair of goons. He'd grown over the summer, with broader shoulders and a form that towered over the first years. His white-ashen hair carefully parted to the side, not a strand out of place. Then his eyes, that's what Harper noticed the most about him. They glistened brightly, cold and metallic, rivalling the most polished suit of armor. She tore her own green irises away, afraid he'd catch her staring. No matter how devilish the wizard was inside, she would never deny that Draco Malfoy was handsome.

“What does it look like?” Hermione's own lecturing tone cut through. “She was giving the boys signatures.”

“Of course,” he huffed as his eyes raked over her. “Famous Harper Potter.”

She crossed her arms defensively, a slight frown bedecking her features. “Do you mind, Malfoy?” She asked.

Luckily for her an amused grin took over his face rather than that malicious sneer. “I do, in fact. See, I'm an even bigger fan. A signature won't suffice me.”

“And what will?” Harper perked a brow, choosing to take the bait.

“I think I would prefer a genuine Harper Potter souvenir,” he winked before reaching forward and pulling the Gryffindor scarf off her neck. Before she could even react, he was already slinging it over his shoulder and walking away, Crabbe and Goyle in tow.

She shook her head with a small smile at the mischievous one. “Don't start a war you can't win, Malfoy!” She called to the retreating figure.

Hermione made some sort of flustered gesture behind her. “Harper, why do you entertain him?”

“Is it just me, or did Malfoy get fitter over the summer?” Lavender added.

“Lavender!” Hermione scolded as the girls continued their venture to class. “Do you have no boundaries?”

The blue-eyed Gryffindor simply rolled her eyes while Harper blushed at her words. She was comforted to know she wasn't the only one who noticed.

“What?” Lavender retorted. “I know he's the same old git, but he's looking well fit.”

“Looks aside, he's vile,” Hermione said. “Right, Harper?”

Harper blinked, pulled out of her quickly roaming thoughts. “Yes,” she abruptly answered, “vile.”

Her scarf was still slung over Draco Malfoy's shoulder as she entered Defense Against the Dark Arts. He smirked at her and shook the end of it tauntingly. Harper didn't bite this time, instead exaggeratedly rolled her eyes and sat as far away from him as possible to appease Hermione.
