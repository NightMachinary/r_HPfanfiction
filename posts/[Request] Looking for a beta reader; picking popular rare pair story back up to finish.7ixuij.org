Hello there! I have need of a beta reader to help me rectify the worst of fanfiction sins--I started an epic story and then abandoned it for 8 years. It's fairly well known in its rare pairing (Sirius/Hermione), and is about half-written as it stands now, at just over 150,000 words. This is a time travel fix-it fic with a lot of depth to it, kind of a character study, humor, friendship story that has a chunk of time in the Marauder era and a chunk of time in the 'present-day' of the late 90's, including a version of the final battle (I say version because I started the story after Half-Blood Prince but before Deathly Hallows).

So my plan is to basically leave most of what's already written as-is, with a few tweaks (I want to up the rating from 'fade to black' when anything physical happens) to the story as a whole. The last 8 chapters before I had a baby and stopped writing need some revision as well. Mostly, though, I need a beta reader moving forward for typical beta things (I use the m-dash FAR too much, lol) and for accountability in finishing the story, though that shouldn't be hard; I'm super hyped up to be back into this favorite story of mine.

The story is posted all over the place, but was posted first on the workhorse fanfiction.net, where it actually /broke/ the number of reviews display--it shows as having 1,033 reviews there, but I know it has over 700,000, so I'm pretty sure it's over a million. That's a lot of hopes to have dashed, and I am determined to redeem myself! Right now I'm posting it on AO3 (but not in a big chunk; chapter by chapter): [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/12946575][Then Shall I Know on AO3]] but all 48 current chapters are here on ff.net (ignore all the fussy introduction stuff there, I hate that they have such truncated summaries): [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2872605/1/Then-Shall-I-Know][TSIK on ff.net]]

Thanks in advance! I know it's kind of a lot of baggage compared to a typical beta request, but I'm starting to despair of where the heck to find a beta that isn't a link to something someone posted 5+ years ago!

Edit: I am also happy to do one chapter here or there with you if someone wants to help but can't do a lot.


** Let me read what you've got so far, that is not one i've found in my marauder digging, and i will see if i can help? I write under love4lupinalways on ffn, if ypu want to take a look at what i've not yet finished...

*** That would be lovely, thank you! I can't vouch for bad formatting on fanfiction.net, but since I haven't posted it all to AO3, if you hate reading on ff.net, you can read it [[https://tsik-inscribed.livejournal.com/][here on the livejournal]]. Just check the sidebar for the tag for chapter 1.

Much appreciated, whether you choose to help or not!

** I'll check what you've got. I haven't read that pairing yet as it doesn't really interest me but I'll see how I do. If it is something I can handle then I'm interested in helping.
