Any good fics involving the goblins? I was looking specifically for fics about their reaction to the Trio breaking into Gringotts and humiliating them, as I don't think they would be all too happy to manage Harry's vaults after that, but any fic about the Goblins giving Wizards a bit of trouble will probably be great fun.

  COMPLETE. When Harry is called to Gringotts Bank to meet with the goblin Boneclaw regarding financial matters, things go unexpectedly. Harry is furious. Will Boneclaw come to regret his actions? Goblin bashing. AU after OotP. Oneshot.

** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16856581/chapters/39577636][Music Beneath the Mountains]] linkao3(16856581) pre-Hogwarts Harry is adopted by a goblin. Great look at goblin culture and magic.

​

In [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2141337?view_full_work=true][Gringott's Lesser-known Branch]] linkao3(2141337) Goblins protect their investments by adopting abused wizarding children, including Harry, Blaise, and Draco.

​

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6769957/1/Harry_amidst_the_Vaults_of_Stone][Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone]] linkffn(6769957) Goblins take custody of toddler Harry from Petunia after reading the Potters' will.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12001230?view_full_work=true][Impeaching Modesty]] An SI is reincarnated into a Potter-verse with soulmarks. Sirius is her soulmate which puts her at grave risk due to pureblood legislation so she hires the Goblins to negotiate her contract. (This is more difficult than it sounds.) This is a romance focused fic but the glimpse into Goblin culture is fascinating and the SI is an independent, fiesty and clever heroine.

** Honestly, the only realistic Goblin plot that follows the Trio's break-in at Gringotts and Voldemort's fall is a Goblin rebellion.

From their point of view, it is the perfect time - they have just cause for war, the wizards are completely disorganised and divided, and the hate for wizards amongst goblins would be at an all-time high after the Trio destroy Gringotts in their escape and Voldemort kills the goblins who bring him the news of the cup's theft.

*** True, but I was thinking at the very least they might create a lot of chaos by refusing to release any funds to Wizards and Witches, and disappearing everything that is in their vaults, which would make it harder to rebuild a country. And yet, I've never read any post-war fics that show the goblins reacting in any way, which doesn't match their temperament. In some fics, Hermione goes to work for the Magical Creatures department, but the focus is always on House-Elves, and there's no mention of how she would hardly be a person the Goblins would want to deal with. So I guess I would be happy with any fic that shows some kind of backlash.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.
