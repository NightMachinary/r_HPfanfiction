I've been searching all over but can't seem to find the type of second/next/post generation fic I have in mind, so I'm hoping you guys can help me! I recently read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9831689/][The Deadline]], a post-Hogwarts Dramione fic that had an incredibly well-crafted background of second gen characters, and not just the main Weasley/Potter clan but OCs of other families such as the Notts, Zabinis, Goyles, etc. I'm looking for something similar, with the OC children of smaller characters from canon. Or, if nothing like it really exists, then just fics revolving around the general second generation characters, in other words, no character- or pairing- specific ones. I guess I'm looking for fics that weave all/a bunch of the second gen characters together, almost like a sequel... so realistic fics, meaning no slash please! And good writing is a must! Unless the fic is highly recommended-- I've read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5724013/][The Magic Word is Sorry, Not Please]] and enjoyed it, despite the narrative and its occasional awkward, unrealistic spots.

Thanks so much! :)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] is a good story that focuses on Teddy Lupin and the children of some other characters.

** Well, I don't have anything that matches your request exactly, but little0birds post-hogwarts/next-gen verse is an excellent (and long) read, also Vekin87s Albus Potter series (contains good OCs, though not necessarily children of minor known characters)

** Ignite by Slide is an amazing next gen fic featuring a great Scorpious/Rose, and it has a sequel.

*** I second Ignite, it's really great. - be warned that you /will/ cry, though.

** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7460][This]] has a lot of scenes involving second generation canon characters. It's listed as H/Hr, but that's almost an afterthought as most of it focuses on their children.

  realistic fics, meaning no slash please!

I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you didn't mean to sound like a homophobic arse, because surprise! Gay people exist and are therefore perfectly realistic.

A request for no slash is fine, but I would greatly appreciate it if you could edit your post to cut out the "realistic fics" part.

**** To quote TVTropes:

#+begin_quote
  The most common definition has Slash as a Fan Fic that pairs two (or more) characters of the same sex. Often, "slash" is used for male/male pairings only, with "femslash" or "femmeslash" used for female/female pairings.
#+end_quote

Although I'd say in fanfiction it often means more than that.
