OK so, I read A Lot of "Dark" and "Evil" Harry stories - it's my favorite genre - but after you read so many then you notice one recurring theme, they all tend to Justify the Dark and their arts and/or painting them as Misunderstood.

What I'm after is a Truly dark and/or evil Harry who practices Dark Magic knowing that they are bad, and does truly evil things. A lot have an Evil Harry why walks the line, but isn't really evil, or he hides it. While realistically I understand this, part of the fun of these fics is the blatantly dark actions.

So what I want is a blatantly Dark/Evil Harry who Tortures, kills, maims and practices dark magic that really is bad. Pairings don't matter as long as it's not Hermione or Ginny. Slash is preferred, but Het is fine as long as it's not those two.

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.

** Hmm that's my kind of story, but as you said most Dark!Harry tend to justify, I'll try to sift through my list.

linkffn(A Nightmare Man) *Definitely what you're looking for. Dark, Insane, Truly Evil harry, no pairing, good writing. Complete.*\\
linkffn(Birth of A Nightmare Man) *(Prequel of A Nightmare Man, not finished yet (read A Nightmare Man beforehand))*\\
linkffn(On A Pale Horse) *(this one looks like it has been abandonned, which is sad, but still well worth the reading. VeryDark! Harry)*\\
linkffn(Paraselenic) ** (One of my favorite, not as dark as the three above, but Harry is definitely Dark! wit its fair amount of killing and maiming.)**\\
linkffn(Worthy of Magic) *(psychopath!Harry, good, but the writing is inconsistent and nearly put me off).*\\
linkffn(Xerosis) *(? Evil!Harry, but it's not that Dark, quite funny to be honest)*\\
linkffn(Again and *Again) (A bit like Xerosis, less humoristic, Darker. Also Time Travel)*

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** in circular reasoning harry uses tons of dark magic, tortures people, kills lots for instance he [[/spoiler][cuts the face off someone and wears it as a mask in just the first chapter, he also tortures children to make their father talk]] its insane/dark harry who still keeps his moral code (in that he only hurts "bad" people but he realizes that he himself might be a bad person, kinda like Geralt from the Witcher series)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning]]

in fury of the hellspawn Harry actually is truly evil; its PWP with harry/bella/narcissa, deatheaters come to privet drive; he brutally murders/tortures rodolphus pairs with bella and starts being evil. really highly rated on DLP, but abadoneded
