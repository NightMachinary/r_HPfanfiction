** I know it isn't actually about any of the main characters from Harry Potter, but this is about Draco working in St Mungo's as a drug rehabilitator and Harry has to go work with him. They work with other people and their experiences of drugs, also Draco's past use of a drugs a little bit. I know my summary won't do it justice.

It's an amazing read with an equally amazing sequel called Foundations. [[http://heckyeahdrarry.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/reparations-and-foundations.html][Reparations and Foundations]]

** The [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2529586/1/Broken-Mind-Fractured-Soul][Broken Mind, Fractured Soul]] series has Harry suffering a magical personality split due to severe childhood abuse. HPDM, Mentor!Snape and slash after a while, really long and very fantastical portrayal of dissasociative identity disorder, on the whole I think it's worth a read. There's like four stories in the series but the last one is just a one-shot.

** I just posted a Draco/Astoria, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=322009][Dreamscape]], where Draco is suffering from post-war nightmares and Astoria is his psychologist.

** Just discovered this subreddit, awesome! But maybe [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=127417&chapter=1&textsize=1][Saving Harry]] is something you're looking for? I haven't read that in a while, but it was definitely well written. I just can't recall off the top of my head if there were sessions like that, but I want to say there were.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2603288/1/The_Nietzsche_Classes][Try this out for size?]]

It's a Draco/Hermione.

edit - Oh God I just sounded out the word "Dramione" out-loud and it's awful I'm never using it again.

*** How did it sound to you? I say it like druh-mione. Drarry is fun to say, though my personal favorite to say is Drapple. It makes me want a Snapple Apple. LOLI feel there is a rap somewhere in that last sentence.

**** "dra-my-oh-nee"

I used to pronounce it "dra-moine" (like Des Moine, the city), but last night I drunkenly sounded it out correctly. I like my old way better though.

** No suggestions, but I did just want to voice that I love that you asked. I never thought to, but as a Psych student, I'm happily bookmarking the crap out of these stories and am excited for free time (AKA, after the holidays) to read them. Because honestly, Harry could use the psychological help. Dumbledore, Snape, Ginny, and Tom Riddle too. Heck, even everyone else after the Battle of the Hogwarts.

** [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=5][Broken]] is a Dramione where Hermione does attend some therapy. It's not a HUGE part of the story but it is a part of it.

** This is the first one that comes to mind [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5577953/1/Existence][Existence]] by children of the shadows, it's a HP slash fiction. Darker then the writers usual stuff by a long way. She has a lovely story called dating remus lupin which was the first ever slash story I read. It's really lovely.

I'll think about it for a while. I'm sure there's other ones.

I do think there's a very dark one with Hermione in it actually, eh called, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5603291/1/][hearts keeper]] it's very dark btw... not my fav fic for that reason.

dumbledore give sessions to one of the characters from [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/140916/Leila-B][Leila Bs]] stories. Despite the fact that all her stories involve OCs and English isn't her first language her whole again series is pretty good.

If I think of more i'll let you know :)
