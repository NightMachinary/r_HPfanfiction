I'm reading a great fic atm, and it's full of politics, revolution, and intrigue. I'm really into it.

But it feels like eating a small bit of sand each time the small population size is indirectly mentioned. Epic battles for the soul of the wizarding world seem ridiculous if the wizarding world only contains a thousand people. It's more like a small town meeting dispute at that point. Casualties on a "battle field"? You're taking huge chunks out of the population right there. Institutions like the Ministry of Magic, St. Mungos? Are they filled with 30 people each? Same thing with Hogwarts, with only a handful of students in each year.

I know the small population is canon, but JKR kept the size of the world beyond Hogwarts very vague so you could imagine it as you liked. I sometimes find it hard to care about big concepts in fics when authors keep the population so limited. Anyone else feel the same? Thoughts?


** Size of wizarding world a bit hard to guess. Mainly because JKR is terrible with numbers and we have many contradictions.

However I believe population size it is roughly about 10 000. Give or take few thousands.

** The problem with small populations is that they make it realistically impossible to have rich and subtle culture.

Lockhart the famous author is clearly modeled after muggle world famous authors. The sort of popularity and money he enjoys is impossible for population sizes in low thousands.

Several newspapers able to earn enough money to be profitable? Nope, more people is needed.

Thousands upon thousands of books in the libraries? Who wrote all those books?

There are many examples like that, and this problem is rarely mentioned in the fics. I seem to remember one which postulated that wizarding politics is more akin to politics in a small town, but most fics tend to ignore the issue, or exacerbate it by making politics and cultural life actually richer and more nuances than in the canon.

*** At least when it comes to the books, I feel like a lot of those books are very old. I mean, Harry is using a 50 year old textbook for Potions with no problem.

For the rest of it: I grew up on an island province with a population of around ~140,000 and use this as a model when I'm thinking about the wizarding world. There are definitely some famous names, but they're somewhat accessible (like Lockhart at Flourish and Blotts). Lots of family names that pop up a lot, lots of newspapers and publications flourish because a small population has a real vested interest in itself.

**** That is a fair point. In the Wizarding World, not only did they likely not experience the dark ages, but also their books wouldn't particularly become obsolete. Some would, but for the most part, wizards would have access to all the books written going a thousand years back, with a mostly literate society which is effectively post-scarcity. It makes a lot of sense that all they do as a society is research and mess with magic.

**** The population of the whole UK is 64 Million, I imagine the wizard population pre-wars was 1% of the muggle population. So 640,000

take 50% casualties and leave you with 320,000 of which most are over 60 years old and no longer having children. The younger were involved in the war or left the continent, especially the muggle born.

So maybe 500,000 left by the time Harry starts at Hogwarts, and the birth rate has only just begun recovering from the last war so very small classes at Hogwarts.

Really... Magic is pretty low chance for muggleborn students, probably less than half a percent and yet it seems that at least quarter of the new classes at Hogwarts are Muggleborn.

250k Magic users seems about right, anything less is just...disappointing. Easy to seem like such a small population though with only one fully magical village in the UK (Hogsmeade) and Harry being so swaddled and kept away from the magic world but it just HAS to be bigger than 1000 people...

***** I think those numbers are good 500,000 seems like a larger number than most people give it.

This is an aside, but I would argue that the numbers lost in the first couple of wars isn't a sheer numbers issue, but a percentage issue. Because a lot of people compare Grindelwald and Voldemort to Hitler, they're probably thinking numbers in the millions that have now downsized to what Harry has. But if you think of it more like, there were 600,000 wizards in Britain, only like 500 family names, and even 10 whole families were wiped out, that would seem significant. I'm not sure if I'm articulating the thought very well.

** If you can get past endlessly nitpicking the fact that the economy is extremely unrealistic, I tend to enjoy the small population idea. One of the fundamentally unique and interesting parts of the whole magical world is that this small group of people have their own separate society functioning within the muggle world. A small population means that important and influential people, groups, and events are much more accessible to the average person. The whole "seven degrees of separation" thing becomes more like two or three at most. Characters become less expendable and unlike the muggle world, you're not just a faceless number among millions, but have the chance to realistically contribute to society in a meaningful way.

** I much prefer a small wizarding population (e.g. under 15,000 in Britain). This is ultimately about a) maintaining the importance of individual powerful wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort and b) avoiding large scale magical battles. I think it is hard to maintain the fact that individual wizards are capable of turning the tide in a war, and the subterfuge/guerrilla/small skirmish style of wizarding combat, in the face of a large population. I also prefer the idea that wizarding society is less state-focused than the Muggle world, with international borders and nation-state governments meaning less. I prefer to think of the dynamic of the wizarding world as like a global conspiracy, Illuminati style, in which all wizards are complicit. The "other" are the Muggles, not wizards of different nationalities.

Accordingly I tend to think of Quidditch teams, for example, as far less commercial than Muggle professional sports teams. I picture many players having regular jobs in addition to being on Quidditch teams, and the general tone of the domestic Quidditch league as being similar to an amateur league in the Muggle world.

Similarly I prefer characterisations of the wizarding economy as much less sophisticated than the Muggle one. For example, no stock markets or developed financial services. Very little mass production, with most shops selling what Muggles would call "artisan" goods - each one slightly different, with one-of-a-kind items being commonplace.

Ultimately I don't feel like a small size belittles the wizarding world at all. I feel like it's a very Muggle way of thinking to equate scale with significance or power. But when a single wizard could probably take over the entire Muggle world (unless other wizards restrained them), the wizarding community does not need scale to be significant.

I know JKR's math, interviews, and so on are inconsistent, but how does your number jive with the number of students at Hogwarts? In an interview, she said there are about a thousand students. But it sometimes reads as if there are only a few hundred. I guess I'm wondering how many students you think there are at Hogwarts and if that makes sense population-wise

**** I generally go with a relatively small number of students at Hogwarts. The maths is something like this:

Average wizarding life expectancy (estimate): 150 years

Size of average Hogwarts year: ~60 students

(This is a compromise number. I completely ignore the interview number as my metacanon places book canon far far above interview canon, so I take the books as priority. From what we see, there appears to be around 40 students per year. But in PoA there's stated to be 200 Slytherins in the crowd at a Quidditch match, making an annual year group be around 114 students. I feel like ~60 is the closest you can get to the 114 figure without being too unreasonable in terms of compatibility with the tone of Hogwarts as seen in the books. Certainly it seems reasonable to me to posit that there were students with whom Harry never interacted or even noticed. Just think about how Cormac comes out of nowhere in HBP, but has apparently been there the whole time.)

On that basis:

Total Hogwarts student + alumni population: ~ 9000

That brings us pretty close to the figure of 10,000-15,000 I prefer. I feel like you can make up the difference with those who fall through the gaps of the wizarding world like non-Hogwarts British students, migrants, plus non-wizard magical "humans" like werewolves, vampires, hags, etc.

I think you could easily go through the books and find details that point to either end of the spectrum In terms of population size. It just goes to show that population count wasn't really high on Rowlings priority list when creating her narrative.

Personally, my headcanon is wizarding population is about 1% of muggle population worldwide, but honestly its not something i care too much about as long as the story is coherent.

Hogwarts's population fluctuates in my headcanon due to deaths and people leaving the uk. So while the year or two of harry's year and before and after (five years) are artifically depressed due to pure- and halfbloods fleeing a war zone and the deaths of whole families, leading to a larger glut of muggleborns compared to usual, as the celebration children begin to arrive---(people would likely stop worrying about bringing children into the world), many likely having late summer, early fall births making those be three years behind harry---we would see the hogwarts population rebound and as those who fled begin to come back---unless they're happier on the continent or the states or wherever they fled---we would see 'transfer' students, likely beginning harry's third year and on.

** I'm so glad you brought up this discussion, as it's a topic that's been bothering me for ages. I believe JKR said that the wizarding population of the UK is around 3000 people, which makes these epic battles that everyone writes about very hard to imagine. From the books it seemed like Voldemort had at most 2 dozen named Death Eaters by DH, in addition to the various magical creatures he recruited. How could that few people cause so much chaos? When I read about battles in ff my brain is caught between the image of these grandiose visions of destruction vs. the "reality" that would be more like the throwdown in the Department of Mysteries, i.e., less then 10 people on each side. I always find the dissonance very distracting.

Intuitively I feel like 10,000-15,000 in UK feels right, but then I can't reconcile the small number of Death Eaters' outsize influence so that by Harry's time there was the feasibility of anything less than complete asymmetric war.

** The population numbers is probably just one of those things that Rowling didn't plan for when she was writing a children's book. It just doesn't make any sense.

you can make a wild guess at the total population based on our numbers, if you accept a few assumptions:

-every kid (or most kids on the Uk) go to Hogwarts. -wizards have the same reproduction rate as muggles

now, assume that in average there are 10 students per house per year. or 70 students/house, or 280 total students. Hell, 300 for a nice round number.

The total population between the ages of 11 and 17 is, more or less, between 10 and 12% of the total population (in the uk, according to Wikipedia) so lets use 11%.

if 300 students represent 11% of the population, that menas there's less than 3000 total wizards in the Uk.

3000 build an entire system with banks, stores, sports team, etc etc etc.

And the thing is even worst.

Hogwarts is like 1000 years old right?

There are 2 options here:

1- they build a bigger castle than necessary for only a few students, so they would have spare room when more wanted to join.

2- they build a castle for what they believed they would need: around 300 students a year.

If the first thing is true, then the population of wizards in the uk was like 2 people. Because in the year 1086, the total population of the uk was 1,710,000. (and then they barely reproduce for the next millennia)

If the second case is true: then wtf happened to the population for the next 1000 years? how in the hell stayed the same? there's a super magical chickenpox killing entire generations of wizards?

you can go on and on with this. The point is: don't think about it and hope the person writing the fanfiction just add more people.

p.s.: English is not my first language, sorry if I wrote anything wrong.

10th century castles looked like this: [[http://www.primaryhomeworkhelp.co.uk/castles/images/april/ten.gif]]

The Hogwarts we see in the films displays MUCH later construction styles and fashions. Wizards may have been able to build beyond muggle technological limits back then but they would not do so by using designs derived directly from construction techniques invented later favoured by muggles when they became possible.

So I go with Option 3 - What we see of Hogwarts is not the original construction but a result of later expansion and re-development.

Why did they expand and build much larger than needed for the small number of students? Prestige! Showing off wealth and magical prowess.

It's a good commentary on countries, and even on the world in general, I think.

There's also the fact that JKR is British and is naturally used to playing with smaller numbers than, say, US readers might be used to. There are still villages and towns in the UK with similar adult populations, a couple thousand people, say, which in the US might be the size of the number of students of a high school.

For example, Hogwarts' approx. 400-500 students is not at all atypical of the number of students a British high school would have in reality.

** Working around a small population is a pain when trying to write about the wizarding world. Especially considering the fact that it encompasses its own ecosystem complete with entire species that have near-human and even human level intelligence.

It's really frustrating when you consider that you basically have nothing but the canon locations to go off as well. I mean, just how do you equate a population that barely breaches five figures (10,000 or so) with a Ministry of Magic that large? Or the fact that Hogwarts is fucking huge for a student population that small? We're talking around 300 students (~10 per house, per year = (10/7)/4= 280) located in a scottish castle purportedly large enough to garrison about five times that number as a low estimate (going off the movie sizes)?

I love writing about a much bigger and more flexible wizarding world existing outside of London (thriving little subcultures in Wales, Birmingham, etc) that stay outside of the MOM's reach through various means and do their own thing independent of the goings-on centered around London and Hogwarts.

The canon 'tiny population' thing is the first thing I throw out of a window when writing HP fics. It just doesn't really fit, especially with how easy it would be to cause a population explosion in the wizarding world by using the muggle one (science + magic = artificial reproduction. Not that other option you were thinking about...).

Hell, considering that magical creatures imply an entire biosphere of more intelligent creatures that go with it, the picture gets bigger anyway.

Population numbers are a pain when doing canon compliance. I just give up and ignore it in the end.
