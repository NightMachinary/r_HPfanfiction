Basically the title. So happy right now! Although now I have a question - how do you indicate a title for a fic? I opted for quotation marks, since it's more like an article, but should it be italicized?


** I had not seen this story previously. Thank you for bringing it up. Looking forward to continuation.

  Voldemort had not only sent his Death Eaters to the Ministry, but vampires as well. Hermione and Harry fall to them and find themselves in new, undead lives. While Harry struggles to remain human, Hermione becomes what was believed dead long ago. She becomes a Countess, an heir to Dracula. Unfortunatly, there are no books on that. Vampire!Hermione/Harry, Dark!Hermione Dark!Harry

We have this thing called Google now. It's really quick and easy to use. You should try it sometime.

**** Haha. Better an asshole than an idiot. It took me 10 seconds to find an answer to a question you posted to a forum where the first response, mine, was 20 hours later.

***** Did it ever occur to you that you didn't actually answer my question? That I wasn't sure if you treat fanfiction like articles or titles when it comes to proper punctuation?
