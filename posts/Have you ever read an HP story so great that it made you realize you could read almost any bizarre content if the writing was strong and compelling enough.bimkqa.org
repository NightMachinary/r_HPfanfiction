** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11907443/1/Full-Circle][Full Circle]] linkffn(11907443). I always skipped all fanfiction with >18 age gap, especially if it's DE/anyone. That's why I haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/][Again and Again]] even if it's recommended quite often. HP/LV soulbond is quite common, even if it has reincarnation/time loop/time travel or something similar; and I hate it because most of it is full with angsty Harry /'he killed my parents and make my live hell; but he's so fucking hot'/ or that the issue is never addressed at all.

However, I read Full Circle in one sitting. There's no angst, bashing, or DE whitewashing. Harry and Tom started to like each other only after their ~20th (I think) live. There's no angsty time travel vibe 'I will get revenge on the light side because they manipulate me' at all. It's also not too cracky either. They mainly just fuck around with Dumbledore while having fun.

The best part is how the author sometimes create an omake from their previous live. Don't forget about live #77 with David Steel, the Boy-Marked-With-Victory, vanquisher of the Dark Lord Thanatos and his arch enemy, Altair Burke, pureblood heir to the Burke family.

The main plot is a bit underwhelming, but I'll let it pass only because I want the author to create other omakes.

** linkffn(Harveste by kyaru-chan) and all its sequels though the last one is unfinished

It's a crossover with the Addams Family. Unlike other crossovers where Harry ends up falling in love with Wednesday, this deals more with the chaotic, dark and macabre side of the Addams which even the Dark families of the Potter universe found too disturbing. In spite of that the Addamses really do love Harry. Having grown up in a loving environment, this Harry is willing to open himself up and have friends whom he fiercely loves and protects. So even if Harry is Dark and powerful, he is not alone and "edge-lordy." A lot of iffy dark rituals are mentioned which I normally don't like but because the writing was compelling, I forgave those.

*** is that the one where he's a cross-dresser? i stopped reading it at that point, not something i'm at all into. largely gave up on finding decent crossovers of it, to be honest. the only two that come to mind are Family Values by Ishtar, and the Shadow Council series by Tenhawk, which is also a cross with Buffy the Vampire Slayer and is Xander-Centered, with Harry more as a side character.

â€‹

and i just discovered that Tenhawk's website is down, so unless you're like me and have most of his work in Calibre (though i'd have to go digging around for it), you're not likely to be able to read most of it. looks like part of it is still up on FanficAuthors, though. no idea why his site is down (and has been for awhile, apparently), but if i had to guess i'd have to say it has something to do with his original works he sells on amazon. which, frankly, aren't as good as his fanfics, from what i've read (the On Silver Wings series).

Both of them showed me there's a fine line the author has to walk to keep readers horrified but make them keep coming back. I couldn't put either set down. They are NOT for the faint of heart, and if you get halfway through and have to stop for a few days, hey, that's all right.

** Linkffn(Godling ascending) A demigod fem Harry Potter. I expected it to be a lot like most HP Percy Jackson crossover but it really surprised me. Instead of an overly powerful demigod or Hogwarts then going to camp Halfblood in summer, this fic sets a different tone for me. No need for Percy Jackson background, it can stand alone.

It's the only HP crossover to Percy that I truly liked.

Linkffn( A Promise From Her Boy By PsychoCellist) Hedwig is a female animagus. It gave hedwig very friendly if not Motherly feel to it. The tragedy of her not being able to use magic anymore other than taking the form of an owl and the friendship she had with Harry is priceless.
