So why exactly is Harry getting detention for this? Draco tried to use an unforgivable on Harry (and at this point has already used at least one on another human) and Harry was simply faster with his spell. It was a clear case of self defense, Harry knows about Dumbledore's pensive and Veritaserum and Draco is obviously a Death Eater (both Dumbledore and Snape know). So I'm wondering why is Harry being the bad guy here? He used an unknown curse, so what? The other guy could have tortured him into insanity, violating the magical Geneva convention (ban on unforgivables) in the process. Lethal force was a perfectly rational response to this. Even if Dumbledore believes that Draco can be redeemed, why punish Harry?


** Harry was acting in self-defense but he was fighting on campus and he used a pretty dangerous curse that could have killed Draco if they weren't found by Snape. I imagine from a school administrator perspective, it would send an inappropriate message to the other students if Harry went completely unpunished.

**** Harry didn't intend to hurt Qurriell. Quirrell was burned as a result of harming Harry. I would have to reread that passage but I don't think Harry did anything to get that outcome.

In any case, I know the books can't directly translate into the real world but I can't imagine two schoolmates throwing spells at each other and then not getting in trouble regardless of who started it. If I'm not mistaken, Harry follows Draco into the bathroom (right?) rather than gets an authority figure to address a situation he is concerned about. I get it, most authority figures aren't exactly trustworthy in canon so maybe that's a moot point.

Now, said student might have been forgiven this; he was acting in self-defence and admittedly had not known the curse was potentially lethal. But if the student then goes off, not ten minutes later, and curses a teacher in the BACK, just because the teacher told him he was getting detention, the "self-defense" argument doesn't hold up. That was a planned action and definite malice. The student had cursed two people in less than half an hour, and in the last case it was because the teacher didn't want to let him off a detention.

And the detention is just that: A detention. A student has done something wrong, hence he gets detention. No amount of self-righteous "but he is helping Voldemort by giving me detention" is going to let the student off. He tried to kill two people -- one by accident, one on purpose -- he should man up and accept the punishments instead of whining about how he's a soldier in a war.

  Madam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot, then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it wouldn't. She bent toward Malfoy, who was still glaring at Harry.

  “I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, dear, let me just...”

  “Ouch!” bellowed Malfoy, slapping her hand away. “Watch where you're putting your pins, woman! Mother, I don't think I want these anymore.”

  He pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at Madam Malkin's feet.

  “You're right, Draco,” said Narcissa, with a contemptuous glance at Hermione, “now I know the kind of scum that shops here... We'll do better at Twilfitt and Tatting's."

  And with that, the pair of them strode out of the shop, Malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could into Ron on the way out.
#+end_quote

I suppose that COULD be interpreted as Madam Malkin touching a sore Dark Mark, but I don't really see it. He complains about her not watching her pins earlier, so I just read that scene as-is: She was being worked up by the bad vibes in the room and getting careless. This, combined with the confrontation between Harry and Draco, caused the Malfoys to retreat. And pretend they were doing so with honour.

So if you blurt the spell as fast as possible but you don't form it correctly, the spell fails.

  ITT: No one knows what “unforgivable” means and everyone forgets that Harry had no idea what the spell did other than “for enemies” in a book that had been nothing but helpful to him.
#+end_quote

To be fair, given Harry's use of the Cruciatus Curse in OotP and his later two attempts at using it at the end of HBP, I don't think he knew what "unforgivable" meant either.

If Harry truly wanted to just defend himself, he could have used Stupefy instead of Sectumsempra. Its easier to say and its a spell he actually knew what it did. The fact that Harry used Sectumsempra without knowing what it did is arguably darker than using it while knowing what it does, since it show Harry's carelessness with magic.

It doesn't help that a spell that says "for enemies" should be a clear indicator that the spell is either a curse or just any dangerous spell. It doesn't take a skilled wizard to realise that a spell that is marked as being specifically for enemies implies its so dangerous and dark that it would never be used on a friend. Spells like Stupefy and Expelliarmus aren't "for enemies", they are just spells. "Dark" magic would be for enemies; "regular" magic can be used on anyone.

Despite Harry getting an Outstanding in his DADA O.W.L, he was apparently dumb enough to think that a spell that was specifically listed as "for enemies" would be a normal spell. It would be like trying to light a cigarette by using a flamethrower instead of a lighter. Is it really too much of me to expect Harry, someone with an Outstanding in his DADA O.W.L, to have a basic understanding of jinxes, hexes and curses?

My basic expectation was that Harry should have considered that Sectumsempra was some type or curse based on it being the only spell that was deemed "for enemies" in the Potions' book. At the very least, he could have inferred it was a darker spell than the rest of the spells that Snape wrote in that book.

To me, Harry lost the moral high ground once he decided to use a spell without knowing what it did, while also knowing that the spell was dangerous enough to only be used for enemies. If all Harry wanted was to defend himself, he would have been better using Stupefy or Expelliarmus. At least he knows what /those/ spells actually do.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

On the contrary, since what JKR glossed over entirely is that the burden of proof would be on Harry. The reason that Harry didn't tell McGonagall or Snape that Draco was trying to use the Cruciatus Curse is because *Harry was literally unable to give any evidence to prove that Draco was intending on using the Cruciatus Curse.* If he can't undeniably prove to either Snape or McGonagall that Draco was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, then he would have no real claim to self-defence.

We know Draco use trying to use the Cruciatus Curse, but neither Snape nor McGonagall didn't know. What most people forget is that even though Draco was trying to cast Crucio, he never /actually/ cast the spell; he was hit by Sectumsempra before he could even cast Crucio. Meaning even if Snape or another professor checked the last spell that Draco's wand used, it wouldn't show the Cruciatus Curse at all. It would just show one of the lesser jinxes or hexes that Draco was using before he tried to use Crucio.

From a logical perspective, Snape was right to punish Harry for attacking Draco with Sectumsempra:

- He doesn't know that Draco attempted the Cruciatus Curse.

- Harry is unable to prove that Draco attempted it.

- The first thing he sees is Draco covered in blood and Harry standing unharmed.

- CoS and HBP demonstrate how viewed memories aren't always entirely truthful.

- Veritaserum is canonically a worthless potion for confiming the truth since the one affected speaks only what they believe the truth to be, not what the truth actually is.

- Legilimency is just as unreliable than the Pensieve, if not more so.

*I must emphasize that I am NOT defending Draco here, I'm just pointing that logically speaking, Harry stood no chance of proving he acted in self-defense, let alone proving that Draco attempted the Cruciatus Curse.* The only thing that Snape or McGonagall would know is that Draco was covered in a pool of his own blood while Harry was completely unharmed. In the worst case scenario, it might look like Harry used dark magic to attack Draco unprovoked. In the best case scenario, it would suggest that Harry and Draco actually dueled but wouldn't be able to tell who started it. Harry screwed himself over by using Sectumsempra since he couldn't prove he acted in self-defense, couldn't prove Draco attempted an Unforgivable Curse, and couldn't justify why Draco was covered in a pool of blood while Harry himself was completely unharmed.

At least if he had used Stupefy or Expelliarmus against Draco, his detention wouldn't be nearly as severe given that he wouldn't have used dark magic nor would he have split blood. Its not like SWM where the whole school saw the Marauders attack Snape first until Snape retaliated with Sectumsempra (or Diffindo, given how weak it was); there were no witnesses to prove that Draco attacked Harry first either.

*TL;DR: Harry was an idiot for using Sectumsempra. He was even dumber for not realising the implications of how dark a spell must be if its specifically noted "for enemies". Thinking he could justify Sectumsempra, let alone think he wouldn't get punished, was even dumber since Harry was unharmed by Draco. Because Harry couldn't prove that Draco attempted the Cruciatus Curse, it meant Harry couldn't prove he acted in self-defense and was unable to justify his use of Sectumsempra to someone like McGonagall. If anything, Harry is lucky to not be expelled by McGonagall/Dumbledore since I believe any other student who did what Harry did would have been expelled.*

#+begin_quote
  Not being able to provide evidence of the Cruciatus Curse.
#+end_quote

I mean, Harry and Dumbledore both are aware of what a modified memory looks like in a Pensieve and, headcanon aside, there's never any canonical examples of people being able to protect themselves from Veritaserum. So... What?

#+begin_quote
  If anything, Harry is lucky to not be expelled by McGonagall/Dumbledore since I believe any other student who did what Harry did would have been expelled.
#+end_quote

What? /What?/ Even if Harry had straight up /meant/ to Kill Draco, it was in defense of a /torture curse/. An /unforgivable/. You're suggesting that Harry would have been expelled for defending himself is insanity.

Maybe the movies are biasing your memory, but in the books Harry NEVER attacked Malfoy with anything dangerous UNTIL that point.

#+begin_quote
  And Harry realised, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot, that Malfoy was crying -- actually crying -- tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into the cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder.

  Malfoy wheeled round, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own. Malfoy's hex missed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways, thought Levicorpus! and flicked his wand, but Malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another --

  ‘No! No! Stop it!' squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room. ‘Stop! STOP!'

  There was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded; Harry attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that backfired off the wall behind Malfoy's ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle, who screamed loudly; water poured everywhere and Harry slipped over as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, ‘Cruci---'

  ‘SECTUMSEMPRA!' bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand wildly.
#+end_quote

Draco was the first to raise his wand. Draco was the first to cast a spell.

ALL of Harry's spells were to incapacitate: Levicorpus, Leg-Locker.

Draco's missed spells were shattering and BLOWING THINGS UP (Harry broke a cistern with the leg-locker).

FINALLY Draco casts an Unforgivable, at which point Harry responds with a spell that ends up being lethal.

At no point did Harry attempt to start the fight. At no point prior to the Unforgivable did Harry attempt to do anything other than incapacitate a hostile entity.

And he can use his /memory/veritaserum/ to prove it.

#+begin_quote
  From a logical perspective, Snape was right to punish Harry for attacking Draco with Sectumsempra.
#+end_quote

What? Absolutely not. From a /logical/ perspective, his first action should have been to take care of his student and then /figure out what the hell happened/. Why would you /ever/ not get both sides of the story? Even if you argue that Snape didn't have a reason to believe him (which is bullshit), it's simply /irresponsible and illogical/ to NOT get both sides of the story.

#+begin_quote
  CoS and HBP demonstrate how viewed memories aren't always entirely truthful.
#+end_quote

CoS were entirely different from a Pensieve. In HBP, a viewed memory is demonstrably false.

#+begin_quote
  Veritaserum is canonically a worthless potion for confiming the truth since the one affected speaks only what they believe the truth to be, not what the truth actually is.
#+end_quote

This is extrapolation from canon, not canon. I don't recall anyone ever saying that Veritaserum was useless.

#+begin_quote
  If he can't undeniably prove to either Snape or McGonagall that Draco was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, then he would have no real claim to self-defense.
#+end_quote

If someone attacks me in public and I break their hand, the burden of proof is not on me to prove that I did it in self-defense simply because /he's/ the one who's injured. We would /both/ be obliged to make our case.

In this case, Harry's burden of proof would be that a lethal spell was /appropriate/, not that he was acting in self-defense.

There is a significant difference.

#+begin_quote
  If Harry truly wanted to just defend himself, he could have used Stupefy instead of Sectumsempra.
#+end_quote

Before he used Sectumsempra, he was using mild spells. Levicorupus and a Leg-locker. They either blocked or missed. In the heat of the moment, about to be struck down by a spell that's known to turn people into vegetables, he used a spell that he could reasonably assume was dangerous, and nothing more.

Another worthy thing to note: Harry was /incapacitated/ when Draco threw the Unforgivable at him.

#+begin_quote
  To be fair, given Harry's use of the Cruciatus Curse in OotP and his later two attempts at using it at the end of HBP, I don't think he knew what "unforgivable" meant either.
#+end_quote

This is entirely irrelevant, isn't it? He didn't in /this case/, which is what we're talking about.

*TL;DR: Harry walked into a public place, was instantly attacked, cast only spells meant to incapacitate (leg-locker, levicorpus) until he /fell to the ground/ and Malfoy, standing over him, cast an Unforgivable spell on him known to turn people into vegetables.*

Since Draco didn't actually cast the spell, in court he would easily be able to argue that there is some prank spell that starts with the letters Cru. Maybe its some sort of make you think your a lobster spell called Crustacean.

Dumbledore would protect Harry simply by exposing Draco as a Death Eater. His Dark Mark was more than enough proof.

Later, there would be no Death Eater incursion at the end of year. Dumbledore could then arrange Snape to kill him at a moment of his own choice. He should be able to give Harry more instructions and even the Sword.

In Year 7, Draco was highly likely the Head Boy given he successfully assisted Dumbledore's murder. He should be the ranking Death Eater among the student body. But we know he was very passive by this time already, and having him leading the Inquisitorial Squad actually benefitted the DA.

Still, /Draco/ was the one that instigated that fight, so he definitely should have been punished for that at the very least. If punishments for school fights were determined by who got the most injured, then way more kids would instigate fights with their hated enemies, take a few punches and watch gleefully as they get suspended.

Harry was completely irresponsible to use a curse when he had no idea what it did, when stupefy or expelliarmus could have sufficed (he does get accused of using expelliarmus too much in DH after all), and I don't think it was entirely wrong for him to be punished for that.
