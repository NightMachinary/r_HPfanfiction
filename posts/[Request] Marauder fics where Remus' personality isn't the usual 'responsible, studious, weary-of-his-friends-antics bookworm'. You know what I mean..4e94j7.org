** This one is a stretch: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]]. It's the first two years at school. Lupin is not as studious or bookworm-y as other stories, but he's portrayed as shy and nervous and fearful, rather than a mischievous troublemaker. He is good at causing trouble, but he's afraid to do it because he thinks he'll get kicked out of school/hated/fail all his classes. The only reason he eventually goes along with it is to impress James, Sirius, and Peter. Really pulls at the heartstrings, but it's a good read.

*** linkffn(Casting Moonshadows) is very similar. He pulls some pranks on his own because he's a loner in the beginning, but eventually he makes friends with the other marauders.

  Lonely and outcast by his classmates, Remus wishes on a moonshadow for a friend who understands him. To his amazement his wish is answered not once, but three times, by his former enemies, the Marauders. SBRL and some JPLE as well, of course.

***** It's probably in my top five favourites of all time. It's Wolfstar and their relationship is the primary focus of the story.

** So, this fic is . . . is adult themed, but there's a lot more to Remus than other marauder era fics I've read, linkffn (debt of time). Hermione/marauders, you know the drill. It's a Sirius/Hermione fic, but Hermione dates Remus first.

*** How good is that story, plotwise? I am usually wary of Romance/Friendship ones because they too frequently end up having boring plots, characters whose decisions make little sense, or worse.

**** It's extremely long, but it's one that I recommend to people who are open to the particular relationships involved. It's got some absolutely hilarious and brilliant scenes involving the four of them. It does involve time travel, so cause/effect is a lingering piece in the background. I personally think that some of the 'decisions that make little sense' in this story are very well explained within the story itself by butting personalities and certain plot elements themselves. They make sense, just not from the inside as another character unless they're aware of the situation.

If you can get through how long it is, it's a wonderful fic. You've got consequences of time travel, magical theory and laws, magical /society/ theory and laws, both wars, development of relationships and characters, and a neat little bow at the end. But the length has been a deal breaker for people before.

** Well to be fair in the only interaction we have with them he /is/ a tired, somewhat responsible bookworm who's uncomfortable with (or at the very least doesn't participate in) James and Sirius' more, ah, risqu√© "pranks"

In any case he's quite the marauder in linkffn(It Falls to the Young), which started before HBP and so is very, very, very AU. ^{^{AlsoitmightbeSnapecentricbuthe'sbasicallyanOC}}

  During their summer at Order HQ, the suspicious Marauders clash with the secrets of Severus Snape: his unforgiving father, Albus' loyalty, a past that haunts his nightmares... But no one expected friendship, nor the consequences thereof. Plus cute!Tonks. ***NEW CHAPTERS FINALLY UP AFTER 5 YEARS WHAAT? Newest ch is 41! NOW COMPLETE!***
