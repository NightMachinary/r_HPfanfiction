I'm tired of the same scavenger hunt/know where every horcrux is/ have to push everyone away cuz I'm dangerous trope or if its a Slytherin pairing (OC or otherwise) the fact that there are repercursions... That's just annoying after so many fics with the same "orignal ideas".

I've read most of the big ones, I think. But sometimes you can surprise me. Just please. Absolutely no Lily-Bashing. IDGAF about James, but no Lily bash. Preferably without Dumbledore Bash/Hate/SOM-GG.


** Gonna be brave and stupid and put out my fic. The main character's an OC and it's canon compliant until the end of the third year with significant changes in the second. The pairings are yet to be determined but I'm sure you'll get ideas about them along the story. Linkffn(The Progeny of Slythern)

  Hidden away from a world that would've hated him, Theodore Riddle had but remnants from his past; bare pieces that would teach him his own wretched story. Clinging onto the vestige of his innocence, he tries so hard not to succumb to the Dark Lord's influence; he tries to keep his loyalty to Dumbledore and his friends... but a boy can never run from his own father. Gets darker. OC.

***** I'm confused, in a fictional world of wizardry, how are homosexual relationships any harder to write? JK Rowling all but said that Dumbledore was gay...

If anything they'd be much easier to write realistically, since a gay guy writing such a relationship is a guy himself. Whereas someone writing a hetero relationship has to realistically write the opposite gender, which isn't really intuitive at all. You can kind of see this in Canon Harry Potter - it's entirely lacking in any sort of masculinity. Which isn't necessarily a dig at Rowling, but a testament to the difficulty of writing from such a different perspective.

******* No problem lol.

Nobody mentioning it more speaks to the sort of men and women that are attracted to the sort of Harry Potter meta story. Many of the former wouldn't know masculinity if it bit them in the ass - I don't want to say low T, but, well....

Both groups probably tend to see masculinity as something negative, which makes sense given the media they've been exposed to.

There's a bunch of scenes of the male characters being slobs, being lazy, generally boorish. It shows the worst of boys, and is completely devoid of the best of men: dominance and assertiveness, loyalty and trust, willpower and perseverance.

One of the best examples of this is Ron's repeated betrayals and flakiness, and the reasons Rowling writes for them. Male friendships of that kind are much stronger than she writes, and men certainly wouldn't be tempted to act like that because of a disparity in wealth and status. That might be an accurate portrayal of female relationships, but not male friendships. Humanity as a whole simply wouldn't have gotten to where it is if this was the way men thought and acted on the whole.

And the entire character of Harry Potter? If the character existed in real life, sans the magic any shit, I wouldn't want anything to do with him because it's just a pathetic personality. His greatest desire is to be normal, and he wants a family, but doesn't have any drive to self but improve and isn't assertive enough to get a woman unless she literally falls into his lap. Honestly, Harry Potter would be an incel out of high school, because there's no way in hell any woman could possibly find that attractive. You can make him female, just change the pronouns, and you wouldn't lose a /single thing/.

Seriously, what's to like about him? He isn't funny, he isn't strong - mentally or physically. Literally his only positives are being against literal evil, and having such low self-esteem and ability that his only option was to suicide by Voldemort.

Oof, I wrote a lot more than I intended, but fuck it, I'm bored at work, so...

******** Haha true. I've seen my brothers and boy, they are loud, rambunctious, always tumbling around fighting, but they're the thickest of friends. I was kind of disappointed Ron and Harry didn't have that kind of relationship.

If I take only the character setup of the trio in Philosopher's Stone, I'd say Ron should probably be the kind of boy who makes jokes out of his family situation. It also would have made more sense, if Harry actually actively tried to woo girls, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT BOYS DO! The Marauders are much better at being boys than Harry and Ron are. Sadly, readers (mostly female) go on about how they're insensitive and arrogant. I've realised writing fanfiction is a problem for me, because I try to incorporate some masculinity into Harry. Not like harems and stuff, but at least with one girl. It kind of makes his character OOC to read, but I'd rather prefer he manned up. I'd like to recommend you an essay on LJ where the author elaborates on this. [[https://sarahtales.livejournal.com/133740.html]] She writes how Feminism is good as long as we don't keep putting down boys. It should be about equality and acceptance.

** There are a lot of reasons for writing homo relationships to be harder, one of it is the lack of examples and material since most of the official media only portrays hetero relationships. The rest, I don't have time nor intention to explain it for you, you can do a little research yourself. Thank you for asking tho.

Edit: also I don't feel the need for more muscularity in the thing I read.

  Twelve years after the horrible experience in her father's bookshop, muggle Katherine Shepard is back home to start anew. However, a visit from a tall, miserable stranger sends her into a world she never knew existed, changing her future forever. As the dark potions master tries to grapple with the woman he's been forced to protect as well as living a life of a double-agent, his own worldview begins to change...against his better judgement. And as he continues with his plan to protect the world against the Dark Lord and begins to acknowledge the feelings that are starting to grow for a certain annoying muggle, Severus begins to wonder if he might deserve a happy ending after all. ***All 'Harry Potter'/etc related credit goes to Miss Rowling - whom I am very thankful created such a wonderful world full of amazing characters that we are able to play with!***[Note: This timeline is similar to Book 6- and it will continue slightly AU in the future for reasons that will eventually present themselves. ] I live for comments - they are my lifeblood.
