Hi, I love fics that explore the political or cultural side of the wizarding world. Anything that has networking. Just ended rereading Marauder's plan and wish some more good society fics. I don't really care about the pairings, except that im not really into femslash (it's ok if its in the story but not as a main ship) Also pleas no cracky stuff. I also don't usually read the bashing type stories because they take the character bashing to the extreme and way out of character (but am prepared to give it a chance if its a good quality fic)

I'd prefer if it was on ao3.

Thanks to anyone who responds üòò


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is the first one that comes to mind, you also may like my series, which starts with linkao3(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn). Linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw) is definitely more tropey than the other two I've rec'd, but it's quite long and the writing is solid.

  Chessmaster Volume I. AU. Harry discovers that cleverness is the best way to outwit Dudley and his gang, which leads to a very different Sorting. While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain. Sequel complete.No bashing or child politicians.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
