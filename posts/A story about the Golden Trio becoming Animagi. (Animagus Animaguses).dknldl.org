I opened a new profile on FFN and AO3 to rebrand and really put my complete all into my work. I am immensely proud of what I have started on this profile, a story called Amato Animo Animato Animagus. It's a retelling of fourth year wherein the Golden Trio undergo the Animgus transformation according to how the process works in canon. It is also the first of a connected 'universe' of fanfiction I'm writing with Harry Potter. I'd greatly appreciate a read and a review.

** If you don't mind it being a Pokemon crossover, Harry Mewter is pretty neat

#+begin_quote
  When Harry Potter sees his godfather transform into an enormous black dog to save his life, his interest is piqued. When he hears stories that his father could do exactly the same, his attention is well and truly grabbed. And when he hears that his father and godfather attained this ability while still in school, there's nothing that can stop him.
