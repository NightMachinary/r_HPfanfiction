Specifically fics where Harry is raised and/or trained by Elrond. Or Gandalf. Or Galadriel. Or really any of the “good guys.” Or all of them.

I would prefer fics of some length (over 20k), but I have no idea how many fics would fit my request, so that may not be possible.

Thank you.


** The only crossover of these fandoms I really like is “The Shadow of Angmar” by steelbadger Harry gets some training (sorta) from Saruman and has a close relationship with the elves of Rivendell and Lothlorien in particular. Currently, it's over 200k words and you can find it in both ao3 and ff.net.

There are some other stories that I enjoyed but none that really fit with the request.
