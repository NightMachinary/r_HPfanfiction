Any Harry/Ginny/Luna fanfic out there, preferably no smut, I like it as a romantic pairing only.


** I'm reading one right now called Hearts Home with that pairing.

**** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4757373/1/Heart-s-Home]]

It's starting to get steamy, but not overly graphic yet.

*** Isn't that H/Hr/L though rather than with Ginny?

Also, I found the weird garden thing... weird. Definitely one of the odder concepts I have read so far.

** That could be a cute pairing, so long as the relationship is done well and it's not just a 'harry and his two girlfriends' thing

It could easily be a good poly relationship. I always shipped Luna with harry when I was a kid since they are just very similar and yet different enough to enjoy spending time together

And Ginny if sone well could fit right in.
