I read linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/727732/chapters/1350935]]) were Harry essentially takes over the Dark Mark, in this case accidentally, and takes control of (some) death eaters. Is there more like this out there? I prefer Slash, though its not necessary. An adventure or dark fic without romance would work too. Doesnt matter either if he takes over the mark to save someone, or by accident or to usurp Voldemort. So, recs? Cheers! :)

  AU from Chapter 32 of DH. Voldemort has learned who the true master of the Elder Wand is, and he plans to kill Draco along with Snape. Harry is desperate to save them, because Dumbledore would have wanted him to. But with wild magic, Horcruxes, and Dark Marks all involved, Harry's condemned all three of them to an accidental bond.

  #+begin_example
      This is One of Those Bonding Fics\. It’s also One of Those Threesome Fics, and also One of Those Fics With Harry\-in\-Denial\. If that sounds like what you’re looking for, then come right in\.

** In “Where in the World is Harry Potter” (linkffn(2354771)) and its sequels Severus is a marked follower of his.

In the sequels he also makes a muggle fight wizards basically for his amusement, and dabbles in necromancy.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** Chapter 4 of linkffn(The Terrible Ideas Bin by The Mad Mad Reviewer) has Harry taking over Bellatrix's mark.

[[http://snowgall.livejournal.com/5198.html][An lj rec list of Drarry fics with mark removal/changing.]]

linkffn(Black Vengeance by Teufel1987) has [[/spoiler][Sirius in lieu of Harry]] taking over. [[/spoiler][Harry inherits the enslaved Voldemort.]] I think there are a couple of indy!Harry fics where he takes over by /right of conquest/ if you are interested but the writing is likely to be mediocre.
