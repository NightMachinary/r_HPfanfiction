I remember this story involving Harry, and an OC female being a major character. The girl is helping Harry, and when Harry and the girl go to Grimmauld Place, the girl is kidnapped by Order members, and then she somehow... disappears, due to... torture or something. She returns in some form or another. Might be time-travel, or the girl is summoned or something.

  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).
