Sure, we all know the time turner is just about the ultimate McGuffin, especially in Hermione's hands; however, the concept was just wasted as it was originally written. I'd like to see a Hermione who pulls out a time turner during book seven, or better yet, makes excellent use of the tool either during or after uni. A Hermione Time Lord perhaps? One where she lightheartedly takes a cue from the fictional show, not where she actually teams up with Who.
