** Well Pureblood pretence is one of the best in terms of fem!harry. Imho, of course. But, while very awesome in its own right, it is nothing at all like the never ending road.

*** Ehhh, no. The first year is indeed very well written, with a tight plot structure and excellent character development.

However, starting from the second year onward, the author got bit by the rambling tell-but-dont-show bug. She started posting 25k word chapters filled with scenes that last for twenty pages consisting of nonsensical, barely coherent infodumps disguised as dialogue. And the OCs all feel like wooden plot devices instead of actual characters.

** I LOVE The Never-ending ending road. Most fem!harrys read like Self- inserts but Harriet is amazing. She has enough of Harry's traits while being likable and realistic. Snape sings on the page whenever he's there. Remus, Sirius and Dumbledore have great characterizations and the story is paced well. It takes an extremely talented author to take a premise that makes most people go "Ew" and turn it into a well-written, touching story. I haven't found any other fem!Harry story I've liked as much.

** I"m sorry OP- Never-ending road is my favourite ff and I haven't found anything comparable when it comes to plot, characterization, and style.

Under 3 days? Have you even slept? ;)

*** You think that's bad? Under three days when I had an exam and a long-ass analytical essay coming up in several days.

Today, no, in less than three and a half hours, and I'm just about to begin studying. Way to go, me, find something interesting that you can't get away from at the very best of times!
