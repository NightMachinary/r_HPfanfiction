I was looking for a story where Harry Potter gets sent to the GoT universe and creates a new kingdom.


** */The Difference one Man can make/*

Unfortunately as dead as most of the main cast of GoT at this point, but still an enjoyable 1/4 of a million words read.

The gist of it is that Harry finds himself beyond the wall, builds up a flurishing civilization with the wildlings and eventually gets onto the map for a lot of rulers of Westeros and Essos.

linkffn(11132113)

*/A Song of Ice, Fire and Lightning/*

A bit of a rough one, but okay-ish if you want some GoT action is this one. It has a prequel which is... yeah... I wouldn't recommend it, and you really don't need it to understand this one. Just know that harry comes into this world powerful af.

It has some good interaction, especially with the Starks. I haven't read it to the parts in Essos for some reason, but it can't be that bad since I still have it in my bookmarks.

He technically helps create a kingdom, so...? I dunno.

linkffn(11904771)

A lil' extra, if you haven't seen it already: */The Winter Witch/*

Not Harry and not Kingdom creating, but enjoyable. Hermione ends up in the GoT universe and meets Robb Stark. She helps him and from there on out she gets roped into the war more and more.

  My reward for beating the Demon Emperor and sending him back to hell? Finding myself in an unknown land, hounded by heralds of ice and fire, as well as the idiotic peoples of the lands in this... Westeros. Is it possible to find a way home? I don't know. Eventual Harry/Daenerys. As in way, way later. Stop asking when :P

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom, and finished with a battle outside her tent. The deciding line between staying and helping Robb Stark, or returning to her universe, is getting harder to see the longer she's in Westeros. But it's a decision that she has to make, or it's one that will be made for her.

** linkffn(11255223) This should be The wizard of harrenhal. I remember reading it and Harry creating a fairly powerful kingdom. Its short but really shows how much of a game breaker a wizard with full control of magic would be in the game of thrones.

  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.
