*** I for unexplainable reasons am just /dying/ at the sentence 'these are my favorite Snapes"

Edit: Like I'm sort of picturing this group of Snapes in varying degrees of characterization etc. jumping up and down going 'pick me' or sulking in corners being dragged out and held up like Simba by Rafiki as you go 'You. You are my favorites. All hail the chosen Snapes.' XD

** linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) really gets inside his head and examines what makes him tick, both good (intelligence, loyalty, patience) and bad (arrogance, possessiveness, holding grudges). I really enjoy reading his gradual character growth, as Lily's influence saps the fuel from his bitterness and leaves him tired of pushing people away.

#+begin_quote
  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.

** Summary:

Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve until her mind can be cracked.

Snape is not the main character but he is just such an interesting character in this story.
