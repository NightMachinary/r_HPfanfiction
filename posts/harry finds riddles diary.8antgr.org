  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9348546/1/Ink-Stains][Ink Stains]] by Dreams2Paper11 might be something you'll like. However, it's an MCU crossover so that's why I was not sure if you would still want to read it.

In the beginning of this story, twelve year old Harry actually kept the diary long enough that Tom stole Harry's energy and basically switched places with him. So Harry's in the diary and Tom kept the diary to toy with him considering that Tom is Harry's only form of human communication. Eventually, Tom got rid of the diary with Harry in it to the MCU verse where he was alone for a long time with Tom's memories that was already imprinted in the diary. You can guess he became sort of â€˜dark' due to learning everything about Tom's life from those memories up until Tom stop using the diary. Bruce eventually finds the diary after who knows how long Harry has been without human contact inside of the diary.

  In which Harry was sealed inside Tom Riddle's diary during his second year and tossed into another world, upon where he finds himself in Bruce Banner's lonely hands. With the life Banner leads, he supposes that he shouldn't be surprised by this "Harry Potter" being. Really, there wasn't enough coffee in the world to deal with this.

  Companion pieces to my ongoing story, Ink Stains. In this, I shall throw fluffiness and occasional angsty one-shots that can't fit in my story. I would warn you about POSSIBLE spoilers, but we all know that even with that risk, and if you're as curious as
