I personally would construct this story like this:

Harry, fed up with the idiocy of the Wizarding World, intends to show them they are wrong. Gathering a group, many people with powerful families, along with Ron and Hermione, intend to start a revolution. Somewhere in it, Harry would ask Sirius for help, explain him wizarding habits, teach him a lot of spells, because Black was once an Auror. He would slowly introduce the members of the Order to his interests and, thanks to his friends in Slytherin, cleverly win them over to his side. After graduating from high school, I think he would travel the world, leaving Britain behind and learning from the Masters of the arts. By communicating with his friends, he would find out that England is really bad and that the impulsive Gryffindor interrupts his training, having no chance with Voldemort, delaying the entire process of taking over their power. He stays there for two years, until finally [someone I have no idea who] crushes his mind into his head and literally blows him abroad. Later (definitely later, don't know twelve years?) He finally shows up as a multi-skilled mage who rivals Voldemort, defeats him, and takes control of Britain. Dumbledore and the rest of his Order try to oppose him, but with his supporters they quickly root out the rebellion and take on the rest of Europe.

Okay, I wrote a little. And I read it and didn't give what they are fighting for. So yes, at one point Dumbledore and the rest of his gang want to reveal themselves to the Muggles, but Harry, knowing from experience that it will end badly, creates a resistance movement and at the same time a third party in the war with Voldemort. In addition, it tries to create a friendly place for all creatures where they are not afraid of who they are.


** I would have Harry think he's a vigilante only to come to the conclusion that the public sees him as a dark lord.

** I'd write it where Harry comes to the opinion that the magical world does not have the right to deny the muggle world magical medicines and other aid. With the sheer ages of some characters, a cure for cancer canonically must almost surely exist (unless being magical makes you immune somehow.) Famines and water shortages could be lessened by wizards.

As such, he feels the need to integrate the two world. However, he can't do this without being in control. As such, he starts his own faction and is deemed a dark lord by the government.

** Well... the only Gryffindor that we see almost become Dark Lord is Dumbledore so for that you'd need Harry to meet someone with seductive ideas about constructing a utopian society. It reminds of that arc from the Charmed series where the witches create a society where everyone is expected to be good and any transgression is punished severely through mutilation and even death.

** Sum of their parts does this pretty well with Gryffindor!Harry going rogue when the Shacklebolt Ministry starts going after werewolves as Dark Creatures in anti-dark pushback.

I'd say that a Gryffindor Dark Lord Potter would likely grow out of his insurgency with the DA- if the ministry pushed him too far, Dumbledore somehow fell out of the picture at a critical moment, or the Second Wizarding War dragged on much longer Harry would get more militant and aggressive towards his enemies, with his army of followers getting more and more used to following his orders and accepting him as their leader.

One Scenario is that Dumbledore dies during Umbridge's reign of terror (Old Age? Perhaps the Death Eaters assassinate him to remove their biggest obstacle before their big reveal?), and as a result the membership of Dumbledore's Army are radicalized by the martyrdom and Harry is made the new primary ministry scapegoat in Dumbledore's place, pressuring him to resort to increasingly violent means as the DA begins to see all non-Potter authority figures as enemies in the civil war.

** Basically the Sum of their Parts. Harry is tired of magical world never changing, takes matters into his own hands to force change. Starts by targeting Voldemort supporters who avoided capture/repercussions through their influence/gold. Slowly starts to be viewed as a Dark Lord by the population. Although, if I were writing it, I feel like Harry would see himself more like a Punisher type vigilante, rather than a titled "Dark Lord" it would be others who see him as such.

*** Leaving aside that in Canon there is only one (the) Dark Lord anyway, pretty much this. Whatever definition one would use for a general "Dark Lord", presumably it'd involve some sort of personal desire for power, not power in order to bring, say, more equality or justice.

This is also why I wouldn't call a hypothetical GreaterGood!Dumbledore (the real thing, with Grindelwald, not the Fanon trope) a Dark Lord. The angle of what the power is for is different.

** I'd kill off the Dursley's early on, have him be adopted by the Weasley's, but then start to lose them one by one. Put him into a corner where his choices become to either use dark magic or lose the people he loves. Give him a reason to be dark, but FFS don't just have him shrug his shoulders and decide maybe being a dark lord wouldn't be so bad in the very first chapter.

As a side note I suppose I really need to give "The Sum of Their Parts" another chance. I like the concept, but i absolutely despised the first chapter.

** I'd hand that plot back to the people that suggest it: There's no realistic way a Gryffindor!Harry becomes a Dark Lord.

What /is/ possible is to have a Gryffindor!Harry who later loses all relevant Gryffindor traits and becomes a Dark Lord. But I dunno that that was what you meant?

For all the annoyances Gryffindors can be, they just aren't Dark Lord material. The drive to even get there is fundamentally lacking. The worst incarnation of Gryffindor is McLaggen: Arrogant, entitled, narrow-minded and convinced of their own righteousness, but fundamentally too lazy to do anything of relevance.

Which is not to say Gryffindors can't have visions or be politicians or rulers, see Dumbledore. Just, I'd think they'd go about that in a way that couldn't be called "Dark Lord". The way Canon is set up, that seems limited to Slytherins by definition, at least if they had those traits already during school.
