** You get a lot more scrutiny the more popular your fic becomes, I find, which can be helpful in the long run but super demoralising when it comes to writing. I kind of miss that moment when I wrote the first chapter of Not From Others and turned to my boyfriend with a big beam and said "20 people have read it now! One of them is from PERU!"

That said, it's nice getting genuinely helpful and supportive reviews, which when you don't get a lot of traffic can be rare.

  One of them is from PERU!

That's actually pretty cool. You're fic had/has international appeal, beyond just the majority-English speaking countries, and Western Europe. Straight baller.

**** I don't think the stats are very reliable. I had a review exchange with someone I know was in the UK but it recorded all the views as being from Greece - and I know it was the same person because there was only one visitor. So I don't think you can really rely on the stats. I seem to get quite a lot of readers from India. /shrugs/

** I'd say there's positives and negatives to both. When I posted the first couple of chapters of Grow Young with Me, it was mostly on a whim. I didn't edit things as manically as I do now, nor did I stress over characterisation or plot. I also didn't do a lot of fact-checking (Teddy is supposed to be a year older or something, but oh well). Basically, I felt no pressure to improve which made it easy, but also made the story suck more. But then suddenly a lot more people were reading it, and I really started to feel that pressure. And while it became more difficult to actually write, it was great because I was motivated to research and learn so much more about writing mechanics and storytelling along the way. And I'm still learning and trying to improve.

But there are also downsides to a story being more popular. Sometimes I feel as if people expect perfection, or assume that I, myself, think that my story is perfect--both of which are ridiculous. And because of this, it attracts a lot more negative remarks. I will wholeheartedly accept constructive criticism and cherish it, but one sentence stating that someone thinks the story is shit is not really going to help me. And when that does happen, yes it's frustrating and demotivating, and it gets harder to pick myself up and start writing again, shit story be damned.

In the end, though, the most important thing is that people are actually reading your story. It took me getting more readers to realise that I should really try to improve, but that shouldn't matter. Speaking from experience, whether you have one view or a thousand views, you have /someone/ who is invested in your story. Even if that someone is you.

** Not having a ton of reviews and the like can be very difficult because it's hard to want to write when you're not sure if anyone is even reading.

*** Or when you've got a lot of hits, but the reviews/favs/follows don't reflect that. From personal experience, there's nothing more demoralising than putting your heart and soul into a fic and then getting a hugely muted response even though the readers are clearly there, while a poorly-written harem fic garners thrice the reviews/follows/favs that you have.

** I've written stories that have both well and poorly received.

I know a story that I literally put a lot of heart one was kinda like "meh". That's hard to deal with. As authors, we do put in a lot of hard work into our stories--so when it's not really taken well, it's saddening. But then you get that one or two loyal reviewers, and it just makes it better, you know? Those loyal leave such thoughtful reviews, that you keep going.

I find I actually get less motivated when a story is more popular. All of a sudden there is an expectation and then-- the reviewers just feel so strongly for certain elements of your story that it just takes the fun out of it. I know I've actually had a couple reviewers flame me excessively over a certain event not taking place or ships. To me, when you have people taking away your story to make it their own is the worst.

Write your own story then. The second that happens, I just find it more and more difficult to write it.

It's odd, but I work harder when I have something to prove or when I really love a certain plot bunny.

** Since I didn't have people asking me to continue in the last year, I also don't feel TOO MUCH pressure to update quickly, and I can edit my story whenever I like, make drastic changes. That is positive about it. I'm not sure how I would feel if years from now I still haven't received any positive feedback, but right now I don't mind.

** It's harder to write when you think no one likes what you do. I understand that there might be a certain amount of pressure when you get popular, but believe me, being ignored is worse.

I have only ever posted stories that were already complete, but even that was hard when I could easily go for five or six chapters (maybe more, I forget) without a single review. I do think if I had been posting as I went, I would have become completely demoralised and stopped writing quite quickly.

Well, to be fair, I have been thoroughly demoralised, but at least I was demoralised with a complete story not an abandoned one - which is an achievement of sorts I suppose. It hasn't done anything for my self esteem, but it has pushed me into writing original fiction instead. I'm sure that will go well. Ha.
