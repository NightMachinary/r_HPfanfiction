** AO3 is designed for the type of reader who reads a broad variety of story types so its functionality is directed towards over-inclusion.

FF.Net is designed for the type of reader who wants to read a specific thing so its functionality is directed towards over-exclusion.

Example : if you just want to read Harry-centric stories, FF.Net is the place to go. Stick Harry into Character A and you'll get mostly Harry centric stories. Meanwhile on AO3 if you put Harry into the character field you'll get more non-Harry centric stories than Harry-centric ones in the results.

Example 2: if you want to read any story which features a certain trope (e.g. "enemies to lovers") AO3 is the place to go because you can search by that specific tag and it will return a ton of stories, all of which will be relevant to you provided you don't particularly care which characters they are about.

Which site you prefer will depend on what type of reader you are. As someone who only reads Harry centric fics, AO3 is basically unusable for me.

Sadly, that's still a long way off

** Both websites have their pros and cons. I prefer AO3 when it comes to Marvel because of the Crossover nature of the whole thing (eg if I want to read a story about Loki I never know where to look on FFN - Thor or Avengers or a crossover between both?) but then again if I want to read a Loki story on FFN I get only those stories with him as the main character - on AO3 I get thousands of stories that list him as a character but the story isn't at all about him. This is especially a problem when you are not looking for a certain ship but just one character. AO3 is nice when you are looking for something very specific - eg time travel fix its. But you might miss stories that did not tag that and you never discover anything new if you keep your search this specific...

** I read through my Android tablet exclusively. FF.NET had an amazing app. It doesn't really sync with the website fully but it still works wonderfully. Ao3 doesn't have an official app which means they expect you to read via the browser. The app gives a more book like experience. To me it is also easier to search and sort the stories.

Maybe it depends on what device you're doing your reading on.

***** There weren't nearly as many fics back then, so it was easier to find something interesting. Crossovers weren't their own categories, so you'd have to look through either of the properties involved to find them.

You could filter some stuff, like age ratings, genre, word count, etc.

I was just amazed and happy to be able to find fanfiction at all when I first got started. It was such a new concept to me that for over 10 years I just read whatever looked halfway decent.

I do appreciate the filtering capabilities we have now. It makes it a lot simpler. Unfortunately, it is extremely hard to find old fics I read when first starting out. There's many I'd like to reread if I could find them.

That being said, Classic Cowboy has some awesome X-Men Evolution and HP crossovers. I always recommend him. I also used to share PMs with the guy in the early 2000's. He was pretty cool.

Also, ffn.net also lacks the defense tha ao3 provides to potential during for copyright infringement by authors that it provides as a nonprofit organisation. On top of this it also has many current fics, where fun.net had as good as died on the mind if most current fic readers.
