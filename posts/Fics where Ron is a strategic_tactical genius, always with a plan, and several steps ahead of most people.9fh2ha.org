In canon, especially the latter books, I feel as if Ron was shafted. Are there any (well-written) fics where Ron can be compared to a younger Mad-Eye Moody, in terms of strategy and tactics? A Ron who plans WAY ahead of schedule, jumps hoops around most characters, and will eventually make Dumbledore seem like a simpleton planner. He might not be very book-smart, but he knows how to blend in and disappear; knows obscure potion ingredients used in XXXX poisons and how to cure them etc.

​

Bonus: Ron gradually gains his own following that is, if not greater, equal to Harry. Additionally, a version of Ron who represents the resourcefulness and cunning of Slytherin.

*** I, for one, am not. The main sub likes to jerk off a couple times a week about /poor Ron/. People overcompensate for the movies having to take content away from Ron because Rupert Grint simply cannot act by saying Ron is actually the greatest character of all time ever created in the history of the universe. Then they complain in the same breath, without a trace of irony, about how much they hate 'perfect' Hermione.

I don't need that circlejerk here as well.

We don't. It's terrible and unrealistic portrayals of Hermione that we dislike.

** Ron looks like he'd develop into somebody like that in The Boy Who Died, which is bizarre and rather unreal and satisfying that way. He's a cunning and observant fellow who experiments with potions right under Snape's nose in Snape's own class in First Year.

It's still ongoing, but the author is regularly uploading chapters a few times a week and had stated that the fic is already complete.

** Don't know a fic about this, but you might wanna read this.

Ron can be the most important character in the story, if the author uses him correctly. IMO the best way to make Ron impactful is make him the heart and mind(not the brain) of the Trio. Ron is essentially a people's person. Harry is the hot-head who jumps into anything blindly out of flawed morality. Hermione is this obsessed genius who thinks only way to get a control of a situation is know everything related to it.

Ron...He is the cool-minded one. He sees a problem, he sees the risk, he sees a obvious solution. He knows the large consequence, he knows that spiders are dangerous, House Elves don't want to be freed, the ministry is generally corrupt. He is provides an unique view of being raised around magic. He can talk to others and let them understand what an impolite Harry wants them to do. Or let them know why Hermione is buried nose deep under this particular book. He cares about these two, because they see him and need him just as much as he needs them.

Like the best moment in canon Book one, "Are you a witch or not?". He's 11 and doesn't know the exact fire spell to take out the vines, but Hermione who should know is panicking. He points out the solution. Same with Book three, "You'd have to go through us", he will risk it when the need arises. Though, I'd have to think a few more of these instances, which became..rare in later books.

So, making him a little Mad-eye or uber manipulative or even knowing obscure facts, might not be the best way to give what he deserves. Make him the one normal guy surrounded by crazy things happening and without him both his friends would've died in like a first few months of the first year.

** Ron is a Slytherin and develops his tactical/chess side in my series, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn). It's a political AU, and while Ron is not on a Dumbledore level, he's certainly much more aware of things than in canon.

Yes, I'm Muggleborn!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13119842/1/]]

Harry Potter

Words: 2,136 Genre: Adventure/Romance Rated: M

This story follows our unsung heroes, the Muggleborn Wizards from Gryffindor. I also added a new twist to Ron's character, which is more mature and playing to his strengths. Harry and Hermion will play a key role, but the spotlight will be stolen by Ron Weasley, Dean Thomas & Colin Creevy. Smart Ron, Half-blood Dean, Savage Colin. Rated M for Language and Graphic Violence!
