:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Sooo, I can't really remember the start but what I remember is:

1. Harry and Draco start secretly dating and they go to Hogsmead for their frist date and Draco brings this umbrella that records the memory.

2. Luna and Draco are friends sort of and Luna helps Draco and Harry pass notes to each other - oh and Hermione thinks Luna and Harry are dating because of this.

3. Harry tells Sirius and he sends Draco hate mail.

4. Snape finds out through Harry's memories .

Okay if any of this sounds famillar to anyone I will be grateful.


** Do you remember if it was on FF.net or AO3?

**** It has the memory umbrella (chapter 8), Fem-Harry telling Sirius (chapter 13), Sirius sending the threatening letter (17), Snape finding out about the relationship through searching her mind (chapter 15), Ron and Hermione have the misunderstanding that Luna and Fem-Harry are dating (throughout the entire thing but addressed in chapter 20).
