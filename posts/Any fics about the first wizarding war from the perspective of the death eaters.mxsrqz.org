I read All The Young Dudes and loved it but I'm Interested in what the war looked like from the other side...we know regulus had Voldemort clippings in his room so curious about what events those were covering, what the propaganda looked like, how they recruited, what their strategy was, what the dynamics of the group was. And they were winning before 1981 so what that rise to winning and then immediate fall looked like? Would love to see the perception/characterization of Voldemort as a leader looked like to his followers.

Not really looking to read about hogwarts but more like adults...would love regulus and bellatrix as major characters.


** You're gonna hate me but linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) is the most comprehensive story of the first war. And second war. And founders. And everything else it's 1.8M words HAVE FUN!! ðŸ˜Š

  Bellatrix's torture of Hermione uncovers a long-kept secret. The young witch learns her true origins in a story that shows the beginning and end of the Wizarding wars as Hermione learns about her biological father and the blood magic he dabbled in that will control her future. (Complete version is on FFN. I am uploading chapters to Ao3 as I edit them.)Beta Love: Fluffpanda, Nykizta, azuthlu

** Well linkffn(7937889) explores that phase of Snape's life. However, as in the original books, the Death Eaters mostly use stealth tactics rather than flashy attacks. Snape invents a bunch of spells and potions that makes them really silent so it's not that interesting of an action. Just a lot of assassinations.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
