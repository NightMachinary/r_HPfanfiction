Are there any fics where either Lily or James Potter, or both went dark and sided with Voldemort. Preferred complete or at least regularly updated fics


** I don't know any, but this could be a sick AF prompt. Though, Lily as a muggle-born wouldn't work. You'd have to change her heritage or parentage.

*** It's not something I want to read, but we know that Voldemort doesn't really care about that shit of blood, he just uses pureblood supremacism to manipulate that bunch of idiots like the Malfoys or Lestranges and use their resources, he still recruits some useful half-bloods like Snape and he probably wouldn't mind recruiting talented people like Lily or Hermione if he thinks they can be useful to him, of course, they would never follow him. In the end, he only cares about power, he is crazy shit after all.

I am pretty sure he hated muggleborns (see his opening of the chamber of secrets) and muggles (hating his Name, his muggle-father etc.). He was a racist, there is no denying that. But he also has psychopathic tendencies. If he can use something to his advantage he will use it. That's the reason he tried recruiting Lily Potter - not because he didn't hate muggleborns but because he likes power more.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13675330/1/Ruin]] is really good and i also like her other works.

i don't know if this counts as dark James but he is a real jerk in the beginning and a very intriguing plot.
