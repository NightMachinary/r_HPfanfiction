I just finished reading the Sacrifices Arc and am having major book hangover because it was so amazing. I liked how detailed and action-packed it was, and that its plot diverged fully from the actual series. Also, I enjoyed the slash relationship and how well it developed without overwhelming the story. It was kept firmly in the background, and the story was not about the slash.

I'm looking for powerful!Harry fics like that one. He can be Dark or good, I don't really care. The plot has to be very different from the actual series, and I would prefer a complete AU of Harry's seven years, rather than an non-epilogue compliant AU like most slash seems to be. It can be any kind of slash--I am fine with Snape/Harry, Draco/Harry, and Riddle/Harry... the slash possibilities are endless.

And no, before you ask, I do NOT want to read het. I look for Dark!Powerful!Harry fics on fanfiction.net and all I see is haremfics. haremfics everywhere. Ugh.

Also, near-perfect grammar is necessary. The writing style has to be good, or I simply can't read it.


** Prince of the Dark Kingdom might be what you are looking for, there is some het, there is some slash, there is some intimate Harry/Tom Riddle moments.

**** Sorry, I guess I should have been more specific. What you said is indeed true. When I say they are intimate above I do not mean sex. However, the story is the first one I think of when I think of an intimate relationship between men.

** I tend to intentionally not read powerful!Harry fics but nevertheless I have a couple that meet your requirements.

- [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewuser.php?uid=53][If You're Prepared Series]] - In this series Harry has to spend his summer after 5th and 6th year locked away in hiding with Snape rather than at the Dursleys. For the first couple years of the fic Harry and Snape have a purely Mentor/Mentee relationship (although Harry does flirt with Snape a bit). Harry starts to rely on Snape for reassurance/support a lot more, and their relationship changes before Harry's 6th year. This is an AU which was written, I think, after GoF because it is only canon-compliant through that. IIRC Harry is really powerful in this.

- [[http://thetwobroomsticks.slashcity.net/sansa/OntheLastDayindex.html][On The Last Day of Our World]] - I am so torn about this fic because it has so many wonderful aspects and also so many terrible parts! But the general premise is that Harry and Draco travel through a light and wake up in an AU (kinda multiverse...) world empty of people. The beginning is really well-done and has great tension and a lot of creepy parts that are great. Then it quickly jumps YEARS into the future and harry and draco are totally different people as well as completely overpowered. It is totally ridiculous and overdone (for example 22y/o Harry in this is more powerful than Dumbledore). There is a lot of Dumbledore bashing and waaaay too much overuse of the word "lover." The magic and world building is great, the beginning is great, and everything else has a lot of problems imo.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/101475][No Way Back]] - This is a sort of time travel fic where in what seems like only a moment, Harry lives through 20 years of another timeline (like Narnia kinda). Then when back in the present he has the mind and power of a 35 year old and also knows how to beat Voldemort. Harry's relationship with Snape is secondary to the "fix it" plot.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1097868][Escribamens]] - This fic is good but suuuuper odd - it is really reliant on pure-blood families and customs and actually has some rather good world-building for how pureblood magic works with muggleborns and how magic is "bred". Basically Draco becomes Lord Malfoy after Lucius goes to Askaban. Draco gets access to all of the spells that Lord of the Malfoy's only has. One of these is a spell that reveals everything about a person and you can use it on your enemies. Draco uses it on Harry and finds out that not only is Harry super powerful, but is in love with Draco. It is all from Draco's POV, so it is not clear why Harry would be in love with him but whatever. And seduced by power and wanting to be on the winning side, Draco starts to court Harry and eventually starts falling for him. The writing is good and the magic descriptions/world building is great. The character motivations and dialogue are a little weird and under-developed.

** The R series probably qualifies, but it's not slash (but, romance is not a big focus of the story anyway). One of my favorite portrayals for powerful!Harry. Best of all, instead of moping up all opposition, he tends to fuck up quite a bit, which makes for an entertaining read. The focus of the story is mentor!Snape, Harry's auror training and of course getting a handle on some very dangerous magical abilities.

** Can't remember the exact name of the fic, but it has pretty much everything you're looking for. Think it's something like Of Lies Deceits and Hidden Personas by an author called Jessikaa15 if I remember right.

** linkffn(October by The Carnivorous Muffin) The premise might seem hokey at first, but trust me: it's good. It's got one of the best critiques of classism and anti-muggle/purist sentiment I've ever read in a HP fanfic. It's more Tom-centric than Harry-centric, though. (Because Harry is so powerful in this that he's literally unfathomable to most people--including Tom.) And the slash is (unfortunately) one-sided at this point.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, slash

** Try [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=6256][Secrets]] by Vorabiza. It's not all 7 years, but not post-Hogwarts, either - it begins after sixth year. Definitely a different plot from the series. Although it might not be quite the powerful Harry you're looking for. Believable relationship development considering where they start out. And I think the writing is pretty good.

Summary: Beginning with Draco's unexpected arrival at the Dursleys, Harry's summer after sixth year becomes filled with activity and many secrets. As his summer progresses, Harry generates several unexpected allies as he finds himself actively becoming the leader of the Light side. H/D post-HBP Complete
