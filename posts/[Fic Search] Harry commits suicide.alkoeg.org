** There's a very sad one where he kills himself by hanging with the invisibility cloak and of course I can't remember the name. If anyone can remember and link it, it's pretty well written.

*** It is this one. It is a mildly sad story that I think about a lot.

** It's spoilers for this story to know that he chooses to off himself, so I'll do a hard link instead of using the bot: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/The-Substitute][link]]

Maybe some people will come across it out of context of this thread and not be spoiled.
