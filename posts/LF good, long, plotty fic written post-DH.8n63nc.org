The last time I really read HP fanfic was before Deathly Hallows came out - and I mean the book. I used to love this fandom, though, and I want to get back in to it, so can you guys recommend me some plotty, must-read fic that's been posted since then? Something with good characterization that doesn't just follow the Stations of Canon.

Any pairing, slash, het, gen, whatever, as long as the focus is on the plot. I also love all kinds of tropes: time-travel, altetnate dimensions, mpreg, etc. It doesn't have to be complete, I will also read WiPs or even abandoned works as long as they're reasonably long.

I've tried to sort by kudos/favorites, but it doesn't seem to be as reliable an indicator of quality as I remember.

Thank you for your help.


** Just to be clear, you're looking for any story that was written after the seventh book came out regardless of the era it takes place in. Not just stories that take place post DH.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is my top post DH fic. It's not Epilogue compliant as Harry and his friends declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126), is my favorite Epilogue compliant postwar fic. It's a nice take on Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]] by cambangst is probably the most underrated literary work that I have ever seen. I actually wrote a long review on this fic [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8iu981/recommendation_harry_potter_and_the_conspiracy_of/?st=JHSOJFDW&sh=b6083044&utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app][here]] but I'll quote a summary of it. linkao3(6701647) Status: Completed

#+begin_quote
  I love how each character plays off each other in a way that progresses the story that is fluid. The characters are also very distinctive. The author seriously understands each character's motives and personalities depending the situation. All the suspense and twists are also very well planned and thought out. Literally nothing is what it seems.
#+end_quote

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4910668/1/The-Inquisitor-s-Son][The Inquisitor's Son]] by jinxdoll is another well written murder mystery with the main character of Scorpius Malfoy. Very interesting and I highly recommend it. linkffn(4910668) Status: Completed

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]] by bennybear is about Draco's character growth after the war and how it affected his life. linkffn(6432055) Status: Completeed

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7900250/1/Raindrops-on-Roses][Raindrops on Roses]] by Miss Saigon. Is a fic about broken relationships between Scorpius and his father. linkffn(7900250) Status: Completed

- Another fic I highly recommend is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8479548/1/George-Weasley-and-the-Computational-Error][George Weasley and the Computational Error]] by pisoprano. The first chapter is really George being irrational going back in time to attempt to prevent Fred's death. However, as the story progresses it actually becomes a decent read. Overall, the story is a unique read. Plus there's just a lack of Fred and George fics out there even if they are the popular Weasleys. This fic really emphasizes the Twins differences and their bond. linkffn(8479548) Status: Completed

  Part 1 of The Computational Error Series. George Weasley may be 40 years old now, but he still misses his twin dearly. And when he has the chance to go back to 1989 and see Fred alive again and stop everything from happening, he can't resist. George's relationship with everyone he loves, however, will change in the process. Time Travel. NoSlash. COMPLETE
