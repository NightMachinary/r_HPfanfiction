I have been looking for good Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter crossover fanfictions for quite some time now, but, Have only found 3 - 4 completed ones. If you have any suggestions please put it in the comments! The fic must be completed. Some things that are accepted is,

- Elfling!Harry

- Harry reincarnated as another LOTR character

- Istari!Harry

- Ships (LGBTQ+ are welcomed)

- Harry being friends with one of the other LOTR characters.

Some things not accepted are:

- Incomplete/Ongoing stories (Only exceptions are fics that have recently been updated ex. 23 Dec. 2020)

- HarryxAntagonist

- Antagonist!Harry

Thank you for your recommendations!


** Like the other comment says, Shadow and Angmar is the best there is, and pretty much ruins any other crossovers with how good it is.

** The best Lotr and Harry Potter crossover is unequivocally Shadow Of Angmar, however the author has another story called The Power He Knows Not which is complete. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not]]

** I quite like this one: linkao3(The Guardian Of Life by MissYuki1990)

It is a little cliche but has Istar!Harry and is complete.

#+begin_quote
  After centuries of being alone, of yearning for a place he could call home, of loving and losing over and over again, he had given up and decided to spend the rest of eternity alone. But nothing had ever gone according to plan with him, so why should it work now?Drawn into yet another war, into yet another battle with the fate of the world at stake, will he lose himself to darkness again, or will he find what he has been looking for in the midst of sorrow and pain?
