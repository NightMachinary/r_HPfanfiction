** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4779144/1/Charmed_Wool][Charmed Wool]] is one of my favorite hidden gems. I like the switch of the usual troupe of "Harry works for the Ministry and investigates Draco". In this one, it's Draco that works for the Ministry and ends up investigating Harry for illiegal charmed jumpers.

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/984156?view_adult=true][Hidden in Plain Sight]], Harry and Teddy happen to run into Draco while on holiday three years after Draco was abducted.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2304488][Draco Malfoy: Toilet Supremo]] is one of the most unique career choices I've seen written for Draco - a toilet salesman.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/234222?view_adult=true][Then Comes a Mist and a Weeping Rain]] - Draco conjures a cloud that follows him around and rains on him constantly. The cloud has an interesting reaction to Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10470538/1/Letters-From-No-One][Letters From No One]] - Harry recieves a letter from a seven year old Draco fifteen years after it was written.

*** Uhm, I like the 8th year fics, because Hogwarts feels like homeðŸ˜Š

I every year read the whole H/D Erised on Ao3.

I am not quite into long fanfiction, I prefer Stand Alone's.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
