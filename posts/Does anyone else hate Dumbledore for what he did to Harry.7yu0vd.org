I can't believe this is a real question. I can't believe (not won't, I specifically can't) because it would be ridiculously easy to go to FFN, sort by update or favorites or reviews and find a large number of Dumbledore bashing.

Therefore your tag is wrong. This ain't a discussion, it's a rant.

** If he needed Harry to not have any self-esteem, then that failed spectacularly. Harry had self-esteem out the wazoo, and certainly did not think of himself as worthless. Hell, he could be an arrogant little bastard who often took his friends' unconditional support for granted. Right from the first book he snarks and backtalks and makes jokes, and he just gets cheekier and snarkier over the course of the years. This isn't an oppressed kid whose self-worth has been destroyed.

Dumbledore's goal wasn't to turn Harry into a soldier, it was to keep him alive. Harry was marked for death the moment he got that scar; all Dumbledore's machinations were ultimately a desperate gamble to ensure that Harry would somehow escape his inevitable fate and not have to die anyway.

There are plenty of things to criticise Dumbledore for, but at least keep to things he ACTUALLY did instead of going all Rita Skeeter on us.

  Verbal abuse regardless of what some psychologists would like you to believe isn't that big of a deal if one learns to man the fuck up
#+end_quote

Thats how you breed sociopaths.

*** And really, look at Harry in the first few books. He is a smartass, snarky little shit. Was he happy? No. Was he downtrodden and broken? Also no.

*** 1. Emotional abuse is a bug deal if you do it to a KID. How can he "man the fuck up" if he didn't even hit puberty?
2. Growing without friend and in a cupboard is also a big deal. It's not because you grow up spoiled in a lovely family that you can think that everything is okay. Don't be Dudley.
3. Man up.
