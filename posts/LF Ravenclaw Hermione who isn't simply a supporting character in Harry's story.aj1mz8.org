- it's gen or femslash. I adore romance stories, but Hermione is one of the characters I prefer not to ship until well after Hogwarts. If she must be in a relationship, I'd much rather it be with another girl. That being said, I'm not totally opposed to het ships. If you have the perfect story but Hermione hooks up with Justin Finch-Fletchley in their fifth year, feel free to recommend it.

- It's not just a rehash of canon.

- She's at least as competent as she was in canon. If anything, she's at least a little more academically minded since that aspect of her personality shone through enough for her to be sorted into Ravenclaw.

Oh, and absolutely no shipping with Draco, Voldemort, or Snape.

Thanks to everyone reading this. Even if you don't have anything that matches my request, I'm thankful that you took the time to consider it. I hope you have a wonderful day.


** A very tall order, unfortunately. Most Ravenclaw!Hermione fics tend to sort her there alongside Harry, who is the lead protagonist. I recall a Bellamione fic where the 'ship happens when the Ravenclaw!Hermione is in her 7th year at Hogwarts; but I don't think Hermione has much of a personality there.

- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/):]] What HPMOR /should/ have been. Updates very slowly.
- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10381381/1/]]) an interesting fic in its own right, but I don't remember how big Hermione's role in it is.
- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6359064/1/]]) is abandoned and actually renders Hermione as less talented than in canon, but it's decently written. The Harry 'ship won't happen soon.

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

  What if Hermione was sorted into Ravenclaw, and she, Harry and Ron never became the Golden Trio? But some things are inevitable; HP/HG, light Weasley bashing
