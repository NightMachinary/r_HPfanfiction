Do ya'll mind, on this sub, if stories are posted in chapters as they are finished as opposed to a finished shiny thing?


** If you are asking if I mind a story going up one chapter at a time. No, I like chapter by chapter updates. If you are asking if I mind author's putting up unfinished, first draft, unedited chapters, yes. I hate to read unrefined chapters. As an author, in my opinion, you should want to put up your best work. You can lose a lot of readers to putting up rough content because it is hard to concentrate on the story when you are distracted by grammar, punctuation, spelling, and continuity issues. The question to ask is why should readers care to read your story if you don't care to make it the best you can? I have often found authors who don't make it shiny are more likely to drop their projects, so I don't stick with them anymore.

** Could you explain? I'm not quite sure what you mean?

Edit: Much clearer now. I prefer that fics get posted chapter by chapter as many great fics are unfortunately abandoned and so if authors waited until finishing their fics I would have read a /lot/ less fanfiction. Additionally interaction between author and reader can lead to a greater motivation to finish a fic so it is more likely for fics posted chapter-by-chapter to eventually get completed.

  The best stories as those were the authors finish the entire thing and then publish it. When they all go out at once you lose out on a lot of reviews and FFN fame, but it's really nice for the reader.

This may be one aspect of why Inverarity's Alexandra Quick series is so good - he writes the whole thing, then he has it beta'd /from start to finish/, in order to make the thing coherent.

** The best release format for everyone imo is when the book is completed (or nearly so, end in sight) the author than posts it at a reasonable speed chapter by chapter. (Reasonable: book is fully posted in ~3 months and no more than 6, with perhaps 1-2 posts per week depending on chapter/story length). This keeps the reader engaged, and give the author more comments/feedback

As a reader, this type of posting assures me I won't get attached and then have it die before the stories conclusion, and the update schedule keeps me interested without needing to reread parts between posts.

A longer delay (such as the 2 weeks mentioned by another redditer) makes me, the reader, lose too much of the details between posts (often requiring me to skim previous chapter each time a new one is released). In these cases i tend to skip reading it until a sufficient buffer is built (5 to 10 chapters, or possibly the whole story), and then skim the previous and read the new, repeating every couple months. If it was an update schedule to post over the course of 1 year or more, I would wait to read until it was complete. Both of these reading styles would defeat the purpose of serial updates by removing chapter by chapter feedback.

*** Other release formats are better depending what you want/need. If you don't care about chapter by chapter feedback, many readers prefer a one time, fully released story. You get feedback on your finished project, and the readers finish at their own pace (plus, some readers ignore all in progress stories, so more people may read it to begin with).

A incomplete story being serially released gives you, the writer, chapter by chapter feedback you can /use/. Even with a beta, you may take into account feedback on writing style. You could do polls to get reader input into the story (ie who does the hero end up with, should I make the story darker by killing someone off, etc). Or you can gauge what your readers like by the comments and give them more of that.

It depends what you want as an author. If you have a story to write or that you have written, share it once completed and everyone is happy. If you want to tell a story and practice writing while having a back and forth with your readers, post as you write and see where the river takes you.

** I prefer for the whole thing to be out at once when I'm reading but if the author is keeping up with consistent updates then I can get behind a chapter by chapter release. I hate getting into stories only to realize they abandoned or haven't updated in six months.
