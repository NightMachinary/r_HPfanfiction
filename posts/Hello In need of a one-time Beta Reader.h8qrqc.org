*Quick summary:* My current Beta Reader is down for the count, and can't go over my current chapter. (Has to study for Exams)

I'm not really looking for something extensive in terms of picking out plot holes or anything. I just need someone to nitpick for SPAG and weird sentences and to leave a somewhat detailed review at the end.

It's only the fourth chapter of the fic, but if you'd like, I'd appreciate it if you skimmed the first three chapters [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13595523/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Path-To-Knowledge][here]] so you can have an idea of what I need. I'm looking to get it up today, if possible.

It's only a one-time thing, so If anyone is interested please let me know ASAP and I'll link you the doc to go over.

Many thanks, cheers!


** in a most sombre -> into

of pillaging -> or

shimmering of the wards were -> was

Pettigrews -> Pettigrew's

the middle of the, -> Missing word.

since the wards... so there was -> No need for "so"

not surrounding it -> him

matt of hair -> mat

gesture, The Dark Lord -> the

the rest of British -> the rest of the British

spurned upon him -> "spurned" doesn't have a meaning that fits, maybe something like "laid" or "inflicted".

fawkes -> Fawkes

drew blank -> drew a blank

'He had stood here,' -> Since this is a quote, it would be more natural to write it as, 'He stood here'

it's voice rising -> its

overbearing on their grief -> "overbearing" doesn't have the right meaning, perhaps "intruding"

It's a somewhat interesting premise, changing who lives and how, and reinterpreting Voldemort's motives. I'm not sure how the confusion about Harry's survival would remain for long when the Portwoods were going to perform an ancestry test, though. I suppose you'll probably handle that in a later chapter.
