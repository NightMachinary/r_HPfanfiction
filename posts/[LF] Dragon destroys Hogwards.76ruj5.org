I'm looking for a story where Harry flies against a Dragon in the first round of the Tri-Wizard-Tunier. And the Dragon partially or completely destroys Hogwards. I think, it's an Angry Harry Story.


** linkffn(The Day the Dursleys Came to Hogwarts)

It's not a good fic, but I think this is the one you mean. Spoiler: The dragons are scheduled to be killed because of Lucious Malfoy and we have helpless!manipulative!Dumbledore doing nothing, Harry ends up trading the basilisk he killed instead with the helpful!Goblins.

If that rings any bells, that's the story. It's not really worth reading in my opinion though, but you can decide for yourself.

  Gently clearing his throat, the headmaster of Hogwarts had the gears in his head running at top speed to try find the best way to come out on top in this instance. "Harry,-"

  "Lord Slytherin," Hermione corrected Dumbledore.

  Dumbledore paused, surprised at being corrected by one of his students, especially this particular student who normally revered teachers. "Surely we could set aside titles while discussion this matter, yes?"

  The anger and hurt in her eyes let him know instantly that he wasn't going to make amends with her anytime soon. "No, headmaster. Titles are most important with any discussion you have with Lord Slytherin. Especially the discussion we are about to have today."

  Harry nodded while trying to keep his face blank. "Just as Hermione said, headmaster."

  The bearded older man grimaced. One of the last things he wanted to do was acknowledge Harry in his new role as the heir of one of the Four Founders of Hogwarts, but he could not see any way around it that wouldn't further damage his image among the large number of onlookers.

This is where I personally couldn't take it anymore.

*** It's honestly interesting how many people forget that Dumbledore isn't a politician and doesn't give a rat's ass about his image.

**** Dumbledore /is/ a politician, or at the very least a diplomat. Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and Supreme Mugwump of the ICW. Thats gotta require some form of political work.

I agree with the "image" part. Then again, he seems to be such a larger than life figure that he can probably afford it.

***** I would call him a political adviser at best. Those titles could be mostly ceremonial/administrative.

No way to know for sure, though.

**** He is the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and the only time we see this role in action it is held by a politician (Fudge).

However, I do agree - Dumbledore doesn't seem to be the man to care about his image too much.

  It's the day of the First Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and the last people that Harry ever expected to be there to see him before he was to face the dragon was the Dursleys, or even the other revelations that would be revealed. H/Hr. Some Draco bashing.

Harry eventually manages to kill it using a makeshift ballista, is it the one you're looking for?
