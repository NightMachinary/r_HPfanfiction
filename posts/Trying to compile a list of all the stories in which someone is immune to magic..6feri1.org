  Prophecy brings nothing but ruin, and half a prophecy is even worse. Lord Voldemort is neither fool nor weakling; he vows to break away from the prophecy's accursed magic. He is ready to defeat Albus Dumbledore at his own game. After all, Harry Potter is just a boy. AU, sort of Mentor!Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Working in the Ministry archives, Julia finds a document she really has no business seeing. When she discovers that the Muggle world is threatened by an ancient and terrifying evil, she seeks Albus Dumbledore's help. He sends her to Twelve Grimmauld Place where she has to persuade the enigmatic, troubled, and very bad-tempered Sirius Black to help save the world.
