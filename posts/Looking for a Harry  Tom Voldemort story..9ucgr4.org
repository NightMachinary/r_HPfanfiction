* Looking for a story. Harry is with Tom, & they are at a ball, can't remember if it is Malfoy's or not, but Harry is drugged w/a Liquid Imperio because people know he is impervious to the spell version. Tom feels something is wrong through their bond? If I remember correctly the person who drugged him may be one of Tom's followers

*** It might be a younger tom. all i can remember is harry being drugged with liquid imperio and dragged out of the ball room by the guy, and tom feeling what was going on through their bond.
