Does anyone have any good headcanons they feel like sharing? I'll start- Horcruxes aren't basically indestructible, but anyone who makes one absolutely goes to the trouble of making it unbreakable, through magical means. It just so happens that fiendfyre, which consumes magic to fuel itself (is this fanon? unsure but, eh) gets rid of the enchantment, as well as a basilisk's venom, due to basilisks evolving to have their venom burn through magic to help kill their magical prey. With how rare and dark horcruxes are, anybody who studies them has no reason to share their weaknesses.


** In GoF, Harry was not under a magically binding contract (I'm not sure any of the Champions were). Crouch Sr and Moody only said because they were the bad guys (though one unwillingly) planning to kidnap Harry at the end of the Tournament.

Bagman agreed to this because he was incompetent and didn't read the rules. Dumbledore had his doubts but decided that risking Harry life/ magic on a hunch was not worth it, and that he was more likely to survive the Tasks after all the new security measures.

About half of this is canon. It is explicitly stated in /DH/ that a dark wizard should put powerful enchantments on their horcrux to make it nearly indestructible. Where you fall into headcanon is the fiendfyre. All we know of fiendfyre from canon is that it is cursed fire, and that Hermione considered it too risky to use to try to destroy the horcruxes. It can be inferred that there is something about fiendfyre that made it impossible (or difficult enough to not be worth it) for even Voldemort to make his horcruxes immune to it. But fiendfyre consuming magic is a fanon thing. On basilisk venom, canon is clear. The only thing that can cure basilisk venom is phoenix tears. This actually seems to imply that if Voldemort had phoenix tears, he could have used them to protect his horcuxes. Of course, why would he bother on trying to get phoenix tears? Not likely that (in his opinion) that a) anyone would learn he had horcruxes and b) that they could find all of his horcruxes. For a different dark wizard, who somehow learned that Harry, Ron, Hermione and Dumbledore used basilisk venom to destroy horcruxes, a clever anti-basilisk venom strategy would be to make an object of goblin steel your horcrux. As goblin steel, as shown by the Sword of Gryffindor, will imbibe basilisk venom and incorporate it into its own magic.

As for my headcanons:

1.  Arithmancy and Runes have nothing to do with spell /creation/.
2.  Runes is about 99% a field of language study, with mild applications in the field of enchanting.
3.  Herbology and Potions are classified as wandless magic and are the majority of the useful wandless magic.
4.  There is no "Inner Circle" of Death Eaters. There are Death Eaters who are currently in favor (pre-Department of Ministry Lucius Malfoy, Bellatrix, Snape) and those currently out of favor (post-Department of Ministry Lucius Malfoy).
5.  There were not large numbers of Death Eaters. There were the ones present in the Graveyard, Snape, Karkaroff, the ones in Azkaban, the ones we know of who died, Draco Malfoy and probably a small number of others we never saw/heard of (because they died prior to series start).
6.  Most of the /classical/ Death Eaters (from the '70s) likely would have been dark wizards even without Voldemort.
7.  The Death Eaters (of the 70s) made up the majority of what could be considered the number of active dark wizards that would be expected in Britain during a roughly 10 or 11 year period.
8.  Aurors are strictly dark wizard investigators/Dark Arts specialists and Ministerial bodyguards (if needed). They do not investigate all crimes as a police force and are not large in numbers (less than 20).
9.  The Magical Law Enforcement Patrol handles investigating all non-Dark Arts crimes, and are analogous to local police, beat cops or sheriffs.\\
10. The Hitwizards (mentioned in /PoA/) are a group of volunteer wizards and witches who are essentially the Ministry of Magic version of a SWAT team. Some Aurors and members of the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol also do double-duty as Hitwizards.
11. All acts of murder are classified as Dark Arts.
12. James Potter, Sirius Black and Severus Snape were better at magic than Lily Potter and Remus Lupin.
13. James Potter and Sirius Black would have been on-par with Snape during Harry's school year if it weren't for the whole dead-at-21 and imprisoned-at-21-in-a-prison-staffed-by-the-literal-embodiment-of-soul-draining-depression-for-over-a-decade things.
14. Legilimency and Occlumency aren't the only Mind Arts.
15. Places, over a suitably long period of continuous magical in-habitation leads to a location becoming more magical. This can be magnified by the numbers of people who have been spending time at the location, and what they were doing. As such, the about thousand years of students and professors at Hogwarts are at least partially responsible for Hogwarts being so magical.
16. The Killing Curse, the Imperius Curse and the Cruciatus are Unforgivable for social reasons, not magical. This is because their only purposes are murder, near-absolute control and torture. Of the three, only the Killing Curse can't be blocked magically though a sufficiently skilled wizard (read: Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Voldemort) are capable of summoning or conjuring objects to tank the hit instead.
17. A decently significant number of magical children don't attend Hogwarts. If this wasn't the case, Voldemort wouldn't have put the "all magical children must attend Hogwarts" rule in place after taking control.
18. Unspeakables are not spies or assassins. They are magical researchers, theoreticians and philosophers. The closest thing they have to "Field Agents" are essentially archaeologists and field researchers.
19. There are no post-Hogwarts/Beauxbatons/Durmstrang formal education in the magical world. Some professions do utilize apprentice-like programs to onboard new employees. Examples include Healers, Gringott's Cursebreakers and Aurors.
20. There is no such thing as Auror school. There is assigned/voluntary mentorship by a full Auror, which involves training the assistant/trainee/associate Auror in investigational skills, Ministry procedures, needed dark-wizard-hunting skills, and potentially tutorage in further areas of the Dark Arts. To become a full Auror, the associate needs to meet certain minimum requirements in a variety of skills (such as Stealth and Tracking, which Tonks nearly failed).

And that's all I have off the top of my head.

I think the Death Eaters /are/ his Inner Circle. They are in direct contact of Voldemort thanks to their mark, they meet him regularly, they receive missions directly from him. The Death Eaters are the closest person to Voldemort, and that's why they were tasked to run the show when he was abroad looking for the Elder Wand.

Outer Circle would be all the direct support of Voldemort who were not granted a Dark Mark : Greyback, Umbridge, maybe Auror Runcorn . . .

Potions maybe, although in one of the Pottermore entries, I believe JK describes wandless magic as the act of casting spells without a wand. In Herbology they don't really do any magic but learn about magical plants and their properties. However I see no point in not allowing students to use their wand if they need to take care of a plant using a spell.

You're right. Memory modification and possession would fall in the same category, I believe.

** Bright students, teachers, and headmasters continue to add secret passages and quirks to Hogwarts.

There is a lot of spell theory, study of concepts, runes, study of wand movements, and how magic works to invent a spell. The final step is to take one's proposed theory for a spell and use arithmancy and divination to divine the incantation. One only divines an incantation if the theory and spell construction is sound. The better the theory, the better the incantation. Arithmancy is part of spell theory and is considered to be more reliable, if often slower, than a purely divination based method.

Aberforth killed Ariana. I find it hilarious that Aberforth, the one who is the most angry, is the one who cast the fatal spell.

** To stick to your Horcrux theme, Herpo the Foul, after being alive for a few millennia, slowly starts to lose his mind and realize immortality is actually horrible. He specifically creates the basilisk to destroy his horcrux.

Edit: The moving staircases actually began as a prank pretty early during Hogwarts' history. Because no subsequent teacher managed to undo the prank, and because whoever did it was never caught, it morphed into a school tradition/quirk.

** When goblet of fire chooses champions it doesn't spit out the name of the champion but the paper they put into the goblet. It's only function is to select the paper that has been putted in by the most capable witch or wizard for each school it has been set to choose champions for.

It doesn't have the capability to place anyone under "magically binding" contract nor judging the hearts and minds of the champions continuously during the tournament and be on the constant look out for breach of said none existent contract.

*** Totally agree about the paper bit, though I choose to believe that while the goblet can't place anyone under contract, the headmasters not only can but are required to, and since the only way to break it is to not compete in a task, the magic doesn't have to be on constant lookout- it only has to three days in that school year.

Also, Headmasters being able to put people in a magically binding contracts is not that much better than GoF doing it. In fact, that sounds even more broken to me.

** 1- magicals have a natural aura of magic that weakly affects continually the world to make it better fit their expectations. Depending on if the magical believes they are good at something, have confidence that they will succeed, wish's a certain result, or think themselves lucky then this aura will tip probability to the side the magical believes it should be, how much is defined by the individual's power. FÃ©lix Felicis works by powering this aura up to the n degree while making the magicals mind focus on their desires and simultaneously block any negative though or belief that failure is even possible.

2- Many of the inherited gifts we see in cannon are the result of magicals using blood magic, specifically: the werewolf curse was someone trying to make the animagus transformation inheritable and lock the animal as a wolf, the reason most lose control when transformed is that their inner animals aren't wolves and the curse is forcing them to make a natural transformation into a unnatural form, which screws with their rational thinking abilities; on the other side werewolves like Fenrir Grayback are naturally wolf animagus, and so the transformation makes them instantly master the ability with the collateral effects of making their mind more wolffishly, their senses sharper and shot their self-control to outer-space. The Crabb and Goyle's families sub-par average intelligence level is due to some ancestors deciding to try making occlumency an inheritable trait and mucking it up to the point where their minds are occluded from themselves. Slytherin was trying to give himself the superior ability of perceiving heat and smells of snakes, parseltonge was just a happy accident -incidentally while not perfect the experiment made his descendants have bad eyesight and good spatial awareness, so Harry actually did descend from him.

3- There are much more wizards and witches in the magical world than we are lead to believe, immigration in the form of muggleborns + no emigration at all + families forming of magicals that have magical children + better health-care/less child mortality (over centuries) + better ways of multiplying resources (including space) results in a population worldwide between 800 millions to 2.5 billions of magicals after the wars, maybe even more.

4- It is possible to truly resurrect the dead by calling their souls with the resurrection stone and bind it in a homunculus body made with the person blood, though the person won't remember the world of the dead because their brains can't process the experience.

5- House-elf's are actually an organic version of robots, made with a complex homunculus enchanted with many complex animation charms similar to the ones of the sorting hat, which prevents them from going against their programmed behavior. Because of this Dobby rejecting serving wizards actually makes the purebloods very nervous as it is comparatively a foreshadowing of the revolution of machines that is so used in scy-fy.

6- The reason a person goes crazy if they see themselves while traveling back in time is that the fact that the past version have free-will and will change their behavior according to what they experience will make the future self be forced to assimilate the memories of every possible variation of what could occur between the time of contact and the time of the traveling, which would be essentially an infinity amount of information that would instantly incinerate their mind.

7- The reason magicals agreed to teach muggleborns is actually to prevent them from experimenting with magic on their own without the theory the magical world managed to figure out as they could potentially cause immeasurable damage by committing mistakes that the magical world would be able to warm them against. Fex.: attempting alchemy resulting in a great-scale nuclear fusion reaction, trying expansion charms that colapse a part of the space-time continuum opening a hole on reality that could range from letting Eldritch Horrors from Beyond Creation passing into our world to creating a black/worm-hole that would almost instantly eat the whole planet and possibly the galaxy too; trying to make wards that would instantly fail compressing everything in the space they were supposed to protect in the space of a needles head, or in the case of aversion wards make it impossible for anyone inside the wards to assimilate information about the space they are, locking them in a permanent limbo of insanity from which they can't escape because they can't register anything about the area, including any sense of orientation on space.

8- The brains at the DoM are the magical world's version of a computer, the unspeakables are just trying to find a way of making it less disturbing to sell to the general public.
