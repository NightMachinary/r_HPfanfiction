Seen a fanfic like this awhile ago, and the author discontinued it. Was wondering if there were any others like it, finished/ almost finished/ currently being updated.

Thank you in advance üòÅüëç


** Why the fuck would Ron get bashed for that moment ?

*** Exactly. I can definitely seeing a broken relationship happening over the goblet of fire event and that summer when no one contacted Harry but not over this one.

*** Because Ron only uses Harry for his fame and money, and would probably be pissed at harry for ending his friendship with Hermione.

Also, Ron and Hermione probably worked for Dumbledore before he died. Think to when he met Ron, you think there was any reason for a family of witches and wizards to be standing outside the barrier shouting about it and being around the muggles. And Hermione always listens to authority; you think she wouldn't take the offer of more political sway through Dumbledore or the weasleys, than just being a muggleborn in a pure blood society where all she needs to do is rat out her friend.

***** It makes sense when you take in that Albus Dumbledore purposely raised harry in an abusive home to mold him to die. It says it both in the books and movies where albums admits it to snape

**** Not to mention Dumbles probably used Harry's own money to pay them off and hid his inheritance from him. No way an heir of an old family like the Potters would only have a single small vault.

***** And since he was his magical guardian may have had access to arrange a marriage contract between harry and ginny. And due to manipulations harry wouldn't care cause he is already wrapped around Mrs weasly, Ginny, and Dumbledores thumb.

Which could be considered line theft even without the marriage contract.
