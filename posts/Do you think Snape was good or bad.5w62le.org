** Umbridge levels of awful. For the most part when I judge Snape I ignore his war stuff, why? Because he wasn't doing it to be good, he was lashing out at Voldemort he wanted to take another man's wife for his own then, when he realised he set the most dangerous man on earth after her he realised he couldn't clear up his own mess so went to Dumbledore for help. It was purely selfish.

The time I believe to be the most important times to judge Snape are pre-Voldemort and in between the wars. These are the times he is who he chooses to be not who he needs to be to survive and as Dumbledore says it is our choices that define us. Lets take a moment to look at how he treats Neville. The poor boy is so terrified and bullied that Snaps is his Bogart. There is no excuse for being that cruel and petty. Now personally I think his behaviour towards Harry is disgraceful but some apologists will say that its okay because Harry's dad was a prick before James grew up. I think that's a dumb argument but ignoring that look at his reputation, he is a pathetic bulky who abuses his position to make others suffer. Unlike Umbridge who at least can pretend she's doing it for the Ministry and the good of the nation Snape is evil and cruel because he can be. Nobody MADE him become a Death Eater, he wanted the power, heck he only tries to do something about it when Lily was in danger.

In my opinion, and this might well be wrong but a lot of people ignore how much of a bully Snape is and look to blame James Potter. Being bullied at school was apparently an excuse to become a Death Eater, who knows what he did as a Death Eater. James Potter was a prat who grew up, who loved his wife and child enough that he was willing to try and fight Voldemort without a wand to buy them time to escape. Snape is easily one of the most interesting but cruel people in the series. Voldemort is the bogeyman, he is evil because he is, he's insane. Snape is real evil, the sort that actually exists in everyday life like Umbridge we all know a moody gut who feels the world owes them and lashes out. The sort of person who abuses whatever power they have simply because they can.

keeping this short:

'his war stuff' is the one of the central aspects of his character and the trajectory of his life and arc. he wasn't 'lashing out' at voldemort, he was trying to atone for his part in lily, his ex-best friend's death, by opposing voldemort and supporting the cause she supported. your view is /prodigiously/ reductive. like

#+begin_quote
  “Don't be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?”

  “Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said Snape.
#+end_quote

he didn't say 'those people had nothing to do with lily, so i don't care'

getting into word of god territory:

#+begin_quote
  He stood to gain nothing personally but the triumph of the cause Lily had believed in. He was trying to do right.

** It depends on how you look at it, he was true to the Order of the Phoenix but only really because he had a seriously weird obsession with Lily. I mean its not like he even liked Harry he just saw Lily's eyes and that is the only reason he did what he did - plus he IS the reason that they died if you remember it was Snape who told Voldemort about the prophecy to being with, even if he didn't know it at the time.

And as amazing as the revelation scene at the end was, he still treated Harry and many other students including Neville like crap for years and years, I mean Neville's biggest fear in the world was Snape in PoA. I don't think that just because he was a double agent for the "good guys" excludes all that, and it still boggles my mind that Harry named a son after him (even if it wasn't a first name) I mean yes by all means honor what he did, but to name your son after a man who literally hated you for 6 years and went out of his way to bully you just because he was a double agent and had a weird obsession with your mum. Bit stupid to me, which is why hes Albus Fredrick Potter in my head.

I mean seriously you are going to name your son after Snape after the death of Fred and Remus!

Having said that I love Snape as a character he is complex and interesting but I don't think there is much of an argument to calling him "good" after everything he did before the big revelation in DH.

*** I mean I always think that people forget that Snape needed to sell himself as a deatheater even in Hogwarts. If he wasn't seen to be biased against non Slytherin and have it out for the two chosen ones the deatheater's children would tell there parents and his loyalty would soon be questioned. That being said perhaps he did take it too far and saw Harry as a way to get back at James.

** The dude couldn't get over an obsessive crush for almost 2 decades. He was a monstrous teacher and had no business being around children much less teaching them. He instantly hated the child of his crush because he looked like her husband. He probably knew that Sirius wasn't the secret keeper before the shrieking shack episode but still didn't do anything to help get an innocent man out of jail all while he, as a death eater went free. He was horribly abusive to children for no reason besides the fact that he was a petty douche.

At one point he actively supported the blood supremacy of the Pure Bloods, which is why he went to their side to begin with despite being a half blood. It wasn't until the woman he listed after was threatened due to his own actions that he switched sides. And even then he never said his beliefs had changed. He just didn't want her, and only her, not her child or husband, spared. When Voldemort killed her Snape l turned against him. He turned traitor out of spite and lived a miserable life as a result.

He was a horrible piece of shit who spent 6 years helping to create a child who would willingly commit suicide to kill Riddle. Snape despises me as a person. Almost as much as Dumbledore does.

*** Close? He crossed that line with Neville more than once. Also the whole occlumency lessons were basically mind rape since he never said how Harry should defend himself.

And let's not forget that he is solely responsible for Sirius being still wanted after PoA.

*** That second paragraph explains why I hate Snape, as every time we see Him giving info it's "Nothing yet" or "The Dark Lord's biding his time" yet seemingly Voldemort ended up with the entire Order Play Book, Names, Faces fuck the noseless wonder probably go a Autographed poster of the entire Order Roster and a Beer cozy!

I swear Snape paid simple Lip service to Dumbledore, the entire Climax of OotP depends on the Idea that the Order couldn't beat The Ministry 6 to the Ministry, yet we learn one book later that the Order has Nigh instantaneous communication with their Patroni and we know they all have Instantaneous Travel in the Form of Appartion, so if it took the agreed 3 hours for the Thestrals to reach London, How did it take that long for everyone to get there, unless Snape sat on the info for a long while, what part of Instantaneous did I miss that requires 3 hours?

** I don't think Snape was /good/ or /bad/. For me, he sits firmly in the middle - he's a bad man, for sure, filled with petty hatred and a powerful obsession with Lily Potter, but at the same time ends up doing the "right" thing at the end (helping to defeat Voldemort).

The thing that sets Snape apart from the rest of the Order or the rest of the Death Eaters is that everything he did, he did so /on his own terms/. If anything, Snape is on his own side, and his only objective - in my mind - is seeking some kind of retribution for Lily's death, or even more so, /absolution/ for his role in destroying her life. Even when he's looking after Harry, it's only because he reminds him of Lily, and that he feels some kind of obligation to her memory - or Dumbledore exploits it, same thing really.

He's a hollow shell of a man to me, someone who's stripped away their humanity in pursuit of a single goal, some far-away aim that he's obsessed with reaching.

I think that if he could get his absolution without siding with Dumbledore or helping to defeat Voldemort, he would have done so. He often appears dissatisfied with the state of affairs (his rant at Dumbledore in HBP about not wanting to do it anymore), and that suggests to me that he'd be willing to leave it behind if it were in his interests.

*** This is under the assumption that he receives both his Hogwarts salary for teaching and money for selling potions to apothecaries and fellow Death Eaters. Such work would probably pay well, so if he wanted to go to another country and completely start over (new look/identity), he probably could have once he'd saved enough.

**** I agree that financially, he might be able to just walk away, but to me he's more concerned with the absolution of his sins - I should have phrased the original comment a little better, sorry.

The way he reacts when Harry calls him a coward at the end of HBP suggests that he wouldn't be able to just up and leave, even if he had the means. To me, the reason that he stays isn't because it's the right thing to do, but because it's the only way he can see that /might/ give him absolution.

***** I agree. His obsession with absolving his guilt definitely would have stopped him from considering leaving Britain. I think he was also concerned with what Voldemort would do if he won, though that really just be part of the agenda of having his own side and remaining alive.

** Snape is a bad guy let me list all the reasons why first he calls his best friend the equivalent of calling an African American a nigger. Second, he joins a Neo-Nazi group of his own free will straight out of school, who by the way loudly state their desire to kill all muggle-borns and blood-traitors. Third, the only reason he leaves his Neo-Nazi group because that same friend who married someone else is now being targeted by the leader of his Neo-Nazi group. Fourth, he can't bring himself to get over the fact that he and James Potter were School rivels. and takes it out on innocent 11 year old boy who just happens to have you look like his father. Fifth, he fails to warn the order in time in the fifth book so instead of capturing the death eaters without risking kids 6 kids he is responsible for nearly die and Sirius does die.

** Snape was a bad person who did both bad and good things. As Dumbledore put it, he risks his life every day to protect Harry, and ended up being invaluable to the war and the downfall of Voldemort. He did this because he knew that Dumbledore was right - the best way to honour Lily and, perhaps Snape's own way of apologizing for not protecting her (?), was to ensure that her Voldemort would never be able to kill her son, the Voldemort's original goal.

But there is a problem with all of this. Snape was an asshole to tons of students for no good reason. He mentally tormented Neville for 6-7 years. He was wholly unprofessional by showing mass preference to his own house, and was willing to verbally insult children if it meant covering for his own house. When Harry saw Snape's memories during the Occlumency lessons, Snape stops giving lessons even though learning Occlumency is vital to Harry surviving Voldemort. He was a pureblood supremacist, at least before he met Lily, and was probably one /after/ he met her, too; he did join the Death Eaters, after all.

Ultimately, I think Snape and Snape's actions are far to complex to be able to keep it as black and white as "good or bad." While I don't think he was a good guy, he wasn't completely evil either.

** He is somewhere in the middle, but leaning more towards the good side.

I think he has strong principals and knows what's right and wrong. He never felt like he truly belonged anywhere; he joined the Death Eaters to belong somewhere. He switched mostly because of Lily, but I believe that deep down he had some reservations about Death Eaters soon after joining them, and Lily's life being endangered gave him a very strong reason to help fight against Voldemort.

On the other hand he was bullying younger students and held a childhood grudge. He was extremely bitter his entire adult life, and probably had mental problems. He is far from a guy who had a rough exterior with a golden heart.

Tl;dr He is a bitter prick with a good side.
