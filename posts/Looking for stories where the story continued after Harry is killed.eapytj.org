I don't care when Harry is killed in the story, could be when he was a baby, could with the fight with Voldemort, sometime during one of his school years, later in life, I don't care, I just want the story to continue after Harry dies, the fight continues on, et cetra.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

I don't want Harry faking his death and in hiding, I want him to be actually dead in the story itself.

  Haunted by the ghost of a former student, an ex-wizard struggles to preserve magical knowledge for future generations.When Harry Potter died, twin wands' explosion wiped Europe clean of magic. Enchantment-free, Gringotts crumbled into a mass grave for goblin bodies. Pixie corpses covered the meadows. Romanians buried their last dragon.Wizards remained. Thousands flooded Muggle streets with useless chanting, unable to return home through non-existent wards.They had nothing except pride. Remember that when watching a middle-aged, redheaded waitress and her daughter taunted by children for their strange way of talking, passing the sallow-faced, somber neighbour who prefers candles to electricity, finding a sky-blue twinkle under matted hair of a homeless man.Pride was the reason they survived.
