** linkffn(8848598)

I feel I need to justify a tongue in cheek one-shot. This fic never fails to be enjoyable, its got a perfect mix of humor, serious elements, characterization, and tempo. It also really hits the nose on the particular pairing its selling.

Its followed closely by linkffn(11265467)

What if Adults Weren't Useless? The fic. Its also very entertaining.

  What happened to the Other Hermione that Harry encountered in "Shadow Walks"? As she struggles to survive, despite immense loss, in a world that no longer has a place for her, how will the reappearance of someone she'd thought she'd never see again change her life completely? Reading "Shadow Walks" first is advised. Companion piece; alternate universe.

** My favorite would be the Alexander Quick series. It's set in the HP universe but the plot is completely original anddoesn't intersect with HP canon at all. It also has a lot of very non canon world building and is set in America, but its the best thing to come out of the fandom thus far imo.

For some honorable mentions

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by santi is a classic, best harry has a twin story hands down. Unlikely this will ever finished sadly, I'd be surprised if it even updates again.

Thirding pureblood pretense, its great.

Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus is really polarizing but I love it.

Scourgify. This one may also be polarizing since its an SI but I really liked it, may or may not be abandoned. Has an SI who is Vincent Crabbes twin sister.

Also most of the writing from Taure, Newcomb, or Bellial666 is good.
