I do like reading stories where a character is raised differently then canon, however I am tired of ones that are just about Harry being raised differently.

An example would be linkffn(11230962) where Ron is raised by Clint Barton. What make this one interesting is sort of Ron reaction when coming back to the magical world and how would he act when not being surrounded by magic since childhood.
