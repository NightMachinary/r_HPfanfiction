Hey everybody, I may be confusing this fic's details with another one by the same author, but let's try anyway! So I forget what the exact start is, but near the beginning, Harry finds out that Dumbledore is taking money from his Gringotts account (and the goblin's may also be corrupt?), he get's mad, runs away, ends up in America as the best member of some Light/Task Force/Corps. He has a crush on the daughter of his boss, who has a crush on Harry Potter. People begin to find where Harry went, and he has to reveal himself to his boss, the wife of his boss, and the daughter of his boss. He does that by glowing gold or something, which I think shows that he's supposedly stronger than Merlin. He then runs around, teleporting stuff, and stuff. Sorry if this isn't very helpful, parts were coming back to me as I wrote! Thank you so much!


** I think I remember this, but I can't find it so far. As I recall, the group he's working for turns on him and he winds up, among other things, stealing the entire compound they used as a base?
