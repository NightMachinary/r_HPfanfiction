Bonus points if Hermione attempts to campaign for House-Elf rights despite the name. Extra points if Draco smoothly takes over the organization and uses it to organize a private war against "rogue" House-Elves.


** I feel like the more likely result would be that Elves would be prompted to go to war with Wizardkind.

*** War? We are talking about the same, terminally and magically bound, eager-to-serve creatures, right?

Unless it was a crackfic or wildly OC, I don't think they'd do much of anything but die, to be honest.

**** Have you forgotten how fiercely the Hogwarts Elve fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, once Kreacher roused them? Obedient doesn't mean meek. The only reason the Death Eaters didn't employ Elvish soldiers is bigotry; they utter obedience, which doesn't prevent them from being aggressive if asked to do so, would make them ideal soldiers.

***** Yeah, they were bound to the castle/Headmaster; of course elves are fierce in defense of their masters, we saw that with Winky and even Kreacher.

They were fighting for their masters, not for some abstract concept.

In the case you presented, their allegiance would have been to the castle or Headmaster.

And might I remind you that these same Hogwarts elves you are talking about are the ones that looked down on Winky for being derelict in her duty as an elf, and on Dobby for his being a "free" elf?

My point is, if the elves fought in and war, it would be at the behest of someone else, not independently.

And such a war would be ultimately disastrous for the elvish population: it would devastate their population for what is essentially a massive virtue signal, they'd die and suffer for what humans /think/ they /should/ want.
