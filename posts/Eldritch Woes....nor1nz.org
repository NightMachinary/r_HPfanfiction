Reading [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/nod2lr/daphne_greengrass_horrifying_eldritch_abomination/][this]] post got my creative juices flowing -- no, not /those/ creative juices, you dirty-minded people! ;)

Harry Potter is an Eldritch Abomination.

Sounds simple, right? Nope!

His old self, bored with everything and his fellow Entities, decided to incarnate himself as a pure, untainted mortal to experience something new before returning to be an Eldritch Abomination.

When James and Lily Potter's son died early on in the womb due to natural complications, the Abomination infused itself into the little corpse and restored it to life, with itself in the pilot seat -- little Would Have Been Harry's soul went into the afterlife peacefully, and the Abomination's nature was locked away, memories suppressed.

Abomination Harry continued to grow/develop as normal and was delivered -- in essence, a normal, healthy human baby boy, despite his origins.

Life happens. Tragedy hits Harry and his family.

In the afterlife, Lily and James are reunited with Original Harry, and they are utterly baffled -- however, they also know that what was once Abomination Harry loved them as they did he, so in essence they had two sons.

Fast forward years later, one of Harry's fellow Eldritch Abominations, one that he had flings with in the past and had numerous nightmarish spawn with (though, to them it's meaningless) had the same sort-of idea, albeit retaining her memories and nature in a mortal shell than incarnating as a human.

Perhaps she mimicked being a daughter in a family, kinda like in the prompt that inspired me here, and lived with as a dutiful daughter to experience mortal life; perhaps she possessed a stillborn child like Abomination Harry did; perhaps she stole the body of a girl, purging the soul into the Afterlife or puppeting the body as her own with the original girl's consciousness still intact, like a Goa'uld's host ("I have no mouth but I must scream").

Either way, she's having fun being a "human".

When she meets a clueless Harry during their Hogwarts years, she has suspicions almost immediately. She sleuthes around a bit, spying on him and trying to understand. People think she has a crush on him and naturally feel amused (especially the teachers and older years -- they are only eleven, after all), despite her protestations.

Another year passes, and she's sold on what/who Harry really is, and she confronts him.

Only, Harry has no idea because he's basically just a normal human now. His old nature is gone/completely submerged.

Understanding what he's done and feeling genuine horror, she resolves to and tries to, throughout the passing of the years, convince him/get him to "wake up".

Now, the first subversion: Instead of the expected Indie-Harry/Power-Wanking you see in fics, Harry does come to see the truth.

But instead of choosing to "wake up" and restore himself to his old state of being, he resists and rejects it. He's happy being a plain mortal, as that's all he's ever known. He doesn't want to go back to what he was before. And when he dies, he'll be happy to meet his parents in the Afterlife as a normal, mortal soul.

He is Harry James Potter, son of Lily Potter nee Evans and James Potter, even if he didn't start off that way.

It's like someone who had godlike power and was a psychopath with an orange and green mentality choosing to have their memories wiped, their personality killed or suppressed to the point where it's near irrecoverable, and "descending" to be a normal person. Later on, the new person finds out who they used to be and reject it wholeheartedly in favour of who they are now.

...Actually, it kinda has parallels with the original Total Recall (with Arnold S., heh) twist.

The second subversion? Harry's attracted to her as she is to him, despite initially having a reversed James and Lily Hogwarts dynamic. While she tries to convince him to "wake up", he's doing his best to convince /her/ to give up her Eldritch nature in favour of being a mortal like him.

To live a mortal life, be in love, to marry, and to have normal, mortal children -- to eventually die and pass on into the Afterlife.

And she is so, /so/ incredibly tempted.

Who will win? Who knows.

A side-story could be one or two of their Spawn discovering what their parents were up to, and they decide to stay out of it and watch at a distance for their own curiosity/amusement.

Dumbledore, Voldemort, and others are being run ragged by "Horrors Beyond Reality" causing many little fires everywhere constantly that they have to spend all their free-time extinguishing, to give Harry and, let's just say Daphne or even Katie Bell, a distraction-free playing field for their little dynamic.
