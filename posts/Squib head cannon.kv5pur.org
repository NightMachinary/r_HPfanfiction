** I mean, if you want to write a fic like that go ahead, it could be really interesting to see how it affects family relationships when one child has a legitimate reason to think their twin "stole" their magic.

But it would be an AU, none of the known squibs in Harry Potter are mentioned to be twins. Mrs Figg may have a twin sibling though it's never mentioned, but Marius Black is almost certainly not from how he is displayed on the Black family tree.

*** I wouldn't call it AU, since there is nothing in canon that contradicts it. It could be pretty much canon-compliant and feature a set of twins with one squib and one magical. There's nothing in published works that says that can't happen.

**** u/minerat27:
#+begin_quote
  What if squibs could *only* be born if they had a twin
#+end_quote

OP's prompt, emphasis mine.

A pair of twins, one magical one squib, is perfectly canon compatible, but OP was proposing a world in which /all/ squibs have magical twins.

***** Fair enough. Just skimmed over it.
