Summary:

As they ran away from Filch, the three Gryffindors found themselves trapped in a dead end, the doors ahead of them locked.

"Wet me twy!" Hermione said. "I know a speww to unwock it!" She pointed her wand at the lock. "Awo- awohamow- awohawmwa-"

"Awwoh vewa?" Ron suggested.

"Amwohamawa- fuck!" Hermione cursed.

------

AU where everything's the same except Hogwarts starts at age 6 and the kids are allowed to curse whenever the fuck they want.
