Hi! A few time ago I have site when I can search stories similar to other, it was enough to paste link to ff.net with story, then the site reported stories with a fairly similar plot, with the same paring, etc. Does anyone know it?

** In addition to what the other person posted, there's the similar bot from Hackesta, and a couple of search sites (one called FicRecs and the other is the Scryer tool on Dark Lord Potter forums).

Hackesta Bot - [[https://hpffrec.hackesta.org/]]

FicRecs - [[https://ficrecs.elusiveguy.com/]]

Scryer - [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]]

You can also just do a sub search here. Go find the reddit search bar, limit your search to this sub, then search the name or URL of the story you want similarities to and click any request posts that strike your fancy.
