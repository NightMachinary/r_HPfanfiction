I'm after a really good, preferably completed, fanfiction where harry goes back to Tom Riddle's time and eventually becomes friends with him. I read Past Player and Fate's favourite and while back and loved them but I really wish Past Player had been completed. Does anyone know of any similar stories to these? Thank you in advance


** Can you link your story? I don't know it but it sounds interesting!

I'm actually reading one right that's REALLY good but it is Fem!Harry so I'm not sure if you're in that. I really love it though because Harry gets thrown back in time and is appropriately terrified of Tom and treated like an outcast by the rest of Hogwarts for being so strange. Tom's characterization is done really well imo, hes young enough that he still has the potential to change but still Tom Riddle enough to be angry and hateful and want Harry dead just for being an inconvenience to him. She's the only one who knows what he is truly like inside and isn't fooled by the fake persona he puts on for everyone else, which is one of the reasons he starts to like her and wants to be her friend but she (true to what Harry tormented by Voldemort her whole life) wants nothing to do with him so he (true to his scheming and cunning ways) has to come up with plans to get keep her in his company while also not making it seem like he wants to be in her company. It's really funny too!

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4728995/chapters/10806773][Gilgamesh]] is probably the closest thing I know of (the story is completed, but it has incomplete sequel).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10241474/1/In-Wonderland][In Wonderland]], but here Harry comes back earlier and raises Tom (sadly neither is completed).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15873207/chapters/36982095][Ink]] (completed) is not a time travel, but it has great dynamic between Harry and Diary Tom (this is somewhat similar to another Fictionist's story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7932144/1/Solace-in-Shadows][Solace in Shadows]], which I also recommend).

  Sirius's death is what literally broke the camel's back. Harry completely loses it and demands Dumbledore to send him back in time so he can stop Riddle and save his Godfather, his parents, Cedric and countless others from being murdered.
