Something that occurred to me recently: literally all the BWL!Neville fics I've seen to date follow a pattern:

1. Neville isn't as good a BWL as Harry was in canon: a worse person, not as brave, a less effective fighter or leader, etc..
2. Harry (often In Name Only) is still the lead protagonist, and BWL!Neville is mainly a device to free up Harry become amazingly skilled (often in secret), probe the depths of magic, have amazing adventures, and generally become a greater wizard than he was in canon.

Are there stories that break this pattern? That is, are there good BWL!Neville stories that are actually about BWL!Neville, his adventures, and his growth into a hero who fulfills Trelawney's prophecy and defeats Voldemort?

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.

*** Thanks; a bit sketchy on the details and almost but not quite brave enough to diverge from canon, but it's probably the first BWL!Neville fanfic I've seen that's actually about Neville.

  Wouldn't technically any knowledgeable Harry count as "your" Neville BWL? The only problem with Harry is that he has no fucking clue what's going on with him. Neville as the BWL would instead simply have waaay more knowledge about it... That is why I personally find this request weird.
#+end_quote

I don't see how. Harry and Neville are very different people, with very different personalities (even net their upbringings). They have very different families (even assuming both are still effectively orphaned) and very different places in society. For that matter, Harry isn't exactly a paragon of human perfection with the minor flaw of being ignorant about the wizarding world at the start of canon.

I've taken a look at the fics, and they seem to be following the pattern I described: they're about Harry becoming a powerful wizard (/C'est La Vie/ being a mild exception, due to time travel making it a moot point), with BWL!Neville being portrayed in a less-than-flattering light. (At least he doesn't get bashed like he does in a lot of fics like this.)

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
