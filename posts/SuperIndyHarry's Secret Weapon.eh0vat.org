The world viewed young Harry Potter as an arrogant duelist. Gifted, yes. An incredible (almost ever growing) arsenal of spells and techniques at his disposal, despite his lack of actual duelling experience or formal training.

But he was well known for his sharp tongue, cutting jabs and barbs that he laced in between every spell he cast. Purposefully doing his darndest to wind up anyone and everyone who raised a wand against him.

But it was only in the Graveyard in 1995, when Voldemort rose again and decided to slay his impetuous nemesis, that the "Dark Side" discovered why. Not just why he was so prone to teasing and goading his opponents along in a battle, but also why he was so well versed in magic.

It was when a spell, that lanced forks of jet black lightning, leaped from Harry's wand and into the masoleum Voldemort danced behind to use as a shield. A spell the Dark Lord recognised as one of his own creation, and a spell he had shown no one in all his years.

A lull appeared in the battle as Voldemort stepped out, crimson eyes bugging as hos gaping mouth spat out his incensed, accusatory question, "Potter, where did you learn a spell like-" "I learned it from you, five spells ago." The half grin on his sweaty, bespectacled face was a little cheeky (gaze burning sith olayful determination), and what little colour existed on Voldemort's bone pale face was flushed from him.

For he'd discovered why Dumbledore was so eager to fly him out on little trips around the world for brief looks at different magical cultures and practices...

The blasted brat had adomopathy! It was Voldemort who fled the graveyard first, lest anymore of his secrets were to fall into the hands of the enemy...
