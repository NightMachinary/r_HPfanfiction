  But this of course this is could just be another plot hole JKR left in the story.
#+end_quote

JKR admitted it herself: where there are numbers, there's a fuckup.

The canon wizarding world is not a viable setting from a rational point of view, and gets worse every time Pottermore updates.

Just, like, gliss over the practicality of it, there's no point addressing it unless it involves a key part of what you're writing. My headcanon is simply that professional quidditch is actually just semi-pro and not economically viable. Which would actually be a good reason why it's so unoptimized and school aged kids are routinely good enough for national teams (Charlie, Krum) without even having to pass through the league.

Charlie never played for england. Wood says he had the potential down the line. Krum is a prodigy because he's a teenager and he /is/ playing right now.

But everybody says he could have, the Weasley, Wood, McGonagall, Hagrid, etc.

He's meant to be seen as that tier of player. And Harry is talked about in the ame breath by the way, so here comes another teenaged wonder.

***** Yeah, but in sports there's a huge difference between a prospect and a success. There are so many guys who don't make it, whether it's the pressure, injuries, experience, etc. Comparing Krum to Charlie diminishes what Krum was able to successfully. The two of them really aren't in the same category at all.

There have been sportstars who've made their breakthroughs in their teens who have gone on to become legends in their sport.

If you're an Englishman, or play cricket at all, you'd have heard the name Tendulkar at least a million times. He played for his national side when he was 16. Chang and Becker won their first Grand Slams at 17.

Also, you said it yourself, the numbers are messed up. JKR puts wizarding population at 10K, which is ridiculous. A better one (and more realistic) would be to have it at 10% of the total population. For the UK, that would be about 6 million.

****** 6mln wizards (and by extension 6-700mln worldwide) would be an extreme stretch. No way you can hide that many people no matter how many purebloods never step foot in the muggle word.

I like the idea of one wizard every two hundred muggles. So you have a 300k wizarding population, which would make pretty much everything make some degree of sense, from the small town style politics to the small businesses economy. Quidditch still wouldn't be economically viable, but then it doesn't really need to be for canon to stand. A semi-professional regime would easily allow for a proper league with a sizeable following.

If that were so there wouldn't be any need for obliviators. Besides the issue is not so much the magic as the actual physical presence of millions of people who for all intents and purposes don't exist because either they never registered on any government or private list (purebloods), or just disappeared into complete obscurity (muggleborns and muggle-raised halfbloods). Imagine if 5% of all 6th graders (assuming about half the wizarding population went to muggle primary school, which is plausible in light of muggleborns and halfbloods) every year disappeared from the education system. It would cause a massive degree of investigation. Imagine the revenue service trying to make sense of 10% of the population's worth of exchanges from and to unknown parties (the concept of unknown being essentially equivalent to criminal in the modern world of taxation). Imagine the sheer amount of food and living space that would go into feeding and housing all those wizards, what are you gonna do put a fidelius over a county's worth of land? At some point you start to need so much magical bullshittery to justify everything it stretches belief far too much.

This is the kind of thing that the SoS ought to affect primarily. Something that removes those records, and cause something similar to a muggle repelling ward - that is, when people think about it and start to wonder, the SoS intervenes and makes them forget.

Food is never a problem, since they can replicate it with magic. Same goes for living space - if there is an undetectable extension charm (something that a 17 year old can do) then there are going to be other variants that can be done on a larger scale.

Gamp's law actually says food can't be conjured. Canon is pretty bullshitty about magic's internal consistency, but food related business wouldn't make sense if you could live off magic food, whereas we see plenty of wizarding food and restaurants.

Expansion charms overtly clash with canon, since the wizarding houses and settlements we see and are told about don't work that way and there's no reason to imagine the vast majority of the setting to behave in a completely different way from literally everything we're actually shown about it.

Fuck yes it stretches belief to imagine a massive enchantment that can effectively mindwipe people by the million and and destroy physical records of years of experience yet somehow is unable to deal with momentaneous if overt episodes of magic.

But the point is that you're bending your logic backward to justify a headcanon. Hey dude you can imagine whatever you like, just don't expect other people to share your version of the wizarding world.

  Since quidditch is not really something you need to be extremely in shape to do
#+end_quote

I'm not sure where you're getting this from. Flying isn't as simple as simply sitting on a broom - each turn in flight subjects the body (both user and broom) to inertial forces. If you've ever driven a car (or a bike), you'll have noticed that it takes a bit of effort to keep the car along the line you want to go. But a civilian car is grounded and a lot more stable than a small broom in the air as the motion is 2D , and there's a lot of frictional and air drag to stabilise the car. An object in air is subject to turns in 3D, and has a lot less air drag. This means that the player does more work in order to compensate those inertial forces. There's also the fact that players usually grip their brooms with one hand and their knees, while a car driver is secured to a car much more securely.

There's also the fact that players will be flying a LOT faster than cars on the road. According to wiki, HP's Firebolt has a top speed of at least 150mph or 240kph - that's ridiculously fast. Even if the chasers and beaters (who use Cleansweep 7s, let's assume) fly around at 120-150kph (at about half the Firebolt's top speed, this seems fairly reasonable) they're still being subjected to a lot of inertial force every time they make the slightest adjustment to their flight lines.

Take the dive from the first movie (the one where HP and Higgs dive down). Assuming they're diving at 180kph (which is being extremely generous, as I do not believe that a 2 year gap can provide an increment of 30% to top speed of any product - that's just being silly), HP is subjected to about 2.5G if he pulled out of that dive in 2 seconds (which is also being rather generous, as I think the time would have been considerably less). In terms of pure energy, he spent about 40kJ in pulling out of that dive.

In comparison, Usain Bolt spent about 60kJ when he ran the world record 100m sprint in Berlin.

Note: I'm assuming HP weighs 30kg, as he is quite malnourished at 11, and has a weight lower than what can be called average for a 11 year old.

** I think it's likely that Quidditch players could have longer careers than muggle athletes. Wizards live longer in general, so it's possible that they both hit their physical prime later than we do and have a slower decline afterwards (especially if you consider the apparent superiority of magical to muggle healing).

As for the supply side of things, the pool of professional Quidditch players may not be limited to the House teams. Hogwarts may be the only notable wizarding school in the UK, but some families may send their children abroad (the Malfoys apparently considered sending Draco to Durmstrang) or keep them homeschooled (there's no canon evidence for that, but I think it makes sense given how insular and controlling some of the pureblood families are). And even among those who went to Hogwarts, it seems possible that some people with Quidditch talent wouldn't end up on the teams. Picking players is, as far as we see in the books, entirely up to the Captains, and they don't always pick just based on talent. No one else in Slytherin was going to get to be seeker, no matter how good they were, after Draco bought his way on the team, and Katie Bell warns Harry that "Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces, or letting in their friends."

Admittedly, the numbers may not add up even with those considerations. Though having too many professional Quidditch teams for the population /would/ explain why the Chudley Cannons can't find better players :p

** with a smaller population the raw talent level required for pro quidditch will be necessarily lower than with muggle pro athletes, so longer careers are possible.

add to that, magical healing means that wizard athletes have less to fear as far as injuries go, even factoring in how dangerous quidditch is. i think harry alone suffers mutiple debilitating career-ending injuries in a muggle context that just ended up being an overnight stay at the school infirmary for him

add to that, wizards age a bit slower, or have longer lives at least, so maybe their physical prime lasts longer than an equivalent muggle

maybe this stretches things out enough to make pro quidditch work

** Thank you, I mentioned this in a post last month as part of my "Rowling's numbers don't make sense" rant, and it's gratifying to see other people agree.

The only thing that would make 13 teams viable is for the wizarding population to be 1% of the Muggle population (~500k in the 1990s), which is still pushing it but much better than 3k magicals and for Hogwarts to be the most prestigious magical school in Britain, instead of the only one. Students that went missing without explanation like Sally-Anne Perks (often highlighted to humorous effect in fanon) could be explained as parents pulling their kids out of school and into a safer school nearby them when news of Harry's shenanigans emerges.

** 5.6 years is crazy short. Most rugby players or footballers would probably have 12-15 years from Academy to veteran, assuming it's not cut short by injury. Given magical medicine and longevity, it's not absurd to suggest wizard athletes last longer.

Plus, they don't need to produce basic necessities and only have the one sport. What else are they going to do?

** I just think it is one of the giant loopholes that has to do with the fact that hogwarts alone caters to all of the british magic population - you can't have that and a culture that attempts to replicate british football and have a plotline that allows for only 500 students in one year.

​

An interesting consequence is that the house teams were probably as good as the professional ones, at worst being just a tier below.

​

I'm inclined to agree that injuries are less problematic, and careers are longer - but that JKR's number game still needs vast improvement.
