*** Always nice to see Worm fans. The standard of writing is better, and even self insert/cyoa fics are better written, and clearly labelled.

Here are a couple of crossovers

*** A list of Worm fanfiction but you haven't listed the greatest AU that didn't follow canon: Go Gently?! It's a travesty D: Find it here: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/go-gently-worm-wtnv.304558/]] It's dead though, so enjoy it as it is.

** If you've read NoFP or anything in the Naruto universe, you've probably read Team 8 linkffn(2731239).

One Eye, Full of Wisdom linkffn(11016559) is (imo) a better fix fic than Team 8.

Team 7's Ascension is another "Kakashi is a functional team lead" fic, but quite a bit grittier linkffn(9948266) and its sequel is updated every week.

  In unity lies strength; each leaf is important or the beauty of the tree is lost. Some bonds, however, are difficult to forge and even harder to keep. The tide of blood nears, drums thunder, and three Genin stand tall as the world spirals into madness. [AU]

  Kakashi survived his losses in spirit as well as in body, and having learned both wisdom and intellect from his experiences, he now seeks to pass those traits on to his students. Story emphasis is on tactical fighting, mind games, adventure, and the occasional bout of humor. GenFic, no story stealing OC's or creepy romance between children. Current Arc: Naruto of the Sand.

** I like this AU of the prequel Star Wars trilogy- Obiwan dies and awakens as a Padawan again. He promptly drops out of Jedi training and the story diverges from there. Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3578757]])

This Thor MCU AU is amazing- Frigga arranges Loki's marriage to Sif after Odin falls asleep, and the story diverges from there. It's a series- the plot, the romance, and the characterization (aside from the Thor/Jane relationship being a little too perfect imho) is top notch. Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/series/32075]])

I found a Mercy Thompson fic that addresses some issues in the worldbuilding. You need to have read at least one of the books to understand it, though. Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/series/477235]])

This Thor MCU AU reminds me of Make a Wish but it's 10x funnier. Loki is a reincarnated Earth magician whose comedic villainy is as clever as it is hilarious. I routinely cry with laughter while reading it. Very long fic, not completed yet. Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/534937]])

  Post-Thor, canon-divergence. Loki doesn't survive his fall from the Bifrost and winds up reincarnated on Midgard as a mortal magician named Lucy with no memory of her previous life. Her decision-making skills have not been much improved by the transformation._____“Do I even want to know why you think I'm your missing brother?”“The similarities are startling,” Thor managed. She looked pointedly down at her chest, then back at him, her lips pursing. He knew the look in her eyes, the set of her mouth, the tension in her jaw. Oh, how he knew that sharp, angry, hard face. He could practically hear Loki hissing “You idiot” in his ear.“You deny it, then?” Hogun asked.“Seriously?” Lucy's left eye twitched slightly. “I have at no point in the last thirty years seen or experienced anything that would lead me to think I'm a dude, an alien, a god, or any combination thereof. So yeah, I'm going to have to go with denying it.”_____Irregular updates. Thanks for reading!

  Four years ago, Loki and Sif took the throne of Asgard together, and a new era of cooperation between Asgard and Earth began. Now expecting their first child, the King and Queen prepare for their last trip to Midgard before the arrival of the baby, but their plans are sent awry by the discovery of a secret SHIELD project that threatens to send both realms into open hostilities. But someone has been waiting in the far reaches of space for a chance to seize power, and with two of the most powerful realms in chaos, it's the perfect chance.

*Blue Sky* - Portal fanfic, set post-Portal 2. Only one from the fandom that I've ever read (can't remember how I came across it, now) but very enjoyable.

**** Because you sounded ... badly, and you have a history of such comments so people assumed you want to be an arse and treated you as if you were.

And while I'm at it, the “trying” in your comment (“I'm not trying to hate”) implies that despite not trying you do hate, and when people are already inclined to think of you as rude they won't stop to think that maybe it's just unfortunate wording.

****** Yes, you do. Whether or not it is intended, quite a lot of your comments are very easy to take as arrogant and/or condescending. And people do see such an attitude, regardless of whether it's really here or simply a result of a writing style.

And comments along the lines of “[you] wanted to see if people here are smart enough” (which is not a direct quote but something you did actually say using different words at least once) do not help your case because they do imply that there is a certain level of arrogance on your side. So from the perspective of those who'd downvoted you, or at least from the perspective of some of them, you are probably seen as an unpleasant person who doesn't really want to discuss anything.

Right ... the latter part of this message makes it clear: you simply are that arrogant. Maybe you don't know it yourself, but you are putting people down as you speak for whatever reason and you don't seem willing to change that. Considering that people will see this conversation, don't be surprised to get more downvotes now that the people who were doubting have something they can use to decide.

Because really, when you want to prove that you are not arrogant and condescending, throwing uncalled for proclamations that maybe other people are stupid is the last thing you'd want to do.
