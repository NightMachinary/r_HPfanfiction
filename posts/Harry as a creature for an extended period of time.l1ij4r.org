Why hello there!

I am looking for any fics that has Harry being in animal form for a longer period of time, preferably years.

I have read some and two that I enjoyed were "Charred paws and heavy coils" (might not be exactly the name but close enough) on ao3 and "breath of the inferno" on ffn.

Thank you for taking the time to recommend anything, and I mean ANYTHING, that resembles what I am looking for.


** linkffn(Instinctive Behaviour by Knife Hand): Harry leaves the Dursleys' porch as a lemur, and he's currently partway through first year and he doesn't even know he's technically a human yet.

linkffn(The Natural Animagus by wsbenge): Harry leaves the Dursleys' porch as a kneazel and doesn't become human again until he starts Hogwarts, but he at least knew he was supposed to be human.

linkffn(The Accidental Animagus by White Squirrel): Harry turns into a cat to escape the Dursleys, but he only sticks in that form for a few weeks over the course of a few paragraphs. I'm pretty sure him being an animagus gets used a lot in the rest of the story, but I don't really remember it.

linkffn(Harry Mewter by Alex Ultra): Harry becomes a Mew animagus before his third year, and he spends a lot of time in that form by the end.

linkffn(Serpents and Celestial Bronze by Levity Lirum): Harry turns into a (mostly humanoid) monster after CoS, and he stays in that form (though it's almost entirely a Percy Jackson fic, with very little of Harry Potter showing up before it was abandoned).

linkffn(Incendio by savya398): Harry is a dragon, and I'm pretty sure he mostly sticks in that form by the end.

linkao3(A Hairy Business by Vinelle): Harry is a deer. That is all.

** linkffn(13230340) Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: At some point between preschool and Hogwarts, Harry turns permanently into a dragon. No-one else seems to notice until his introduction to the Magical world.

Growing Up Kneazle: linkffn(6690487) Harry is a Kneazle animagus. He spends a long time in Animagus form before someone finds out.

Parsel: linkffn(11585513) Harry turns into a snake and lives on the Hogwarts grounds for a long time before he is rediscovered, to the point of only speaking Parseltongue for a while. Fair warning for uncomfortable conversations about human (specifically female) biology, late in the fic - specifically, awkward mentions of monthlies.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
