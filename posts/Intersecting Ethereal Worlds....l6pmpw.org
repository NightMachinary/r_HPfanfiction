Someone recently mentioned a Cthulhu crossover on here that had Harry seeing things no-one else could (Dumbledore went insane and killed himself when he got a glimpse of things).

I kinda like the idea, but...

For as long as Harry could remember, he could see and interact with things on a plane of existence that intersects with our own -- think kinda like Stephen King's The Mist with that Stargate SG-1 episode where people begin seeing bugs crawling around and inside of the walls.

Some of these entities are benevolent and friendly; some malevolent and actively hostile -- deities, abominations, mindless creatures, animals, et cetera.

At Hogwarts, despite being the Boy Who Lived. he's seen as being a little strange (which many attribute to the Killing Curse side-effect), pleasant/friendly enough, and mostly keeps to himself. Some of the things he does though confuse and baffle people, like how he side-steps nothing in a corridor, or how his attention frequently wanders but somehow he knows what's being said (such as a teacher's lecture).

The only real trouble he gets in is when he's caught wandering the Forbidden Forest, but the professors have no idea how he's always unharmed.

The centaurs find him strange and intriguing, but something around him makes them uneasy, so they tend to just watch him at a distance as he does his strange things; Acromantulas actively avoid him, fleeing on sight in terror.

Unicorns are at ease around him, though he finds it a bit annoying when he attracts a herd like a wet, hard-boiled candy does dirt on a carpet.

Two further thoughts:

Luna arrives at Hogwarts, and she completely amazed that he sees the things she does. When they begin to talk about things they both can see and interact with despite never having even seen each other before, the professors and other students become much more interested...

Or...

Out of the blue, someone in Harry's year begins to see the same shit he does. It could be anyone from a Daphne Greengrass to Katie Bell. After realizing, people are confused when Harry takes an active interest in befriending someone -- something that he's never actively tried before.

Dumbledore becomes amazed and horrified when he learns the truth -- especially when Harry casually chills and talks with beings that were thought as gods in antiquity.

(Harry having an argument with a maternal Aphrodite about finding a girlfriend, but his protesting he's only like eleven could be funny. The Shade of Tom Riddle trying to awaken the basilisk in the Chamber, only to find out that it's too terrified to poke its head out of its statue den or is just gone would be hilarious -- never mind that Jormungandr's head is currently half-extricated in the Black Lake, looking on with amusement).

Causal, slice-of-life stuff -- humour? Crack? I dunno.

Yeah, I'm rambling a bit, sorry -- I'm on painkillers at the moment. So, yeah. This was a thing.


** Casual Cthulhu is definitely a genre we need more of. "Is there a monster under your bed? Befriend it, for the tentacles are many and hard to clean unless you provide a fluffy towel."

*** The cosmic horror/Cthulhu genre has so much potential outside of strictly horrible things. it could be a sitcom, but with eldritch gods killing bllions to get icecream, or something equally absurd.

**** Oh, it's a thing. I mean, there's literally a tabletop RPG called 'Cat-thulhu' and there's a few video games and books around that look at the beauty of the cosmos instead of the horror. Just not so much a thing in this fandom is all. The closest we've got is 'It's the end of the world aa we know it' by Quartermass, but even that's not quite there.

  (Dumbledore bashing! Lovecraft Lite!) Exploring the Dursleys' attic led Harry to discovering a few hard truths. His mother is alive and well. She has been imprisoned for years. Oh, and did we mention she's none other than the Crawling Chaos, Nyarlathotep? Watch out, Magical Britain! Sanity's going bye-bye with this Outer God and her son...

** I think I read one where Luna is descended from the deep ones and all of the nargles and things were eldritch horrors. She cast a spell to let her bullies see what she saw for a few minutes to teach them a lesson.

  Some people can only be pushed so far. Luna will take a lot, but it's best not to insult her mother.
