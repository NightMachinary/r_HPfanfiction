Hi,

I'm looking for fics where Harry is recovering from a grave, near death wound, potentially marking him forever (scar or the like) given from either the aftermath of a fight with Voldemort (leading to his defeat) or him being kidnapped and tortured.

Harry would be coping with the aftermath of his ordeal and trying to hide how much he's hurt (with success or not) and his friends would help him the best the can.

Bonus points if it's consequences from Voldemort demise (either battle of kidnapping). I wanted to find more stories like "The Fight for Harry's Life" linkffn(5807920) and its unfortunately unfinished sequel "Recovery" linkffn(6532715).

Thanks


** linkffn(ectomancer) fits that criteria and is quite a ride. Sadly, it remains incomplete.

  Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.

** Linkffn(What it Comes Down To by Greycie) fits your criteria but goes to some dark places and has some smut towards the end.

** This story fits half your criteria. It's an AU of PoA where Wormtail decides to take matters in his own hands when Sirius escaped Azkaban. It's a rather new ongoing story but is very promising. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12940130/1/Grim]])

** Linkffn(imprisoned realm by lovehp)

While it doesn't exactly fit your criteria. It deals with 1 Harry being transported into a horrible dimension and deals with some nasty shit and the original Harry from that dimension dealing with a lot of shit.

There is a bit of recovery and dealing with trauma.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? This is a very dark fic. Warnings within. A/N: Currently editing fic.
