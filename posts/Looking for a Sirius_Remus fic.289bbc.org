Awhile ago I read this pretty good fanfic and I want to read it again but I cant find it, it could have been deleted but I'm unsure. It starts off with Sirius in the hospital, he is taken to another room and meets Remus who is very wolfy and i think has a magical eye. they fight. eventually they are taken back to this manor where Sirius is introduced to a lot of new characters. All of the characters have some sort of specific "power" or oddity, there is a ghost named Casper I believe but that's about all I remember.

I know that's not much to go on but any help is appreciated.


** I've stumbled upon a fic whose summary sounds sort of similar. Does it have a Narnia kind of door thingo?
