** The Resonance Trilogy (Resonance, Revolution, Resolution) by GreenGecko is one of the best series I have read in a while.

Each book is 150,000 words long, and the first two are complete, while the last one is supposedly missing 2 chapters that don't look like they'll ever be added. However, everything is reasonably wrapped up by then so it's not too annoying.

Harry is powerful without being OP or annoying, and is still quite challenged. There's also a quite refreshing spin on magic; the author does some really interesting things.

Yes, it is mentor!Snape -- [[/spoiler][Snape adopts Harry at the beginning of book 1]] -- but it avoids the common pit falls of 'Severitus'. Their relationship is characterized as more even than a father/son dynamic would suggest (as Harry is of-age in the fic).

I would wholeheartedly recommend this. It's even better Severitus than I saw in the Like No Other trilogy

*** Which was pretty good... sadly I've given up hope that series will ever be finished.

**** It likely won't be, but on the authors blog there are a couple additional chapters that didn't make their way to FF and out did seem to be winding down.

***** Very sad, it had a lot of promise. True she went overboard on the angst and was very verbose to some parts of the story, but there was a great deal of story there to play out. I'll see if I can find those chapters, would at least give me something to sink my teeth into.

** It is a great series, just remember it's incomplete and considered abandoned. It is SO worth the read though, so don't let that discourage you. You can tell it's approaching an ending (or at least it felt that way to me), so it's not like you're left in the middle of the plot.

*** The author said she wanted two more chapters, so it's barely incomplete.
