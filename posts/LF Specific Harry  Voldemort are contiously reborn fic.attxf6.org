  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (slightly crack AU w/ some seriousness) MoD!Harry, kinda soulmates!TMRHP SLASH M/M

  Harry Potter, Master of Death, was reborn fifty-one times with his soulmate Tom Riddle in various eras and universes. After a millennia of absurdity and amusement, they've finally returned to their first life. And this time, Harry's ready to make the most of it.Chaos shall reign supreme.

*** His Twenty-Eighth Life by Lomonaaeren linkffn(12597395) is good and fits this description, but like pretty much all Lomonaaeren works (imo) is fairly slash-focused.

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.
