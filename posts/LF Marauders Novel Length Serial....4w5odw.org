need more of this universe, so looking for recommendations of the best Marauder era hogwarts adventures.


** linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5) is pretty much considered /THE/ fic for that time period. Sadly incomplete, and seems to be abandoned. Still long as all hell. I saw a picture of it printed out. Shit was thicker than any one of my Organic Chem textbooks.

  3 years after Hogwarts, James and Lily are back with old and new friends by their side. Their lives are motivated by fear, their world surrounded by immense danger. As they each fight for their lives and for their loved ones in a world centered around Voldemort, the struggle to survive the war against him is nothing compared to the struggle to survive the wars within themselves.

*** Might have been me, haha. I recommend this fic every time someone asks for Marauder-era ones.

Fictionalley has a lot of really good fics, although I doubt anything new has been added in years.

** This one is decent, I read it ages ago. Tells the story of the Marauders from Remus POV. Give it a try! linkffn(1769213)

Although not really a story, it was still fun enough to read linkffn(4207913) . Need to get used to the formatting though.

  Inside this story you will find the chronicles of the 7 years of torture the staff of Hogwarts had to endure, from their point of view, due to 4 boys. That's right. None other than James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew.

  Twenty years before Harry Potter entered Hogwarts for the first time, four young men had made that self-same journey. Twenty years before Harry Potter there were the Marauders. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. This is their story. Post HBP. Complete.
