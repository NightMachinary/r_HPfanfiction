I couldn't stop reading this fic and now I really want more good Slytherin Harry fics - really loved how they covered the politics of the wizarding world. Also really enjoyed the use of Dark Wizard Harry and the friendships between the slytherins


** I loved Evitative! Also thank you for posting this because it reminded me that the author was planning a sequel and I just discovered that they posted the first chapter!

Not a Slytherin Harry story, but if you're interested in really good stories that flesh out the characters and relationships of Slytherin then I cannot recommend linkao3(Six Pomegranate Seeds) enough. It's technically (without giving too much away) a Hermione in Slytherin story.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path.

** How good is it. I've been eyeballing but I'm so tired of political dark Harry fics so I'm hesitant
