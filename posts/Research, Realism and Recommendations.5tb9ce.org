** This seems to be set in 1996. Harry has a cell phone and is casually sending and receiving SMS messages. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_9000_Communicator][This]] is the sort of cell phone you could buy in 1996. Unless Harry is a technophile, he's not going to have a cell phone, and he's even less likely to use text messaging -- it existed, but carriers tended not to support it very well until 1999.

If Harry had a cell phone, by canon it wouldn't have functioned in Hogwarts.

Remus swears a /lot/ in this. In canon, I don't think he ever swore. He equivocates Death Eaters and Slytherins; in canon, he seemed like a fair and unbiased teacher. The personality you're using for him is better suited for Sirius. There's a lot of swearing and crudity in the story in general, a lot more than in canon. There's nothing wrong with swearing, but it's a deviation from canon personalities with no explanation.

You /can/ explain these things, but you didn't, so it looks like you either are unfamiliar with the source material or decided to change it for the sake of making it more like your life. You can tell that story, but you won't get nearly as much attention or appreciation as if you chose changes for the sake of a plot.

You want a comma or semicolon, since Sirius was dead by the start of sixth year. As written, it looks like: the story is in an AU which departs from canon in sixth year, and Sirius lives. You might alternatively plan to resurrect Sirius from his veily grave.

You also have a lot of grammar errors. Did you proofread before posting?

** Sadly, any authors' works that I have read that are exceptionally realistic tend to start to blend into the nit-picky area, and get boring very quickly. I would recommend not going overboard trying to make it realistic, but that may be just me. Anyhow, your story sounds good so thanks for posting it.

** Remus did not place two pieces of toast into the toaster. He put two slices of bread into the toaster, which caused the bread to become toast.
