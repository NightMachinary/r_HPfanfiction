:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I'm looking for this fic where in second year when malfoy used the snake summoning charm, he summoned his own snake from malfoy manner, harry wqs going to speak parseltongue but malfoy stopped him when he heard him first start hissing. They become friends after a bit and start studying together in an abandoned classroom and slowly their individual friend groups join them but this is all kept a secret from everyone else. It's also a series starting from second year up or at least it's a looong fic that includes the next books as well. I know when they get to fourth year the group is helping harry through the tournament and harry uses parseltongue and a wyvern to get the golden egg. I dont remember if their was a ship or just really close friendship...
