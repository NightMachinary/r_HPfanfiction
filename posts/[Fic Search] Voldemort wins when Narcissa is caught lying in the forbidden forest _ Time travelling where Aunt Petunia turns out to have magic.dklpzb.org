Looking for two fics, which might actually be one fic, I'm afraid I don't super remember.

In one of them, Voldemort wins when Narcissa is caught lying in the forbidden forest, when he makes her check if Harry is properly dead. Bellatrix suspects her so she checks for herself, finds out she's lying. For some reason, Ginny is then brought into the clearing and Harry makes some sort of deal where he isn't killed but ends up controlled by Voldemort. The rest of the fic mostly takes place years later, Ginny is forcibly married to Blaise Zabini but is taking some sort of potion to prevent him from being attracted to her.

The other one, which might actually be the end of the first one, involves time travelling to fix the past, Aunt Petunia is involved and in the climax of the fic she turns out to have some latent magical ability and saves the day. This last scene might take place in the shrieking shack?

I read both originally on Mugglenet but I haven't been on that site in years and have no idea how to navigate it now.
