Muggle concepts like science and equality have thoroughly infiltrated the magical world. Magitech is common in all magical homes. More, and more powerful, spells are being invented every year. Millions of galleons are being spent on mingling with muggles, and things like "stopping climate change" and "ending world hunger". Old rituals are being labeled ineffective, replaced by more "scientific" ones. The Wizarding village recently founded on Pluto, whose failure was supposed to finally show the arrogance and foolishness of the progressives, has instead become a resounding success. Worst of all, a Mudblood has been elected minister.

Lucius Malfoy, the last bastion of the Pureblood government in exile, had one last desperate gamble remaining to try and make things right. He was going to travel back in time to 1991, and ensure His Lord's deserved victory.


** Not to that extent but NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series relies on that a lot. In the story there are significant developments in magic explained by magiscience (?... I guess) to the point that many of the characters are on par with Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald if not stronger. Also wizards visit the moon. Also the Statute of Secrecy is abolished but it becomes less and less of a significant plotpoint as the story progresses.

*** Did you even read the end of the prompt? It's a reversal of time travel fix it. Instead of "things go horribly wrong and the good guys go back in time to fix them", it goes "things go so well (taken to an extreme), and the bad guys go back to undo that".
