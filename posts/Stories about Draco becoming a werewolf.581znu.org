What the title says, any stories about Draco dealing with the fallout of being bitten, like being thrown out of the family, shunned by his peers and ends up becoming a better person?


** linkffn(Black Bond by CentaurPrincess)

it's not entirely what youre looking for but you'll enjoy it and Draco does get bitten and is learning to deal with it.

Hope you enjoy it.

** I don't know any fanfic stories of the sort, but there's this fan theory for canon, that [[http://www.dracomalfoyisawerewolf.com/][Draco was a werewolf rather than a Death Eater.]]

JK Rowling's debunked the theory, mind, but most of it is actually pretty sound.

*** It's as sound as Weasley/Dumbledore manipulation theory.

I liked how Draco's relationship with his father was portrayed. Ginny's characterisation is bad, though.

  In a world where Voldemort has assumed a dictatorship across Wizarding Britain and Harry has died, his remaining allies struggle to survive. Five years later, Ginny Weasley finds herself facing new struggles in the form of an exiled Draco Malfoy. What she doesn't realise is these struggles could lead to something so much more... AU. Rated T for sexual themes and violence.
