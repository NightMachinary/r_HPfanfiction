I'm almost positive the story I'm looking for was a one-shot, but it's a Harry/Hermione and accidental pregnancy. Harry takes her to Sirius, who agrees to marry her. I think it was because the sex between Harry & Hermione was a one-time thing and he was with Ginny.

I remember wanting to read more to the premise and being disappointed that there wasn't any, that's why I think it was a one-shot.

I'd like to read it again, but can't seem to find it. Any help is appreciated.
