It was a oneshot or twoshot. They kidnapped her because they were paranoid about all the things that could hurt her. In the end she gives up trying to leave and Harry and Ron stay with her

  A Triocentric oneshot quite unlike any you've ever read before. I hope. I put genre 2 as hurt/comfort. I was aiming for suspense or horror but don't think I quite got there. Also they don't have a trio option in the character drop down so it's under Hr/h.
