** I always did find it very problematic that Hogwarts tuition had already been paid since Harry birth even if it was done if Something happened to his parents. First Harry could have chosen to go to other school like Dumstrang Institute. Secondarily it pose the problem of Hogwarts not fulfilling their education contract with the DADA poor employment decisions of the Headmaster.

Post Scripton : The present remark is valid only for most of the fanfictions, as Hogwarts is paid by the Ministry, proving that the school is not as independent from the Government as the founders wanted it to be. But one could say that the mandatory books price can be considered as tuition expense, and one could say that Gilderoy Lockhart books expense could have been in contradiction with the philosophy of educational expenditure in books guarranted by Hogwarts prestige.

Hogwarts isn't a private school - it's funded by the ministry, presumably by the wizarding society more widely through taxation, assuming JKR was drawing from familiarity with the UK's education system.

She clearly borrowed some things from the conceptual public school - not least the boarding aspect of it - but chose not to include the concept of fees, because the idea that people should pay privately to be educated is quite rightly appalling to the majority of the people in the UK.

Or if you only take the books as canon, she chose not to include them because she was writing an adventure story for children, not a detailed treatise on fictional economics. It's reasonable, going by what's in the books, to assume that Hogwarts is an elite private school and to infer that free schools also exist. You could also equally well assume from the books that Hogwarts is the only school, and that those who can pay do pay.

And even if the concept of paying for education were appalling to most UK citizens then so what? It's also appalling to most UK citizens that a government could be so disgusting as the magical one portrayed in the book. Rowling doesn't shy away from showing us some appalling things, so I can't accept that the school has no fees for that reason.

#+begin_quote
  *`My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but I realised. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters ‐ and many of them are almost as terrible as he ‐ were still at large, angry, desperate and violent.* And I had to make my decision, too, with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone for ever?

  No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure, too, knowing him as I have done, that *he would not rest until he killed you.*

  *`I knew that Voldemortʹs knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power.*

  *`But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated ‐ to his cost.* I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your motherʹs blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.ʹ

  `She doesnʹt love me,ʹ said Harry at once. `She doesnʹt give a damn ‐

  `But she took you,ʹ Dumbledore cut across him. `She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your motherʹs sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.ʹ

  `I still donʹt '

  `*While you can still call home the place where your motherʹs blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort.* He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, whilst you are there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. *She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.ʹ*

That is the crucial line. Because Harry could have been a lot better than badly abused if Dumbledore had simply told Petunia that any harm Harry would suffer from her or her family's harm would be returned to Dudley tenfold. And before you argue about coercion or anything the like, if the Dursleys had acted lawfully and simply kept Harry like a normal child, nothing would have happened to them. It would only cause harm if they chose to abuse Harry (which they did). Hell, by British law they'd deserve 14 years each, and the most crucial law they violated dates back to 1933.

Better horribly abused than pampered is what Dumbledore says there. If you kept any prisoner in such a cupboard, you'd be tried for inhumane treatment. Harry appears malnutritioned in the chapter he is introduced in PS. They stood by while Marge unleashed her dogs on him. Physical violence, at least the odd beating, was common enough for Harry AND Dudley that Harry did not find it surprising when Vernon struck Dudley in the same book. Petunia tried to crave his skull in with a frying pan (that would happen if her swing connects).

Even after acknowledging the situation, he did not consider child abuse something where he'd have to step in. And in my book, that is one sign of being evil.

  because he saw what being pampered did to Dudley
#+end_quote

Is there any evidence of Dumbledore actually ever seeing Dudley before HBP? Because that conversation is taking place at the end of OotP and Dumbledore makes it sound as if he had never laid eyes on Number 4 after November 1st 1981. I think that scene was referring to Malfoy rather than Dudley.

And I never claimed that Dumbledore set the Dursleys up for humility, but rather that he welcomed the abuse because at least Harry was not pampered. Whatever he later does in HBP is irrelevant at that point. The fact that he did not go full "Gandalf vs Grima" on the Dursleys as soon as he found out is enough to condemn him in my eyes. Nevermind the fact that it took him ten years to notice. Or the whole mess with Sirius (let the children break a dozen laws, why should I do anything?).

And what little he did in HBP certainly consists as abuse of muggle artefacts and petty assault rather than anything which would have actually helped the situation.

He claims to have watched Harry Extremly closely, so him missing Dudley is very unlikely.

#+begin_quote
  `Is there a defence? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have ‐ and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined ‐ not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands.

Saying he welcomed the Abuse when he clearly asked the Dursleys to treat him like Family and care for him is wrong.

************* Yet he did not lift one finger to intervene. Not when Harry was starved, beaten (not black and blue as fanon loves to imply, but physical violence is canonical) or kept in a closet while there were two bedrooms available. Not when Marge set her dog on him. He was not there. And yet he claims to have watched closely. I rest my case.

***** "Reader interpretation and critical thinking doesn't matter."

It doesn't matter what he says its his actions that mean something. Dumbledore doesn't pass the refrigerator test and it's things like that which allow for HP Fanfiction to last for so long or to be made in the first place.

******* He starts off phrasing it as a possible argument using an interpretation of the texts, he then uses his interpretation with hyperbole

You, then just put in a quote saying "No No that's wrong he doesn't say that." Even though the content of the quote supports his fanfiction theory.

What is not said is just as important as what is in writing.

We assume Harry would be treated very well if he grew up in the wizarding world yet Dumbledore chose to keep him safe with his horrible relatives that he knew were not the best. Its not mental gymnastics to say Albus Dumbledore would prefer "Harry abused rather than pampered like Malfoy" Based on the quote you gave.

Edit: Granted that Harry is safe from death/ Voldemort, until he can complete the prophecy.

******** What Hellstrike said isn't even ambiguous, he argues that Dumblesore's explanation was evil, when it undeniably wasn't.

And no, the quote I gave clearly shows Dumbledore explaining that he chose the Dursleys purely for Harry's safety. You may believe for some reason that this isn't the full truth, but that is not what the text shows.

And I am not gonna argue about Dumbldore's Intentions, that discussion has been done a thousand times already.
