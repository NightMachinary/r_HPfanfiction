As the title says, I'm looking for a story where Harry has a different parentage. I'm fine with Lily being or not being his mother, but I don't want his father to be either James or Snape.

No slash either.

** Do crossovers count? I remember one where Harry was Smaug's son(yes, Harry is a dragon in this one). Many others have him being the child of a god/goddess.

Some have him being reborn as a Black, but he was at some point in time James's kid.

  Two people struck with frustration search out a way to relax. All starts from there. This is a sketch of a beginning to a story. It's finished and intended to spark your imagination! AU James Potter is not Harry's father Links to stories inspired by this one in my profile!

  Sometimes people take actions or do things because they are unaware of the possible consequences. Sometimes they do because of those possible consequences. Sometimes even despite the possible consequences. But all of the time if they don't want to run forever they have to cope with those consequences. Started during NaNoWriMo2019 read "One Night Stand" first.

** I love those kinds of fics!

The only one I can think of, that you have not mentioned, is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4947538?show_comments=true&view_full_work=true#comments][The Best Mistakes]] . There is also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4431766/1/Harry-Black][Harry Black]] , not exactly what you are looking for, but Ill still link it (Harry is raised as Sirius's son, but he is actually a Potter. Lily and James live ) .

Oh, and, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13560272/1/Dandelion-Wine][Dandelion Wine]] - WIP, no slash YET, femHarry, Malfoys

*** There are, actually, quite a few fics, where Harry is a Malfoy. But most of them have either only a couple of chapters, or are of a poor quality.

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/21403696/chapters/50992021][How Like Hatred]] is not bad, but its waaay to short (its complete though)

** The only one that I can think of that sets Harry as not Snape's or James' child is a slash FF. It essentially goes with the plot premise that Lily/Sirius were lovers prior to Lily/James, and during a moment of weakness or something Lily and Sirius fuck, and here comes Harry! (Minor Chapter 1 spoiler I think) Except only Lily and James know, because James offers to "blood adopt" or something Harry so no one knows that the kid is Sirius' to protect Sirius or something, I don't really recall the reasoning.

The plot itself was interesting, but the author unfortunately smothered the later part of the story and the sequel with excessive smut. (Like, not to the point of excessive slash smut, but excessive smut. If this wasn't slash, you'd still go "That's a lot of smut.")

Anyways, the story was linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/The-Black-Heir]])

â€‹

Also, if you don't mind me asking, why are you looking for this specific circumstance? Usually people look for being raised by Snape, Sirius, Remus, McGonnagal (I don't know how to spell her name, damnit.), Dumbledore, actually not a bitch Petunia, etc.

Also, not being Lily's child would be an admittedly interesting premise. I wonder what plot point it would be raising for that starting premise?
