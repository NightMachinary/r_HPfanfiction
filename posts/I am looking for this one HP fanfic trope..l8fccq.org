I am looking for a decent fic where Harry wakes up/reincarnates into the 'real world' where the Harry Potter franchise is pure fiction. I do not mind short fics - just maybe >10k words will be okay. I am just curious to see how writers would illustrate Harry finding 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' in the book shop one day.


** lol if u find something like this let me know

** There is one where the author is a huge fan of Draco and she's talking about her life when Draco somehow lands up in the real world (as a ferret, maybe?). She takes care of him and when the spell fades, shows him around and explains to him about the HP series. Meanwhile, Harry, Ron, Hermione somehow come into the real world and find Draco and they all go back. I read this a long time ago and I remember it very vaguely. However, the writing was hilarious!

** linkffn(The Girl of Steel and the Silver Speedster by mysteryman10000) and linkffn(The Lightning-Struck Soldier by TheUnHolySmirk) both do this...kind of. In both of them, the "real world" is the Supergirl world, and the other characters in story tend to have bigger reactions to finding out that Harry Potter is real than Harry dies to finding out there are books about him.

  Supergirl is a hero. A beacon of hope for the people of National City and the world. But when tragedy strikes, she learns that her heart isn't as unbreakable as the rest of her. In her darkest hour, when she questions her very humanity, who will be the hero that saves her? Will the darkest speedster in the multiverse be the light of hope for Kara Danvers? Can they save each other?

  He handed Alex the book so she could read the gold lettering stamped into the top of the front cover, The Lightning-Struck Soldier. Below a minimalistic cartoon of a cupboard door was the name "HJ Granger". / Alex felt weak in the knees. "Hermione Granger wrote this?" / Harry smiled. "Best woman I ever knew. Bit barmy at times, though."
