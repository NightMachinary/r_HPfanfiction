The Harry Potter fandom has over 800,000 fics on FFN and another 200,000 on ao3, but for some goddamn reason, I keep ending up falling in ships that only have 300 fics! THREE otps and ALL of them are rare-pairs!

Why do I do this to myself?!?!? üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

***** Perhaps Fem!Ron is an ugly duckling who only later grows beautiful, and thus is terribly insecure ?

Ginny still exists, the younger child, an accidental child, but still deeply cherished. Fem!Ron can't even be the only Weasley daughter.

Thinking Fem!Ron is a copy of Ginny is foolish.

*** I don't know why, but at some point in 2018 I spontaneously started on a Delphini/Hermione fic, and I just refuse to think of any other pairings for her besides the time I tried a HP/RWBY crossover and had Delphini/Blake. I don't even like femslash, but the dynamics between a xenophobic young dark lady and a highly intelligent SJW-esque minority are just too good.

I've tried brainstorming on Harry/Delphini, but it just doesn't seem to come to me. Partially because they're quite closely related, but mostly because I don't can't think of a reason for her to be interested in Harry without devolving into obsession tropes.

Granted, I generally try to have romance be a pretty minor thing that's loosely connected to the plot whenever I try writing, so that might be part of the reason.

** Whilst my favourite pairing (Harry/Daphne) is fairly common and popular, many of the other pairings I really like are sadly quite rare.

This includes Harry/Astoria, Harry/Lilith Moon, Harry/Pansy (its becoming more popular, but not by much), Harry/fem!Draco, Harry/Tracey, Harry/Delphini (Preferably with Delphini around Harry's age), and Harry/Flora/Hestia (or any combo of the three).

I think its obvious that I quite like Harry & Slytherin girl stuff.

#+begin_quote
  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.
