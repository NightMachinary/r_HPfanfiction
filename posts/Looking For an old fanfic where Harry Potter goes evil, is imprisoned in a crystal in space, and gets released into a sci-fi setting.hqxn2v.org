I read something like this a long time ago, and I can't find it again. In the first chapter, Harry turns into an evil wizard and everyone else bands together and traps him inside some sort of crystal. They send that off into space, and then there's a big time skip.

Some ridiculous time later, the crystal gets picked up by some research spaceship and they break Harry out of the crystal while they're zapping it with a laser. Somehow there's a big battle and he takes over command of the ship.

The rest of the story goes on with Harry in command of his ship and getting into trouble. At some point, he returns to Earth and gets one of his eyes stolen from him. I don't think the story was finished when I read it, but I have no idea what's happened to it since then.

It was a pretty dark and serious story, and I can't remember what the sci-fi setting was. It might have been a crossover, but I'm not sure.

There was a search for this quite a while ago. I assume its the same story?

*** Yeah, that looks right. Any idea where I can find it now? It doesn't seem to be on FictionHunt or Webnovel anymore. It seems there are also scrubbed and full versions out there.

** The fic you're thinking of is "The Star Empire" by RahXephon. It has since been taken down.

It had incredible space combat, which is why I enjoyed it so much, but it was fucking DARK. There's definitely at least one scene where harry rapes a woman (a rival pirate captain.) And I think he also does so with the reincarnation of his mother. It was profoundly fucked up.
