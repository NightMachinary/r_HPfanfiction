I'm addicted to incredibly long stories. I just got caught up with all four (current) books of The Pureblood Pretense and to say it's incredible is an extraordinary understatement. One of the things that I love most is the attention to detail because each book is SOOOOO LONG! Not only do you get to enjoy it for longer, a long story generally means better world building and insight into characters.

So what are your favorite MONSTROUSLY LONG stories???

** A long story I recommend is the “Sacrifices Arc” seven-book series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]], which starts with the book [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][/Saving Connor/]]. At around 3 million words, the series goes very deep into world-building, scene-setting, and side characters, and it wrapped up every plot point I cared about by the end. I enjoyed it enough to finish it. The length is not perfect, however -- when I tried to reread it later, I gave up around book four because I felt the story was moving too slowly and getting tedious.

** Most fics mentioned here I did not make it through. They become stale and boring after ~500k words. But I have a 1.800.000 word fic I have read multiple times and that is still updated regularly:

Linkffn(9443327)

I am not big into Marvel but still absolutely adore the story. It always stays interesting and is one of the few HP fics with some space travel. But I have heard from multiple others who are deep into Marvel, not just the movies, that they love how many of the more obscure characters are used in the story.

The author also has multiple other fics that are pretty long.

** Thought of another great, long series: linkffn(11591125) First fic is pre-Hogwarts, the author currently goes through 3rd year. The premise is that Harry tries to be 'normal' to please the Dursley's, so that they'd treat him more like a son. It sort of works, and he's treated better, but the Dursley's still don't really love him. Interesting worldbuilding, Harry learns about traditional pagan religious beliefs in the wizarding world.

**** The author doesn't start posting until she's done with the fic. And it sounds like she's mostly done with book 4:

"How close am I to finishing, I hear you ask? (In my mind, at least...) Well, that's the bad news, I still have a lot to go. BUT I'm a lot /closer/ to being finished, and I'd say I'm comfortably over half done, perhaps around two thirds. All the major events are plotted out; I know where this fic is going, and I know how it's going to end. I also know it's going to need ten more chapters to get that all down with the lavish detail I enjoy writing. Y'all want a really long story, right? (If not, you might be disappointed...)

I won't rest on my laurels and I'll continue to try and keep up the pace now I've built some good daily writing habits over the past two months of frenetic writing."

So hopefully we'll see book 4 come out in the next few months--remember to follow the author on ffn.

** With its cast of entirely OC's and its unique take on Magical America, the Alexandra Quick series, linkffn(3964606), barely counts as a fanfiction at this point. But it currently stands at around 1.2 million words, which is already longer than the Harry Potter series, and there's still another ~110,000 words of book 5 that have been written but not yet released. Depending on the length of book 6 & 7 when they are eventually finished, the series could end up being close to 2 million words.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11269078/1/To-Be-a-Slytherin][To be a Slytherin]] is really, really long, despite skipping Year 2 and 3. It's about Harry's sightly dark-ish Slytherin twin sister Lorena and her adventures. I haven't finished it yet but so far so good. Also, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929][The debt of time]] is quite controversial in this community but I adore it regardless. It's a Hermione/Sirius romance that starts during the war when she brings him back from the Ark and continues when she is thrown back in time to the Marauders' past and adopted by James Potter's parents as his sister. The story is rich and interesting and the romance is very well written. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7453087/1/Pride-of-Time][Pride of time]] is a very realistic take on a Hermione/Severus ship. It all begins when she comes back in time to his younger years. But the story also tells about his and Hermione's daughter who's the same age as Harry and co and knows that her mother is also her classmate.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** The story is really good, my main gripe with it is that it is long-winded and that the author decides to undo lots of this story's character development of Harry near the end of the second part / at the beginning of the third part.

If you like the premise of Snape taking in Harry, check out the "A Very Slytherin Harry" series by geoffaree - 560k words and growing. I actually prefer that series over "Like None Other".

And a long story that really impressed me and blew my mind was "HP and the Conspiracy of Blood" by cambangst. 250k.

** linkao3(6835726) Great D&D/Harry Potter crossover fic. Plot is similar to canon early on, but diverges a lot around later on. Mostly follows Rose (OC from D&D universe), Harry is more of a side character. Only fic I've read which includes Sally-Anne Perks as a major character. Note the warning on the main story page: "Warning: Starts out light and cracky, but gets darker the farther in you get." Stop after book 3 if you can't handle major characters dying (won't say which one here, but read the author's description for book 5 if you want to know who).

linkao3(12608820) My 2nd favorite WBWL fic after Prince of Slytherin, which you probably already know of if you read [[/r/HPfanfiction]]. Has a lot of tropes many people don't like (Slytherin!Harry, WBWL, and tropes associated with those things), so skip it if you can't stand those things, but very well written.

** 600k words:

Sovran's Meaning of One: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]]

Seriously, this is like the third time in one bathroom break I've rec'd this.

It's a Hinny Soul-Bond which (rightfully) is a turn off for some people, but this is I think objectively the best fic, at least that I've read so far. Each character feels like their canon counterparts, it is a gripping, tense, and emotional rewrite of Hogwarts, and has some brilliant twists and turns I don't think I've seen anywhere else. The bond itself, normally a trap for uncomfortable moments and trashy tropes in similar stories, is well thought out and given a clear explanation of it's mechanics early on, and the relationship that builds between Harry and Ginny is handled with tact and maturity, while also acknowledging the weirdness (read: puberty) that comes with the bond they have and at their age.

Though honestly, I'd read this fic even just for McGonagall.

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach by acgoldis)

I have not actually read this (waiting for enough time to be available) but it is complete and about only 50K words short of the /entire/ HP series (so should fit your criteria). I really like the summary of the fic and I am pretty sure it would be a great read.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** I'd recommend the Jennifer Craw series for a long read. It's original character + shape centric but not what you'd think from that description. The characters are very believable, really good world building though AU as it was stated before the books were finished.

At 24 books long with each book typically around the 100-250k mark it's a great read

** linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky; Stranger in an Unholy Land; The Odds were never in my favour; Harry Potter and the Homecoming; Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament; Harry Potter and the fifth element; Black Bond by centaurprincess)

HP and the Homecoming is part of a 6-part series, its around 500k words in total ? something like that.

Though HP and ITT isn't 'massive', at 300k so far, I know for sure that it will be way longer, at least 500k when its done. And its constantly updating.

Black Bond and Fifth element, though massive, are abandoned (Fifith should have a sequel, but it doesn't, and Black Bond has one with 150k words, but abandoned as well).

Eclipse of the Sky is by far my favourite fic all time, rarely have I ever met a better person as the author, and even if the begining of the fic is arguably bad (it was written around 20years ago) the rest is great imho.

Stranger though it has a sequel its 'complete' as it is.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
