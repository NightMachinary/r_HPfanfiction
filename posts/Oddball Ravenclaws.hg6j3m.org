Fics with more Ravenclaws like Luna, or ones that focus less on grades and more on whatever they like learning. Just because they are the scholarly house doesn't mean they have to be bookworms. Give me a Ravenclaw who forgets to go to charms because she is experimenting with potions, or one who loves history, a boy who makes arithmantic predictions for people at dinner etc. Ravenclaw is always depicted as the smart house with all the good grades, but for the most part people have specific interests.


** Was it in linkffn(Lion Unity by Fruitality), where Penelope Clearwater was constantly working on improved sanitation system for Hogwarts and the Ravenclaw Common Room was full of pipes (and her detailed knowledge of the current system at Hogwarts turned out to be important in CoS finale)?

  "While you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts," said McGonagall. Following the 1991-92 school year, the Gryffindors decide to make good on that promise.

** She's not the main character, but the Padma in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343543/1/Harry-the-Mysterious-Curse-of-the-Girl-Who-Lived]]) is what you're looking for. She's really quirky and also the funniest Padma in all of fanfiction. Story is about a Harry who appears male to himself and muggles but all magicals think of him as a female.

  Harry always knew that there was something unique about him. In a way, the arrival of the Hogwarts acceptance letters was almost expected... except, why are they all addressed to 'Harriet Potter?
