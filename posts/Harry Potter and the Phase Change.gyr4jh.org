Three of the four competitors dashed towards the lake, the other lazily brought his wand up, 'Glacius Maxima!' The lake quickly began to freeze solid. Nodding in satisfaction, Harry pocketed his wand and turned to the judges and waited.

"What's my score?" he asked finally, as behind him the expanding ice began to swell, lifting the now frozen surface of the lake higher and higher as the earth groaned.

The five judges shared looks of confusion, before Dumbledore stood up, "The task requires you to retrieve what was taken from the lake. Until an attempt is made, no score can be given."

Harry nodded along, "Yes and I have made my attempt, successfully I might add."

karkaroff slammed on hand angrily into the table, "What foolishness is this, Dumbledore? First he worms his way into the tournament and now he fears to compete!"

Dumbledore was saved the trouble of replying as Harry cleared his throat, "I think you'll find that the instructions for this task were to retrieve what was taken from the /lake./ I have just done so. The fact that whatever you took is now burred in a glacial is immaterial to this discussion."

Four of the five judges just stared at him, open mouthed. Bagman's wand shot into the air, awarding Harry full marks.

*** No, it's clearly an ice cube! A lake is a large body of water enclosed by land.

**** I support the idea of Harry stealing the biggest ice cube in Great Britain to complete the task.

Let's see what judges decide.

Bagman:10

Crouch: 8

Maximoff:0

Karkaroff:0

Dumbledore:0

Giant Squid:0 and official declaration of war from merpeople

Plus with all that war business noone will investigate Bagman's gambling or if Couch is under influence
