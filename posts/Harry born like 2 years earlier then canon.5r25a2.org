  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** linkffn(9939304) is one of my favorite Harry/Fleur fics. It gets a bit crack-y at some points but I really like this version of Durmstrang and dueling. Also its complete (the author said they would write an epilogue but its complete otherwise) which is a huge bonus! The characters are really interesting and although Harry is powerful he's definitely not super!harry

*** I like this story but my big problem with it is that is made the rest of the Wizarding World rational and interesting and left England canon.
