As title. This can be crack, a serious fic which turns Voldemort away from the dark side TM, Merope and Tom Riddle Sr. can be married, single mother, unexplained, etc. Anything goes - just wanted to get this idea out there.


** Tom Riddle's friends stared in horror at the monstrosity that appeared in the doorway before them.

It had leathery skin, though it was pale to the point of translucence. Its eyes gazed in entirely different directions, and they wept constantly with tears almost as viscous as the long stream of mucous hanging off the end of its crooked, narrow nose.

Its legs were as thin as a spider's, yet they were short and nonidentical like a goblin's. Its fingers gnarled and knobbed at the joints, which cracked audibly as it flexed grotesquely. Its ears were wide, round, and almost perfectly flat; like dishes attached to the head at odd angles. Most hideously of all, its black and brown teeth grinned wetly as it drooled on what it held before them.

It held in its spindly arms a tray of blackened cookies. The charcoal rattled against the pan as the creature convulsed.

"D'nrs rdy," it slurred.

Tom Riddle rolled his eyes. "Thanks /Mum."/ He grabbed a cookie and, without batting an eye, cracked it between his pearly rows of perfect white teeth.

As the ungodly being wobbled away from them in fits, Tom groaned quietly to his friends.

"Mums, am I right?"

"So we have agreed to get rid of the filthy mud bloods and show the Muggles magic and integrate technology. We shall torture them into insanit-"

Tom Riddle Sr walks in*

"Hey there champ. Oh and its friends. Hows the group? Good? Well I remeber when you were younger and you used to play with Barbies down here."

Everyone tried not to laugh while Tom was embarrassed. "Daaad! What did I tell you?"

"Yes yes son. I'll go! Have fun with your meeting guys! Oh and mum made cookies for everyone!"

Exit*

"Let's put our plans on hold and have cookies guys!"

As Tom leaves the room a bunch of teddy bears with eyes and mouths stitched on follow.

Mummy Riddle comes in with her Black frizzy hair and grey eyes "Hello kids! TOM HARRY RIDDLE WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THE FILTH!"

One of the bears replied "Sorry Bellatrix but we were having fun down in the basement!"

She had a soft look before replying "That's all right Ronald!"

Ah... I'm sure I'm close.

** (Tomarry warning, powerful!Harry, DarkLord!Harry)

It was 1994 and the 16 years old Tom Riddle and his followers were planning.

Tom was speaking: "As I said, I will set the basilisk-"

Suddenly, a horrific creature came in with a huge cake.

Was it a Ghoul? A house elf - Wizard hybrid?

Behind the weird creature, a scrawny boy with ivory skin and strangely coloured, coldly green eyes (that seemed to be recently fixed from the magic flowing around them) was shyly looking around. He seemed around 11 years old.

He glared at them and mouthed: "13 years old, you twat." What? A natural legilimens?! Just like their Lord!

"Tom! I brought cake! And look, young Harry came!" the creature said, set the cake on the table and left them with the boy.

Tom rolled his eyes. "Mothers."

The boy, Harry, snickered.

Tom glared at him. "Hadrian. The meeting started an hour ago. What were you doing?!"

Hadrian. So Harry was a shortened version of the name.

"For your information, /Tom,/ I have my own followers to tend to. Draco was being whiny about Lucius, tell him to stuff it with the marriage, would you? Ginny was all over me again since she had broken up with Seamus. Neville has finally stopped being shy, at least. Ron was a git to Hermione and she cursed him! The twins tried to prank me, their Lord, again! Of course, now they have antennas instead of me. Oh, and Cedric told me that your idiotic follower, Karakoff, put my name in the Goblet of Fire! What the hell, Tom?! I'm not-"

But suddenly, Tom Riddle Sr came in.

"Hey, Tom! I heard there was cake! I came to get a slice! Oh, Harry! What a surprise! Came to visit your boyfriend, eh? I must say, I was shocked when you and Tom told me and Merope that you were a thing! Anyway, I have to run now! See you!" Riddle Sr took a slice of cake and exited.

Tom and Hadrian sighed. "Soulmates, not regular lovers..." they both said together.

Hadrian seemed to remember something.

"Oh! By the way! Luna said that if you set the basilisk- on the school, Myrtle will die! And Hermione will get petrified! That's my followers! /That's my followers!/ Don't you dare hurt them! I don't hurt /your/ lapdogs! Also, they would close the school. But do conjure some deers for the Basilisk, she's hungry, is what Luna said."

Tom got up, wrapped his arms around Hadrian and kissed him tenderly.

"Hadrian, you know I won't hurt them since you care about them so much. But if Ginerva tries anything," he raised his voice in warning, "I /will/ put her on the basilisk's menu!"

Hadrian frowned. "Well, same goes for Bellatrix!"

They kissed again, this time furiously.

Tom's followers could do nothing but stand there, gaping.
