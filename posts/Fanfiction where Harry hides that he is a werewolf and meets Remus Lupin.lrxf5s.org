I've been looking for a fanfiction where Harry is a werewolf but nobody knows because he is hiding it and he meets Remus Lupin. They can meet in his third year or elsewhere, it doesn't matter but at first Remus doesn't know about Harry's "condition". Does anyone know of a fanfiction that fits those criteria??


** Could you perhaps be talking about the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22088044/chapters/52712932][Howling at the Moon]] ? It's a series of fanfic where Harry is bitten at ten years old and takes on more wolf like attributes and eventually grows in to borderline dark Harry and the stories go on

*** I tried reading this and after reading 3 works right after the other, I think the author sometimes forgets what they already wrote. There is some great stuff in there and brilliant ideas, also I don't mind a darker Harry. But the story is inconsistent and jumps forward and backward all the time.\\
Also Harry is in some parts realistically angry but then flies completely off the rail and is angry for no reason / goes over the top in the next scene.
