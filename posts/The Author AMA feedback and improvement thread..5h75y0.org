** Can we get a heads up on the authors who will be participating beforehand? I would have asked questions, but I'd honestly not read any of the stories listed by those authors. If I had a day or two lead time I could look over their fics and have specific questions ready.

** It was a bit clustered, to be honest. Maybe the authors should make their own comment-threads so that people can minimize the entire thread to make the whole thing a bit more manageable.

Otherwise, I liked it. Its a fun thing to do.

** Probably easier to limit it down to 3 authors though I have no qualms with 5.

With 3 authors, it might be easier to read at least portions of all their stories so users who haven't previously read their fics can ask some relevant questions instead of just generalized questions.

I would have each author have their own thread and have all the other users post their questions in the respective thread.

Otherwise, I thought it was a fun thing to do and I'd like to see it continue.

** 1) I didn't participate, but from what I read, it seemed to go well, except for a bit of clutter.

2) 5 authors or less. Any more and it's likely to get cluttered. Too many cooks spoil the broth, after all. It was pushing it last time with just five authors.

3) Gather some commonly asked questions from the Redditors beforehand and pose them to all the authors beforehand? I've really got nothing else here.

4) If sprinter1988, MK-ONE or James Spookie (all on fanfiction.net, as far as I know) are Redditors, I'd like to see them

I wouldn't mind doing an AMA myself if for some reason multiple people nominated me, but I'm well aware that I'm hardly well known in the Potter fandom to do such a thing here, so I'll just sit back and enjoy.

*** Well, I'm not the target audience here, so my comment may be redundant, but it strikes me that the views of lesser-known or unknown writers will be at least as relevant as the well-known ones. In fact if I was going to make a suggestion it would be to have a varied mixture of writers in order to avoid homogeneity.

**** I guess they could emphasize this fact when asking for nominations, so we can get a proper mix.

My small claim to fame is having the most popular story (most faves, follows /and/ reviews) in the HP/Winx Club crossover section, but I wouldn't consider myself generally known on the HP side of things and I don't know how popular the other fandom is generally with Potterheads.
