As the title said, let's collate all stories where magical education begins as adults, not as tweens.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and Hogwarts U) sounds like what you are looking for. Not finished and seems to be abandoned though.

  What if Hogwarts had to wait to start till student's were 18 when their magical cores matured? With magicals going to the Saint Schools for primary/secondary, they have a big lead on the Muggleborn in everything but magic. Follow Harry as he leaves Stonewall behind to enter into Magic where the rules seems stacked against the Muggleborn/raised. AU with alternative sortings. Harry/?

  An aged Harry reveals the scandalous truth about his youthful exploits. Read how a lying, womanising coward became the hero of the magical world. Rated M for language and sexual content. Title changed to comply with website's guidelines.

** It's not a fanfic of Harry Potter, but you might like /The Magicians by Lev Grossman/ a novel with that premise. It's really good, and reminds me a lot of Harry Potter, just for adults.

*** The series itself is definitely worth a read but I would shy away from comparing it to Harry Potter. Brakebills itself is nothing like Hogwarts and Quentin is certainly nothing like Harry. Especially with the divergence the sequels take I wouldnt call it similar to Harry Potter.
