I'm curious to see if there are any good fem!Snape stories out there. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/xqsze/anybody_know_of_any_femsnape_stories/][This]] old topic makes me think it's largely unexplored. Any recommendations?

*** Did you mean "One of the many demands?" I don't understand how this is any different than all the fem!Harry, Draco/Ginny, Harry/Tom Riddle, etc. It's an exploration of "what if." No different than any other non-canon fiction!
