Someone recently asked for a female!Harry/Hermione fic, and were given [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11197701/1/Yule-Ball-Panic][this]] wonderfully cute piece whose sequels attempt to tackle prejudice on that /other/ front.

So, I was wondering if there any - hopefully complete - male!Hermione's out there that are paired with Harry Potter. I'm curious to know what others imagine their dynamic as, with her there as his 'best mate', or runner up depending on the angling of the plot - of course. And, I am hoping for plot that at least tries to handle the same issues - not a sappy one-off that ends with me longing for more. Either would be okay, though, if that's all there is.

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated and thank you in advance for your help in this noble quest!


** Sorry buddy, but the only male Hermione story I know of is Session Transcripts. It's an amazingly beautiful story, but there isn't a romantic pairing yet, nor does it seem likely that there will be.

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.
