Is there anyone here who has enough knowledge of both to answer this? Like a dao cultivator. This is mostly a random question that popped into my head but I think it would make an interesting fanfiction. (Wizard dropped into cultivation world and trying to survive)


** If the Killing Curse works by just severing the Soul from the Body and letting the nature take its course afterwards, then I can see a Daoist with a Nascent Soul being able to take control of their spirit and stop it from going to the afterlife (and possibly even immediately possess their own body back). But if you interpret the Killing Curse as an immediate, purely-conceptual command for the victim to /die/, then I could see it being similar to a powerful Heavenly Tribulation Lightning---the kind of power that will immediately destroy them, only possible to avoid or redirect, only eventually stoppable at the highest stages of Immortal Cultivation (where the Cultivator is already pretty much a God in all but a name). Though I would be unsatisfied with letting Wizards have this much power without working for it, narratively speaking---and a lowly Daoist has to /work/ for their power, and the kind of esoteric effect that the pro-Wizard interpretation of the Killing Curse assumes would require /massive/ amounts of enlightenment, meditation, and willpower from a Cultivator. In any other crossover, I might just side with the canon-purists for the sake of clarity and making both settings more equal in the power-level department, but the matters of death and immortality are the principal theme of all classic Xianxia---it would feel like betraying the spirit of the genre.

In a Wizard -> Cultivation World story, I would just make the knowledge of the Killing Curse be a part of some Dao of Death, giving the Wizard an edge in the understanding of that Dao if they wanted to follow it (but maybe not in the practical aspect of just one-shotting everyone). Just one Daoist Technique among many, depending mostly on the user's willpower and Cultivation stage to succeed.

tl;dr It depends on your interpretation of Potterverse, the exact Xianxia you're talking about, and your goals for a crossover. But both 'yes' and 'no' seems like perfectly reasonable interpretations in this case.

** Interesting question. In classical cultivation story the ultimate objectif is immortality, as opposed to the more western influenced ones with a higher focus on True God/Divinity and way less codes in the cultivation stages. I think (but I am not sure ) that you differentiate the two by calling them Xanxia (Wuxia ?) for the classic immortality type and Xuanhan (?) for the western fantasy type.

I think your question would be more pertinently answered by using the classical one as the base. In those kind of story the stages of cultivation will generally take the cultivator to a stage called nascent soul ( in most case just after the golden core / core formation stage ). This stage is when the soul of the cultivator becomes a power source. In some story you will be told that the cultivator create the nascent soul, some times out of the golden core, but it is functionally the same thing. In the great majority of cultivation stories you will hear that after reaching nascent soul, the protagonist can survive without a physical body and will even be able resurrect and rebuild a physical body as long as the soul is healthy. It is in essence the same thing as an horcrux but way more OP and way less evil(depending on how you cultivated to arrive here of course).

I think it is safe to say that in a classical Cultivation setting, any stage from Nascent soul and up is completely immune to the killing curse. Now, if you want to write a more western cultivation what will happen depends on you, because the setting is way less coded than the classical one. Here, you will be the one freely deciding of the cultivation stages and their particularities and boundaries. So it will be up to you to concoct whatever rules you see fit in relation to your cultivator and the killing curse.

** Yes it would.

The killing curse is not just severing the soul from the body. Otherwise people who receive the dementor's kiss would all die. But they don't. They keep on living without a soul(or at least their bodies do).

So the killing curse is something else. It might be soul magic too. But I think that it works the same way as all other HP magic. It creates a conceptual status effect on whatever it affects.

Meaning the killing curse puts the status effect of 'dead' on people. Meaning a cultivator would die if they get hit by it, unless they where a high-tier cultivator that cultivated the law of entropy or something and could resist instant-death effects
