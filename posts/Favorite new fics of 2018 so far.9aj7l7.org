** This is every story in my favorites list that was published this year, definitely hoping that this thread introduces me to some more hidden gems.

Linkffn(13022207) is the best new time travel fic released in a while. Its a Hermione-centric story dealing with time travel from an outsider's perspective.

Linkffn(World On Fire by WiseTomato) is an HP/Mass Effect crossover with a older Harry fighting the Reapers invasion of Earth.

Linkffn(Druid of Holly and Yew by Team Ozone) is a story with a Harry who was apprentice of a Druid coming back to the wizarding world.

Linkffn(12885827) has an absurd premise but is worth reading just for the novelty of it.

  Lost time is never found again, unless of course you are willing to pay the price. Harry is not himself. Hermione will find out why.

** Since you said you like time travel: linkao3(7944847)

Six Pomegranate Seeds was technically first published in 2016, but its latest update was a week or so ago, and I'd wager that it will wrap up before the year's out, if you prefer to wait for fics to be complete. The story is a Hermione time travel with a really interesting perspective.

** My most recent favorite is one that just started -- Harry ends up in the 1970s but is terrified of changing the future (it's kind of like /Back to the Future/) so he tries to avoid everyone. Ends up pretending he's a squib and gets roped into working at the Hog's Head for Aberforth Dumbledore. Really smart writing, full chapters, nice characterization, especially of Harry and Aberforth.The only drawback is that the author says it will eventually be slash, but emphasizes that slash or romance isn't the main point of the story. Given how good the first 50 thousand or so words are, I'm sticking with it to see (no slash at all yet). It also, so far, updates really regularly.It's called /The Second String,/ Linkffn(13010260)

**** Neither, exactly, yet. He tries to avoid changing the future by laying low, but it's implied so far that this hasn't worked. He isn't it at the screw it point yet, but it seems like he's going to realize he can't avoid changing the future and is starting to actively start changing his approach. It's kind of slow moving, but the writer gives lots of different scenes and varies the tone really well, so it doesn't seem to me like it's plodding. As for angsty-ness, there is some, but I definitely wouldn't classify this as an angsty fic. More he encounters problems or things that depress him but then finds a way to move on. There's lots of humor, so that helps alleviate the angst.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. A new perspective on the 1970s time travel/AU cliché. Updates weekly on Saturdays. Some slash much later.

** linkao3(Present Imperfect by SofiaBane) - features quite a rarepair (Lupin/Kingsley), but a nice take on Lupin after Sirius's death even if you don't care about the ship

linkao3(Blackpool by TheDivineComedian) - Regulus-centric, warning for child abuse

linkao3(Concerning Rabbits by LullabyKnell) - a bit of an unusual interpretation of Cedric's character, but it's got probably the most accurate depiction of social anxiety I've ever read

linkao3(An Hour of Wolves by thebiwholived) - heading towards Harry/Ginny, very character-driven, warning for non-con (not between Harry and Ginny), in-progress

** Andromeda's Galaxy by sheyamiku. Was started in 2017 but is still getting updated in 2018 (so I'm counting it). It's got Andromeda being forced to be a death eater. Strong Bellatrix presence and learning a lot about the beginning of the death eaters. I'm dying for the next chapter to come out. It's got a a very good mix of romance and action. Really great star cross lovers of andromeda and ted mixed with great action and hero andromeda!

  Andromeda being disinherited marked the start of the fall of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black. How did it come to this? This is my version of Andromeda Black's story, explored through Andromeda and Ted's relationship but with emphasis on Andromeda's relationship to her family and sisters in particular.

It's possible, perhaps even likely that I've read enough fics with "Noble and Most Ancient Houses" that I've become numb to their presence. As a result, minor changes to the formula have become "good enough" rather than actually good.

I can at least say, that it avoids Harry being overly pretentious about the whole thing, which is refreshing. There hasn't been any "Oh hello, Mr. Potter - " "Actually it's LORD Potter, and you'd better be appropriately scared and respectful when addressing me." There are some definite warning signs that everything good about this fic could rather rapidly go downhill, and I'm in fact prepared for exactly that.

Basically, if you want to pair Harry with a named Slytherin female in his year, you're picking from Pansy, Millicent, Tracey, and Daphne. Pansy's personality is a bit less malleable due to actual canon appearances, Millicent's out because we can't pair Harry with ugly(/s), so you're left with Daphne Greengrass, because the name Tracey Davis sounds too girl-next-door, and you can just go to Hufflepuff and throw a stone and hit a half-dozen of those.

That sounded both wrong and perfectly right.

And as someone who tried writing Katie ships a couple times, it's very difficult to write it without sounding like you are simply having a "better Ginny" (the sporty girl from Harry's team, but not his fangirl) or a "better Hermione" (hot muggleborn, but no nagging). I like to include her as a good friend to Harry like in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12745758][No longer alone]], but to write a good romance with her without sounding bland is rather difficult.

It's a sequel to a previous story where Harry, in his first life, was bitten by a werewolf and eventually killed for being one. His second life was spent elevating creatures above humans so the non-humans ruled the magical world. His third life is the sequel, where he's up to shenanigans as the MoD Werewolf in a world ruled by Voldemort. The author plans on finishing the fic by end of September and updates every other day.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13119842/1/]]

Harry Potter

Words: 2,136 Genre: Adventure/Romance Rated: M

This story follows our unsung heroes, the Muggleborn Wizards from Gryffindor. I also added a new twist to Ron's character, which is more mature and playing to his strengths. Harry and Hermion will play a key role, but the spotlight will be stolen by Ron Weasley, Dean Thomas & Colin Creevy. Smart Ron, Half-blood Dean, Savage Colin.

** I'd recommend A Stumble in Time. It's a time travel fic where Death Eaters attacked the Ministry, killing everyone except Hermione and Draco, who formed a last ditch resistance. They plan to transfer their memories for a redo, but something goes wrong and Hermione ends up in Fourth Year while Draco seemingly disappears. While she shamelessly abuses her Time Turner and Arithmancy, she tries to fix things and sometimes makes them worse. There's a whole subplot where Viktor made her lose her memories but that seems to be resolved. Draco is a little bit fannon-y, but not insufferable. Some Snape involvement. No pairings from what I can tell

#+begin_quote
  AU Post Battle of Hogwarts: Voldemort had a back-up plan. Harry, Ron, and Astoria are among the "Massacre of the Ministry" victims. For three years, Draco and Hermione try to pick up the pieces, but when Voldemort kills their parents, they look to time-travel to save them. But time is a fickle friend, and they don't make it all back.
