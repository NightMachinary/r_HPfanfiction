Im looking for favorite fics on the Founders. Would be especially appreciated if there is a rotating focus onto each character, even from an omnipresent narrator like Through a Glass Darkly or Shoebox.

Bonus points if details on Godric/Salazar split, building of Chamber of Secrets/any secret room, or on the background of Merlin, Helena Ravenclaw/The Bloody Baron/any Hogwarts ghost.

Sorry if this has been asked before couldn't find anything just like this in the search! Thanks!


** I haven't read anything like this, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2740971/Izzyaro][Izzyaro]] has a lot of good Founders' era stories, with a timeline on their bio. Features all four Founders and very good characterization. Check it out!
