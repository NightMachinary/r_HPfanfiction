EDIT: To further expand on this plot bunny, maybe Astoria and Daphne had a muggle or muggleborn friend who they watched Frozen with constantly while growing up, and they both take on the persona of Elsa and Anna, much to the bemusement of muggleborns at Hogwarts


** Alternatively, a time travel/insert fic where traveler hears 'she is the ice queen of Slytherin' and starts making frozen jokes/references every time she is around, to her confusion...

***** *Kintsugi*

Kintsugi (金継ぎ, "golden joinery"), also known as Kintsukuroi (金繕い, "golden repair"), is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum, a method similar to the maki-e technique. As a philosophy, it treats breakage and repair as part of the history of an object, rather than something to disguise.

*Classifications of fairies*

The fairies of Irish, English, Scottish and Welsh folklore have been classified in a variety of ways.

Two of the most prominent categories, derived from Scottish folklore, are the division into the Seelie Court and the Unseelie Court.

These categories may reflect an earlier (medieval) classification of the Germanic elves of light and darkness (Ljósálfar and Dökkálfar), as the corresponding Insular Celtic "fair folk" do not appear to have a comparable division.

William Butler Yeats, in Irish Fairy and Folk Tales, further divided them into the Trooping Fairies (appearing in splendid processions known as fairy rades) and the Solitary Fairies (mischievous spirits appearing on their own).

***** This is so well thought out! Thank you for writing all of this up :) Haha I'd have a hard time killing Harry off though. I'm all about him going through all kinds of trials and tribulations, and even some wall to wall angst, but I'd have a hard time killing him off

#+begin_quote
  When George and Fred give Harry the Marauders map, they merely intend to allow Harry to travel to Hogsmeade for a day of fun and levity. Harry notices something on it however and heads off to investigate, unearthing an entirely new direction for his destiny to follow. Elements of Frozen will influence characters and scenes in the story.
