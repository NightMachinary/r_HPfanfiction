Because people, love potions are really dangerous!

Harry can be successful or maybe he fails. He could work for the light side, having Voldemort kill all of his Death Eaters. (Keep in mind Voldemort in love would still be a creepy fucker and maybe he'd lock Harry up to keep him somewhere forever) He could also work on his own, maybe wanting revenge in Dumbledore and Voldemort is a piwerful Wizard. Maybe Harry likes it. Idk. Share your ideas.

I first thought of it as a crackfic but tbh this could be a really dark piece of fiction. (Serial Killer courting gifts. #ikilledyourawfulrelatives #lookhere'swormtailshead)


** "Oi!, Mrs. Weasley, I need a love potion to seduce Lord Voldemort good again!"

"No problem dear, so long as it is just a manipulation, and you don't break my daughter's heart by leaving her for a Dark Lord."

"Thanks Mrs. Weasley, you are like the mother my new boyfriend killed!"
