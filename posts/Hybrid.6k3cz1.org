** Come to think of it, wouldn't this be the perfect excuse to turn him into a version of Deadpool? The basilisk venom is constantly killing him, and the phoenix tears are constantly healing him. He still feels all the pain until it drives him bonkers and doesn't bother him any more.

Not saying he needs to start using katanas or grow lumps on his head or anything, just a Harry slowly gaining Deadpool's mentality. Could be either a crackfic or a horrorfic as everyone realises that Harry's losing his marbles, painkiller charms aren't working and he can't be fixed. He can't be killed easily due to the phoenix tears, and the basilisk venom is resistant to all methods of healing except for the tears. Would be tragic as Ron and Hermione slowly see their friend slipping away from them through the cracks of sanity.

*** Hope you don't mind, but this spurred me to make something. It's unedited and the first chapter isn't quite finished, but here's a taste:

#+begin_quote
  Ever have days where you'd wished you just die? You know, those days where everything you do is clouded by a vast, endless wave of agony and despair? The kind of days that hollow you out with a dagger and chop up your insides into tiny little bits of potions ingredients?

  Yeah, I'm having that kind of day right now and it's not just because someone actually *has* hollowed out my insides for potions ingredients.

  It's because they're growing back. They always grow back. And there's not a thing I can do about it --

  No, wait, that's not necessarily true. I can get angry about it. That's what I am right now, angry, angry enough to THINK IN CAPSLOCK about how utterly FUCKED the man, the myth, the legend HARRY POTTER is.

  Yeah. That's me. Harry Potter. You might have heard of me before.
#+end_quote

And there is the appetizer.

I'll be uploading the first chapter to Ao3 in a few days, hopefully. (It's going to be a little too fucked up for FFN for any future installments I have planned.)

*Edit*: I really shouldn't have done this since I have other things in the works, but I don't care. It was a fantastic idea from [[/u/SaberToothedRock]].

**** Of course I don't mind in the slightest! This is a fanfiction subreddit we're on after all, if I wanted to keep ideas to myself I'd never post them! I never really put any of my ideas to paper anyway, I'm just amazed someone is willing to do something with one of them!

And that tidbit looks fantastic. I wish you truly the best of you luck your fic! Please let me know (either through PM or in a comment) when the first installment's up!

****** Looking good! I'm definitely going to be following this story! (Shame I don't have an AO3 account.)

And thanks for mentioning my comment (you didn't have to) at the end! If I may make a recommendation though, I'd save mentioning the inspiration for much later in the fic (until it's been revealed just how Harry lost his marbles) as it gives away the premise - unless, of course, you have so many more unveilings and plot twists waiting in the wings that spoiling this one doesn't matter.

EDIT: I also just noticed the tags.

******* Thanks, glad it's all right. I was hoping to do the prompt justice.

The reveal for Harry's insanity is going to come up in the next chapter, actually, which is why I plonked the author's note right there. And there are indeed a lot of plot twists and whacky stuff up ahead.

  Hi there. All right? Good. Now that the introductions are over, sweetie pie, you should know that this is a dark comedy, action-adventure starring me, Killjest, the Deadpool-inspired (coughcoughripoffcough), magical, hilarious-yet-sociopathic, neighborhood not-a-hero who is just as likely to break the fourth wall as I am to break faces. You can call me Harry, though. Oh, and if you don't like messed-up humor, you might want to keep scrolling until you hit the freaky fetish fics that you're probably looking for instead of this. (Be safe, don't chafe.)
