** Hermione is a pureblood so everything is OK.

Draco said sorry one time so everything is OK.

** Draco not having to change his views on blood purity to be with Hermione and them getting together while he still thinks Muggleborns are inferior.

One of the prerequisites for them falling in love (in my opinion) would be for Draco to completely abandon the pureblood supremacy views, as I don't think Hermione would want to be with him otherwise. It's an insult to her own character and morals to date him before he realizes how wrong he was.

Also, Draco's character development is a big part of why I'm drawn to Dramione and without it he's just too unlikeable for me to ship him with our girl. :(

*** While I agree Malfoy has to stop being a Blood Purist before the end of this kind of fic (unless you plan a break up and a bittersweet ending), I don't think he should do it "before" getting together.

I mean, ships like this survive almost only on drama, and a Draco struggling between his budding feelings for a Muggleborn and years of endoctrination from his parents is a plot line with a lot of drama.

Without a blood purist Draco, you can only go 2 direction :

- Secret relationship, both try to maintain their relationship secret and struggle more and more in a society taken over by war (can be pretty interesting, especially when Draco get marked, but good luck explaining how he maintained the secret when Bellatrix taught him Occulumency)\\
- Open relationship where the problem come from judging people. But this one goes a little too easily into bashing in my opinion (and I don't need another stupid and jealous Ron yelling "But he is a snake" while projecting most of the food he gorged himself before speaking. I like this character).

**** You can't be in a relationship with someone if you hate their skin color, same way with blood. You can screw them but you can't be in a relationship, to truly like someone/love them you can't hate their blood... You could be in lust with them, but that would mainly be , that you want what you can't have... Having your characters in lust with each other is fine but it's not a relationship

***** You can; just not a healthy one. It'll be a "you're one of the good ones" sort of relationship though, and extremely damaging once the person realises you haven't changed your views, you've just made an exception. But these aren't for fluff fics, these are for much darker stories.

***** My example for this kind of romance is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9738656/1/You-ll-Be-The-Death-of-Me][You'll be the death of me]] . It's a Neville/ OC (Draco twin sister) but shows fairly well the changes in their relations. Starting purely physical and then turning more and more into love when the characters questions their positions (mainly the Death Eater daughter of course).

Not exactly the same because Neville is just a Blood Traitor (still more acceptable than mudblood) but I just find it preferable to show a character evolution. Rather than having a chapter 1 Draco saying "Hello, not blood purist anymore, I love you".

** My issues with Dramoines is the same issue I have with most fics... They start from a cannon base and don't realistically get set up... To have a realistic dramoine... Either Hermione has to be a pure blood who believes in that ideal, or Draco has to not be a blood purist, both need to be set up not just chapter 1 saying that's the case.

** Truthfully, that they exist. It's taking the person that espouses everything that your values consider evil (and vice versa), and then saying that they suddenly are in love. It doesn't work like that, someones views has to change.
