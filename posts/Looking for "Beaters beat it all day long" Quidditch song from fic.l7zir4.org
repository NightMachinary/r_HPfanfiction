:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am trying to find this dirty quidditch song someone wrote in their fic. I can't remember anything else from it other then that fred and George were singing it in front of a young harry. The lyrics I remember from it is "Beaters beat it all day long, keepers keep it (nice and tight?)" If you know what fic this is from please let me know. I am making a hand made marauders map and thought it would be hilarious to use the song as the random words around the pitch.

  "Seekers do it fast and nimble, beaters beat it every night. While keepers keep things nice and tight, the chasers like to score..."

It was just a quick search, so I'm not sure if there's any more than just the above.

Hope the map turns out well :)

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter. HIATUS
