Hey guys. My friend and I used to read lots of HP fanfics (well, he still does). And he asked me about a specific one because he does not know the title. Well, neither do I so please save me: the fanfiction he's looking for contains a scene where Harry uses a dementor and puts the soul of his mother inside the dementor in 3rd year (in different words, he makes that dementor his mother), though can't remember if his godfather is saved or not. Please help :)
