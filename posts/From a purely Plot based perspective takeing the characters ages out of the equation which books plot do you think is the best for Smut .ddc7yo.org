I would say the four book with the other schools and the tri-wizard tournament is probably one that is the best if you want to weave the smut into the books plot. With stuff like girls from the three schools Suducing Harry to try and find out how he got his name in the tornement, or girls trying get information out of Harry.

Outside the four book I would say none of the other books plots really lend themselfs to any sort of smut.And it's best left for post Hogwarts and dedicated smut fics.

For reference of what I think is a good smit fic linkao3(Creating Your Happy Memory)

Edit: for ffnbot!refresh but may as well add some more post Hogwarts smut stories inkao3(The Warden of Azkaban) and linkao3(And I Walk from My Machine)

Edit2: Is the bot broken or am I just linking the stories wrong?


** By takeing the characters age out of perspective I assume you mean aging them up so that Hogwarts is more college age ? If so yes the fourth books plot with the other schools and the tri wizard tornement does lend itself best to a smut fic plot wise.

I also agree that smut should be left to dedicate Smut fics and not forced into stories were its not the main focus of the story.

**** Its more because I find it detracts from the quality the smut, if the Smut isnt the main focus of the Plot/story.

** The creation of DA and the whole defense club leaves a lot of potential for introducing people to each other in situations outside of the normal class routine. you can put as much or as little drama into it as you want with many potential partners, the ministry and the growing threat of voldemort for outside pressure

First year quidditch leaves some good openings too. mixed gender team, everyone has their blood up from practices/games, locker room shenanigans. you can play it off as mentor/student too if you want. then there is all the potential with other teams and their interactions.

*** Wasn't there a time were it was a common trope in stories that Exercises and high adrenaline and emotional stuff brought magic to the surface and one of the ways that The Gryffindor Quidditch team(and other teams) bonded was threw Naked cuddling(and team orgies for older students) so their magic could get to know each other and make the team closer and able to work together because it would make them work better as s team on a magical and subconscious level?

I remember it from years ago, Normal Harry and Katie would be Naked left to cuddle naked while the rest of the Team went of to have a Orgy.

** Chambers of Secrets.

While the MC is thought to be Slythering Heir and a confirmed Parseltongue, we get a lot of eager Slythering ladies wanting some piece of the Heir and we learn Salazar and his ability with Parseltongue was very very famous. Current generation slythering ladies and a couple from the other houses are learning this for themselves.

** If you mean make hogwarts a Uni?

Hmmm.

Gobelt of fire is a good choice not just the other schools but if you rpefer a story competition and life or death fighting is good. Most pairings work if you wanna do it.

Order of the Phoneix is angst as well bit well tbh read any romance novel or smutty novel or story Angst is soooo useful oets you do tons of different types of emotions while writing.

Also I have seen more than a few slash fics play around with umbridgees reign lead to a spike of homophobia. Which is good tho I usually prefer if a gay writer is writing that stuff.

Half Blood prince as it is... Is just Drarry fuel it is far far far too easy to turn into drarry fuel. Granted it also is good like really good for Ronaco and Tharry.

Granted Tharry is just gay Harmony.

Deathly Hallows is iffy.

It hads MOMENTS but it requires a lot of changing.

I like to see people play around with Dean x Harry during this periord idk why but having Harry x dean be established and then it gets to Deathly hallows just feels right.

Or riverdale /Ashleigh Murray playing a 19 year old at 31/

***** By the end of the Movies weren't a lot a the actors for Harry, Ron, Neville, Draco,Hermione ect like 3 or 4 years older than the Characters they were playing. so even the Harry Potter films by the end had a minor case of Dawson casting by the end.

I am pretty sure by the time of Order of The Phoenix film even Emma Watson who was one the youngest when they filmed the Philosopher's Stone was over 18 years old.
