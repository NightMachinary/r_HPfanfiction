Like, leave Britain and the normal plot entirely, get a peaceful magical education somewhere else while also taking advantage of being back in the 90s and making some serious money by investing in the right silicon valley companies.


** I've written something for a Harry and Hermione time travel to 1970. Instead of going to Hogwarts and doing the usual Marauder shenanigans, they went to America, created a major corporate powerhouse, and built a secret paramilitary organization of disgruntled Wizards (mostly Muggleborns), whom they bound to them through carefully constructed magical contract.

The plot outline works like that:

- The war ended badly for the good guys. Harry and Hermione were only the few who had survived. Blood purists still maintained a grip on power. Hermione suggested the idea of time travel a few months after the Battle.
- Since they have only limited knowledge of this time (for example Horcrux locations are mostly unknown), they decide it makes sense to keep the timeline intact until late 70s.
- As a result, they will completely remove themselves from Britain. They will instead use their advance knowledge to make some good money in Muggle stock markets, preferably in America.
- They can use this competitive advantage to build up a powerful business and private army, made up of Muggleborns fleeing from Death Eaters in Britain.
- Of course, events in Magical Britain should still be followed closely. By late 1970s, it's probably a good time to send an anonymous tip to Dumbledore about Voldemort's Horcruxes and his Death Eaters.
- Give Dumbledore and his Order some time, and only intervene if they still suck as much as in canon.
- If they successfully defeat Voldemort, egg Barty Crouch on (bribe him with a small fraction of their now massive fortune, and send pieces of his Jr back to him whom they kidnapped a few months ago) to go totally merciless on any remaining Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers to your knowledge.
- Once Death Eaters have been removed, try their best to incite another civil war between Dumbledore and the crazed Barty Crouch. Watching “fire across from the river” can be very satisfying, but make sure to save James, Lily, Sirius, and Remus.
- The end result should be pretty much the destruction of Magical Britain's traditional establishment, and now they can move in as their ‘savior'.

Lily's graduation in 1978 should be the point at which they have finished building up their forces and ready to strike at Voldemort. Their opening move is to get Lily and Marauders to safety. First, bring her parents into protective custody sometime after her graduation and send her a notice. She and Marauders will certainly show up and that will be the time for the "red pill/blue pill" moment. The goal is to get them out of Dumbledore's incompetent military leadership and into theirs.

*** Next is a scene Harry explaining things to Lily:

Harry: Welcome, Miss Evans. I'm terribly sorry for subjecting you to this ordeal, but your very life is at stake, and many of your loved ones too. I couldn't let Death Eaters, the Ministry, and the Order know of our little operations.

Lily: Let me go, you little creep! I will never betray my friends, and do your worst!

Harry: I'm not asking you to spill your fellow Order members' names or addresses, or to betray their plans. We know most of them anyway, for example, Frank and Alice Longbottom, Alastor Moody, Caradoc Dearborne, Dorcas Meadows, Aberforth Dumbledore, Fabian and Gildeon Prewett, Marlene McKinnon, Benji Fenwyk. Do you need me to show their addresses too? It's all in this pile.

Lily: How? What? Who are you?

Harry: We are here to help you fight Death Eaters, and their minions in the Ministry. However, we don't want them to know, and we want to give everyone an illusion that you and your family were abducted.

Lily: Then why do you have me tied up? And why don't you contact Dumbledore directly?

Harry: We are perfectly aware of your temper, and we know you are very angry about your treatment. I need to finish my explanations before releasing you from the restraint.

Harry: First I'd like to know your opinion of Magical Britain.

Lily: I'm not going to answer anything until you release me!

Harry: Very well. But you need to agree not to attack me at the first opportunity, or until we have finished our discussion.

Lily: Good, I promise to hear you out first. Now release me!

With a swish of his hand, the binding on Lily was gone.

Harry: Again, I'd like to know your opinion of Magical Britain. Please tell me how you really feel about it. It's important.

Lily: At first, I was very excited. A whole new world to explore, new people to know, and new powers to learn. But then, You-Know-Who just appeared and started killing people, especially people like me. And he started driving the students apart, destroying past friendships...

Harry: Severus Snape.

Lily: How do you know?

Harry: We have our sources. But please continue, Miss Evans.

Lily: I want to know who you are, and how do you know all those things about me, us; and how much more you know.

Harry: You will of course learn that in due course. For now, I'm interested in hearing more of your opinions. You already know what Death Eaters are after, can you think of a Muggle world equivalent of Death Eaters?

Lily: Nazis. They are magical Nazis.

Harry: I'm very glad that you see this parallel so clearly. What do you think of the Ministry?

Lily: They are bigoted, corrupt, and incompetent. From what James or Sirius told me, it's full of Death Eater collaborators and sympathizers. That's why we all joined the Order, Dumbledore is our only hope.

Harry: I'm sorry to tell you that Dumbledore also has very little success against the Dark Lord so far. How many notable Death Eaters has your Order permanently put out of business so far?

Lily: I can't tell you.

Harry: That's ok. Because the answer is none, both the Ministry and the Order have so far only taken out some of his curse fodders and none of his key Death Eaters. Just like we know about the Order, we also know about the Dark Lord's organization.

Lily: Why do you call him the Dark Lord? Only Death Eaters call him that.

Harry: What else are we supposed to call him? "You Know Who" or "He Who Must Not Be Named"? That's downright silly! He's of course extremely powerful, a walking weapon of mass destruction, and militarily very competent. So I think it's fair to call him the Dark Lord. Of course, if you want to be derogatory towards him, we can always call him "Tom".

Lily: Tom? I like that. Better than Dark Lord anyway.

Harry: Alright, Tom it is then. For the past 7 years, Tom has been waging a terror and guerrilla war against anyone who doesn't subscribe to his ideology of blood purity. The Ministry, with its bloated bureaucracy, divided loyalties, and hopelessly outdated military strategies and tactics, has little to no success against him. Dumbledore, despite his immense personal power and wisdom, is foremost an educator, a researcher, and not a general. Dumbledore and his Order have good intentions, but are not a competent military and political organization. As the war continues, we expect your people to suffer grievous losses, and eventually to lose this war of attrition.

Lily: You make grand claims, mister. I suppose your group can do better?

Harry: Of course, the very fact we captured you so easily and obtained such detailed information about your Order should be evident of our capabilities. I know you don't like my assessment of Dumbledore, but all good medicine tastes bitter.

Lily: So you want me to abandon Dumbledore and join you?

Harry: Exactly! Now let me ask you another question, what would happen if Voldemort wins this war and takes control of Magical Britain?

Lily: He would kill all people like me, and more.

Harry: Is he going to stop at just murdering all Muggleborns? What about Muggles, in Britain and the wider world?

Lily: If he takes the war to the Muggle world, other magical countries and the ICW would step in.

Harry: Maybe, but either way, far more people will suffer and die. Have you ever considered the possibility of him getting his hands on nuclear weapons and starting WW3?

Lily: How?

Harry: Very easy, the Ministry already has the Prime Minister of the UK under its control. If Tom wins the war, he will have the Ministry and the PM under his control too. Then, Britain's nuclear arsenal will be at his disposal. But he could go further and also bring the American President under his control. Do you think those MACUSA aurors could stop him?

Lily: No.

Harry: Right, when he has the US President under his mind control, he could easily launch US nuclear weapons against Soviet Union, and here is your World War 3. Billions will die, maybe up to 95% of current humanity.

Lily: No, he can't do that. Nobody is that insane!

Harry: Then you don't know Lord Voldemort. He has been insane for a very long time already, because of his rituals to achieve immortality.

Lily: No, I don't believe any of it. This is nonsense, no person can live forever!

Harry: Maybe you should call up your old friend Severus and ask him about whether his precious Dark Lord has ever boasted about achieving immortality. Or you can ask Dumbledore about his opinion. Maybe your friend Sirius could also fill in some concepts about dark magic from his family library.

Lily: How do you know any of this? I can't blindly believe it without proof.

Harry: What kind of proof do you need? We have interrogation transcripts from captured Death Eaters. We have books about dark arts, ancient rituals, and alchemy.

Lily: I'd like to see them. Also, tell me more about your organization first.

Harry: Our organization is called the "Resistance". Our goal is to bring equality, justice, and prosperity to all wizards and witches, regardless of their ancestry and blood status. We would like to begin with Magical Britain, and we would like to turn it eventually into a constitutional democracy. Here is a sample constitution that's still subject to revisions.

[Lily went over the text briefly]

Lily: You have a very lofty goal. But that means fighting against thousands of years of entrenched interests. That means revolutions and wars and more deaths!

Harry: Americans fought a war against us because they didn't want to be taxed without representation. Americans fought a most devastating civil war to free the slaves. Our parents fought a total war against the Nazis. Even the often maligned French Revolution freed us from absolute monarchy. Tell me, Miss Evans, would Muggle world be a better place without the American and French and Glorious Revolutions?

Lily: No, but the magical world is different.

Harry: How so? Wizards, by default, are supposed to be magnitudes more productive than Muggles. They should long be in a post scarcity society, an utopia, and yet, we can observe extreme poverty, material poverty, everywhere in the magical world. Whether it's in Knockturn Alley, Rue Maudite in France, or Boerum Hill in New York, or Kamagasaki in Japan, conditions there rival the worst of Muggle slums. When inequality and injustice reach an extreme level, there will be a need for struggles and revolutions.

Lily: I don't know. I wish we could all live in peace, and prosperity. I hate wars, but I hate injustices too. I don't know. I need to think about this. I need to ask my friends. Where is James? Where are my parents?

Harry: James is still resting in the next room. I'm going to speak to him next. Let me accompany you to your room, your parents are there. Please don't try to break out, you will fail. Consider your stay here as a form of protective custody, or witness protection program.

Lily: When can we leave?

Harry: A few more days, after our talks are concluded.

** Serious muggle money, maybe, but I'm not sure why that would be helpful to a wizard. It almost certainly seems as if the ministry allots a certain amount of galleons for muggleborn currency exchange. You can't conjure gold. What value would muggle money really be worth? Paper money that someone can transfigure or conjure? If you really needed muggle money, there are far easier methods than worrying about investment. Like conjuring a bearer bond and slapping a confundment on it.

As an actual SI though, I agree that I would be surprised if anyone actually stuck around for the Voldemort thing. Not when Ilvermorny, an English speaking school free of Voldemort, or Beauxbatons, with hot girls/boys, exist and are top magical schools.

Well, for starters, you can buy physical gold and silver on commodities/futures exchanges. Goblins and Wizards both take real gold. Or you can buy Muggle real estate, slap an Anti-Muggle charm on it, and it becomes a magical property! Hey, even Dursley's home can be connected to the Floo network!

Sure, but what about conjuring those rare Earth element metals that actually cost a lot more than gold? Or how about weapon grade Uranium, Plutonium, and Deuterium (heavy water, key ingredient for the Hydrogen Bomb)?

That's actually illegal, but using advance knowledge to buy stocks that go up 100 or 1000 times is not.

**** I concur that wizards would take real gold. However, I don't think this translates to wizarding money in a manner that would be as profitable as just pursuing wizarding methods. Galleons are large coins forged by goblins, which we know impart special properties into that which they create. 1,000 galleons fit in a pocket and are not too heavy. It's clear something is done to gold before it becomes currency.

I'd note that you don't exactly have to pay for muggle real estate if you slap an muggle-repelling charm on it. There's probably a reason why the Weasleys own the burrow.

To clarify, it'd be transfiguration. I added to the confusion by using conjuration myself, for which I apologize. That was supposed to demonstrate the untransmutability of gold. It'd have to be transfiguration as conjuration is temporary (with the possible exception of conjuring vanished items). There are two issues I see with that. One, untranfiguration exists, though I admit this may not be too applicable. Two, it still falls under the issue of the low value of muggle currency.

I'm not sure confundment is actually illegal. Hermione confunds Cormac; Newt confunds a policeman, and the Order regularly confunded Dawlish. I don't recall any laws about counterfeit muggle currency (which to wizards is valueless). In any event, you could probably just conjure a working bearer bond.

Finally, even if the muggle quick-wealth methods are efficacious (which I've noted my doubts about), the wizarding quick-wealth methods seem superior. With the knowledge of canon, I'd simply place a bet at the quidditch world cup (avoiding bagman of course) and rake in wizarding money with less work than muggle methods. Get wizarding money without worrying about the hassle of currency conversion.

***** Yea.... but a Billion USD has just ‘got' to be worth ‘something', right?

There was a guy that would have owned 10% of Apple, had he not sold out for $800 way back when... Take ‘his' place.

Also... it used to not be illegal to take noteworthy domain names that matched companies and then sell them back to said companies, for ‘any' price. McDonald's.com? Anyone?

Get into AOL, Comcast, GE, Apple, Google, McDonald's, Netflix and Bitcoin; and you're set forever in the muggle world. Then drop a cool Billion on Magical Britain (that's 24 metric tons of gold), and see where that gets you. If it's not enough, drop a hundred billion more.

There's NO WAY they won't notice 2,400 metric tons of gold suddenly existing where it wasn't. Bye bye, economy, you will be missed.
