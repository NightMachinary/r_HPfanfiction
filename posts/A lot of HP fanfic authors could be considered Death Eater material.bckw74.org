** The definition of a Death Eater is a thug who uses magic to push an ideology eerily similar to the one of Adolf Hitler, just replacing the Jews with Muggleborn, doing so in the service of their leader Voldemort . Whether they are closer to the Sturmabteilung or the Waffen-SS is debatable, but the parallels are clearly there.

Now, I get the point you are trying to make, but calling a lot of authors material for a fascist street fighting gang is bad taste IMO. Especially since some of the points you raise are stupid. No sane person would fight a war without lethal force. To paraphrase Patton, the objective of a war is not to die for one's country but to make the other guy die for his. I mean, who'd be stupid enough to put themselves into more danger to save the lives of the people who are running concentration camps for a racial minority and have death Squads roam the countryside?

***** I see looking at all the universally agreed upon examples that the word applies to and contrasting them with those who are not agreed to be within the confines of the group to be the best way. It ensures that we get everything within the group while not getting anything that isn't. Such as creating a definition of "Human" that accidentally encompasses sheep or excludes humans with disabilities.

I think part of the issue is that we just don't know what death eaters were really going for. We know about the death of mudbloods and blood traitors, but we don't know the motivation for such things. The analogies to Nazis were blatant. It's part of why Umbridge was a more compelling villain than Voldemort. At least her attacks were personal and explained to a degree.

****** Umbridge ran a carbon copy of a tribunal based on the Nürnberg laws with more severe punishments. She wasn'taa mere thug but would have fit right in with Heydrich and Eichmann.

Generally, the Death Eaters do what their +Führer+ Lord commands, and that happens to be straight from Hitler's playbook. We don't need to know more about them to draw our conclusions.

******* We do need to know more generally. There's a reason we have first degree, second degree, third degree murder, and manslaughter. Sure, they all involved the killing of a human due to another human, but the context and motivation for it matters a lot.

Funnily enough, we don't have that distinction here in Germany. Murder is murder, manslaughter is manslaughter.

*** Right, I'll change the title. I stand by my points though---this was meant to be ridiculous. I actually agree with quite a few of the ideas that I posted, and that self reflection is actually what made me post this.

**** Yet you completely trivialise the canon Death Eaters. I mean, I'm all for Black humour, but your post fails short of being funny, especially since half of your points are unrelated to Death Eaters as we see them in the books or movies.

** Someone writing a story in which Death Eaters win and kill their enemies doesn't mean this is what the author wants to happen in real life at all. Even if your main character is a murdering psycopath, that doesn't make you one (and it doesn't mean you write that stuff because you'd like to do it). Sometimes it's just an interesting exercise to write a story from the villains' point of view.

Although I agree that some fics that go for this go to extra lengths to bash the canonically "good" characters, when it's not really necessary. In occasions it feels like they try to justify their MC's actions by making the others unreasonably petty and over-explaining their side's motivations too much.

Maybe that's what you meant with the post? Because I agree it happens in fanfiction often, and in some stories it seems unnecessary. I'm more partial of just letting your MC be selfish and evil and go after the "good" guys for his own reasons.

***** Lavender is overbearing and possessive, and that girl in book 6 tries to feed harry a love potion. People most definitely acknowledge Ron and Dumbledore's flaws to the point that it borders on hatred. Yes, people hate on slytherin's based on there CANON portrayal more than they should but people so deep in Fanon do the same, just in reverse.

****** Oi, I resent that bit about Lavender. Romilda the rapist is one thing, and she can rot in prison for all I care, but Lavender bravely fought and most likely died in the Battle of Hogwarts. She shed blood, swear and tears to end Voldemort's tyranny. Which, in my book, puts her above any Slytherin character who is not just a name.

So she was an overbearing girlfriend. Yet she also repeatedly got the shitty end of the stick, be it that her pet was killed or Ron spun her along despite not wanting the kind of relationship she was aiming for. People like to bash Lavender far more than she deserves for being overbearing.

****** idk maybe it's because i ship a lot of slytherin/gryffindor pairings and have been bashed for it a lot that i've got this perspective. i also prefer fanon over canon since, as a slytherin, canon isn't too flattering of my house. i see people hate on snape so fucking much and he reminds me so much of myself that it feels like a personal attack.

******* I understand that, I'm a ravenclaw and Canon doesn't portray us all that well either, and fanon even less so with the whole "hazing" business. But Snape is not a good person, almost every choice he made in his life were objectively wrong. He bullies his student and hurt house unity more than dumbledore has. Has he done some good things, yes, but that does not make him a good person.

******** i honestly relate to him mostly because of him being bullied as a kid and wanting revenge, and him being in unrequited love for years, and being irritated by his students not doing things correctly. tbh i probably would've been just as terrible to the students, and it's dumbledore's fault he's a teacher in the first place, a job he didn't enjoy. some people shouldn't work with kids.
