*** Sounds like the average FFN reviewer. Malfoy insulted Harry and he didn't brutally murder him in response? Trash story.

** You think it is "being a wuss" to /not/ straight up killing people whose worst crime to you is insulting you or your family?

That's not even self defence.

Now, I don't truly mind characters in a story killing for revenge, but the original crime has to be bad enough to justify such a strong drive for revenge.

*** Bro... the problem is not to straight up killing them... my problem is that he doesn't do shit to prevent it... you think is bad and it is... in the MUGGLE world but Harry is a lord do you know what happened to people that insulted a lord or a king? Executions...so it bothers me when authors try to make super Harry that already knows his place as Head of the House Potter but still doesn't do anything to clean his name and of the Potter Family. Like I know I exaggerated with Malfoy but Rita Skeeter still gets away with a lot of shit... but had it bees anyone else like Lucius who Really knows his rights it would have been an Honor Duel or blood feud you have to think with their laws not ours...
