Preferably not slash with him having whatever age he was's knowledge in an eleven year old.

Maybe he tries to be his friend to change the future, maybe he keeps an eye on him, maybe he is just biding time to kill riddle at an opportune time.


** I enjoyed Welcome to Hogwarts 1949 linkffn(2550563)

and then there's Past's Player by the Fictionist. linkffn(5736901)

Can't think of any others that don't have slash.

  Harry is accidently transported fifty years back in time through a fluke with the mauraders map. Here he runs into and befriends Tom Riddle, hoping to find his only weakness. No Slash.

  Getting stuck in 1942 was bad. Getting put into Slytherin was even worse. Having Tom Riddle practically stalk him? Harry hated his life. Prequel to Fate's Favourite. [ABANDONED.]
