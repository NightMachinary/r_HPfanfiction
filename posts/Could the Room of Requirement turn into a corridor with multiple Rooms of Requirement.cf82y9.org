Just in case multiple people want to use it at the same time.


** I want to write a story one day of the gang discovering that the Room can house its own copy of Hogwarts, complete with the people living inside. Then, the slow mounting sense of unease as they realise this Hogwarts has its own Room, and so on, culminating with the realization that they might just be another copy.

**** Inception style. The one who opened the room would have control over it, just like the Architect of a dream.

****** They use the Time Turner to go back as far as they can, and realize that it's mere minutes before Colin Creevy introduces his little brother Dennis to Harry.

There is no Colin. There never was. The Room made him to fulfill Dennis's wish to become friends with Harry Potter.

And as long as Harry is his friend, he'll never leave the room and consign everything Harry knows and loves to the void.

******* What would be really cool is that every “person” who was created by the room can't traverse to the other levels of the room, and that was how they figure out who are the creations and who are the copies of real people, because all of the created people are stuck in their own level

** I'd imagine it could, since in DH it apparently made a bathroom within DA headquarters.

** I think it can create a hall or corridor but I doubt each room will have its own capability to do entirely separate rooms, like if Harry wanted a Training Hall with thousands of rooms each with a certain number of dummies and books, sure but I don't think it can Run several separate rooms each with the full suite of enchantments in the same space that would probably cause several paradoxes and kill everyone involved
