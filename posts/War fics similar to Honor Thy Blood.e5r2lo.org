I would like to read some fics with the same sort of comradory and fighting as seen in honor thy blood. By that i mean Harry's fighting partner in Sirius, they are able to banter while also having banter. Doesn't have to be sirius in particular, could be Ron or Neville ect ect. I hope this makes sense...


** I remember picking that story up a couple of years ago when it was being written, but can't recall much of it now.

But if you're asking about stories in which Harry fights Voldemort alongside someone else, then what immediately comes to mind is nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]. It's probably a bit high on humor with a side dish of mild crack, but if you're looking for a fic with good banter and comradeship, then you should give it a chance.

*** Yea man, A Black Comedy is a great fic. I would recommend finishing Honor Thy Blood and also reading some other of the authors fics.

**** I'll definitely put it on my reading list and check out some of the author's other stuff after that.

Since yesterday I've also managed to remember another story that might fit your request. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19334905/chapters/45993925][Messing With Time]] was originally written in 2014-15 and posted to FF.net, but the author migrated to AO3 earlier this year and has posted a new chapter last month. I have hope that it will be continued after a long hiatus.
