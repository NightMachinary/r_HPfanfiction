"Hydrogen injection sequence...green."

"Roger that, initiating infusion of energy type C3 'Water Mana'."

The group of centaurs, each of them dressed in proper pants, horseshoes and lab coats, gathered around the testing chamber to ooh and aah.

"Guys, this is a routine procedure, stop getting so excited about it..." one of the older centaurs grumbled.

"But it's so pretty..." came a reply from one of the people crowded around the chamber.

"Someone's entered the forest."

The atmosphere in the room suddenly grew tense; centaurs turned away from the viewing window and galloped to their computer terminals, bringing up the security feeds.

"No galloping in the war room...er, science room." Magorian, the head of the science lab barked, "Honestly...alright, it's just Hagrid...wait, he's bringing a few students with him? Something's wrong, Bane, Ronan, do you copy?"

--------------

Bane and Ronan grumbled. They had been chosen for 'display duty' tonight, which means that they had to strip naked, pick up their (secretly enchanted) bows, and stand outside a cave (which held a concealed elevator leading down to the centaurs real home), pretending for the humans that they were primitive tribal barbarians. It was humiliating.

Their little invisible earpieces gave off a quiet chime, "Bane, Ronan, do you copy?"

The two looked at each other before Ronan raised a hand to his ear, "This is Ronan, what is it Magorian?"

"Rubeus Hagrid has entered the forest with three...no, four students, and his dog. Can you go and investigate what they're after?"

"Can do." Ronan looked at Bane, who was looking distinctly uncomfortable, "...Let me guess, afraid of being seen naked by the humans?"

Bane nodded slightly, blushing and looking nervous.

Ronan sighed and turned in the direction of Hogwarts, "...I know, I'm iffy too. Just think about...the sky or something. Mars is bright tonight, think about that."


** I can't even imagine how scared Bane would've been when he had to teach Divination for a year.

*** Actually, that was Firenze who came to teach Divination. Maybe the other centaurs were worried that he'd expose the colony's scientific research stuff, maybe he's actually secretly a spy on the humans, or maybe he just creeps everyone else out because he likes being naked around children.

If nudism is a thing with us lowly primates, I don't see why it would be deemed as creepy by a society that had managed to unlock the techmagic tree while also managing to maintain the masquerade in the eyes of other magical races.

Other than that, good writing and story premise.

*** Hmm...who should the viewpoint character be, though?

Should it be a spy spoof with Harry? Slice of life with Bane and Ronan? Inner-struggle-as-whether-to-reveal-the-truth with Firenze? 'What really happened in the forest' with Umbridge?

**** Everyone wants to know what really happened with Umbridge.

Perhaps Firenze was undercover to try and get a hold of her, so they could neutralize the threat she was.
