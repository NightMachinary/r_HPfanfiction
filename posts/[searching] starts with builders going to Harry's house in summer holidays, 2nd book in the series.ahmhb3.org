I started reading this a whole ago so not sure if this is all correct but I think it's the second book in their series and begins with builders going to Harry's house and then he ends up helping them work and possibly finds a snake, I think the snake has some sort of magical ability. I belive this is a popular one but am not sure now as I can't find it anywhere
