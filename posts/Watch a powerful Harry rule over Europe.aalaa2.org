I've been writing HPfanfiction for 15 years in my native tongue. I shifted to English with this fic. I miss my readership - they were the fuel that kept me writing. Time to find English readers - hence, the self-promotion!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13047893/1/Beyond-the-Curtain][*Beyond the Curtain*]] *is some 55k in.*

Some of its key points:

*AU:* Voldemort found out about the Horcrux in Harry's head, leading to devastating consequences. A magical curtain cloaks itself over Europe, separating Riddle's empire from the rest of the world. And Harry becomes essentially immortal. Watch him take advantage of that;

*Adults:* the story takes place in 2019 when most of our beloved characters matured and grown into their magic;

*POV:* the narrator is Neville, the protagonist is Harry;

*Main focus:* Harry and Voldemort and their struggle for power. Bill and Neville and the lives of normal wizards and muggles caught in between the magical titans;

*World-building:* The whole of Europe is my playground. You'll get to explore Europe ruled by Voldemort for the last twenty years. Wizards are in the open, Muggles are- /wait, did you say ruled by Voldemort? Who is it ruled by then, Harry or Voldemort?/

I guess that depends on who you're asking.

*Brevity:* I'm planning to say what I want to say in fewer than 200k words. Watch me inevitably fail at that but hopefully, it won't be by much;

*Language:* I studied English at university and I have a beta-reader. I'm not a native speaker though. I know my grammar and spelling (at least in theory) but I struggle with stylistics and vocabulary. The first few chapters are a bit stiff but I hope I have improved since then.

Pairings: none major

*

The plot is outlined all the way through, all I need is the energy and motivation to keep typing. That's where you come in - if you like the genre, have a look ;)

** So far, I really like this fic. It's got adventure, mystery and action wrapped together nicely. There's nice attention to detail, but not written in a way that takes away from the flow of the story.

The characters themselves are interesting as well, from Neville's team, to Harry's sidekick. There's a proper mix of seriousness and humor that mixes things up a bit.

** I'm enjoying this so far. It's very different from anything else I've read, and I can't wait to find out more about Harry. The Neville point of view is nice, it really adds to the mystery.

Also wanted to say that this is an A+ self-promotion post. There should be a template for this kind of thing here.

Writing this Harry is what keeps me going. He's so much fun and I have so much more to tell you about him!

*** Even I thought it got a vibe of 'To play with the devil'. Especially the ominous 'Who is really ruing Europe'. I half expected the Emperor name if 'Harry Potter', But still the name is just 'The Emperor' without name.

*** The first arc of the story (out of three) is finished. For me, that's a big milestone reached and it motivates me to write further. Breaking the story (or any task, actually) into smaller goals always makes it seem more achievable.

So, I hope I won't disappoint to deliver the rest ;)

One more thing, I'm aware I'm absolutely unnecessary anal retentive about this because English works differently but it just wouldn't work in my native tongue so it always startles me when someone addresses me so, and I guess it's one of those cultural quirks I won't shake off- so, ehm, long story short - I just wanted to point out I'm a girl ;)

Sorry for the rant.

** I remember when you posted a promotion for maybe the first chapter of this? It didn't really grab me but I gave ut a shot now that it has more chapters and I loved it. Hope you can keep the chapters coming cause I need to know what happens next hahahaha.

** Hey, I'm three chapters in and it's been quite nice so far. I enjoy the noir feeling and I'm pretty curious about what happened to the various characters. I just read about Ginny's "suicide" and that raises a lot of questions.

I wanted to PM you on FFN about something but I just made an account and I need to wait 24 hours, but I'm pretty sure I'll forget about it if I don't do it now. At the beginning of Chapter 3, the name of the french newspaper should be "L'heure magique" instead of "La heure magique".

** Added to my following list. I'll read your existing chapters, but I probably won't be around your updates cuz I have too many following stories to keep track with. However no worries as I'll check in from time to time, just to 'bulk up' your updates. Hope you could finish it! English is also not my first language but all I have done are just translations. It takes a lot of courage to start a story in a second language.
