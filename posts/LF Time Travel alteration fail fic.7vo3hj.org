- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045677/1/Foreshadowing-Demise][Foreshadowing Demise]] by Shadowmistress13 is by far one of the most stressful read I had ever came across. Every scene adds another piece to the puzzle and every scene builds up the story. I especially love every character is not exactly black or white, just a whole rainbow full of colors. The story could make you feel amuse to downright tears and every other emotions in between. I just highly recommend this fic. The only downside to this fic is the fact updates are not frequent, however, in the way the story is written, I say it is worth the wait. Plus the author is very persistent when saying to they are not abandoning the story. It updated recently, and I'm content to say that this is one of my top favorite Regulus and Sirius Black fic.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

  Sirius never stopped to think that his brother may not have joined the Death Eaters of his own free will. Or just how thorough a tragedy his death was. Oh the secrets a diary reveals and the unique opportunities a deadly veil offers.

  "I'm Sirius Black," said the boy. "Who the hell are you?" Draco hesitated. Well how the hell was he supposed to answer this? / / Back in 1976, Draco has a lot on his hands...avoiding questions (both students' and teachers'), playing his part well, & trying himself to understand why on earth he was sorted into Gryffindor this time around. It's going to be one hell of a ride. . .

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

Armed with knowledge of the future, Sirius fights to ensure the burden of prophecy doesn't fall on Harry's shoulders... But can he survive the war and keep his friends alive? Completed!

**** You're right. I think for Crossing Lines I was more going for “tr[ing] to fix events using knowledge of a series of things they know went wrong in their timeline”. But the story is decent enough to share at least.

** There was that fic where numerous people in the future, upon seeing how effed up it is because of Voldemort, decide to travel back in time. Problem is that the numerous time-travelers with the knowledge of the future are now suspicious of each other since they know that the others didn't act that way in the past
