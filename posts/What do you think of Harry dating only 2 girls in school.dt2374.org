** Just because someone's good-looking or famous doesn't mean they're going to want to date every girl who shows them a speck of interest. /He/ has to like them too. As well as have the time and interest to date. Which, understandably, Harry didn't always have given the whole bunch of other stuff going on in his life in addition to school.

**** That isn't even what the article is saying, though. What it's saying is that, when solicited by a woman, 25-31% of the men said no. It says nothing about how often each individual man would accept or decline, just that based on the men they asked on a college campus, they got a yes from 69-75%. (Though it doesn't mention this, I assume that the range is taking in to account the margin of error based on their sample of "men on a college campus").

As for the part about women, well, duh. Of course some women were. But the article doesn't say how many said yes and how many said no, all it says is

#+begin_quote
  Intriguingly, women were just as likely to say “yes” to Johnny Depp and “no” to Donald Trump as men were to say “yes” to Angelina Jolie and “no” to Roseanne Barr.
#+end_quote

Which is a statement about comparing the amounts yes/no answers from men and women. It doesn't actually say how often either group said yes or no to any of those people.

Not to mention, for like half of Harry's time in school, people either thought he was insane, attention seeking, or probably evil, with more of that time taking place during his teenage years than his childhood ones.

***** Yes, but given that there would be at ~60 witches in Harry's age+-1, there ought to be more who expressed some kind of interest than the one stalker who tried to roofie him.

  nothing about how often each individual man would accept or decline,
#+end_quote

Presumably, this also depends if they like whose approaching them. The article says that ON AVERAGE, a guy will accept in 3/4 cases. But that's the point, Harry is never even put in a situation where he could accept or decline a date, nevermind casual sex, other than by one crazy. If Harry really had that hero role the earlier books make it out to be, there ought to be more.

** Eh. Given that Harry tended to hate his fame and wealth, and stuck almost exclusively to Ron and Hermione socially? I'm not surprised he didn't date more. Something to also consider is that the school and the wizarding world either loved or hated him depending on the year, and he was at times a complete fucking outcast. This is also before you consider all the dangerous shit Harry got up to at Hogwarts and how it ate up most of his time, energy, and focus. Add in the Dursley's abusive upbringing and you've got a recipe for someone who really isn't going to have much bandwith for dating.

*** It is still odd that the only who pursued him was a girl almost two years younger who tried to rape him. There should have been more interest. Way more. Even Hermione said that Harry was attractive, despite not digging him.

** He is under enormous psychological pressure as there is a super powerful sadistic genocidal maniac after him.

He is also very picky about girls. It's clear from the Books that he wants hot, fun Quidditch girls who almost never cry. Hermione and Luna don't come even close to his stringent standards.

Honestly, Luna is not meant as a love interest.

I feel like this could easily fuel a hedonistic rampage which ends with a bed full of naked people, 500 quid worth of coke and 3 pregnancies.

Yes, if only there was someone like that whom he knew well and had spent a lot of time with.... ^{^{^{^{^{^{Katie}}}}}} ^{^{^{^{^{^{Bell}}}}}} ... But I am sure that there is no one who could fulfil those requirements.

So I am sure that you could arrange something even if the person in question is not Harry's type.

** At first I thought this was an idea for a fic and my sarcastic reply was "Only 2? You must be crazy..."

But seriously, there are 2 obvious problems: for one, Harry isn't actually that social in first place. He doesn't like the attention. Secondly, the fact that he doesn't like attention means that he's going to be really bothered by people who only see him for the Boy Who Lived thing. He'd only start allowing someone in if they make a honest attempt at knowing the actual person behind the BWL image, which will drastically reduce the amount of prospects to what a "regular" person has rather than a celebrity -- and even less, due to the 1st reason.

Remember, the one major case in canon where a date is actually really relevant (the Yule Ball), he does get attention by several girls. He doesn't like it.

** Well I'm guessing the fact that Lord Voldemort was back when he got old enough to date also playdd a big part in it. I mean during 4th year he had a crush on Cho and in the end he went to the Jule Ball with Parvati I think who was pretty keen on hoing with Harry. 5th year he dated Cho which turned out to be pretty awkward but the whole thing did last till january or so and then there was the mass break out of Azkaban. Not to mention that Sirius died at the end of that year so I guess he had other things to think about during the summer and beginning of the next year. He also fell in love with Ginny during the 6th year and still was during the 7th. I'm guessing he didn't want to date anyone else during that time.
