Your standard do-over where Death or someone under Death's employ is telling Harry he gets a second chance at life, to make things better, to be with who he was really meant to be with, to save the people he couldn't save, yada yada yada.

The entity, whoever it is, promises to give Harry every advantage you can think of, including perfect recall of this very meeting.

And the whole time this is going on, Harry is just wanting them to wrap it up so he can move on.

He has already lived his life, and while not perfect he thinks it was pretty good. Sure people he loved died, but that's the way life goes. And who does this prick think they are, going on about how his loving wife wasn't who he was really meant for?

But before Harry can do much more than say, "Now you hold on just a minute," he is sent back to his first year to do it all over.

And he does.

The exact. Same. Way.

Every decision, every action, he even does his best to say conversations the exact same way he had the first time, all in an effort to give the biggest bird to Death any man has managed.


** Okay, but what if Harry made really tiny changes by accident and they butterflied into wildly different outcomes. Like if a slightly misspoken sentence in third year somehow led to Dumbledore living or something.

*** Then you'd get a very strange conversation between Harry and Dumbledore when the headmaster asks him why he seems disappointed that Snape's attempt to kill him failed.

** Sounds like a cool idea but doing everything the exact same way would be entirely boring to read. On the other hand if Death were to take offense to having Harry do everything the exact same way and throw curve balls derailing Harry's plan of sticking it to Death then that would probably be worth the read. But if everything is the same... I'll pass.

*** I agree that reading it from Harrys perspective would be dreadful boring. But, you wouldn't need to do it from Harry's perspective. If you just wrote Deaths reaction to major events that Harry did the same, that would be enough I think.

** I'd love to see a one shot of this, cut to the ending confrontation with death stomping their foot and throwing a tantrum. "I gave you dementors ability to spread cold and the power to fart fireballs and you didn't even use them! You were supposed to date someone else! This was not my OTP!"

** He could also ignore Death and just go away somewhere else leaving the world in perhaps an even greater mess than it already was. We would see Death trying to make him come back by enabling "coincidences".

*** I read one not all that long ago where Harry cleared out, hid his identity with a Fidelius charm and went to America under a false name. Voldemort took over Britain, except for Hogwarts, and Dumbledore eventually tracked Harry down, many years later, and tried to persuade him to come back and fulfill the prophecy by destroying Voldemort.

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.
