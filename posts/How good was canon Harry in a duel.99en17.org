Let's say we're talking about Harry at the 5th book and onward.

It has been a long time since I read the books, I'm struggling to remember.

He was the best in his year, at least. I think. But was he any better than that? The best student at Hogwarts? Capable of matching an average adult wizard? Capable of matching an average Death Eater/Auror?


** I see the word average. You need to be more clear. The 'average' wizard has little to no skill in dueling. Why would they? Its not like bureaucrats in government need to be able to fight.

Harry needs to be able to fight. Even in his first year people were trying to kill him. Harry has far, far more incentive than anyone else to study defence. Average witches and wizards want to avoid touching cursed objects and that's probably about it. They don't know anything about duelling because they've never had the incentive to. Maybe muggleborns who were at Hogwarts while Voldemort was around might be a bit above average but they're no aurors.

Harry has more reason than anyone, and possibly more skill from what we saw in defence than anyone in his year. He has more practical experience after stuff like the Triwizard. That experience amounts to nothing compared to an auror or hit-wizard who are likely better educated, better trained and have more experience. If you're fighting dark wizards you don't do it half-hearted, Harry lacks experience, he lacks knowledge. He might have 'talent' but some people will say talent is a myth. Personally I think that's bullshit but its hard for talent to overcome experience and knowledge.

How good is an average Death Eater? Well we don't know. Who were they before they became death eaters? What else do they do? Why didn't the aurors catch them? We know that Evan Rosier went head-to-head against Moody in what was likely Moody's prime. Moody killed Rosier but lost a chunk of his nose doing so. Was he average or more talented? If he could hurt Moody he'd probably destroy Harry.

Look at the books, was Harry and the lot at the Ministry safe because they could defend themselves or because they had the prophecy and it couldn't be damaged? Did they ever fight or did they just run. Would you call what happened dueling or just chaos?

In sixth year Snape basically plays with Harry. We know he had a fetish for dark magic and was an active Death Eater in the late seventies but how many other Death Eaters does that describe? We know Snape wanted the Defence job and we know he was talented in potions but how much experience did he have? We just don't know.

In Harry Potter knowledge tends to correlate with skill to a large point. Grindelwald, Dumbledore and Voldemort were all the brightest most talented wizards of their ages in their schools. Hermione on the other hand was one of the first to go down in the DoM fight. Harry seems to be better than Hermione in combat. Is he more knowledgeable in defence or do we look at what Hermione said in the first book. 'books, and cleverness, there are more important things.' She lists friendships and bravery as two. We know from the patronus charm and Bellatrix's description of the unforgivables that some spells you need to mean, a mental or emotional part. Perhaps Harry sits in an emotional sweetspot where as Hermione is too detached? We know its not about being a good person or else Voldemort wouldn't have the same talent but there appears to be a special quality that great wizards have.

Wasn't Snape inside Harry's head anticipating all his attacks in that fight? IMO, a competent legilimens could roflstomp pretty much any non-occlumens in a one-on-one duel.

Huh, that seems strange to me. As a Muggle, I am well versed in the ancient and noble art of Muggle fighting, even if I'm just a paper pusher. It's practically a job requirement, and it's a skill I use most every day. I'm not sure why it would be different for wizards.

** It is rather difficult to quantify Harry's dueling or even his magical usage capability when our reference is to individuals who almost always have considerable larger knowledge, training and age in comparison. For example, Dumbledore, Voldy, Snape, Slughorn, Moody, McGonagall, and even Cedric all have had */years/* of practice and learning to be able to hone their wand work and magic far more than Harry. Having said that however, canon Harry does seem considerably stronger than the "average" student in his age group.Also, there are elements that would affect his magic usage as a whole too, I imagine. We really don't know all the negative impacts the horcrux inside him had and what had changed after it was destroyed inside him. Was it affecting how he used magic in general or was his magic strained in trying to contain it inside him? Furthermore, the whole magical development of one's self is obscure, does it grow with age like our own physiological and neurological development or is it set at birth...

** Decent. He's athletic, and he's practiced. He doesn't know many esoteric spells, and he doesn't have the sheer breadth of tactics that Dumbledore and Voldemort do. But he's pretty good at pointing a stick, shouting /Stupefy!/ and dodging.

Which sounds like faint praise, but in a regular battle that will win you 90% of fights.

*** Seconding this. One of his first descriptors is that he is faster than he looks. He can dodge things and he can draw his wand pretty fast. We know from him being a great Seeker that his reflexes are good. If he's better than his opponant at both those things, then he can probably escape a duel. If his opponant can cast their spell faster, though, then I don't see Harry winning. At least before he trains more anyway.

** Most of the adults are completely incompetent at anything at all.

Harry has almost 0 experience dueling anybody. He has a couple of scuffles that's it.

Book 1 he doesn't duel anybody. He touches Quirrell. Book 2 he "duels" Malfoy. That duel consists of getting hit with a weak expelliarmus and then sending a weak one in return. And then the snake bit. Later in the scary underground chamber He throws his wand away. Book 3 had the dementors and Sirius Black. He doesn't duel at all. Shows 1 good patronus the entire book. Book 4 he and Draco cast 1 spell apiece at one another. Doesn't show anything special I still besides flying in the 1st task. He goes to the graveyard and his 'duel' with Voldemort is Harry being hilariously out classed (although understandable). Voldemort toys with him until the plot armor hits.

Book 5 he shows some talent but to be honest it's more about the death eaters being adults and therefore morons in the prophecy hall. Book 6 shows a little skill vs Draco and none vs Snape. Book 7 Harry shows some skill but not anywhere near incredible or prodigal skill vs the death eaters in the coffee shop, no skill vs the snatchers or at Malfoy Manor. He's nonexistent in the battle of Hogwarts and won because the wand against him was his.

In short Harry is nothing special or brilliant. None of the students at Hogwarts are special or brilliant at dueling. Saying Harry is the best dueler at Hogwarts is equal to being the best in the local county show.

She's always presented as being just notches below the Dumbledore-Voldemort level (she even blocks some of Dumbledore's spells if I recall). By all rights she should have lost much more than Sirius, who had an Animagus form to blunt some of the Dementors drain. But alas, it's not mentioned...

Everyone on Voldemort side who came out of Azkaban retained all or some of their sanity. Would love to know how that happened. Maybe Bella has 0 happy memories and thus is unaffected by dementors. Maybe Voldemorts union with Dementors carried on through the lull in the "war" and the dark mark acted as a beacon to avoid.

******** Well, there're several things in Bella's favor. First, dementors eat positive emotion, and the dark arts are fueled by negative. Building off this, Sirius is somewhere in the neutral greys in alignment terms to Bella's definite dark alignment, so it's reasonable to assume his arsenal is smaller, or he at least has less master of the dark arts. Third, and this is purely head canon, Bella probably practiced High Black Magic to some extent, and I think that would build up some sort of tolerance to the aura of constructs made of black magic.

********* Only the Unforgivables require negative emotions (emotions in general are not necessary for spellcasting). Bella is not devoid of positivity, nor is Sirius's spellcasting literally limited by his moral alignment (he's obviously going to choose not to cast certain spells). But people highly skilled at defense against the dark arts are also skilled at the Dark Arts. Harry didn't have any trouble casting a very dark spell on Draco, Sectumsempra, for instance.

I mean, the Patronus was a post NEWT spell that took a lot of power and was something most adults couldn't do, yet he mastered it in the 3rd book driving off a large number of Dementors. Suddenly, in book 5, everyone can do it.

So from that, we know he's athletic and has good reaction times. This is only supported by him being a great seeker. He held his own in every duel he was in. 15 yr old Harry survived (and barely got injured, if at all) facing off against several death eaters. He was faster than Draco in HBP. He won against the DEs in the beginning of Deathly Hallows, and later against the Malfoys and Bellatrix. Lost against the Snatchers, though. Didn't sustain any injuries during BoH (if you don't count dying lol) among all the chaos. He'd also fought against magical creatures when he had to. All in all, I think he was absolutely capable of matching (and besting) average Death Eaters and wizards; he was raised to fight bc it was a necessity.
