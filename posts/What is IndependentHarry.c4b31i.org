What makes a fic independent Harry fic in your opinion? What is required for it to be an indy!Harry fic?

I've thought of writing one but I was curious what made a fic qualify.


** A fic where Harry is far more independant than in canon. He doesn't need Ron or Hermione, is more cunning, finds ways to learn advanced magic, and keeps secrets from everyone (whether warranted or not).

Has a tendancy to include a lot of Diagon Alley shopping trips, sealed wills, Dumbledore/Weasley (and occasionally, Hermione) bashing, multiple houses, multiple vaults, and of course, the Order stealing money from his accounts.

*** But is the bashing really required?

**** No, but some writers default to it to show how "badass" Harry is, or to give a reason why he's keeping secrets from them.

** To me it's a Harry that thinks for himself rather than passively being drawn into others' schemes. It can range from less trust of Dumbledore to outright rebellion. I think Indy Harry can be light, grey, or dark as long as he has agency.

The other factor I like is when he's more of a leader than an equal to his comrades.

** My view on Indy!Harry is that it's when he becomes independent of Dumbledore. He separates from Dumbledore/Order and tends to create a third fraction where he's still opposed to Voldemort however doesn't agree with Dumbledore's way of handling the conflict. Sometimes it's painted as more “grey” where he's willing to use darker magic or ally himself with pure bloods, especially if you're working in Lord Potter and various noble houses into the story.

** I'm not entirely sure myself, but given the name I'd assume it mostly revolves around him freeing himself from dependence on those who tended to guide his actions in canon and choosing his own route instead.

Often with a ludicrous inheritance and a good dose of Mary-Sue-style realism immunity, though I'd say these particular ingredients are unnecessary.

** - Harry opposes both Voldemort and Dumbledore and a number of people join him in that cause.

- Harry advances in magical development, to become at least as good at magic as were Snape/James/Sirius etc.

- Wizarding Britain is an aristocracy and Harry has a place in that aristocracy.

- Harry is, or becomes, very rich.

- Harry's love interest is a Slytherin.

*** I like fics where he advances in magical development. I still think the themes could have been present, but without him always needing a rescue. Plus I like Harry and co. figuring out how to get rid of the Horcrux that isn't stupid. Maybe a youthful, flexible perspective on things.

Fics like bashing Dumbledore, but good writing makes him a sympathetic flawed figure. Harry shouldn't blindly follow, but the man is over a century old and has a ton of knowledge.

** Taure has a thread on here and DLP about this. You should check it out so as to avoid the pitfalls YOB1991 mentioned.
