I've recently read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/The-Black-Heir][The Black Heir]] and I like the concept of Sirius being a father.

In this story, Sirius basically managed to have a secret relationship with Lily. Due to being from a dark family, Sirius and Lily decided to break it off. Sirius later escapes from Azkaban and finds Harry Potter, who ran away from the Dursleys. They later find out that they're father and son through the Black Family Tree. They go to Moscow and Harry eventually goes to Durmstrang.

Harry could either be adopted, blood adopted, or be actually biologically his.


** linkffn(9566537) ... although this is post-DoM-battle so Sirius is dead. On the other hand, it is really great story.

  What if Harry had waited ten more minutes and said goodbye to the waitress in HP/HBP? Prequel, "What We Had," is now up on my page!

** linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black) has some weird shit going on, where at the start Harry finds out that /he/ was Sirius' /daughter/ all along. Would've been the plot twist of the century if it wasn't in the name and author notes.

  Harry felt he had lost his chance at family after watching Sirius fly away only for his godfather to show up during the summer. Sirius teaches Harry what he needs to know, helping him become the true Lord Potter. Then the Tri-Wiz comes and the deepest, darkest secret of the Marauders is revealed - Harry was born the daughter of Lily and Sirius. Eventual Fem!HarryxTonks

  Voldemort has made a bargain with Harry to stop killing muggles and muggle-borns (when at all possible, of course) in exchange for Harry's cooperation. While Harry thinks he's using the time to find a way to defeat the Dark Lord, he will realize that Voldemort is always one step ahead, and so long as he isn't killing anyone...what's the big deal? He has bigger things to worry about now, anyway. Includes dementors, pureblood culture, the prophecy, what exactly happened with Lily's sacrifice, magical breakthroughs, children Death Eaters, and portraits of family. Final pairing: H/D. Sequel to Black, in the Smothering Dark. Beta'd by laureen@livejournal.
