Bit of a weird question, but what information that was provided from outside the books do you like?

There's a snippet from a Daily Prophet article shown in the Philosopher's Stone film that reads:

#+begin_quote
  Barry Wee Willie Winkle celebrates his 755th birthday in style tonight by throwing a huge party for all the wizards and witches he has ever known. 30 million are expected to attend tonight.
#+end_quote

Or from the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/source/other-canon/dp/dp3/][Daily Prophet Newsletters]]

#+begin_quote
  "I thought we were all getting along fine until I heard the first explosion."
#+end_quote

I dunno, I like these sorts of things, they feel really HP and are fun to read. I'd kind of like to see more stories reference these sorts of things, even in passing. Or maybe take a bit here and there from the games (I recently took a potion from the games).


** Dumbledore's line from the film-Half Blood Prince:

#+begin_quote
  But magic, especially Dark magic...leaves traces.
#+end_quote

I feel is an nice addition to canon. People often ask why Voldemort simply didn't create his Horcrux as a piece of sand and toss it onto the beach or ocean. But based on this information Dumbledore would still be able to find it, only it would not be as protected and it wouldn't be as removable in a crisis. So it wouldn't really ever be a solution. This goes beyond the arrogant explanation which is sufficent in of itself but I do feel this adds another touch to it.

*** I honestly don't see how that would change things. Maybe you can detect the pebble horcrux from a kilometer off, but it's located at some random point in the Atlantic. If it takes one second to Apparate and detect, it would take you over three years to find it -- assuming it's on the surface.

I would rather think the ego and the manner of protection are beneficial or required for horcruxes.

After all, Death Eaters don't know where Voldemort is, but when he activates the Dark Mark on their arms, they can teleport to where the feel him in an instant. And wizards don't seem affected by water pressure (could probably mitigate it even if they do, so Apparition seems like it'd make finding a pebble Horcrux pretty easy if they're Aurologists.

That is, you can't sit at home in Devon and consult the auras and figure out that the horcrux is located at exactly 21.182°W, 4.884°N. You have to be close enough to consult auras, or to cast a revealing spell, or to feel the horcrux taint, or whatever it takes to detect it.

If you know for certain that the horcrux is somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean but you don't know where, you need to get within "close enough" meters of every single point in the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic Ocean measures 106,400,000 square kilometers.

****** You misunderstand me. My point with the Dark Mark Apparition example is that there are ways of magically tracking things from arbitrarily long distances, getting their exact coordinates and teleporting there. The Death Eaters don't know where Voldemort is beforehand, he can be across the country or in another country altogether. But the mark activating gives them enough information to appear there (well, they'd need repeated jumps if it's in another country).

Or for an even more useful example, if you just chucked a Horcrux into the Atlantic (without any other protections) and someone has a suitable version of [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/MACUSA_Real-Time_Hex_Indicator_map][this]] for dark magic , they can find its precise location. I'm not talking about traipsing about the Atlantic until you get close enough to feel it but having a magical means of knowing exactly where it is (whether by following a magical trail or having a map of sorts).

Would've been great if you had objected to the "if you can detect it within a kilometer" part rather than the "it would take three years" part, then.

#+end_quote

Voldemort designed the Dark Mark as a locator, because that was wise: it let his followers (and only his followers) gather quickly for meetings, and he didn't have to spread the word among them through normal, slow, interceptable means. He wouldn't design a horcrux as a locator, because that would be foolish: giving his enemies a way to locate them would hasten his demise.

Or, if he had designed the same location system into the horcruxes as the Dark Mark, then the horcruxes could always locate each other. That wouldn't let Dumbledore (for instance) locate them trivially, any more than he could detect the Dark Mark on Scabbers.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Well, they could find its vague location, at least; that map seems to have a resolution around 8km.

Assuming they did the work to produce a map like that. Assuming you can make that kind of map for detecting a horcrux that its owner tried to keep hidden.

How long did it take MACUSA to build that map? And that's a government working on a project they could use for decades, on territory under their control, and somewhat under a tenth as much area as the Atlantic Ocean. But maybe it's the sort of thing a bright student could do as a hobby project in a couple of weekends.

Even in the most generous case, it doesn't make it better to put your horcrux in a shack that your mother's family owned than to put it deep in the ocean. On par at best.

** Random thoughts:

1. *A basilisk is the second most dangerous creature. The nundu is the most dangerous.* How exactly they determined this I have no idea. I just imagine magizoologists creating one of those tv shows where they pit a crocodile against a great white shark or something.
2. *The only spell that is unblockable with magic is also the only one that needs to hit only once.* My isn't that convenient?
3. *Good and evil are color-coded*. That one is pretty clear. I would love to live in a world where all I needed to know was that if I have a question, I ask the person in blue or bronze. If someone is evil, I just have to see if they are wearing green, silver or black.
4. *Unicorn hair sells for 10 galleons, but Olivander's wands cost 8 galleons (give or take).* No wonder the Malfoy's are rich. I hope no one ever involves Mrs. Rowling in fiscal policy of the U.K.

Edit: Just try telling me you are not now imagining a Nundu and a basilisk throwing down over who is king of magical beasts.

The minute you step onto the bridge, you see tons of signs for the suicide prevention hotline. I figure if there's a place in SF where Dementors would hang out, it'd be that bridge. The paper doesn't even report on the suicides anymore, even though there are dozens every year because they don't want to plant the idea in anyone's head.

They're finally starting work on a suicide barrier after years of debate about costs and aesthetics. A few years ago a film crew set up cameras and recorded every jump for a year. The documentary “Fatal Beauty” came out of that.

***** They are able to breed, but they are non-gendered and seemingly amortal (neither alive nor dead). Breeding in cases of non-gendered creatures usually involves them splitting in some form after attaining a large enough size (such as bacteria or certain plants). And we know the dementors start breeding significantly when they are given greater reign to assault/attack the population of Britain (it seems unusual to Fudge, so they were not able to do so as much beforehand).

Another possibility I see is that when a human has their soul sucked out, when they die a new dementor is born (the soul cannot move on to the afterlife but does not become a ghost). This is why they cannot be killed.

#+begin_quote
  One young Canadian boy earlier asked her how Dementers breed.

  "I was just so pleased that he thought about it and pleased that I had the answer," Rowling told The Canadian Press.

  These evil creatures don't, by the way, breed but grow like a fungus where there is decay.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-canadianpress-moore.htm]]

This fits well with Dementors increasing in numbers when they are given freedom - it's a cycle, where their presence causes people within the proximity to fall into depression and despair, resulting in the area decaying, which in turn creates more Dementors.

It may seem crazy not to make your horcrux(es) into mundane objects.

  'However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.'

  'And they could be anything?' said Harry. 'They could be oh, in tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles...'

  'You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things, suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with some care, favouring objects worthy of the honour.'

  'The diary wasn't that special.'

  'The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the heir of Slytherin. I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.'

I've hinted at it in my story, but we'll see if I get an opportunity for my heroes to actually meet him in the incredibly ancient flesh! Also from the newspapers, there's something amazing about the entire /Ginger Witch/ mythos, of course.

And the newspapers in /Fantastic Beasts/ referred to the branch of detective magic that explores the sinister auras left behind by Dark Magic (as we see Dumbledore perform it in the Cave of the Inferi) as “Aurology”, which I, and many others, have started using. It fills a gap, and unlike certain terms we have been forced to use (/cough/ wards /cough/) it actually /is/ sort of canon.

The movies showed a portrait of a young Minerva McGonagall in the Gryffindor Common Room. It was probaby nothing more than a cameo, but it seemed such an odd but intriguing departure from the "portraits are made for /dead/ people" tradition that I decided to worldbuild a whole explanation for it. Basically, I decided that she, the old closet romantic, had that portrait made right after breaking up with Dougal MacGregor, so that no matter if /she/ changed over the years, there would still be a /version/ of her out there that remembered how vividly she had loved Dougal. Then when she became a Hogwarts Professor she decided to give the Portrait a practical use by having her watch the Common Room on her behalf, and report back to her real self on egregious rule-breaking. Of course, being younger and less strict than the flesh-and-blood one, that version of Minerva has made friends with some students and sometimes lets things slide that the real one wouldn't...

I think people tend to forget that both Albus Dumbledore and Gilderoy Lockhart (as well as, I'm fairly sure, other famous witches and wizards, like Newt Scamander) had portraits painted of them when they were [still] alive in the books. The portraits would be used for Chocolate Frog Cards, book covers, etc...so the "portraits are made for /dead/ people" tradition definitely tends to forget these instances.

The Chocolate Frog Card pictures strike me as being different in nature from the Portraits, to be clear. I highly doubt the Portrait-Dumbledore who walks amongst the Cards is the same individual who was kept in the Headmasters' Closet and released upon Dumbledore's death.

And yes, Lockhart did have a bunch of portraits of himself made, but Lockhart is Lockhart. He would totally kick traditions in the backside to get a bit more ego-stroking. It was more surprising to have stickler-for-the-rules McGonagall break the tradition, and within Hogwarts at that.

***** My impression was that the Chocolate Frog Card parent company commissioned a magical portrait of Dumbledore, which was then used as a direct reference (similarly to how a mold is made for mass producing objects made of plastic and resin) for mass production of the cards themselves.

If this is the case, another portrait of Dumbledore would likely exist somewhere in said company's private archives.

We know it's a magical portrait, because the Dumbledore within the Card portraits seems to have the same abilities (sans talking, it seems) as regular magical portraits do. I'd say that the same goes for Lockhart, or any other witch or wizard who has a "living portrait" of themselves done.

We also know that moving pictures are the "norm" for the wizarding world, as they're developed using a solution that gives them magical properties. Yet before the invention of the camera, witches and wizards would've /had/ to have "magical portraits" of themselves made while they were still alive.

(Not to mention that the wealthy / rich getting portraits of themselves by commissioning popular artists was the norm for centuries in the Muggle world, and before the Statute of Secrecy, many witches and wizards, like the Malfoys*, often directly intermingled in "high-class" Muggle society and social circles.)

It was also always my impression that Hogwarts Headmasters also had magical portraits commissioned of themselves, while they were still alive, and then enchanted them to automatically appear in the Headmaster's office for when they would ultimately pass away.

Since the Headmaster Portrait's Portrait-Person is supposed to not communicate with the world and just talk with the Headmaster until the Headmaster's death, at which point they (along with their frame) are unveiled, it would be most peculiar for that same Portrait-Dumbledore to have also been the one gallivanting across Chocolate Frog Cards, no?

Is it explicitly mentioned in the books that the pictures on the Cards are /paintings/? In the movies, they are living /photographs/, which would conveniently solve that conundrum. And we do know magical photographs can be made to be just as alive as Portraits or nearly so (from the numerous photographs Lockhart had, which weren't just stuck on repeat but had their own feelings on whatever he said).

We also know that the Gryffindor boys expect the players in Dean Thomas' West Ham poster to move and presumably none of them would think Muggles would get a magical portrait done.

I'd assume that all magical drawings/paintings/photography moves by default and there are different levels of animation/sentience, with magical portraits being at the top but also being the hardest to produce.
