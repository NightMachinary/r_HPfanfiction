I did do a search, and no one specifically looked for this:

I'm looking to see if there are any good Harry/Harem fics. A few catches:

- Would prefer no smut to be involved, but if it has to be its fine
- Would also prefer Hermione NOT to be in the Harem
- Would prefer Fleur to be in the Harem and to be a primary member
- Must be complete or regularly updated

Thanks guys!

Defeats the purpose of a harem story, methinks.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5790760/1/Searching-For-The-Power]]) (lots of smut, no Fleur, but Gabrielle plays important role)

** The closest thing to a good harem fic that doesn't have Hermione as a member would be Whispers in the Night. Writting is actually decent. However the story seems to get clogged up with all the extra women the author adds to the pairing. Fleur does have a big role in the story. But primary focus of the harem, I'm not so sure.

No smut. Hermione is not in the harem, just a friend. Three years complete (here's is just the first year). Fleur is not there yet, since it's only the first three years.

To be honest, I really like this series. But I'm not sure if it's a guilty pleasure or a true great one.

** The only harem that I remember that I found to be somewhat good was linkffn(Whispers in the Night)

It contains, for me, one of the saddest and heartbreaking scenes that I've read, but curiously enough, this isn't a fic that I enjoy. I did read for about 80% of what was released at the time (it was about 1 1/2 years ago that I read it.)

Fleur took a long time to get into it, but she's one of the "main" when she finally does get into it. There's a lot of smut though, nothing too majorly graphic (If I'd have to rate it, a smutfic would be 10, Canon would be 0, this would be a 7.5).

I think what made me dislike this so much was the Dumbledore bash/hate.

I like Dumbledore and I love when he's a competent villain . I hate it when authors make him to be inefective or old stupid GG Dumbledore. The dude was a fucking chessmaster in canon and ruthless. You can't say he's stupid and not make me dislike your work.

The Harem is primarily Daphne, Susan, Tonks and Fleur. Also, Bill is a really nice dude in this, and so is Amelia. Hermione exists, isn't bashed, but isn't part of the harem, she's with a Slytherin, either Blaise or Theo, can't remember.

Oh, I remember now what turned me off from this fic. Wasn't just the Dumbledore part. I hate when Harry goes into that "I don't know what is love because no one loved me while growing up"

You might not know how to tell that what you feel is love, but you sure as shit can understand (by obsevation alone) what love makes people do, and if people are doing shit that only someone who loves you, its clear as crystal why.
