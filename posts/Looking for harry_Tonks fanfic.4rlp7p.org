I have read a couple of Harry/Tonks fanfic but I haven't found any where they meet during Harry's 1st year and date later on.


** linkffn(7746111) has them meeting first year. It's in the upper-tier of readable harry/tonks fics, but that's honestly not saying much. There's others where they meet year 1, but it usually involves nonsense like tonks being de-aged and in the same year as him (or in the year above).

  In his quest to stop Malfoy in his sixth year, Harry turns to an old friend for help. Along the way he finds new allies, a Horcrux, & someone to stand by his side. Alternate view of HBP. Rating for language & violence.

*** Such a shame, too. I always thought Tonks was an interesting character to work from.

*** It's actually a great fic. Shame it's abandoned, though.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry
