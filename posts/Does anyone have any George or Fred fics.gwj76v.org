** There's a fic on Wattpad called Tightly Knit which is Fred/OC. It's very AU though, in case you wanted fics closer to canon. George get some romance later on in the series (really later on).

PS: whatever you do, don't read the comments. There are spoilers everywhere and most of them are important plot points.
