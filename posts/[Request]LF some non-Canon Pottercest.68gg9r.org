Means, Harry isnt married or together with Ginny but with an other Woman and their Family have activities. Untill now, i only know "Potter Family Secret" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493173/1/Potter-Family-secret]] There he is with Daphne, but are there more out there? If in some Fics they divorce and Ginny keeps the Potter name, i wouldnt mind reading from "her" side too.


** Pottercest is slang for potter-incest, so just to clarify, you don't want incest fics?

**** Doesn't seem like it, the fanfic in the OP is about Harry and Daphne. Probably got the term wrong ;)

***** I started reading it and six paragraphs in Harry and Daphne's kids watched them have sex and the daughter started lusting after him. I stopped there.

***** I didnt got anything wrong. Read the first few Sentences "Daphne Potter", so its Pottercest, no matter if its Canon (Harry/Ginny) or not. Harry married a Woman whos name is not Ginny, she take his Family name, they are a potter Family. Ok, alternatively Harry take his Wifes name...i would still call it Pottercest, since he is the last "Heir" of his Family.

****** Yeah, well, as you specified "non-canon Pottercest" I assumed you meant something different, because there isn't any incest in the canon books to begin with. When you then went on to mention the pairing "Harry and Daphne" and didn't mention sexual relations between Harry and his children additionally, that led me to believe you were simply looking for stories where Harry marries someone else.

******* If im looking for Pottercest, its always With Harry/Ginny and their kids. Yes, incest isnt canon in the Books, but the later Potterfamily is....so...

** Did you really need to clarify that the incest fics you want to read need to be non-canon?

**** First off, I sincerely hope you meant post-epilogue.

Second, that still wouldn't be canon.

***** Yeah, i meant post-epilogue. And i call it Non-Canon because thats what it is: Harry/Ginny = Canon. Im looking for the Non-Canon stuff

****** I was replying to [[/u/BobVosh][u/BobVosh]] with the post-epilogue comment.

My point to you was that all incest is non-canon so your request was redundant.

edit: minor fix

** Not sure if that fits your request, but here Harry and Ginny are separated, and the story is about how Harry and Luna get together. linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/31644]])
