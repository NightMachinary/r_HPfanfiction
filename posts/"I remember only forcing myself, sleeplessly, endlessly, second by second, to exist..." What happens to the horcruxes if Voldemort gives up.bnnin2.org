This might be a dumb question, but what do you think?

I was thinking about what if things went different (say Quirrell never visited Albania), and either time or a combined Dumbledore and Harry team bring about the end of Voldemort's shade.

My understanding is that Horcruxes are basically protected soul anchors, preventing the someone (ie. their soul or the true/main soul) from departing to the afterlife. So do the fractured soul pieces leave/die/disintegrate? If so do the enchantments continue or fail because their purpose is non-existant? Do the soul pieces and enchantments stay and continue as is? Could then any of the Horcrux soul pieces come back, only the Diary due to special enchantments, or no because again the main/true soul is departed and the fragment/anchor is stuck. (And for that matter would anything alter in the afterlife? canon Limbo(?), weakest most powerless being in the normal afterlife, or what?)

Would love to read what I'm missing/where I'm wrong, or whatever your own thoughts/head canon/fanon is.

  "That's a problem we're going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing or crushing a Horcrux won't do the trick. You've got to put it beyond magical repair."

  "But even if we wreck the thing it lives in," said Ron, "why can't the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?"

  "Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being."

  Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on, "Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn't damage your soul at all."

  "Which would be a real comfort to me, I'm sure," said Ron.

  "It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched," said Hermione. "But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can't exist without it."

.

The soul pieces will stay inside and stuck to the soul vessel until the vessel itself is destroyed beyond magical repair. If it isn't, then it hangs around for eternity. That's the whole point of putting a soul piece into a vessel/phylactery.

I don't think it's in character for Voldemort to "give up". He doesn't give up. He is obsessed with immortality and viscerally afraid of the Next Great Adventure™. Even if his main soul piece is destroyed, killed, shoved through the Veil, etc, nothing will change the state of the horcruxes unless they are found and destroyed too. The horcruxes' entire purpose is to just... exist.

Sure, but it was just a hypothetical. We know he wouldn't /really/, but if he (or someone in his situation) /did/, what /would/ happen? is the question.

**** Then the main piece (the untethered) will dissipate while the rest of the horcrux exist as is. Like if Diary Tom got out, there's no main soul nor other him floating about bless the rest of the horcrux was awaken

*** thanks, makes sense. I'm a sucker for the idea of restoring the horcruxes, but canon-wise it seems, as you say, the container must be destroyed.

** As usual I suspect the answer is that JKR isn't too great at having a coherent vision of magic. My headcanon is that it's incredibly taxing a for a horcruxed soul have to force themselves to exist, but they are compelled by the magic of the horcrux do so.

** I think it's more that he had the /sensation/ of having to constantly force himself to exist. Sort of like a Sisyphean curse, he could stop at any time, but because it's him, he never will.

​

Actually, given all his dodging of death, I wonder if Sisyphus was a source of inspiration...

** I do think that what would have happened to Voldemort Prime if he had "given up" would be that he have lost his grasp of the mortal plane and gotten mired in limbo. This wouldn't have done anything in particular to the Horcruxes, I think --- continuing with the metaphor of the anchor, just because the tether that binds the anchor to the boat has been severed, doesn't mean the anchor is going anywhere.

The Diary was optimized to possess people by Voldemort, but I think that any Horcrux could have done it given the chance. The Locket definitely seems to be in the process of taking over Ron when he pulls himself together and destroys it.

** Cogito ergo sum, basically. If he gave up his consciousness, his soul would still go on, but he would cease to be Voldemort the person, and just devolve into a sort of mindless malevolent force.

** He probably would 'survive' I think. His conscious would fade, but using the resurrection ritual would work and bring him back. The main difference is he would have no say in the matter
