So in OOTP, Harry finally discovers that James really was an ass and bully to Snape via the Occlumency lessons. There is definitely a realization by Harry that Snape was bullied by James much like Harry was bullied by the Dursleys, and later on, by Draco and co.

Has there ever been a fic where Harry changes Snape's opinion of him by honestly and emotionally apologizing for James? Admitting that he, Harry, has been on the bad end of bullying and he identifies with Snape. Throughout the series, similarities between Snape and Harry come up again and again. (Note: this is not to say Harry exonerates Snape for his behavior)

** Why would a son have to apologise for the action of his father? Mine rape 2 child and killed multiple people do I have to apologise for his action, I do not. Snape was a fucking ass who could not get over some petty hugh school things. Ive been bullied all my scholarity and never have anyone apologise for what they did. I got over it and do not plan to bully in the near futur.

  Curious, and more than a little frustrated by the fact that Dumbledore and others are keeping him in the dark about everything, Harry takes a peek into Snape's Pensieve. Instead of learning the truth about what he's certain is being kept from him, Harry learns that his father is every bit as conceited as Snape had claimed that he was, and that he's more like Snape than he is his own father.
