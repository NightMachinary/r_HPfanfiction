Harry Potter is the adopted son of Benson and as a result, he is acquainted with Mordecai, Rigby, and the park workers. the summer before what would have been fifth year, Dumbledore finally finds him after spending so much time searching for him in Europe.

But, my idea of a crossover between two worlds is Harry behaves completely what is regular for a 15 year old. No lordship, harem, gary stu, or anything not regular. Although he will be able to use magic, his magical abilities are average at best. Here is a dialogue I can imagine Harry saying to others is he does go to Hogwarts.

​

Harry to the students at Hog's Head- "Hold on, guys. What makes you all think I'm even remotely qualified to tutor you all? I never went to Hogwarts or any magic school before this semester. Heck, I can barely do a spell right without needing to read the instructions again. Listen, find someone else to tutor you guys in the dark arts, alright?"

​

The crossover can have some classic Regular Show shenanigans such as magical keyboards, extremely hot wings, or a floating head. Anyways, you can put your ideas on what should be included into this crossover idea.
