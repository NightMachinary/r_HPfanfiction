I am currently working on a fic where I'd like to start from the middle, that is to say, the main character has a past which I'd like to tell as well as the main story which continues from where 'the past' ends. Is it okay to write a 'present' chapter followed by a 'flashback' chapter followed by a 'present' chapter and so on?

I personally don't like that method much and would appreciate the thoughts of fellow writers/readers.


** It can work - it depends on the details, of course. A story where you regularly flip back and forth would in my opinion, work better than a few lengthy flashbacks introduced in other chapters. But you might consider simply starting at the beginning, or just explain the past in the present instead.

I planned something similar - flashbacks - for "Divided and Entwined", but dropped the idea since it was simply too much to cover in flashbacks (40 chapters once I was done).

*** This makes me wonder how much flashbacks should reveal. In general, do you find it better that flashbacks generally give a very clear-cut look into the past, or do you think it is better to make readers have to put the pieces together?

**** A flashback should be clear cut - as far as the scene we see is concerned. It doesn't mean that we have the correct impression of the scene, lacking context.

** This is totally a personal preference, but I love it when a writer just writes as if the backstory is already known to the reader. That way i get to experience the present flow of time without any jarring interruptions, while I also get to piece together the facts about the world as I go. This way makes me feel very immersed into a story and somehow makes the world feel more authentic than if everything is just explained to me ad nauseam.

Of course the skill is in writing things in such a way that they feel like you're just mentioning appropriate facts to the situation, while really you're doing exposition of the world.

** There are a lot of people who like that, but personally, I feel like someone is scraping their fingernails on a chalkboard when trying to read stories laid out like that.

** Personally, I can see the appeal of that method to a writer (and indeed I've used something like that in an unpublished fic), but as a reader it tends to bother me. It can be done well, of course, but oftentimes it is not. My biggest complaint is usually that authors use this invisible time period to pull out deus ex machinas to save themselves when they write themselves into a corner. Basically, writing in the "middle" of the fic can be done well, but if there's something game-changing in the past, it should probably be at least alluded to or else it will come across as bad writing.

** Well quite a few seasons of Arrow got away with it. I'd be inclined to skip the flashbacks in the fic. How much of the flashbacks do you really need to tell your story? How much can be just inferred or left a mystery?
