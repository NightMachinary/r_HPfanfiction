*** Harry is upset that Pettigrew escaped during third year, this pushes him to try and become stronger, he gets betrayed by most of his friends 4th year (similarly if not the same as in canon).

This betrayal leads him to search for a friend, an equal if you will (Fleur) and they basically take on the world. Don't wanna give too much away incase you decide to read it. One of the best styles of writing I have seen in a fanfiction before too.

***** That doesn't help.

Also, that might be true if realistic meant canon compliant. What I meant was considering all the shit that he went through would he not be different?

In canon he was a good little teenager but you would think some the things that happened would have an effect.

Treated pretty much like a slave all his childhood, treated like a crazy murdered by most of the school for his second year, his friends outcasted him for 4th year (they may have come around but it should leave a lasting impression that his closest friend was willing to all but sever the relationship from jealousy), slandered by the government and the school during 5th year.

This all happened during his developmental years, shouldn't it have affected him?

****** It did effect him. Your characterization of Harry stems from some misunderstandings. He wasn't a slave to the Dursleys he was the unwanted stepchild. He wasn't abandoned by his friends, Ron and Harry had a fight, as friends do, then made up and their relationship was stronger for it. As for what happened during CoS I'll refer to the text.

#+begin_quote
  Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, ‘Make way for the heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through ...'

  Percy was deeply disapproving of this behaviour.

  ‘It is not a laughing matter,' he said coldly.

  ‘Oh, get out of the way, Percy,' said Fred. ‘Harry's in a hurry.'

  ‘Yeah, he's nipping off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant,' said George, chortling.

  Ginny didn't find it amusing either.

  ‘Oh, don't,' she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next, or George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met.

  Harry didn't mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin's heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it.
#+end_quote

Wizards as a whole seem a bit gullible, probably just a result of altering reality of a whim. Harry never let his fame, or infamy, get to him because he always had a group of people around him that cared about him.

I'll say again that it did have an effect on him, it just didn't turn him into the ridiculous poorly characterized Mary-Sue from Cadmean Victory.

******* Slave may have been a strong term. Unwanted step-son is a bit light though don't you think they laboured him, withheld meals, verbally and physically abused him, blatantly favoured Dudley over him (this is kind of a big one because this can have a big effect during childhood).

I can partially agree with you that it was a fight and friends fight but it also showed some of Ron's true character, he was always jealous of Harry's fame and fortune among other things. This was no simple argument, it didn't last a couple days but months. It also wasn't just Ron but most of the school was treating him quite poorly.

Wouldn't being sent back to the Dursley's each summer also cause him to question Dumbledore? I understand there were blood wards but Harry didn't know about them until later. Especially considering there was Grimmauld place to stay for summer after fourth year.

Being slandered unjustly many times over whether its by peers, the biggest newspaper in the country, your own government and even your close friends, in other words essentially everyone, will obviously cause some resentment.

In the canon this all turns out to make him a better person but that could have easily gone the other way and it was interesting to see it written out, is what I'm trying to get at.

I didn't really find him to be a mary-sue to be honest but that might just be me.

Maybe not. But he was mistreated. He was verbally abused, starved in the second year, was almost hit with a frying pan, it was even implied, that that was not a one time deal, his cousin and his friends played a game called "Harry Hunting" which involved chasing and beating up Harry. I could go on and on, need I?

******** That he was mistreated there can be no doubt. What matters is the degree and how it effected Harry. Since we don't really see much of the Dursleys the best way to judge them is from how Harry thinks of them. Which is that he mostly dismisses them as ridiculous. He's not fearful of adults, though he has no regard for authority figures. He hates bullies, he's fair, and has no issues with sharing. He has firm moral compass that he frequently acts upon. This all paints a picture far removed from the abusive Dursley tropes that plaque the fandom.

And since the first three books were kid-friendly(meant for kids/Fairy tale)he seems unaffected. It was never further explored. Plus that makes 0 sense. He was abused, deprived of attention, friends, and often told that he was a freak, and he just so happens to be completely fine?

This is not canon, and talking about the tone of the books is another conversation entirely.

The abused step child is an incredibly common trope in children's fantasy. Especially so in Britain, for whatever reason. You are right that Rowling used this then forgot about it, this is true for a great many things in PS. There is also a large shift between the early books and the later ones as the series changed to become young adult fiction.

This disparity makes for a lot of inconsistencies. What doesn't change however is characterization. Harry is always a person with a strong sense of right and wrong, and very little respect for rules. Thus this is what we must accept as truth.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
