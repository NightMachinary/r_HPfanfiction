I want to fit my OC( who tells the world about horcruxes) and dumbeldore together in HBP... And it seems impossible. I fear plot holes and It's kinda confusing what to change and what not...


** No, you risk a copyright claim and it getting taken down. You either need to write it from an alternative point of view and change parts of the narration, change it, or skim over it in some way - it is worth bearing in mind that most readers don't want to read content from the books word for word anyway.

You don't need to change things necessarily, but you need to transform the work so that you're not passing off Rowling's content as your own. For example, I wrote Ron's return in DH canon compliant with the same dialogue and actions, but I showed enough of Ron's inner thoughts that it was noticeably different.

** No, it is certainly not OK. a) it is breach of copyright, b) it is terminally boring. Assume that all your readers actually read JKR books, and then you need just to have a paragraph summary of the part of JKR book you want to include.

** I wouldn't. There's a difference between copying dialogue and a whole chapter. The whole point is to transform it. It can be similar, but you need to change it enough so it becomes its own. If you can't transform it, summarize.

** Copyright claims aside rehashing canon scenes is a sure way to slow the progress of your story and turn off readers. The people reading your story know the canon bits and don't need them recited so if nothing significant is changing do your best to skip it.

**** If your OC needs to know something than find a way to mention how they learned it ('He was still trying to process what he had learned last night. That there was a secret group led by Dumbledore...') efficiently and keep moving forward with /your/ story.
