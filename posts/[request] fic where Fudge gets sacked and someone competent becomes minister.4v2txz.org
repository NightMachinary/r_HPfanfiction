I read it before, I just can't remember what its called. The replacement was the PM's Economics advisor, and was supposed to be in the Minister position temporarily, but did too well and got stuck with the job. Thank you in advcace.

  What would have happened if Harry had been convicted by the Wizengamot after defending himself from dementors before his fifth year at Hogwarts? Humorous! Followup stories on Sirius Black plus Cornelius Fudge's attempt at becoming a dark lord.
