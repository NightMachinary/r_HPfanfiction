Idk why Britain would ostracize him.

I was thinking this could either be a Dark!Harry story, or something of a DarkLord!Harry with good intentions and so on...


** Okay here's a combination of a few things that /might/ work:

- The Prophecy isn't widely know about - Harry is seen as important solely because of the Boy Who Lived thing and because of his other clashes with Voldemort.\\
- Anti-Harry propaganda is more widespread than in canon.\\
- I feel like I remember Voldemort sending some message that he would be ‚Äúmerciful‚Äù if Harry gave himself up? Well whether or not that actually happened, it doesn't happen in this version.\\
- When Voldemort displays Harry's ‚Äúdead‚Äù body, he says Harry was a coward that tried to flee (like in canon).\\
- Harry's ‚ÄúI died to pass the protection on to them‚Äù thing isn't revealed.\\
- Harry's fight with Voldemort is less climactic - maybe Harry just attacks him from behind while invisible.

So thus we have a relatively distrusted Harry who supposedly tried to flee to save himself, then was discovered and pretended to be dead until he killed Voldemort from behind. Still not a terrible image for Harry, but a bit worse than in canon.

Then, in the aftermath, people's opinions can be split. A few people - mainly those who knew him - think he's actually a hero, whereas most see him as more of a lucky opportunist ‚Äútaking credit‚Äù for a victory he ‚Äúbarely earned‚Äù. Harry, tired of everyone's preconceptions about him, decides to leave on vacation, to try to get to be just a person for a bit.

While traveling, he learns his first piece of magic from another culture, and finds he loves the experience. He chooses to extend his ‚Äúvacation‚Äù into a career traveling the world and researching obscure magic.

Then, years later, he decides to return to Britain to find... little has changed. It's still pretty close to the same inept system. Sure, some advancements have occurred, but not as much as should have.

So Harry decides to try to campaign for positive change... only to be met with scorn.

Some people have used his sudden departure to further insult his image and claim that they had much more of a role in slowing/stopping Voldemort's plans, even if Harry is the one who killed him. Additionally, the remaining not-arrested Death Eaters continued to cause trouble for a bit, which further worsened the way Harry leaving looked.

But Harry doesn't give up on advocating for his beliefs. And some of his more ‚Äúradical‚Äù beliefs - like support systems for Werewolves and the decriminalization of some borderline-‚Äúdark‚Äù magic - continue to net him disapproval from many in power. Until eventually, Harry is declared a dark wizard seeking to overthrow their ‚Äúrighteous‚Äù government.

Unwilling to back down on his beliefs and with no other way forward, Harry somewhat leans into this image. He still tries his best to be a good person, but he's now openly fighting the government.

Thus begins the takeover of Dark Lord Harry Potter.

*** Add to the ways to make this possible, Harry was hunting Horcrux's for awhile, unknown to the world so to them it just looks like he abandoned them to Voldemort's mercies for awhile.

** Not quite the same, but in this [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27669059/chapters/67709576][one-shot]], Umbridge drives Harry to (jokingly) declare himself a Dark Lord. Events... eventuate and things go extremely sideways.

*** Voldemort would be very jealous. With but a few carefully placed words, Harry is well on his way to catching up with Voldemort's years of hard work in a minuscule fraction of the time. In fact, Harry's already won half the battle; people are beginning to fear him, especially those who have been caught in the position of opposing him. Because Harry is already a household name, unlike Voldemort was in the 50s, his influence is spreading very quickly.

I've been awaySearching for a reasonAnother purpose to findI've sailed the seasFought my many demonsI've looked to gods in the skies

I've stood in hellWhere many had to sufferI stared the devil in the eyesWalked many roadsTo witness ancient idolsAnd found the great gates of fire

Had many stormsQuestion my convictionGave armies reason to riseThe hangman's searchingFor bones he can borrowWhile I escaped in the nightFight or flight

Live again, all roads endI'll be coming homeTend your light 'cause on this nightI'll be coming home

My story endsNot far from where it startedMy weary limbs have grown oldI've seen the world through the eyes of a nomadHome is where the heart is I've been told, so I go

Live again, all roads endI'll be coming homeTend your light 'cause on this nightI'll be coming home
