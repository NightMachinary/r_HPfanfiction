Someone takes over the magical world with an international megacorporation that monopolizes essential potion ingredients and wand parts.

Want to fight him? Good luck without healing potions and without wands, once your current one fails in a few months thanks to planned obsolescence.

And all the newspapers are owned by the corporation too so good luck getting people to join your cause.

** This would be an interesting prompt but probably wouldn't work in JK Rowlings world where there aren't really any mega corporations. It seems like their economy operates like a small town economy operates where it's mostly mom and pop stores. And then people do research on their own rather than answering to a higher academic power.

**** Butterbeer Inc. secretly owns the government. Any rival company that doesn't “join the Butterbeer family” ends up raided by Aurors with evidence planted of illegal potioneering. Muggleborns who try to introduce muggle soda to the wizarding world are quietly obliviated of all knowledge of soft drinks.

** I mean, Voldemort kind of does? The power isn't in the Ministry or private businesses as much as it is held by old pureblood families. Like others say, JKR just didn't create a world run by big businesses. Maybe it exists and Harry just doesn't notice, but all the wealth and influence in society seems to be in rich old pureblood families like the Malfoys and the Blacks.

People like the Potters, who are wealthy but not /rich/ like we see today, invented some stuff or had successful business(es) but don't even come close to that old family wealth. Harry has enough money to live comfortably for the rest of his life, but probably not enough to go around buying off politicians and strong-arming industries.

These old families are probably the lifeblood of the wizarding financial world outside of the incredibly shifty goblins. Dwarfs exist but I don't recall any mention of any banks other than Gringotts. It's pretty weird, actually, that you have a single bank run by goblins because wizards are apparently just too lazy or too bad at math to bother? They'd rather hide galleons in their houses? IDK, maybe, but my point...

Almost all of those old, wealthy families support Voldemort's views. Or, it might be more accurate to say Voldemort adopted his views to attract all that old family power. Between the Blacks and the Malfoys you have a pretty hefty chunk of the nation's power, the Ministry is just the body that officially legitimizes that power. The ICW or other magical nations are probably not going to be as eager to step in and take out Voldemort if he's also in control of law and order.

If you got rid of Ollivander and the top potions makers you might end up with a temporary shortage for some period, but someone somewhere is going to come along and figure out the techniques to fill that niche, and it's implied that a lot of wizards are self-sufficient to the point where many magical things are just shortcuts to make life easier rather than necessities.

They don't have mass production in the wizarding world, and they don't need it. So the balance of scales are all completely off. People send post via *OWLS*, so who needs Amazon or the postal service? I doubt the Weasleys have ever heard of stamps. People can make their own shit, and if it's too complicated, they can pay someone to OWL it to them, so who needs anything like production lines and factories or distribution or retail stores to sell it? You can grow your own food, or buy stuff from muggles, so are grocery stores really necessary? The economies are completely different because you have a population of thousands rather than millions or billions affecting the economy.

** You still need initial influence over the government to accomplish monopolies, though. For example, nobody is going to allow some schmuck to gain a monopoly on phoenix feather gathering, regardless of how much money they have.

Not to mention, this doesn't work anyway - you can't prevent someone from growing herbs in their garden, you can't imprison a phoenix and to trap a unicorn would pretty much be a singularily evil act. And how are you going to control /wood/? You know, wood, the thing that's literally everywhere?

Most potion ingredients grow in nature, too (seeing as how they are from there), so your monopoly will just fail from the start because people won't visit your apothecaries anymore if you drive the prices up too high.

*** you don't monopolize the materials, you monopolize the wandcrafters (it is implied that they are few) and maybe the same with potion masters? idk, though you could monopolize the import of rare ingredients that can't be grown in the UK for example
