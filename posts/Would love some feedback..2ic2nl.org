** Yours will be the next fic I read. I've read both On the Way to Greatness and Drizzlewizzle's series and I loved them both. It seems either I never finish a fic because it can't hold my attention or I love it but I can't finish because it's incomplete. I enjoyed their sticking to canon but with the changes that come from Harry being a Slytherin, though at times I thought they were not making the changes pronounced enough. It's a fine line to walk, but you need to be sure you're not doing a complete canon rewrite. I suggest not being afraid to diverge from canon a bit. It's much more impressive to see someone managing the butterfly effect than seeing canon Harry put into green robes.

Anywho, I think I'm probably within your target audience. I'll give your story a read and get back to you with what I think of it.

** I know you're aware of some of these issues because they're listed in your author's notes. The story is almost completely a canon-re-write. I know that you feel it turned out to be more of a prologue and that you feel that the point of divergence shouldn't be at book 1. Still, while reading I wondered whether doing a book 1 was worth your time and mine. At the end of the story this is what the changes were from canon:

- Harry's in Slytherin
- cool separate bedrooms for Slytherins
- Slytherins are blood purists, but not militant about it
- Daphne is a prim social butterfly and Nott is a watered down version of canon Draco
- Hermione is Hermione without being friends with Ron (oh and Ron's new Ron is Seamus)
- Snape is ambivalent about Slytherin!Harry
- Early parseltounge reveal
- Slytherin house cup victory
- Harry knows his Aunt&Uncle are assfaces

I'm sure I'm missing a few, but I /know/ I remembered most of it. The thing is, these things could have been relayed if you started with book 2, mostly with a quick recap while Harry thought of his previous year while sulking in his room. You took the advice of others and skated over most everything, but the problem is that conversations would have made the first year worth the read (especially since you were hell bent on sticking to canon). I was interested in the unique conversation with Harry and Hermione on the train ride to Hogwarts, because it provided insight into the characters. Also, the lack of a reaction to Harry Potter being sorted into Slytherin is odd. The school was silent after he was sorted, but afterwards what happened? Everyone seems to be rather uninterested in it. Either this is a mistake by omission, or it was your intent to make it not a big deal to people. If so, I approve. So many Slytherin!Harry characters treat his sorting as a huge event, but treating it as unusual, but not truly earth-shattering is a more realistic way of treating an 11 year old, and it's certainly a fresh take on the story.

Having 11 year olds discuss deep moral issues or beginning to start relationships is cringeworthy, and I'm at least glad you didn't choose /those/ changes in the first year. Your characters mostly were as airheaded as actual 11 year olds are, with the exception of that conversation with Nott about dark magic. Leave that philosophical stuff for later when it's more appropriate, though of course it's more than fine for them to flirt with the ideas. Allowing the story to stay light and fluffy now makes darker and more serious years seem more natural. As for the writing, it's better than most, though the dialogue had very clunky moments, especially in the first few chapters. I don't know how you can fix it, since I'm not a writer, but as a reader it was hard to know who was saying what sometimes. There were a few typos I spotted throughout, but nothing disconcerting.

I hope this was helpful, and I look forward to reading your next installment.
