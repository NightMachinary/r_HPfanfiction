:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I believe it was HP/GW RW/HG and SS/OC along with some other pairings. I think it was canon to HBP but not sure. What I do remember is Harry finding a magic bag in his vault or Sirius' house that would use his loose stones to make the perfect jewelry for their family and friends especially engagement jewelry and Christmas gifts. That's the biggest part I remember. Please help!


** I'm not sure if this is what you are looking for but linkffn(Harry Potter and Dumbledore's Army by Bobmin356) has those pairings. Harry finds a letter in his vaults and uses his magic to conjure stones he puts into jewelry for his friends.

*** I don't think this one is it. I skimmed the one you thought it was but this fic actually involves a magic bag and them fixing Grimmauld Place. They also found a lot of other helpful stuff in the vaults too.

***** I believe I have found it. I believe it is Unlikely Alliances by Redfrog. I'm not 100% sure but I definitely remember reading this one! I will let you know when I'm 100% sure but I recommend giving this one a read anyway since it's so good.
