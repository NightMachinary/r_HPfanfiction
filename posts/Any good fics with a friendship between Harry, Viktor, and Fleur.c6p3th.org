I mean they went through all that trauma together, can we please get some friendship between them? Preferably fics with no bashing and no Harry/Fleur or Harry/Hermione.


** Hogwarts Dawn by Jeconais has Harry becoming friends with them, as well as their friends and family. It was going for a H/Fleur pairing but it was (sadly) abandoned before it got that far.

** [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/index/][Blue Steel]] by Jeconais bashes Ron but it meets your other requirements. It's a pretty lighthearted look at the tournament. No shipping at all and all the champs are close friends by the end.

  If you are forced to participate in a competition that's reserved for adults only, doesn't that mean you should be considered an adult? Harry gets some much needed help and advice before having some fun by allowing his marauder heritage out to play. H/Hr

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
