No instant powerups or training montages, no Harry being inherently better than anyone else.

Something like HP & BWL is good where he's better than his peers because he's been working at it for years.


** linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) has a very powerful Harry, but it's not a slow build-up to that. What is a slow build-up, however, is Harry's rise to power which is the main focus, power which he achieves by being cunning, ruthless, and willing to use both magical and mundane means to further his goals.

*** And, if I remember correctly, he's not even all that capable of a wizard. Isn't he just particularly talented at some battle magic because of all his experience?

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** Are you sure its a Slow build up? If i remember this correctly, one of the earliest times we see harry doing magic its basically a long-range wandless fiendfyre that is extremely powerful and from there on out he just gets more and more powerful with very little practice that we see.

Edit:didn't read through entire thing, ignore this

** Oh, thought of another thing that is probably more fitting than my other suggestion: linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow). In case you haven't read this brilliant fic, you owe it to yourself to go and do it now. The entire trio goes through a lot of character development and pressure, and would certainly outperform their canon counterparts.

** I would have to suggest Linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) and Linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) while harry is more powerful than people, he definitely has to practice. Ill also tentatively recommend Linkffn(Lignting Dragon's Roar) here, harry does magic other people cant but everything he accomplishes is through practice or work(as far as I have gotten, I haven't finished this one).

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.
