Maybe I am not the only one, but I tired of reading fiction with character in school. I a m looking for good and lengthed fiction of the wizard world. Maybe something completely new happening in 2017 ?

Thank a lot

  Exiled for three centuries on a barren rock, Harry's saved by the crew of the Enterprise D. He makes it to the colony world his people planned to go to and finds they're just as insular as ever though Hermione and his friends set them on a better course. Their nuclear option, though, left Harry with no escape. A prophecy is once again in play and he's the Chosen One. Again.

** Historical (in the 1590's) rather than modern, but you might appreciate it; linkffn(Starnlicht by Marquis Carabas).

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.
