Tom may or may not be fully orphaned and has a bit different of an upbringing. Honestly any different tom riddle upbringing fica


** Tom Sr takes custody of the baby. A few years later, Little Hangleton is home to the world's biggest snake-breeding business. Their best employee is 5 year old Tom Jr, who comes to Hogwarts with no less than five snakes in a muggle backpack.

** Self-recommendation, doesn't exactly fit your request but Tom does grow up with his muggle father. Work-in-progress, not abandoned.

*** Omg I LOVE this fic. It's actually what got me started looking into Tom Riddle Sr. The attention to detail, the historical references. Like the info on Tom's exercises, it is just so cool. Are you a historian or writer by trade?

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
