I'm looking for some decent length Snarry fics, preferably starting at Hogwarts. I'm looking for angsty "How could you like that greasy git" arguments, and "I can't have a relationship with a student" drama, and possibly "he's a death eater, you can't trust him" angst. Long enough to develop the relationship, preferably no soul bonds or other plot devices that make them instantly attracted to each other. I've read quite a few good SS/HrG with these elements, but I have yet to find a decent SS/HP... Thanks in advance!


** Seriously, no one? I've been looking for days, and all I'm finding are marriage contracts, soul bonds, creature fics, quite a bit of PWP, and so many horribly written fics that I want to pluck my eyes out... There have to be a few out there that are actually good...

*** Have you checked out [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org][www.walkingtheplank.org]]? It's the Snarry archive, though fairly dormant. You might also want to check out the tags from the Snarry Fic Find community on LJ. [[http://snarryficfind.livejournal.com/tag/]] The snape-potter comm on lj is still active and runs several fests a year. Their masterlist of masterlists is here: [[http://snape-potter.livejournal.com/2631782.html]].

Out of curiosity, where have you been looking for stories?

**** Thank you! Basically on ffn and ao3... How do people find out about these more specific fic groups/ archives? This is the second time I've seen a separate website for a popular (ish) pairing, but they never show up in my google searches. Is there like a list out there? Like "if you want this pairing, try this website"?

***** I found out through word-of-mouth, mostly. Some of these sites aren't indexed, which means that most search engines will overlook them, especially if the pairing is unpopular. I know there used to be a list, but I suspect it vanished along with an archive or two.

** I could give you some links to favorites of mine, but most of those take place after Hogwarts. You might also check out [[http://snarry-reader.livejournal.com/][The Snarry Reader]]. Be aware that it stopped updating several years ago, so there are a bunch of broken links by now. But it's still a good place to browse.

Here are some recs:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1008857/chapters/2001606][Penance Is the Play]] linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1008857/chapters/2001606]]) by Maeglin Yedi (This one has a sting in its tail.)

[[http://inkstain.inkquill.net/isf/archive/21/achoriambic.html][A Choriambic Progression]] by mairead triste and aristide. The end is a bit improbable, but it's one of the earliest Snarry fics with good characterization. And the opening premise is great - funny and horrifying at the same time. The ending is a little weak, but the dialogue and sex scenes are good.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/127][The Long Summer trilogy]] linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1666]]) by ellen_fremedon. First-person Snape POV. Includes a great battle sequence.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/2690][The Finder series]] linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/69885]]) by GatewayGirl. A relationship that starts in school and continues beyond. D/s elements.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/69544][Death and the Open Mind]] linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/69544]]) by loupgarou. Acerbically funny and a little poignant at the same time.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/13439][In Between Days]] linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/13439]]) by atrata. Not a romance, but very intense. Snape kidnaps and seduces Harry for his own purposes.

[[http://www.intertexius.com/_index-harry-potter-fanfiction-and-art.html][A Bittersweet Potion series]] by alchemia and bugland You want angst? This series has angst. It starts out fairly fluffy, with Harry passing himself off as Snape's cat, but by the second book it starts descending into a seriously dysfunctional romance plagued by Dark magic and resentment from Harry's classmates. Alternates Snape's and Harry's POVs. Unfinished after Book 5.

You should also give [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/670548][The Boy Who Died A Lot]] by starcrossedgirl and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032][Rapture]] by mia_ugly a try. They both get recced here fairly often. Well, for certain values of "often." They're Snarry fic, after all.

**** I'm delighted you liked it! I was totally bowled over by that fic when it first posted, and I've loved it ever since.

Also, pardon the crassness, but it occurs to me I have a fic you might enjoy. It's not nearly as wonderful as Rapture, though, so don't feel obliged to try it if it's not to your taste.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/19113][The White Road]]

Edited to add: I also meant to rec a very old fic that's pretty cracky but a lot of fun, just in case you need a palate cleanser between angst fics. Snape and the trio in Kansas!

*** I see what you mean, but I think it's strange that so few writers are able to find a middle ground. I mean, Dumbledore was pretty manipulative, but he wasn't evil, he was just old enough to think that he truly knew the best way to handle things. And Ron was sometimes a whiny jerk, but it didn't make him a bad person, just stubborn, sometime jealous, and immature. So many fics I've read are very very black and white. So focused on a character being good or evil, that they forget that everyone had some good and some evil inside of them. I like the grey areas. I like seeing the naive teen learning to make the hard decisions that end up haunting him after the war, the child of a prejudiced family questioning what he's been brought up to believe because of an intriguing muggleborn, the evil dictator learning that there are some things power can't buy, the war hardened spy falling for the son of his childhood bully... I like the what if's and the second chances, watching a how a single choice can ripple through time. I like hard truths, and seeing the cost of your actions.

Sorry, I ranted a bit there lol. These fics look really good, thank you :-) I think I've got a few days of reading at keep my occupied :-)

** I can't believe nobody's recommended this yet, but [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewseries.php?seriesid=29][If You Are Prepared by Cybele]] is fantastic. It's Hogwarts-era, plenty of angst and internal turmoil over the relationship. Just a warning though, it has a very tragic ending, but the writing is spectacular -- her characterization is on-point (especially her Snape).
