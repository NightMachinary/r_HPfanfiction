** Okay, part one: 'secretely' means 'in an oozing fashion'. You mean 'secretly'.

Part two: try out [[http://ficwad.com/story/150298][Duality]] by andafaith on Ficwad.

HBP AU. It's hard enough being a teenager; add nefarious plots, the Dark Lord, and house rivalries into the mix. A story about enlightenment, growing up, and getting over yourself. Harry Potter/Daphne Greengrass.
