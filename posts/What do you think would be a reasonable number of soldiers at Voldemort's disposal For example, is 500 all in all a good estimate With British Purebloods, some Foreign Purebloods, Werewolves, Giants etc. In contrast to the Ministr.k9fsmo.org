#+TITLE: What do you think would be a reasonable number of soldiers at Voldemort's disposal? For example, is 500 all in all a good estimate? With British Purebloods, some Foreign Purebloods, Werewolves, Giants etc.? In contrast to the Ministry's 100 Aurors? Less? More?

** I think 500 is the maximum number just before The Battle of Hogwarts, but he started with seven in the end of the Triwizard Tournament. I am writing a story about the summer before the Harry's sixth year, and then I estimate somewhere between hundred and two hundred wands on Voldemort's side (including low-level canon fodder, werevolves, etc.; less than fifty first-class Death Eaters).

** Remember he took over by stealth / imperius / the pathetic complicity of most wizards.

Given his personality, I think this implies that just fighting was unrealistic for him.

So I'd estimate

OOTP: 25 people

DE: 500 people

Total fighting force available to ministry: 2500 (not necessarily all aurors, I think they're supposed to be the elite)

** A quote in the fandom wiki:

#+begin_quote
  Although the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Eaters][Death Eaters]] had been attacking mostly [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Non-magic_people][Muggles]] and [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Muggle-born][Muggle-borns]] to spread terror, they soon turned to attacking "[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_traitor][/blood traitors/]]" such as Order members as well. The Order had to work hard, as they were outnumbered by a ratio of *20:1* by the Death Eaters.
#+end_quote

Now the number of people in the Order in the first war is around 25-30, so yes, 500 to 600 would be a good estimate. Inferis were also involved, btw ^{in WW1.}

In WW2, I'm assuming there would be around 300-350 and 100 Snatchers or so, ^{edit:}because many giants were killed after WW1, some death eaters fled the country, while others committed suicide and some were imprisoned, and died in Azkaban.
