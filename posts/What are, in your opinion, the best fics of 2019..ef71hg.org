Since the year is coming to an end, I thought it would be a good time to ask this. Anything is fine as long as it was published/completed this year. Het or Slash, multi chapter or oneshot, complete, in progress or abandoned, smut, as long as you mention it in your post or it's clearly stated in the fic's summary.


** Fate by TheTrueSpartan. It's amazing. The characters have a lot of depth in them, even the OC characters are nice, the story with Ron as the protagonist is very good.

Highly recommended!

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

** It's gotten quite a lot of mixed reactions here, but I'm immensely enjoying [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate]]. It's a unique plot with a lot of AU elements (Basically Seer-Ron who goes to Slytherin) that probably turn a lot of people off, but the way it's paced and carries several plots at once is really well done.

**** It's not a must-read imo (I'm saying this even though Ron's my favourite character). The character interactions are done pretty poorly, there's a lot of grammar issues, and it falls into the "all slytherins are baby mafia bosses" stereotype quickly. It can't hold a candle to Changeling, the fic with Slytherin!Ginny Weasley.

** Promising fics begun this year:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13222805/1/Blitz][Blitz]], linkffn(13222805): Only an one-shot, but one that has great potentials.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]], linkffn(13133746): One of the best Harry/Daphne fics with a very sympathetic Astoria. Fic began last November so I still count it as this year's.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13299443/1/Departure-from-the-Diary][Departure from the Diary]], linkffn(13299443): Female Diary Riddle and Harry share a body.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13161929/1/Invincible][Invincible]], linkffn(13161929): Earth is becoming uninhabitable for magicals, so Harry leads his people to convert the retired aircraft carrier HMS Invincible into a spaceship. Out there, they meet the remnants of the Colonial Fleet and Cylons.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13173587/1/Laughing-All-the-Way-to-London][Laughing all the Way to London]], linkffn(13173587): Harry time travels and hooks up with Narcissa.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/1/The-Granger-Principle][The Granger Principle]], linkffn(13312738): Almost canon Hermione stranded in a non magical dimension without her wand, and she needs its manipulative GreaterGood Dumbledore's (and Grindelwald's) help to get back home.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex][The Imposter Complex]], linkffn(13275002): Diary Riddle gains a body and fights Voldemort Prime.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.
