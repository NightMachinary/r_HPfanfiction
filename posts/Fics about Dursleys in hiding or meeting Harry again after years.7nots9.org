Are there any good fics out there about what went on during the year that the Dursley's were in hiding? Or fics where Harry runs into them or meets them years after the war or Ginny meets them? I read this fic about Ginny and Harry going to Dudley's wedding and it was hilarious.


** In "The Augurey" (linkffn1 2310861) Harry meets Dudley and asks him to fake his death so Harry can pretend that Delphini is his orphaned niece.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11769405/1/Dudley-Dursley-and-the-Deathly-Hallows][Dudley Dursley and the Deathly Hallows]] by Grey Streaked Fur would be exactly what you're looking for. This story really redeems Dudley as a character. It basically starts right after Dudley and Harry said their goodbyes with each other.

**** From what I read up to that point, mostly yes. However, there's one other main OC. On the other hand it makes sense that the author creates one to interact with Dudley since Harry did not know what happened with the Dursley family.

  Dudley Dursley: champion boxer, crass chav, cannibal?, bad boyfriend, good son, annoying cousin, best friend. It's hard to keep all the identities straight. Fin.
