** Um...eventually? It's not really focused on Peter, but I'm working on a story that has a legitimate reason for Peter turning, has Wolfstar, and has Peter attempting to ruin Wolfstar by doing things that include polyjuicing as Remus and tricking Sirius.

My Peter is a capable and conniving wizard who felt betrayed by his friends when he needed them most, so he is going to make them hurt.

It'll be long, but it's not ready yet.

****** I am so sorry! English is not my first language. I just wanted to say: he did it for (unrequited) love and I am not into fics with a straight Peter. Argh!

******* Ok I can understand that. It's a bit of a sore spot in fandom because there are all these straight women who use gay love and gay sex and the issues we live and struggle with everyday as angst porn m, and also the way that western media has dressed homosexuality for so so long is that we're all morally bankrupt, so the implication that it was because he's gay that he's happy for his friend's kid to die or to become a nazi rather than he's gay and a human person with weaknesses and this was the beginning of the e slippery slope of his descent into being a death eater. But I get that the order we out words in can make meanings different and it's not always easy to realise what the implication might mean until someone reads it and is like â€˜what?!' lmao

******** To answer your question I don't think I've ever seen a gay Peter, and esp not one who is in love with a death eater. Usually he's a bit of a bigot and homophobic rather than gay. It's an interesting angle to think about, but I'm sorry I don't have any recs for you
