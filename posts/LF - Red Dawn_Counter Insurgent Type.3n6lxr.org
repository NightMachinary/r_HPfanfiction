Harry and co lose the "war" but survive. They go underground and with new allies fight against the Voldemort regime in a real war. Anyone know anything like this out?


** "Harry Potter and the Witch Queen" linkffn(8823447) has some scenes like that, but mostly in flashbacks/memories.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

*** A pity that it's been abandoned. Though I didn't get along all that well with the author on this sub, I thought it was decent writing.

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.

  Trelawney never made the prophecy, Voldemort was never defeated on Halloween of 1981, Britain has fallen into darkness, and Harry Potter is just another no-name soldier trying to smuggle a certain Muggleborn witch out of Death Eater territory
