:FlairText: Recommendation
:END:
It's older, written from 2005-2018 by JellyBellys. Honestly better than some books I've read. It's very dark and angsty and just so, so heavy. I was reminded of it in a thread about rare pairs and wanted to recommend it to everyone.

Muggleborns are given to Death Eaters as rewards. It works almost as a reverse Stockholm Syndrome in some of the relationships. In others, it's just as horrible as you would expect. My favorite part- if anything so awful can be a favorite thing- is that girls are not the only taken captive. Most people, and especially in any type of entertainment, do not bring up sexual assault of men. All of the characters are so complex and well-rounded, no matter their gender or their morality. Pansy Parkinson is just as despicable as her male counterparts.

The main character is Theodore Nott. He happens to do well in a raid jus as Hermione Granger is captured. He and a few of his friends have doubts about Voldemort's sanity and if Muggles are really so awful, so when Hermione is offered up as a reward, he stakes his claim. Very slow burn. I would call it more of a redemption fic than a romance.

This fic does not shy away from what a war in the HP universe could have been. What Voldemort has his followers do is violent and sad and truly despicable, but that's what war is. It's an excellent character study while still boasting a strong plot, and has some of the most memorable OCs that you will ever meet.

That... actually sums it up perfectly. I've been watching a WWII documentary lately and that's depressing enough. There's nothing wrong with more serious and sad fics, but they do require a particular mood on my part to read.

** I have. I disagree and think it's pretty bad. The premise isn't exactly original and the plot is clearly an entirely contrived manner for Hermione to get with "redeemed slytherin". Writing is mechanically fine, sure, but there's more to a good fic than grammar. Characterization was fine, but unrealistic. I find it doubtful that every death eater is either secretly a guilt-ridden regretful man waiting to be turned by hot captive or a complete raging psychopath (not the correct term, I'm aware).

​

Though I don't deny that the author can probably write good smut if he (or she) puts their mind to it, the writing of the combat, war itself, and other aspects unrelated to Hermione and Nott's burgeoning relationship was mediocre at best. I think it could be recommended for those seeking unconventional relationships but as a fic exploring humanity? I don't think so.

Why does everyone love those Death Eater redemptions? The only way I would read this is if Hermione goes on some sort of a rage-fueled revenge spree and stomps Nott's guts out. The premise sure sounds interesting but I don't want to read about Hermione developing a Stockholm syndrome and making excuses for Nott.
