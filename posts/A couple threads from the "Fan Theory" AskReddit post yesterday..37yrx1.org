** Harry and Tom are related. Extremely distantly. To the point it's not even relevant.

** The Dursley being affected by the horcrux and some shady side of the wizardin world keeping wizards ignorant of muggle tech is my headcanon.

In my opinion magic doesn't disrupts electronics so much , only Heavly magical places like hogwarts/diagon alley do. And only to the extent that EMP protection would be enought.

This is also intentional because it incourages muggleborns to not use muggle gadgets and therefore making it harder to come up with magi-tech or similar.

** i like the last few. the dursleys have similar feelings to harry the wizard as the trio have towards tom the horcrux' so that might explain there reaction. also, ron does become more of a dick as the story progresses.

the last one is interesting. imagine how useful that hat would be if you made one to do something more useful than sorting houses. surely the ministry has a similar thing they do use? and things like traces and aparation/portkey tracking are obviously as useful to a wizard as hacking your communications is to the us government. perhaps wizards are just going through a dark-age.

*** I agree. It was either that or Rita Skeeter, and I prefer to think of her as barmy rather than bitchy.
