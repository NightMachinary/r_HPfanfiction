Just curious as to what people dislike about fan fictions?

For me I cant stand the overly-used "names, words etc tattooed on the soul mates body" idea.

Straight up non stop smut. I just cant do it. I need some sort of plot.

Lastly, OC's not sure why but trying to make up someone who wasnt there is kind of cringy to me.

I'd love to hear everyone else's turn offs.


** The Harry-is-an-ass who knows better than everyone who may have ever existed. I'm all for powerful/super/genius Harry, they can be insanely fun, but him being all that with thirty wives and most wonderful person to ever walk the earth? Please.

** I don't understand how he can be upset at the loss of his parents, I mean he would have been what, 15 months at the time?

​

By the time he's old enough for Hogwarts, his parents would be a distant memory.

​

How can you be upset at losing parents you hardly remember?

​

There are some fics that point this out, but the names escape me right now.

​

I've only seen a handful of fics that have done this, and they're usually stories with a bit more realism.

*** I mean, there is some validity to this but some fics take it way too far. He ignores that his parents gave his life for him and he goes off and romances the people who killed or were complicit in their death (thinking primarily of Harry/Tom stories).

** Whenever a character is described as being new-and-improved a la a summer's worth of puberty. Particularly if they have "curves in all the right places" or are an incredibly muscular teenager without any mention of exercise.

** I don't know why but ‘they never noticed the green beetle, flying away' always gets me.
