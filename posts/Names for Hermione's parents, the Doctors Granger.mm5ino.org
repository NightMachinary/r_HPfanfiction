Honestly, I am sick to death of seeing Hermione's parents named Dan and Emma. In canon, Hermione's parents were never given first names---that's how little they figured into JKR's thoughts. (Explains why Hermione always seemed to spend her holidays with the Weasleys, except for that one trip to France.)

So here's a quick poll:

- How many of you already knew these are fanon names, invented by Harry/Hermione shippers? (Dan and Emma, of course, being the actors' names for those characters.)
- How many of you thought those were their official names?
- If you are a writer, have you used these names for Hermione's parents?\\
  If so, was it always in Harry/Hermione stories, or also stories with other pairings?\\
  If not, what names did you use? (Because a lot of people could benefit from the example.)

And I'll end this with a plea for authors to have more creativity when giving names to canon-nameless characters. It's BORING seeing the same names time after time, especially when it's based on something so banal as a wish-fulfulment pairing.

I'd even prefer Homer and Marge at this point.


** I always thought that Wendell and Monica were their actual names and Hermione just changed the last name. Is it confirmed that these aren't their real first names?

*** I don't know what you would consider confirmation. As far as I know, there has never been a definitive statement of their names. There's no proof against your assumption, but no proof for it either.

On the HP Wiki, their entries are "[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger%27s_father][Hermione Granger's Father]]" and "[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger%27s_mother][Hermione Granger's Mother]]," otherwise referred to only as Mr. and Mrs. Granger, implying they have no official names. Wendell and Monica Wilkins are listed as temporary aliases.

**** Yeah, I agree with you that the implication then is that they're fake names. That's so shocking, like I'd never considered the full gravity of how much she changed their identities. I figured she erased their memories of her and changed their last name and sent them to Australia, but she must have altered every memory they ever had before they even met each other. She just made them into different people. I don't know why this took so long to hit me.

***** For exact that reason I am pretty sure that Monika and Wendell are their true first names. Erasing memories and changing a last name is one thing. Changing their first names too means she would have to change every little memory from their earliest childhoods. Hermione was nothing if not pragmatic - and memory-charms are dangerous. So I think she would have gone with the most easiest still workable solution. She didn't want her parents to end up like Lockhart after all.

*** A great defense from a writer's angle.

From a reader's angle, having the names semi/consistent across the fandom can make it easier to remember them, especially if the story has multiple OCs or renamed characters. When those two have the same name as they had in the last dozen fics you read, you can focus more on remembering who the other characters are.

******** My personal belief: people who give their children unique names usually have rather boring names themselves. Unique names were likely to get picked on in school back then, so if they'd had unique names they probably would not have passed that on. (These days so many parents make up their own names that it's not unusual, but it was a different world back then.)

When authors address the origin of Hermione's name, I see a lot more Shakespeare than Trojan War. It's easy to believe that her parents were bookworms who passed that love on to their daughter, but either origin paints them as intellectuals rather than people with more physical backgrounds.

** #1) Only found out about within...maybe the last few years. As you mentioned, since they are such non-characters, I never made the connection between Dan/Emma and the actors.

#2) Honestly, never considered if they were official names. But since I never questioned it, I guess I would fall under yes for this question.

#3) Not currently writing a fic, but if I did write a story with Hermione's parents, I'd do something "themey" like how the Evans named their girls after flowers. But I'd do something like have it so any Granger child (regardless of gender) would get a Shakespearian name. So her father would also have a name from a Shakespeare work. So probably something like Mercutio, Ferdinand, or Horatio. Her mother would just have any ole name (not Emma).

** I've seen Helen as a very common name for her mother, and Richard and Marcus as names for her father, when it's not Emma and Dan.

My story that is probably never going to be finished but I can dream has them named Emilia and Manuel, because I wanted to go with a Hermione who wasn't 100% white and one of my favorite history facts is that in WWII they shipped British pilots to Texas for flight training because the weather in England was super unsuitable and they were having a lot of deaths in training, so they just shipped them overseas so they could learn in better weather, so I made her paternal grandfather a retired RAF pilot and her grandmother a Mexican immigrant he fell in love with while he was training in Texas.

Edit: Yes, I did know it was fanon because of shippers, but I don't remember when I learned that. I would likely not use it, even if I did write another story where they're both white, because I like Helen and Richard better.

** I really don't think using Dan and Emma means anything for the choice of shipping. Most of my stories are Hinny, but I use them as well, because I just want to be special in this silly way. Also, if I wrote fem!Harry story (which I most certainly don't plan to) I would use Harriet, and my Harry's sister is Rose. All of them are nice and reasonable names, and I just don't want to bother with this nonsense.

*** If I wrote a fem!Harry story (which I can't imagine doing but you never know), I would most definitely NOT name her Harriet, because Evans girls always get flower names.

Juniper, Aster, Heather (very common for fem!Harry because it keeps the H), Laurel, Marigold, Jasmine, Violet, Amaryllis, Hyacinth, Amaranth (I've seen this recently), Senna, Iris, Rue, Alyssa

In the not-quite-a-flower range we have Ivy, Holly, Rosemary (which I've just learned DOES have flowers), Tansy, Willow, Hazel, Sorrel, Cassia (cinnamon)

**** The two Evans girls whose names we know have flower names. There is nothing to support the notion that this is some kind of longstanding Evans tradition and not just a random preference of Petunia and Lily's parents. Kids don't always utilize the same naming conventions at their parents, and Lily wouldn't necessarily give her kid a flower name just because her and her sister's names are flower names.

That said, JKR was really invested in flower names. Besides the Evans girls, we had Lavender, Pansy, Poppy, Narcissa...

** The names should be Shakespearean. My preference:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_III_(play)][Richard III]] (i.e., son of Richard Granger Jr., son of Richard Granger)

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goneril][Goneril]] ne√® Brutus

  As you have probably already guessed, her nickname in school was "Gonorrhoea"; it twisted her, made her become a dentist.

And thus was Hermione born.

I kind of like former-military dad (are UK medicos given formal rank like in the US?), but what are the odds your dentist used to be Special Forces? I mean, yeah, they all need to get "real jobs" when they leave the military, but still...
