*** For starters it's really well written, which is something I know this sub values highly. It also presents a compelling view of a canon compliant Sirius in his youth, fighting between Gryffindor, Slytherin and the Black family. Here Sirius isn't the brash, impulsive and warm guy we meet with Harry, he's been bred to be manipulative, arrogant and cold, but we also see warmth, love and the beginnings of a more open mind. And for those who dislike slash, at the moment it's only been a kiss and it's clearly nothing more than adolescent confusion ;)

  Being sorted into Gryffindor was possibly the worst fate imaginable for Sirius Black, eldest son of a long line of ancient and noble pure-blooded Slytherins. He inevitably found himself pushed and pulled between his Dark family and his Light friends, and he wasn't even sure what side he was supposed to be on anymore. (Sirius's early Hogwarts years.) This story is part of a series with an overall Explicit rating, but it won't have anything too dark or explicit for a while, as the characters start out at age eleven. The story will include both homosexual and heterosexual relationships. I do plan on following the events of canon as Harry sees them, so this is perhaps not a proper AU. It will just be that Sirius's perspective is very different from what Harry knows.All of the chapters will be long like this one, so updates won't happen as quickly as if they were shorter.Updated 8/20/2014 to fix some typos and to reflect the new chapter naming scheme.

** Great fear of mine that this fic will be abandoned eventually. All of my favorite fics are abandoned. I read it three times already, I'm crazy about this story.
