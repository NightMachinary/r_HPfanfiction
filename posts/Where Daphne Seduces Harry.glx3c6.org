I'm looking for something that starts in a manner similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9564974/1/Wedding-Bells][Wedding Bells]] by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (dunno if someone might want to try and contact them about creating a sequel/continuation or if it's safe to just use it as an inspirational springboard or what).

In summary: Daphne talks circles around Harry while dragging him somewhere private and seducing him while telling him how he's supposed to seduce her, melting her icy mask etc, in a complete send-up of the old Ice Queen persona (nothing saying she couldn't have had such a public mask, but her behavior when she nabs Harry should make it obvious that she's nothing like that when not on guard). Whether or not there really is a wedding contract, or that such a claim is used as part of the seduction, is optional; part of me thinks it would be funnier if Harry later catches Daphne in the lie and wrings some kind of "apology" out of her (albeit alternatively heavy drama might ensue if you go with some sort of ye olde-tyme pureblood "losing virginity = marriage" law).

Feel free to ignore that fic's briefly referenced age; you don't even need to have it start on the Express (maybe an adult auror Harry trying to blow off some steam after fighting with Ginny and finding himself picked up?). The important part I want is the humor of the initial pickup where she fast-talks him while pretending that he's seducing her.

  Marriage contracts are a total bummer.
