BLUF: My main concern is a major theme involves time travel which might feel too much like Cursed Child and a plot point that feels like it's trying to include the Fantastic Beast's story arc.

Let me also say I'm not much of an author, but wanted to follow with J.K's writing style. It takes place shortly after the Battle of Hogwarts. It is primarily a Harry Potter story with Ron and Hermione coming in every so often. Some of the major things included would be a different view on the paradox timelines, how time turners (or how they were originally) made, the death of Newt Scamander and the secret he tried to take to the grave. I tried to bring down the levels of fantasm and Deus Ex Machina. I don't know if it would actually work better as a short story but I could see it as a full length book (closer to PS or CoS size).

I don't mean to rag on the authors of Cursed Child. I'm still working on finishing it, but I couldn't help feel like a lot of the stuff was out of character and sparked inspiration for a sequel that would really tie the end off neatly.

Some working titles:

- Harry Potter and the Lost Journal

- Harry Potter and the Strands of Kismet

- Harry Potter and the Infinity Strands

- Harry Potter and the Three Travelers of One


** My suggestion: throw away any paradoxical time travels and make your story a dimensional travel (or a dimensional time travel in which there won't be any paradoxes).

The benefits of dimensional (time) travels are many:

- No paradoxes
- Protagonists have maximum freedom of actions and choices
- Friends and foes can be different
- Events and facts can be different
- Protagonists's knowledge may not be useful or could be even counterproductive in the new world, thus raising the challenge level
- Protagonists may have counterparts there, and I find such encounters usually amusing

*** Yeah so it's not actually paradoxical but as face value it seems it should be.

So basically it extends what happened in Prisoner of Azkaban where Harry directly meddling with time in is part of the timeline, but it takes it a bit further in that two timelines coexist. A big piece of symbolism throughout the story would be the use of the Infinity symbol. They meet in the middle and directly affect each other but need each other to exist

** My main concern is that you're including Cursed Child in canon ;). If you want to read a time travel fanfiction, I can recommend a few, but Cursed Child wouldn't make the list.

*** Well, see that was also my concern. It felt like I was either trying to replace Cursed Child or the future of Harry Potter is only time travel instead of something original. With the format of the story I selected it essentially allows Cursed Child to happen, but not fully reference it.

** Well honestly you can remove Cursed Child without any remorse. It's just bad sorry. It would have been a meh - ok fanfiction, but not professionnal work, and it is pretty incoherent with the novels.
