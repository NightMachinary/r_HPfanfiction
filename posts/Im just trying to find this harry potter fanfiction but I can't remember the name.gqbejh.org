The fanfiction that im trying to find on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] its about the golden trio going through their Horcrux hunt but are attacked and somehow go back in time where they find themselves back in the marauder's era during a feast (pft im just trying to give myself the satisfaction of re-reading it again) or something similar to that
