I just finished "Of Wizards and Heroes" by storyforsomeone on ao3 (I loved it) and its ignited my interest in this type of crossover. So, I'm hoping for suggestions. I'd prefer completed stories, but if they're still currently being worked on that's fine too. It can be on ao3 and/or ffn and I'm grateful for any suggestions people have. Thanks in advanced! (And am I using the right flair?)

** Vimesenthusiast's "A Third Path to the Future" is... really long and intricate, still being written. I think it's a blend of comic and some of the animated series.

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.
