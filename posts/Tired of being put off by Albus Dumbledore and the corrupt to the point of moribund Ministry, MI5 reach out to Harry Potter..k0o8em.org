** Happens in “Effects and Side Effects by Pheonix Dawn” linkffn(4606270), not that I am endorsing this fic. It is a fem!Harry (hopefully temporary) & harem, and it just proves all what's wrong with such stories.

Also, in “One World by Stellar Magic” linkffn(8993792). It has perfect start, agent Kim Hunter (of MI-5) is awesome, but the story is unfinished.

And of course, there are “Operation Wandless by LadyDunla” and “Source of Light” linkffn(9261035;9919621) which are crossovers between HP and “MI-5/Spooks” TV series.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.

  Harry Potter has no idea what to do. His new Auror recruits are nothing short of hopeless. Then an idea hits him... "So, let me get this straight: we're supposed to show some wand-waving weirdoes how to do our job?" "Yes, that is the general idea." Or: failing Auror recruits get dumped with MI-5 to get a lesson in how spying is really done.

  A plot to overthrow the Statute of Secrecy forces MI-5 and their magical counterparts to set aside their prejudices and work together. But it is not all that simple, and for some officers this operation is intensely personal. Sequel to Operation Wandless.

** Sounds interesting, however instead of the usual Muggle Superiority Wank, what I'd like to see is Muggles realising just how ill equipped they are to deal with Wizards. Magic is incomprehensible and wizards are as gods by comparison. Capable of altering the very reality in a way no technology can ever hope to match.

They quickly get Harry captured, their entire operation blown up, those in charge placed under Imperius curse, forced to attack and act against their own government...

  HP / James Bond x-over - Harry uses the first chance he gets to escape his horrible life at Privet Drive when he is offered a very special job by a man that is thought to be imprisoned in the infamous prison of Azkaban. Learning more about the magical and the muggle world Harry Potter starts his way in the service of her Majesty. Look out 007, now comes Harry Potter. Later lemons
