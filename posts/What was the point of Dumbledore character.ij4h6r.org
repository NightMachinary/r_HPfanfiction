Okay, I know simmilar posts have been done before, but I was curious about if the opinions have changed or not.

Im from the people that met the Harry Potter first from the movies. I read the books, but were the movies which had a greater impact on me, and Im still not completely sure of what Rowling intended with Dumbledore, or if she simply messed up somehow.

While with Snape, that seems an awful person at first, we get to know after his death that he had some redeemable aspects (even if maybe it wasnt written properly), with Dumbledore happened pretty much the opposite, we know him as a really wise and powerfull, though kind-hearted man, and then after his death we get to know his flaws and secrets, mainly how manipulative he was, and how he could ignore his own feelings and accept the death and sacrifices of some people in his side if that ultimately worked for his cause and avoided a greater ammount of people dying...

And yet... Plot holes and some bad writing harm his character.

After all, how some of his decisions make sense if he is like that?

Things like he doing nothing to make sure that Sirius was really culrprit or not, and the fact he stil didnt do anything for him after his escape; repeating the same mistakes and neglecting he made on Tom with Harry; not doing anything about the Horrocruxes in the whole decade after Voldemort death, etc.

Then you have the stone and the chamber incidents, when we can only justify his actions with:

A) Dumbledore is retarded.

B) Dumbledore is innegably malicious,

because his plans were basically "Seems Tom is roaming around... Lets bait him and then pit him against Harry to see what happens."

And then, what most gets me is the King Cross afterlife scene in the last movie. I cant remember if there was some extra nuance on the book, but It feels completely off to me about the way Harry reacts.

Like "Hey professor." "Hey, Harry." "Am I dead?" "Kinda." "I see." "Yeah." "..." "Want some exposition?" "FUCK YEAH!"

I know Harry is a forgiving guy, he forgave Snape for gods sake, But in his case Harry knew the good aspects of Snape last, so psycologically the impact should be greater, and it makes kinda sense for Harry to rethink his opinion about the teacher. And even then, Harry obviously felt confused, being incapable to associate the evil teacher and death eater with the double spy that protected him and worked secretly against Voldemort.

But in Dumbledore case, it was at last that Harry realized the man was -at least partialy- using a facade all this time to utilize him as a chess piece, neglecting him and putting him on incountable dangerous situatiopns on purpose, with the intention of leading him to his death. Such a thing would sour the opinion of even your most loved person in the world... And still, Harry is so casual about it when he mets the old-man again. And even gaves him one of his sons the guys name...

If it was me I would have kicked his ghostly nuts and cursed him until I got out of breath, even if it was petty... Its simply theres no way for anyone not to feel used after something like that. Even someone like Harry.

So at the end, if Rowling truly intended to make him some flawed but good, I feel like she failed.


** I'm glad you have realized that Dumbledore is a poorly written character, or rather a dumbed down plot device in a children's series so kids could play heroes.

He can't be competent, he has to be (criminally) negligent, because otherwise the canon plot is easily shot, as in the popular fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/][Petrification Proliferation]].

That being said, I don't like Dumbledore bashing that's endemic in the fanfiction world. This poor guy already got shafted in canon, and you want to dumb him down further? How would that make a better story?

No, I prefer a Dumbledore who lives up to his reputation as a great wizard and vanquisher of the previous Dark Lord Grindelwald. But he faces overwhelming odds from Voldemort, the old establishment, and a malicious Ministry. He might make mistakes, but he is mostly trying his best.

*** Despite what It could seem because the way I writted the post, I dont bash Dumbledore either... I dont bash anyone, really. I think bashing characters is stupid.

I just kinda dislike how Dumbedlore depiction in canon doesnt make sense once you are an adult and analize everything.

** To be a mentor to the protagonist. The Harry-Dumbledore dynamic is a well worn trope. Unlike many of their counterparts, Harry and Dumbledore suffer from plot over character development.

#+end_quote

Culprit of what? Being the Potters' Secret Keeper? James, himself, told Dumbledore Sirius was. Of killing 13 people? Dumbledore isn't the only politician in the books and that wasn't his job. You'd be better off laying the blame for that at Crouch Sr and Fudge's feet.

#+begin_quote
  repeating the same mistakes and neglecting he made on Tom with Harry
#+end_quote

You can say Dumbledore saw the makings of a psychopath and should've obliviated him and walked away, but I don't see how Tom Riddle was neglected in any other way. In fact, it seems like he was catered to by every other Professor.

#+begin_quote
  not doing anything about the Horrocruxes in the whole decade after Voldemort death
#+end_quote

You should give Horcruxes in HBP a once over with special attention to the Dumbledore lines. It's possible he'd been suspicious, but he only had proof after CoS and still didn't know the exact number until late HBP. If you want to blame someone for twiddling thumbs for a decade (and a half) it's Horace Slughorn.

This is incorrect. Harry alludes to seeing what Dumbledore is, and does, as early as PS. In fact, the line is the cause for a lot of Dumbledore bashing. He sees a lot more between OotP and DH. By the end of King's Cross, Dumbledore is someone he admires.

Also, Dumbledore doesn't place Harry in incountable dangerous situations. The stone and Draco are 2. The Dursleys can count as a 3rd. /Harry/ places himself in the rest because Harry typically makes his own choices, which is something this fandom seems to struggle to acknowledge.

** Dumbledore suffers from the fact that he's a powerful adult in a book centered around children. The children need to have adventures that really matter and an adult as powerful as Dumbledore would render their struggles non-existent. So he has to either get out of the way or make a few errors so the child heroes can make a difference. But there are some things that aren't quite fair to lay at his feet.

Short of taking over the government or forcing his agenda via force, there' nothing Dumbledore could have realistically done for Sirius. Sirius advertised the fact that he was the secret keeper, didn't tell anyone about the switch, wasn't able to procure Peter in any meaningful way, and didn't seem to bother defending himself or explaining his side at the time. It's extremely easy to think Sirius Black was playing the long con, serving the Dark Lord like the rest of his family, only in secret.

And after Dumbledore learns the truth, you still need to capture Peter and present him as evidence. Which is no easy task since Peter has a very difficult Animagus form to find. And that's even assuming that the Ministry believes them; it's entirely possible that they'd try to cover it up and have them both kissed, so as not to look incompetent.

Dumbledore was flying pretty blind about the Chamber. He didn't know what the monster was or where the chamber was. The monster being a basilisk isn't exactly obvious because no one, at that time, knew that a basilisk could paralyze if you weaken it's gaze; the book Hermione found only mentions that it kills. In hindsight it's super obvious, but that's hindsight.

There's not much Dumbledore could have done about the horcruxes either. He didn't know how Voldemort sustained his life, how many horcrux were made, what they look like, or where they were.

*** While the thing with serious is right. I feel that if someone could make a case for Sirious innosence that person was Dumbledore... But knowing Fudge, he could have swept everything under the carpet to protect his reputation and stuff.

However, when you take the Chamber for example, everything changes. You need a parselmouth to open it, thats true. But finding it couldnt be more easier... Just talk with the last victim when the chamber was opened: Myrtle, who just happens to be a well known ghost in the castle and died while Dumbledore was the headmaster. Theres no way he would be stupid enough not to think "Hey, I should talk with the ghost of the girl that died. Maybe she has some clues." If Harry, a twelve years old kid, was able to deduce the chamber entry ubication then Dumbledore should too.

And the Horrocruxe thing is debatible.

We are told that he basically confirmed Voldemort had horrocruxes when he saw the diary. But thats only confirmation, he should have some theories about how Voldemort survived anyway, and the possibility of it being because of Horrocruxes. And he should have made some advances based on that instead of waiting to Harry sixth year to even starting moving his ass to hunt them. He already understood a lot of Voldemort psyche to deduce the kind of relics that he could have used for it and also the number.

Im obviously exagerating with this last paragraph, after all we dont have Dumbledore POV to know all he did and how. But it still rubs me wrong, because I can only imagine him sitting on his ass doing nothing for the 11 years since Harry was born until started going to Hogwarts

**** Small correction, Dumbledore was only Deputy Headmaster at the time.

For all we know Dumbledore tried to talk to Myrtle and just couldn't get anything. Myrtle is mercurial on the best of days. Myrtle also seemed more interested in tormenting her bully than finding out who killed her. I think she mentioned Olive Hornby more often than her own. It's possible she didn't even think anyone cared to find out and just didn't bother, if this quote is true.

"Nobody missed me even when I was alive. Took them hours to find my body --- I know, I was sitting there waiting for them."

It's equally possible, of course, that Dumbledore didn't bother looking into it, but we just don't know.

Advances how? Dumbledore doesn't know everything. All he knows by the end of book 2 is that horcruxes are on the table. That's it. And while he does know Voldemort's character and about the horcruxes, he can't possibly know where he put them or who had them. Tom's life outside of Hogwarts is a mystery to Albus, and the few people who can help solve that mystery are long dead, on Tom's side, terrified of Tom, or just plain don't remember because it wasn't a big deal to them. Besides that, just because we don't see him do anything doesn't mean he isn't. For all we know it took him ages to track down the info he did.

To add to that, the man has several jobs. Headmaster, Chief Warlock, and Supreme Mugwump(whatever that is). The man has a lot on his plate, and jumping at shadows is hardly productive.

** This is obviously a rant, so I won't answer to it more thoroughly, but let me just say that he is supposed to be The Mentor from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey]], which needs to die before the hero finalizes his quest.

** Dumbledore is the mentor archetype, unfortunately as Red points out in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXi8_1Pka1Y]] a lot of the time it's necessary for the plot for the mentor to be, well, dead. Or missing. Or just not doing anything. Otherwise how else is our protagonist supposed to do hero stuff for the story?

I don't think Dumbledore ever intended for Harry to die. He sets Harry up to face Voldemort, but I think he always believes that Harry can win because he believes love will triumph over evil. Snape thinks Harry will die, but that's because he's more cynical, not because he's speaking for Dumbledore.

Ultimately, it's a war, and Dumbledore is a general. He does what he does to save the wizarding world, and Harry recognizes that.

** To me, Dumbledore is the actual protagonist of the story. We just are stuck with the POV of his carefully trained lapdog.

It was DD's plan that killed LV. DD set the chessboard, and even when he lost his king (died from Snape's AK), he still managed to win with a pawn (obedient Harry). It makes me absolutely /LOVE/ Dumbledore, and absolutely despise canon!Harry. He's pathetic.

*** Harry IS the king in this story. He's the chosen one, the one prophesied to destroy Voldemort or otherwise be killed by him. And yeah, of course it's Dumbledore's plan! Could Harry, who is still in his teens, really hope to plan the destruction of the most powerful dark wizard of the age when he didn't have anywhere to start? Harry wasn't a lapdog. He didn't do this stuff blindly because Dumbledore said so, but because Dumbledore was initially the leader and Harry had quite literally no other leads after Dumbledore died. Any other teenager in Harry's position would've done the exact same thing.
