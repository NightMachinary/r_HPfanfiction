As the title suggests, give me your best Harry is someone else, or their Harry. Whether it be post Hogwart, time/dimensional travel, different GOF, anything. As long as it is focused, at least in part on the magical world.

Also apart from Harry being someone else the less crossover elements the better. I always feel they complicate stories quiets a bit. By that I also mean don't suggest a story that just transplants the hero, and villian, and assorted friends to the HP story, it's focused on Harry, so let's make it about Harry.

I don't mind a few extra characters here, and there(it's kind of required with Sherlock, and John) just don't suggest a story where Gohan is Harry, and Cell, and Voldemort team up, or some such. No that just makes it all messy, but I am flexible so even if it doesn't fit the requirements exactly, please still suggest, after-all I won't know if i'd enjoy it until I try it.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Strange, I suddenly find myself craving a Land Before Time mashup with Harry as Littlefoot. He still lives with relatives, he still has a band of friends each with unique talents, he still has a killer who murdered his mom out to get him...

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...

****** Ulquiorra is one of the Big Bad's henchmen, but the fandom likes him anyway. He's more evil by circumstance, he's no doubt done terrible things but it's not as if he gets any joy from them, he seems to prefer figuring things out and taking things at his own pace. He has pale skin, green eyes, can grow bat wings and fling green spears that can atomise city blocks. Also, powers in general in Bleach are linked to swords: smacking each other with them is fine and all, but if you really want to get going, you 'release' your sword and get cracking. There's no guarantee the released powers look anything like swords: one dude has his sword turn into razor sharp petals, another into a giant bone snake and the main character has his turn into a smaller sword.

** I recently read a good story where Harry is Superman linkffn(12191520)

He is in my opinion totally op (superman after all) but the author managed to make Voldemort sane and even have him team up with Grindelwad later on to make it more interesting, good read either way. has my rec.

The first three are fully released and the 4th one is in progress, last update 4 days ago.
