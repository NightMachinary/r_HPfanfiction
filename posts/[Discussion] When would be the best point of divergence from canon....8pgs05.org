...if Hermione picks up on how bad the Dursleys really are (in canon I don't think the "genius" (I disagree that Hermione is one - Intelligent? Yeah! Hard working? Yeah! Intellectually curious? Yeah! Bookworm? Yeah! Teacher's Pet? Yupp! - But not a genius! Voldemort is one, Dumbledore as well and Grindelwald, too but not Hermione!) really got it (until much later!) how bad the Dursleys are and how bad authority figures in general treat her friend!) and tries to do something about it?

Note: I don't want her calling in her parents or other adults! I'd like a Hermione that pushes Harry to learn (maybe even with rewards if she's romantically into him!) and wants to push the boundaries of magic with him (without turning into Harry's second (or third if you count Molly, which I don't because I don't like her!) mother or trying to push him around!)

So, again: When would you make the story diverge from canon?

So, stage is yours! Discuss!


** Probably fifth or sixth year. I know that sounds late, but it's around the time her character really began becoming independent. Personally I think that's due to the Yule Ball and Cedric Diggory's death. With the threat of Voldemort really out there, she kind of had to step up to the major leagues quickly. That's my take on it.

*** Interesting...I was thinking after Lockhart (he did turn out to be a fraud which shakes Hermione's outlook on the world and shatters some of her naivety (books can be wrong and authority figures can be frauds, so what else is wrong around her...I mean sure she intellectually knew those things before (she surely heard about corrupt politicians on TV or the radio) but this really drives it home that this can happen close to her!))

Also how would Hermione be touched by Diggory's death (sure she'd be a little sad for a while, but I don't think she'd really care all that much because Diggory is not somebody she would know all that much about, hell she meets him in the corridors sometimes but otherwise he probably kind of is a nobody to her!)?

**** I'm mostly speaking from personal experience here. At my school we've had students die and even if you didn't know them, the first time it happened is still a bit of a shock and can change one's perspective. I don't think Lockhart had nearly as much of an impact on Hermione as you might think. Of course, this is all speculation, but Hermione /didn't/ have blind faith in adults. She set Snape on fire a full year before she even met Lockhart. And she still had almost total faith in books. Perhaps Lockhart was the first step, but I firmly believe that fourth year at the earliest is a good point of divergence.

***** Because she saw Snape doing something and made a snap decision! Pun not intended! Otherwise she almost always deferred to authority and she didn't question Dumbledore once (despite that fact that she supposedly is very intelligent) or McGonagall despite the fact that all of the professors (especially those two as headmster and deputy, not to mention head of gryffindor!) allowed bullying, not to mention they sent a student back to an abusive environment (yes: The Dursleys were abusive, letting someone live in a cupboard is abuse and trying to hit them with a frying pan is even more so!)

ps: I've had students die at the various schools I attended, too and it didn't phase me much unless I knew them well (one of my friends died - probably suicide (especially since his family was tight lipped about the entire thing!) - shortly after we had finished attending school together (I moved on to another school to further my education, while he had gone into the workforce directly (he wasn't academically inclined) and he had problems there (he never looked all that happy when we went out, got busted with weed once (sadly weed is still illegal in Germany) and was dead a few months later)...now that was a blow! I am not emotionally cold but if I don't know the deceased then I don't feel all that sorry for their passing!

pps: Maybe it's because I've lost a great many relatives (especially my younger cousin when I was 10 years old) that death doesn't phase me much anymore (I still see it as wasteful and hope that science can - finally - overcome death in my livetime ("The last enemy to be conquered is death!"), but over all I don't cry anymore, I just feel sad for a while when somebody I know dies!)

****** I'm not saying you cry or anything, but the first time you truly comprehend the gravity of death, it does have some effect on you. It might not be crying but generally, the first time kind of sticks with you. I'm just saying that Hermione could have been affected by this. She's a very passionate and empathetic human by nature, so it'd be understandable for her to be affected by the death of a student.

She may have made a snap decision, but she certainly didn't just do it and go back to obeying all authority. Sure she trusted Dumbledore and McGonagall, but one was the head of her house and seemed to be competent (which she is) and the other was like wizard Jesus. You have to remember, this was taking place in the 90s. Bullying was typically accepted on the small scale of verbal taunts between classmates, and Hermione never went to an authority figure to complain about Malfoy, so how could McGonagall know? Sure she could have seen something, but at the same time she's human and might just not have been able to notice it.

Hermione didn't know the scale that the Dursleys abused Harry at the time, so how could she fault them? Dumbledore has the flaw of trying to see everything from a bird's eye view, which can cause some serious issues. I don't think he really knew the full extent of abuse Harry got, or perhaps he deluded himself into thinking it was all for the greater good.

******* Point taken - still, Hermione didn't seem affected in canon (at least not by Cedric's death or Sirius' death...Dumbledore did affect her because she worshipped the man and thought of him as kind of the second coming of Merlin!)

As for the teachers competence: Competent in their subjects, yes! Competent educators in general? No IMHO! Why? Bullying! All of the heads of house let bullies run wild (Pomona couldn't control her badgers when they bullied Harry for "stealing Cedric's thunder" - so much for fair Hufflepuffs! Flitwick didn't see that Luna was bullied! Snape encouraged Slytherin-Bullies and McGonagall encouraged Gryffindor-Bullies (like James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew!)...and Dumbledore? Yeah, he allowed all this and also allowed a young Tom Riddle to bully people...he might not have been able to expell Tom (he wasn't headmaster then!), but he could have put him in detention etc.)

ps: The defense professors on the whole weren't very competent! Lupin didn't teach many spells to his students (sure he did dark creatures, but that isn't it! You have CoMC for that!), Lockhart was incompetent and a fraud, fake Moody wasn't all that bad (but also didn't teach duelling/fighting!), Quirrelmort was ineffective (on purpose!)...the only half decent teacher left? Snape and he was - sadly - the best of the bunch IMHO!

*** My thinking (as another possibility, I mentioned using Lockhart as a departure point but this was also on my mind) - hell, it could also mean that they confront Remus together ("Why didn't you contact me before, Professor Lupin?" - "Indeed, why didn't you help Harry, Professor Lupin?") and try confronting Dumbledore (and maybe even the rest of the faculty) :)

**** Hermione just asking a simple question of "Harry I get he's your Godfather but you've only known him for less than a hour why were you so ready to go with him? Don't you love your family" which then sets off the ingrained response of "They aren't my Family" which let's Hermione ease into the needed conversation without plot lines leading there but rather it naturally flows there and leaves Plot lines to follow afterwards.

Lockhart wouldn't work since Hermione is mostly blinded to him and sees his interest in Harry as someone who is experienced mentoring her friend. Even after the Basilisk Hermione isn't likely to be focused on Harry and Lockhart but rather her school work and asking Harry everything about the Chamber and what happened.

Third Year is like it is hand built for what your looking for, think about how that year starts and ends its like a Harry Abuse Discount Warehouse, Hermione and Harry standing down the hall from the Hospital Wing whispering about Why Harry seems to be willing to go ANYWHERE but the Dursleys fits better than her trying to do the same after waking up and instead of focusing on herself like she should she is focusing on her friend.

***** Not after the year - Lockhard is de-cloaked (kind of like a using Moody's eye on invisibility cloaks!), his being a fraud exposed for the whole world to see!

Still, I see your point and I agree! Third year works well here and it is early in the story (early enough to make a difference especially since Harry has grown up some more (can't really use first year and second year as you pointed out doesn't work as well!) - I mean the guy IMHO always was very mature because living at the Dursleys wasn't much of a "childhood"!)

So here, have an up-vote (note: Don't know why some douchebag voted you down, your arguments make sense - I guess that person doesn't agree with what you are saying and uses the voting as an "I disagree but I don't want to comment"-button!)

******* Indeed, most people would probably quit (I am not talking suicide, but many - probably including myself - would run away! Especially since the wiz-world has treated Harry badly, not to mention that they made the rise of Voldemort possible by either supporting him, letting his supporters get away after the first war (I blame Dumbledore! I mean we know that they locked up Sirius Black who was innocent, so why not lock up Lucius Malfoy, the Carrows, McNair etc. etc.) and by not fighting back! I mean we are talking about a society where everybody carries the equivalent of a tactical nuke with them! (A wand - especially if used right - can be just as destructive! Hell, apparate in - unleash Fiendfyre - apparate out and let the fire rage!) But most wizards are sheeple and more or less wait till the DEs come knocking to either plead support or die without much in the way of fighting back!)

I for one never blamed Harry for 5th year, hell I think he should have acted out more and rebelled more etc. (he was way too passive IMHO!)

ps: OoTP is probably my favourite HP-Book (next up would probably be GoF and then probably CoS and after that PoA...the rest I like (except for the last book, I don't like JKR destroying her "hero" because frankly Harry plans his hunt like a 3 year old! He doesn't bring the tent or a super-slick bag or even tons of non-perishable food - no, Hermione does and she takes books instead of tons of food and she doesn't bring any entertainment...you can't do this without having some entertainment for your off hours! You'll drive yourself mad!), but those are the four I like the most!)

**** Harry would have made friends with Marietta Edgecombe by osmosis if Harry and Cho entered a relationship so the DA wouldn´t been betrayed(probably). Dumbledore would have keep his headmaster position for longer and Harry would have contacted Dumbledore about his vision about Sirius(like he did about Arthur).

During sixth year Harry would have gravitated more to Cho because hermione was a bitch because of the book and Ron was doing Won Won. She also could have supported Harry investigating Malfoy.

***** Ok, that's reasonable and I agree that this makes a great point of diversion from canon (I also like Cho because she is firstly a bit of a blank slate - we don't know what subjects she's good at for example, but as a Ravenclaw she probably does know a lot of things, so she can substitute for Hermione when she is too bitchy! Not to mention that she is a pureblood - right? - so she knows more about the wiz-world than Hermione does! She's also athletic (she's her house team's seeker after all!) and works well as a partner for Harry)

**** Well Cho seemed really sorry when she told Harry that Cedric had already asked her, if Harry had been a little been more daring earlier he would most likely have gone to Yule Ball with her and their relationship would have been entirely different. Think of it that way, unlike in OoTP, Cedric wouldn't be between them so their relationship wouldn't have been so disturbing/unhealthy. At the end no one can say how it would have ended but it would definitely have changed a lot of things.

***** Indeed, ripple effect (Cho might also temper his impulse to act/leap to conclusions before actually making a plan and thinking stuff through etc.! She's not a gryffindor after all and raveclaws think things through before acting!)...that's something I dislike about a lot of fanfiction-authors:

They change things, but rehash canon despite the changes as if changes didn't ripple and change things!
