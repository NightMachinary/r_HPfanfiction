Edit: Yikes, I get the point from the PMs here and on ff.n. I knew my ideas/story/writing weren't GREAT, but ouch.

Thanks to anyone who bothered to read it, even if you are one of the people who just sent cruel PMs instead of reviewing or commenting. I get the point, I shouldn't quit my day job.


** Expect much negativity. People don't like religion in their fics, whether it's being praised or disparaged.

I don't see Hermione (who is a witch) being so devout a believer as to damn Luna to Hell for not believing in God. Being a Christian witch would require mental gymnastics and hypocrisy at the level she shouldn't be capable of.

*** I feel that, at best, most (if not all) Muggleborns would end up being non-practising Christians during their time at Hogwarts.

*** Hi, I already do. The fic itself isn't about religion except that one section/mention. It was a necessary evil in order to relate it to the book that part of it is based on.

I figured Hermione, a muggleborn, was the more likely of the 3 to have any religious convictions at all, and so there she goes. Hermione's certainly a bit of a hypocrite in canon, and pretty rude to Luna, so I factored that in as well.

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read it!

**** I'm sorry but it just feels wildly out of character for Hermione, and completely bizarre from a British perspective where we are for the most part ambivalent about religion. Even people that actively go to church (which is rare tbh) would find themselves completely ostracized if they went around telling people that they were going to hell.

Nothing in canon has shown Hermione having a spiritual side - in fact, during OOTP it is Harry, Luna and to an extent Ginny that can hear whispering in the veil, Hermione can't hear anything at all. Rowling has directly stated that this is because Hermione doesn't really believe in an afterlife in the same way Harry does. She likes facts and logic and turns her nose up at anything "woolly", i.e, anything that requires a leap of faith or speculation beyond what she can see in front of her.

I guess it just feels a bit forced? In fact they all seem a bit ooc to me - I can't imagine Harry crying "they hate me!" into Luna's arms at all, and Ginny has a weird little religious bit at the end too, with dialogue that feels more like it's coming from a cowboy than a young woman. The Dursleys wouldn't gain any reputational advantage from appearing pious - in fact in my experience they would be considered rather odd.

I get the feeling there's a cultural difference at work here, and while your fic is technically sound you need to make sure you acknowledge that you're writing British characters, not American (which I am assuming you are). I see you were basing it in part on another book and unfortunately I'm not sure HP was the right method of delivery for it.

***** That's fair, thanks for taking your time to read it and offer advice!

I know it isn't super in character, for Harry OR Hermione. I was trying to give enough context clues that they were fairly different from canon, a little more like kids, more sensitive - without going into any deeper backstory. Maybe that wasn't the best thing to do, since it apparently didn't work out well. I just didn't trust my abilities yet to write anything longer or showing much action.

I never considered the death veil to be religious at all, actually. I didn't know JK ever said anything about any of their spirituality, either. Oops :/.

In regards to Harry crying about anything to Luna - I always thought, if he would let his guard down around ANYONE, it would be her.

I didn't intend Ginny to come across as religious, either. My intention was that she was AWARE of the concepts but didn't believe in them, but wanted to say to Harry that if there WAS a god, he'd let Luna in and be honored to meet someone like her.

I can see the cowboy thing, looking at it now. I tried to do 'fierce, certain, tough' Ginny, but she's not easy for me to write, either.

In regards to the other book, it was Bridge to Terebithia. It was a favorite of mine as a child, along with the other two that were going to be referenced, and it struck me how much Luna reminded me of the lead female characters in all 3.

Maybe I should have done something a little more straightforward and simple for my first attempt, though, which I can definitely see now.

Again, thanks for taking the time to offer advice! If I were to write anymore again, it would definitely help a lot.

****** Thanks for being so open to constructive criticism, it's refreshing to have someone not defensive!

The writing is good, and I'm being honest about that!! It's an interesting concept and with different characters it would have been well executed. I don't think you need to be less ambitious at all, quite the opposite. If you're going AU, make it explicit. If you want those themes, pick more fitting characters even if you're not as familiar with them - maybe even OCs. Above all, remember that religious themes applied to a religiously ambiguous fandom are always controversial and will always attract negative comments!

  While she lived, Luna played 3 similar characters to 3 different people. After she died, Luna represented 3 simple concepts to 3 complicated people. Years later, the memory of Luna helped send 3 best friends towards 3 different callings. Although she was not loved widely, she was loved deeply. Later, 3 books are written about her and the people whose lives she changed.
