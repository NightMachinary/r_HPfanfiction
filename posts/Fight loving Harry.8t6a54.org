  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

** Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): Harry is a special type of mage who feels a call to battle and violence (which he refers to as "the drums of war"), that he has to fight against to prevent from becoming a berserker.

Hogwarts Battle School linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School): Harry is hyper-focused on becoming the best, whether that means on as an individual fighter or as leader of Slytherin house.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
