*Edit for clarification:* The pairing seems to be bringing downvotes, so I'll just emphasize that this is *not* a shipping fic, but a dark fic that happens to have a weird pairing.

*** Ah, I'm late to this comment -- been a few days since I've logged in -- but thanks for reading the fic, and thanks for the compliment! Glad to hear that you liked the story.

** More horror is always good. And it being a one-shot means that weaknesses don't persist long enough to be truly grating.

This sub definitely skews towards the DLP subset of the fandom. Snape's dumb conflicted pettiness seems appropriate for this kind of fic.

*** One thing there really should be more of is horror. And yeah, it's admittedly not a premise that could be sustained in a long format, but I've long been fascinated by the darker side of Veela and the folklore they're based on. The unappealing rarepair is just the disturbing cherry on top.
