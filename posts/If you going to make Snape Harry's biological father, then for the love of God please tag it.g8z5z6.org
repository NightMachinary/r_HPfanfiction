Look, I like Snape. I like Mentor!Snape and sometimes you get a few good biological father Snapes within that subcategory, and that's /fine/. Like what you will.

But what I can't handle is that I'll just be enjoying a good fic with a good plot and. Boom! Snape is Harry's biological father /out of nowhere/. Like, it might not even have a single /shred/ of relevance to the plot. And it's really quite off putting. I mean, at the end of the day, it's your fic and you write what you want, but I would at least think that you would have the sense to just put it in the summary, or at least at the beginning of the fic.

Thank you, rant over.


** And most of times, it just spoils Lily's character for no real reason other than that the Author likes Snape over James. One was maybe a bully in his teens, the other is a Death Eater and is a bully in adulthood and as a teacher. One of many reasons that I could never read Snape as father fic.

*** True. I think the worst fics juggle trying to "preserve Lily's modesty" and not make Snape a rapist. These usually result in abominations like Snape willingly go through a memory charm, or being pregnant with Harry for like two years though a potion(? Like what?)

**** imo the only way to do it properly is making Snape a rapist (instead of having Lily be unfaithful or something), who projects the anger and hatred he feels for himself at the product of that. Make him a double whammy, grade-a asshole who both regrets it, doesn't regret it, and hates every part of it, especially himself.

And then, have Harry find out, somehow, confront him about it, and Snape just cracks - he focuses all that chaotic emotional energy into a dark, vicious hatred, and they battle for a while. Both are injured, but Harry less so, and he wakes before Snape. Harry can't come to grips with it, and talks it out with Sirius.

They talk about it, about what it means, and once Sirius is reasonably convinced Harry hates Snape more than James ever did, he reveals a secret plan of his - use the blood adoption potion that's so popular in fics to purge any trace of Snape from Harry and replace it with James, as it should have been.

The end of the story sees Snape experiencing everything as his entire life and existence falls to pieces around him, and he dies at the hands of the young man who is no longer his son.

The end.

******* Intresting... What if Snape were made "good" within an /AU/ universe? Would you hate that portrayal? Or do you just despise the character himself and refuse to read anything that refashions him? I mean, I get where your coming from - I'm sure a talented author could make a great Dramione, if it all occurred within an /AU/. But I wouldn't read it because, ew. Which is probably a similar mindframe.

But isn't the whole /point/ of fanfiction to refashion the characters and world to your taste? If the same characters had the same personalities then aspects of the world wouldn't /fit/ - OOC is a thing.

Idk I'm rambling but I'm quite interested to hear your view on this. I accept Snape is a fucking evil selfish jerk in Canon, no matter what his circumstances. But I also like reading of a Snape who is kinder if he had different circumstances or character. You seem to have a very unflinchingly negative view of him and I understand, but fanfiction is gonna fanfiction.

******** Of course an AU changes everything. But it needs to be established - so a character like Snape needs a few AU snapshots that show his altered path through life, which would essentially have to erase all that's hateworthy of him.

But most stories like this don't do that, they make a single divergence point and then go from there, which causes whitewashing and OOC characters that really needed an AU to be as they are.

******** IMO, a good Snape in an AU is essentially an OC who is named Severus Snape. If there's some real reason behind the change from Snape to OC!Snape, then maybe it might be okayish to read...still wouldn't read it because I despise the character himself.

I avoid Draco/Hermione for the same reason - it's so outlandish to think that Hermione could ever like Draco, other than an severe case of Stockholm Syndrome or something, or Draco could ever like Hermione without some incredible memory charms.

***** Rapist!Snape is totally OOC, the Rowling basically stated his love was real, the entire story is about "the love is more powerful than darkness, Snape could outsmart Voldemort and Harry could beat him because Voldemort didn't understand pure love". Voldemort was all "he just wanted her" and Harry was all "nope, he loved her". Snape run to Dumbledore despite he already asked to Voldemort to spare Lily not because Voldemort said him "nope" (judging by Voldemort's last speech to Harry, he actually said "okay" but Lily refused to move), but because Voldemort got all wrong, he didn't want her submit, he wanted her safe. If Snape wanted Lily with the force, he could have her: he knew enough about dark magic to use on her. He didn't do it because he loved Lily. You can't make a rapist out of him just because you don't like him. What is love and what isn't... it is a plot point. And Rowling said Snape was actually in love. Deal with it.

****** I mean to say that it's the only way to make him his biodad. Because Lily fucking hated the dude, especially what he became after calling her Mudblood.

And don't forget that Snape was totally on board with the death eater movement until Lily was in danger, at which point he asked Voldemort to spare her, and only her. Presumably to erase James and his son from the picture, to do... what exactly? The DEs aren't very forthcoming to Muggleborns. If she wasn't killed for defying their "lord", then she'd be placed under the imperious and gifted to a member. Most likely Snape.

He didn't love Lily. If he did, then he would accept her marriage to James, because that's what love does. It makes you want the person who you love to be happy, and Lily is happy when together with James. The fact that he obsesses over her 20 years after her death, that he hates and bullies her innocent, 11 year old son is fucking abhorrent, and the opposite of love.

JK doesn't understand that this isn't what love is.

******* We don't really know much about Lily to be fair. And we do not even know if really Snape was "totally" on board with Voldemort, he wasn't an actual death eater for a long time and Sirius said many people thought Voldemort was different and they had a change of heart about Voldemort only after a while (like Regulus, he was an year younger than Snape so if he joined them "at the beginning when people still didn't know how bad he was", so did Snape). Yeah, Lily was the reason because he defected, but we really didn't have insight on his feelings about the entire thing, we know he was interested to dark arts and he hoped to gain respect, but we know also he didn't care much about the blood thing and he was worried about "people he couldn't save" (recently, so not Lily) when he is talking with Dumbledore in the pensieve (when Dumbledore is asking him how many people he saw to die). Not the kind of thing a person not caring would say. Revelation focused on love because the saga is all about love, but if really there was not any other feeling in action, Snape would say "nope I'm outta of here" when Dumbledore dropped the big bomb about Harry. Don't forget that a big limit (and beauty, if one is not too stuck up) of the story is we have got just Harry's pov and not much more.

Just gonna say that this goes against the fact that you're using OOB sources like JK's tweets and Pottermore.

Additionally, I think I miscommunicated - not all rape is of the violent kind. He's a potions master, I'm sure he has the ability to make love potions, or some other, more weird potions that would suppress her free will. These would be rape as well. Even the imperious curse coupled with a memory charm would be rape.

And we know that exposure to the dark arts makes you more ruthless and robs you of your humanity, bit by bit. By the time he becomes potions master he's probably stopped, but even if that's the case he's far enough gone to derive joy from the suffering of children.

********* Sorry, we have got only Harry's pov and JKR's tweets obviously. JKR's tweets are facts, Harry's pov... is Harry's pov. Clearly Harry's pov is important, Harry's pov is the story... a stunted story that doesn't give total insight on side characters and we aren't supposed to take as pure gold. The cool thing about Harry: he is often wrong, so we are confused, then delighted when we read where the story is going (ex: the surprising Remus x Tonks).

Of course love potion and imperio are rape. Merope Gaunt used a love potion and Rowling said Voldemort is a sociopath for that reason, because he was born "without love".

That is the reason because rapist!snape is OOC, he easily could use those and he never did. And he never would, considering the final symbolic use of his story in the plot. Rowling never would have him do it. Or something else akin at rape.

Yeah, he is unpleasant, he is supposed to be unpleasant, if he wasn't unpleasant, he couldn't be such effective spy AND character. I don't think it make him pure evil, a villain or a RAPIST... to think he is a rapist is like to think he is Jesus... you're angry for white moral washing but you have got no problem with dark moral washing... I had a lot of horrible teachers myself, people who really shouldn't be teacher, and I'd never call the pure evil or rapist or would rule out they could be capable of heroism. For that matter, I began to read Harry Potter in 1999/2000 and I never saw Snape like utterly evil, in their confrontations he came out more like annoying than evil, and it was just so darnaly fun to see the main characters suspecting of him every time just to be surprised in the end.
