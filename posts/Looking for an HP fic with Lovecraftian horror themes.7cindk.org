As the title says, I'd be really grateful if someone could help me out, I'm a huge fan of Lovecraftian horror. I read all of Ruskbyte's works (Quo Vadis, Leviathan rising, etc...) and "Its always the Quite ones" alongside "Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod" and 'The Eyes' ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/The-Eyes]]) Which I have to admit is my special favorite so far, I wouldn't mind reading something like that one.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

I believe that this should be up your alley. Not finished, but the author did express interest in continuing it. So take that as you will.

I really hope you like it, I know the struggle of trying to find good fics in a small niche.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

** linkffn(The Arithmancer; Lady Archimedes) The maze in the Triwizard Tournament has some space-warping that gives Hermione nightmares of Lovecraftian horrors, which she repays Bagman for, and in the sequel she creates a curse that causes hallucinations and the incantation is Lovecraftian.

  It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way.
