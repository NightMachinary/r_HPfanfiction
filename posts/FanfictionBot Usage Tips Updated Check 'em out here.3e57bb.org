Hi, everyone, So far I'd like to thank everyone for support. [[/u/StuxCrystal]] was particularly helpful in the making of the bot, and the bot wouldn't be where it is if it wasn't for him.

*/applause/*

The bot has, indeed, come quite far:

- I used to run it on my own laptop, but now we have a server for it!
- We used to only support fanfiction.net, but now we support 4 popular fanfiction sites!
- We never supported downloads, but now each request will include an option for an EPUB download (a direct download for AO3; through FicSave for everything else).
- We've added a bunch of new features, and a new things called "tags" that modify the bot behavior. You can view these new usage tips on the [Usage] link posted at the bottom of any bot reply, but I'll copy-paste it here.
- And a lot more... see below!

**** *Tags:*
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: tags
     :END:

- *Tags work by adding them into any comment or post.* They are as follows:
- =ffnbot!directlinks= will parse any links (or hyperlink) to any supported website and generate a reply similar to the examples below. *Useful if you want to use hyperlinks in your post instead of manually calling the bot with =linksite(...)=.*
- =ffnbot!parent= will call ffnbot!directlinks on the parent comment. *Useful for when someone doesn't use the bot* - you can just reply to their comment with ffnbot!directlinks and the bot will generate a reply
- =ffnbot!ignore= will make sure the bot will not parse your comment. *Use if you do not want the bot to create a reply even if someone else wants to see the full bot reply by calling =ffnbot!parent=.*

To hide a tag, you can add a bunch of =^= to subscript the tag away. So you could do =^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ffnbot!directlinks= to use that tag and have it not appear in your comment! *Useful for aesthetics.*

--------------

**** *Calling the bot:*
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: calling-the-bot
     :END:
*/To link Harry Potter and the Natural 20:/*

- You can use the *name of the story*. /(A bad idea if your story is generically named - try another method!)/
- You can use the *author name* in the link request for more accuracy. This is /especially/ helpful if your requested fic has a generic name. /(Almost always accurate.)/
- You can use *direct links or the URL*. /(100% accurate!)/
- You can use the *story ID*. /(100% accurate!)/

*/Thus, the following will all yield the same result./*

** Hey all,

As stated in the post, thanks for your ideas, tips, support, code contributions, and more.

If you have any questions, comments, or criticism, please do post them here. The amount of time I will have to work on this will plummet for the rest of the year starting next month, so I would rather address what I can soon.

And with that said, I think the bot is very close to it's final form, if it's not there yet.

What about adding a way to take an author's name and have the bot reply with their profile/other names?

I don't know how hard this will be to implement, but I was thinking about this:
