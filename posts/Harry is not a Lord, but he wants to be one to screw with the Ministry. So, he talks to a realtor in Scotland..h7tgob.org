I've been seeing a lot of ads for tourist Lordships (or Laird), so I thought that it would make for good fanfiction material. Lots of crack-fic potential in this concept. Either the WW takes it /really/ serious, and Harry is left gaping in shock as his prank explodes, or they know he's full of it, but are forced to honor it due to /Insert Deus Ex Machina of choice/.


** I like the way Wind Shear handled lords. It's a title denoting magical power, akin to Archmage. Tom, Dumbledore and Harry are Lords. The Blacks are a bit put out when they realize the 3 most powerful wizards alive are all halfbloods.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Fun fact. Canonically the only one who calls himself Lord is the /self-styled/ Lord Voldemort.

All the rest are at best Head of Their Families.

I don't recall anyone in book or movie to have claimed peerage of any kind except Tom Riddle, and it was more in the sense of being a Dark Lord, than having a title.

My theory is that this comes from Naruto's fanfiction where canon translation translates the Head of a clan as Lord(or anyone with the honorific -sama), it came from there.

**** So they take their titles from the Muggle World, use it in the Wizarding World, but deny the connection to the Muggle one? I can definitely see purebloods doing that.

I don't recall the convention but canonically it's Most Ancient and Noble House of Black and in Harry's case it's the Noble House of Potter, so I guess you get points and different moniker for how old you can trace the lineage.

That Sacred 28 stuff while canon is complete nonsense made by a bigoted guy whose criteria is "Who doesn't like Muggles" with a bit of "Who I don't want to piss off", so that means any serious consideration would ignore it.

Peerage in the UK has gone through a /lot/ of changes in the last centuries, most of the hereditary titles have lost any real power and their seats are democratic now AFAIK. And the title of Lord can be used in a myriad of ways, normally it includes Earl, Baron and I think Viscount, anything higher is Count and then a Duke(that IIRC must belong to the Royal Family). You can buy some of those old titles from families though, for a large fee I think, but it won't give you any real power unless you bough land with it. I also don't think with today's society it would be a good idea go around demanding to be referred to as aristocracy.

Sorry, rant over, did some research about peerage and inheritance for a fic and fell into a rabbit hole that lead me to understand a lot better UK's govt and especially how confusing their laws are(think they've been added and amended for the last millennia or so), it totally lends credence for those fics where solicitors dig old laws and throw at each other until one sticks.

***** There is no Noble house of Potter, that's fanon.. And we are not sure if Black's are noble just that they call themselves one, but the idea I had was that they got their titles long ago, and those titles are muggle ones, they didn't take them, as they already had them...

Actually I think you cannot buy, like you can kind of (would call it more of a scam if someone sold theirs, as you cannot transfer them), but no other nobility would think of you as noble, and Monarch might not think you are one (most likely wouldn't as you wouldn't be), and for nobility that is the important one. Even more to those in countries where there needs to be an equal marriage, to keep the titles, say Russian's tsar's couldn't marry anyone who was lower classs than them (there are more to this but hard to explain), or they could lose the title, same with their children or counsins etc, they couldn't become tsar after the current died, if they married someone of lower class.. Same was going on in Germany and some other places, though not Britain, but the nobility there still married these nobles from places where there had to be equal marriage so it was somewhat important to them as well. (historically)

And there are actually non-royal Dukes in Britain (only males can inherit them so they might die out if they don't have any boys, or go abeyand), though still their real titles, new ones are only given to Royalty, but there are people who are Duke who are not part of the Royal family.

****** That's true, sorry got carried by fanon again, i remembered a family tree like the Black one from Pottermore and it had the Noble House of Potter written at the top. But I couldn't find it.

Yeah, I remember people selling titles from several countries, but it was mostly a novelty for rich people to have and other nobles with comissioned/given titles wouldn't care for them.

Thanks for the explanation, I am a bit familiar with that, like how before WWI most of the royals in Europe were cousins or something because of Queen Victoria(it was even said if she was alive she could have stopped it)

Thanks for that list, I was looking for something like that, I now see where I was mistakem, well back to Wikipedia.

Still we could avoid all that trouble and just say these noble titles came from Arthur and Camelot and that they are pertaining to the magical world, so they simply don't recognize or don't overlap with the Muggle Peerage.

******* I personally like to think that they would be muggle titles, as that is only one that makes sense to me, and I like to think that say British monach is also the ruler of The British wizarding World, which is why they have Minister of Magic (he would also have a seat in the Parlament, but it would have been kept as speacial kind or heredity title etc for muggle eyes, even though in reality it's chosen by wizards in someway, but for muggles it has different name and they think it's either specialty thing or a heriedity one etc)

And you need to take in account that Arthur and Camelot would have been hundreds of years before statue of secrecy and thus before statue of secrecy all wizards and muggles would have been under the muggle monarch.. I like to think that either all Royalty are magical (how else would they conquer big areas and hold them and like the reason why they studied at home, they truly went to Hogwarts, same reason why they often marry other nobles, they married other wizards, and in modern day when they marry regural people, they marry either muggles or muggle-borns, which in olden days wasn't a thing that other wizards looked l´kindly at, which is why they often married nobility, though I think British monarch married normal people as well so..) or they all had and still have a court wizard..
