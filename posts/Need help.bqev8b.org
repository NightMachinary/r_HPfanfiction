I am a newbie in the HP fandom and specially in SNARRY fandom.I recently finished Danger in the Healing by authors faynia and stormypup for the Dusk till Dawn : Harry Potter/Severus Snape Fuh-Q-Fest Wave 12.There is a footnote by author that a sequel or an epilogue will be written.Please help me so I can find out if any sequel was written or not and if it was kindly help me to find it.

Thank You.


** I didnt see anything expressly stated as a sequel, but maybe it's one on Faynia's master list of fics? [[http://faynia.insanejournal.com/92067.html#cutid1]]
