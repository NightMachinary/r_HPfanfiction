I had a craving for a good humor and AU experience. Preferably no bashing.

I was thinking that maybe this could happen by Molly making Ron take Ancient runes because they still had Bill's old schools books and the required reading for that class was the same.

*** So I clicked on the link before reading your comment. Then while reading the summary I was like "Wow, this is the exact same prompt as the post!" Then I saw the update time and put two and two together. Please continue! I wasn't expecting finances to be the reason why Ron takes up the runes course, but I like it! :)

** An interesting prompt that could lead to some big changes (didn't Harry chose his electives with Ron and so would go in Rune too?)

Except I'm not convinced by the reason of the change. Divination books also probably didn't change (since Trewalney if the teacher since 1980) and at least one Weasley took Divination before (Percy).

But the reason could be anything I guess, maybe they just got lost and found themselves in Trewalney tower, and were totally desabused by the drunk supposed to teach them.
