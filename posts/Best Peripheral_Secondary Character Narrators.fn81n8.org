Essentially, I'm looking for fics that star the Dr Watson to the Protagonist's Sherlock Holmes. Eg. If Harry is the main pusher-of-the-plot, I'd like to see a story from Hermione's perspective as she observes him go, or from Daphne Greengrasses' perspective as she wonders what the hell the Golden Trio are doing. The Protagonist of the story observes the Protagonist of the actual plot and doesn't push events themselves, only observes others doing the things they do. If you don't believe that works, take a glance at Ishmael in Moby Dick, or any of the other references in the TV Tropes page below.

[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonPeripheralNarrator]]

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** I've written a couple of these, both depressing. This one's complete:

And this one would be complete if I could stop reading the news and get back to writing:

*** Damn. I read a little of both and you're right - those are both depressing. I'll be saving those for a day that I'm more... emotionally prepared for them. Thanks for the recs though! I look forward to reading them.

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

  When a human is captured by werewolves, escape is impossible, but she might be able to accomplish one thing: kill Remus Lupin. He's the most evil werewolf in the pack because he's the best at pretending to be human.
