Good day (or night) y'all, this is my first post here, as well as general foray into HP fanfiction.

What are some good general fics starring a Harry who is sorted into a different house? Ideally, I'd love to find different fics for all three houses. Can be one-shots or full-fledged fics, or even crossovers.

I kind of want to see what authors' takes on the underexplored characters from other houses feel like, because man, Griffyndors just kind of dominated in the original story.


** Slytherin: Return of Emerald by Bleu Tsuki (ff.net). Leo Inter Serpentes: First Year by Aeternum (a series on ao3). Ravenclaw: Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven by BakenandEggs (a series on ao3).

Sorry I don't know a good one where he is sorted into Hufflepuff.

*** The HARRY THE HUFFLEPUFF series by BAJAB

**** Would you recommend it? (I read a few, that are more humorous than anything else, which I don't like).

***** I don't know if I might call Harry the Hufflepuff the best Hufflepuff!Harry story, but I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good laugh.

Also, I just remembered another story that has Harry as a Hufflepuff. I like this one better. It's The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville.

***** Golden Age by zeitgeistic is a great Hufflepuff Harry fic - it's not humorous; it's a great take on Hufflepuffs.

ETA: It occurs to me that it might not be exactly what you're looking for, because Harry doesn't start out as a Hufflepuff - he's resorted there in eighth year, after the war. (not a big spoiler, as it's the whole premise of the story, but just to err on the safe side).

I never get the bot to work but I'll try.\\

  The Celtic druids once made a decision that kept magic in abundance in Britannia, but they couldn't account for the technological advances Muggles would make centuries later. Now magic is dying on the isles, and this is not a dark lord that Harry can fight. OR: Harry Potter doesn't save the world this time, but he does get a lot of hugs.

** The Harry in [[http://www.hpmor.com][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] is such a nerd, even Hermione considers him an insufferable know-it-all. It's hilarious. He's a Ravenclaw of course.
