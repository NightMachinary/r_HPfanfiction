Maybe being able to read auras, or emotions that people have, or other similar things, doesn't have to be exactly that.

It can be anyone or multiple people with that type of power.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Et cetra, doesn't have to focus on a pairing).

ANYONE can be the main character, can be on any site, can have any warnings.

NO Harem Harry, no OP Harry. If Harry is "Lord" I'd rather it be him helping other people instead of it being Draco Malfoy 2.0

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Doesn't have to be the main focus of the story, just as long as it's there somewhere.


** The Hedge magic in Percy take the wheel kinda fits with what you're looking for, if your willing to read a fic with Percy as the main character. It's a good read and has some nice bonding moments between the weasleys. Description: A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can. Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14033613/chapters/32322168]]
