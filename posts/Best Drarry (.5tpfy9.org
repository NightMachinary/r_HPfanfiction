  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

*** I don't love Harry in this fic but to be fairs he's coping fairly alright with a terminal illness so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt in this one. I'll look at the others. Thanks!

** Not sure if you've read these, but here are my top few. In order, except for the first three, which are all equal contenders.

1. Stately Homes of Wiltshire: this is such a lovely, heart-warming 'fic full of very sweet Harry/Draco moments. It's quite funny, but mostly sweet, and Draco's characterisation is great. The basic premise is Harry, who's an Auror, has been sent to take care of some poltergeist activity that's been threatening Malfoy Manor. The author nails the dialogue, writes a strong side-Hermione, and writes a really solid, jokey Harry that's reminiscent of canon-Harry (something that I find rare in fanfiction). I definitely recommend, I was sad to finish this one. linkao3(6239806)

2. Stop All The Clocks (This Is The Last Time I'm Leaving Without You): the author's pretty well known for her Drarry, but this 'fic is /amazing/. It's fucking sad, and I spent the rest of the night after reading it feeling bummed the hell out, but it's written beautifully & it's got my favourite kind of Draco/Harry dynamic (messy & confused & oftentimes full of anger). The Harry in this is spot on, it's a really fantastic (if tragic) read. linkao3(1273078)

3. Paradox: this was the first ever Drarry I read. I was mad anti-Drarry pre-reading this, and then it converted me entirely. The author nails Draco in a way that I've never seen before. He's nasty & self-preserving & elitist and it still manages to make sense, the Harry romance part. It's also got a super sweet ending (the story's split into two parts) that'll make yr heart soar, dang. I love this one so much, Draco is perfectly written. It's a time travel fic, w/ Draco going back in time, but it's got this whole interesting thing surrounding the loss of memories (or something, I read it a while ago). Recommend 10/10. linkao3(753415)

4. Written On the Heart: this has the best Blaise Zabini side character, he's such a nuisance. Check this one out for the dialogue, it's one of the very best I've read. Plot wise, it's good, but it's all totally secondary to the brilliant conversations in this fic. This one's a really fun read, definitely recommend. linkao3(9065263)

5. Lumos: this one's got a bunch of wanking, basically. Recommend it tho, it's got a great Harry & a fantastic Draco/Harry dynamic. linkao3(8909155).

6. There is Always the Moon: I haven't actually finished this one, b/c it got a bit... silly, but the first half is such a great Draco that I have to recommend it anyway. Really interesting plot (it's based off someone's one-shot, If The Sun Goes Black, which is great, albeit rushed; I'll link it). Draco's cursed & seeks out Harry's help, basically, but the best part of this 'fic is Draco owning & operating a potion's shop on Diagon Alley. His interactions w/ Narcissa, the shop hand, and customers is a really fun read. Check Always the Moon out for the Draco, check the one-shot out for the Drarry. linkao3(6264406) & linkao3(4707098)

7. All Life is Yours to Miss: Harry and Draco work at Hogwarts, Draco owns a pet beetle, sweetness ensues. Basically Harry ends up paralysed due to an awry Draco-prank. Draco consistently visits him in the Hospital Wing, recounting his day, or whatever, out of guilt-but-eventual-habit. It's a cute premise and it's a cute Draco. Oddly, my favourite thing about this 'fic is Hagrid and his friendship w/ Draco's pet beetle. It's not as overwhelming, IMO, as the the first 3 fics I recommended, but it's still super lovely & the author is well known for her Drarry. linkao3(825875)

Hope you find something you haven't seen before.

  Harry doesn't mind that so many Slytherins from his year have returned to finish their NEWTs, really he doesn't. It's just -- do they have to be so friendly? He's not prejudiced, really he's not. It's just -- they've got to be up to something, right? Unnerved by the attention he's attracting from everyone -- the Slytherins are the least of it, to be fair -- and struggling with a raft of changes to Hogwarts itself, Harry wishes he could be happy that one constant remains: Draco Malfoy really fucking hates him.When he's hit by an illegal love-spell though, Harry finds he has more to worry about than whether or not Blaise Zabini actually wants to be his friend. For if everyone affected has been blessed -- or cursed, by the look on Malfoy's face -- with a magical tattoo revealing the name of their soulmate, what does it mean that Harry's skin remains completely bare?

  Thanks to a clever bit of magic and the help of an old acquaintance, Draco is given the chance to relive his years at Hogwarts with the knowledge of what exactly is in store for the future. However, when things tumble out of Draco's grasp, he finds himself losing his memories of the life he's already led as everything takes a startling turn away from what he'd always assumed to be his destiny.

  Draco's life after the war is everything he wanted it to be: it's simple, and quiet, and predictable, and safe. But when a mysterious curse shatters the peace he'd worked so hard to build, there's only one person he can trust to help him. After all, Harry Potter has saved his life before. Now Draco has to believe that Potter will be able to do it one more time. (A remix of If the Sun Goes Black by pasdexcuses)

** I have so much love for the Drarry pairing - here's a link to [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks][my full rec list]] with comments. There's almost too many recs there but you can put a bunch of filters on to narrow it a bit.

Also you can double post over at [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] for recs too :)
