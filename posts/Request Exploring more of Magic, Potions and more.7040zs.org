Stories that explore magic, potions, maybe Astronomy and Ancient Runes more then they did in the books?

How they did this doesn't matter.

Any rating is fine, would rather have it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters would be fine.


** I've read some fics that focus a little bit more on the theory behind the spells? But I can't think of any specific names. I'll see what I can dig up and then post back!
