“Come Draco, the dark lord has summoned us” Lucius snapped as he struts with purpose closely followed by his son into an eerie equivocal room. Voldemort, perched in a throne like chair hisses at Draco's Father, “Here, now Lucius I must speak to you... I am, once and for all going to kill the boy.”

“Master. It's impossible your horcruxes are destroyed...its suici-”

Before Lucius can blink Voldemort draws his wand. “Avada kedavra!”

In shock. Knees trembling. Voldemort jaunts over to Draco, staring at his father's motionless body lying peacefully on the floor, tears streaming down his cheeks he is ready to collapse on the floor, break down into an emotional ball, wrap his arms around his Dad's unresponsive body to say his final goodbyes wishing he could tell him that he loved him just one more time, and mean it this time. However, Draco doesn't dare move a muscle as Voldemort is towering over the grieving boy. Voldemort draws his wand once again pressing it against Draco's face.

“Don't be so stiff Draco, I'm your father figure now” he whispers whilst whipping a tear from Draco's face with his wand. “let this be a lesson you, don't disappoint me Draco.”

“Y-y-yes master” stuttered Draco as he stumbles to the door.

Harry Potter sits motionless on a mossy wooden chair perched in between his mother and father's graves, the moonlight reflecting off his circle round glasses. Harry hears a familiar sound, the sound of his owl Hedwig, which had a letter clamped between its upper and lower beak soaring majestically towards Harry. The owl lands on an overhanging branch above his head, he reaches up and snatches the letter out of its mouth hoping for a letter from one of his closest friends Ron and Hermione, instead recognising the name Draco Malfoy in capital letters on the top. Harry tears the letter open, it reads:

Dear Potter,

I understand we've had our differences.

Now, however we share a common ground.

He killed my father.

I want revenge.

Meet me at Godric's Hollow at sundown I will be waiting.

Yours, Malfoy

Harry, Ron, Hemione and Malfoy, off to one side, sit on an old wooden table in Godrics Hollow discussing their plan for vengeance. “This is barbaric!” Demands Hermione “you cannot seriously expect us to use harry as bait for revenge”. “and that Granger, is exactly why it's gonna' work. Didn't expect a mudblood like yourself to understand anyway” Hermione's face went as red as her Griffindor scarf wrapped around her neck. It was almost as if you could see steam coming out of both ears and just as she was about to raise a fist the rather scrawny Malfoy. Harry interrupts “Hermione's right, this is not going to work, especially with the army of death eaters that'll be waiting for us”

“What do you suppose then... Potter”

“you're going to turn yourself in”

“that's the stupidest thing I've heard since Weasly last opened his mouth”

Before Ron could retaliate. Harry snaps “we'll go to the ministry first thing morning, they'll be willing to cooperate if you do, make a deal, they want him as badly as we do”

“yea I reckon u might only spend half your life in Azkaban” opined Ron. Harry stared blank, he hated the thought but knowing full well Malfoy would get away with a slap on the wrist if his information proved useful to the ministry.

The sun set over the damp overcast sky floating over Whitehall central London, the headquarters of the ministry of magic being deep underground. They hopped into the disgusting phone booth muttered a spell. The four frenemies stood as the phone booth elevated underground into the headquarters. “Harry Potter for Kingsley Shaklebolt” he exclaimed to a reception witch. “Yes, he's expecting you”

Harry, Ron and Hermione stepped into Shaklebolts office and explained to him their situation, the reception gave Malfoy a signal to step inside. “Mr Malfoy...” He boomed as he sat with his blue robes and crown like hat upon his head “I understand you have information that will be of some use to me”

“y-yes sir” Malfoy studdered with the knowledge that if he couldn't be of use he would be thrown into Azkaban for most of his life.

“I can help you bring down The Dark Lord”

“Once...and for all”

“And this is for vengeance? For your father? I'd give my condolences, if he were not a coward, much like his son” Shaklebolt scoffed. Draco Seems to clench every muscle in his body, his face filling with pure rage, but he knows better than to bite back.

“I want out, I can give you information... if we make a deal”

Shaklebolt pauses for what seems like eternity. “Instead of a life sentence which is the minimum sentence for any and all death eaters, two years in Azkaban prison. My only and final offer, providing the dark lord is either shackled behind bars for life or dead.”

“TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW” Shaklebolt commanded as the room shakes with the boom of his voice.

“He's weak, not powerless but weak. He's been trying to perfect a regeneration poem, disastrous should he get the formula wrong, we must hurry, he's already been at it for months.” One drop of a regeneration potion and Voldemort will return to the brilliant, terrible... but brilliant wizard he once was.

“Voldemort is brewing the potion in Little Hangleton, the old graveyard” Harry's face fills with anguish. “Yes Potter, the graveyard you were led to all those years ago through the portkey of the Triwizard tournament”

“We must go now” said Shaklebolt with a demanding tone.

Ron interrupts, “but minister, don't we need more, you know, manpower?”

“Mr Weasly you must not tell a soul, Rita Skeeta is in.” Rita Skeeta being the star reporter for the Daily Prophet, who could ruin the ministry of magic as it's known today with this story. “This stays between us do you all understand” He Pauses, draws his wand, “acio broomstick”

The five arrive at the rusty gate of the graveyard and hear murmuring in the distance. Ron opens the door just a crack and it screeches like a cat whose tail has been trodden on.

“Shhh this way Ronald” says hemione pointing to a small hole the left.

As they venture deeper into the cemetery the murmurs get louder and clearer.\\
“Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son! Flesh of the servant, willingly sacrificed, you will revive your master.” Squeaks Wormtail as he drops a bone presumably from draco's father in the couldren and cuts off his finger watches in agony as it drops into the bubbling potion. Wormtail removes a Goblet from his pocket, scoops up some of the potion bows and gives it to Voldemort. The audience of death eater's surrounds

“The Dark Lord shall rise once more” They say in harmony.

“Expeliamas!” yells Shaklebolt as Voldemorts wand flies out from his hands. The surrounding death eaters fly away in cloak like smoke recognising the minister. All wands pointed at Voldemort the five surround him.

“Why would kill him? ... Answer me!” Draco demanded

“The resurrection stone can only get me so far, young, ignorant Draco. Your Father paid the ultimate sacrifice, he is a... was a hero hehe!”

Cloak like smoke surrounds Voldemort as he ascends into the night sky. Draco pulls out his wand, tears streaming down his face.

“Avada Kedavra!”

The cloaked figure falls from the sky as Draco collapses falls to the floor, his body filled with emotion.
