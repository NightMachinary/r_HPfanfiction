He had made quite a career unlocking these secrets, Harry thought as he stared at the last remaining vault door. Inset in the wall, the 2x3 foot door perfectly matched the others with its gilt silver hardware and heavy green marble, the now familiar symbol of intertwined snakes surrounding its lock. After he had opened the Chamber as a child, it had sat largely untouched for decades, and likely would have remained so if he hadn't joined the staff of Hogwarts himself.

It had become a bit of an obsession for a while, a look into the mind of the man that tortured his childhood, as well as his predecessors. But today that obsession came to an end, no more late nights away from Ginny and the children. He was going to be a better father after this, do all the things that fathers are meant to do. Opening the lock of course required speaking a phrase in Parseltongue -- an ability he once held naturally, and which he had spent decades slowly relearning built of fragments of memory and the "feel" he had when speaking it in his younger days. He never in a million years at that time thought he would take such a path, but with the Chamber's beastly librarian dead at his hand he had little other choice in order to bring things to the light of day, and to that light these dark horrors must be brought.

The other vaults were filled with research notes, and decayed experiments of various dark and forbidden magics -- the earliest created by Salazar Slytherin himself -- but Harry was far more interested in the last several, the ones stocked by one whose name still sent shivers down his spine at the thought. While Salazar's vaults contained a wide variety of research subjects ranging from mind-controlling hexes to various transmutations and incredibly complex wards, as well as power-amplifying enchantments, Voldemort's crypts seemed centered on a more singular goal: the development of Immortality. It would likely be more accurate to call the vaults a list of failures in that regard, but as things reached nearer the end, one thing came more and more into focus: the precise workings on how to splinter a single soul into many fragments -- the ability to create a Horcrux.

Nearly all of his attempts, though, had of course been failures, and knowing full well that his first success was Tom's diary, Harry wasn't really expecting to find anything else. But one thing that he had found was the absolute level of depravity in Voldemort's experiments, the unnecessary cruelty of which kept him up at night, much to Ginny's worry. But this was the last, the final peek into a dark and disturbed mind, and after this he felt he could finally lay his trauma to rest. Harry spoke the hissing gutteral language of the serpents, and the lock slithered open.

The first thing he noticed was the smell. The horrible foulness quickly filled the room, and he had to fight back a wave of nausea that seemed to reverberate from the dark hole which now stood before him. The second thing he noticed was the deep scratches on the back of the vault door, made as if by some desperate magical beast, but, while disturbing, these things were no surprise given the nightmares he had seen in the other vaults. What /was/ a surprise, though, was the sudden movement in the shadows...

"Lumos!" he yelped while falling back to the floor, wand outstretched in front of him. He could now make out the near skeletal, stark white, growling figure in the dark as it bolted towards him, tackling him faster than he could utter any sort of defense, and for a brief moment the thought that he may never see Ginny or the children again chilled him to his very core. The snarling teeth of the creature stood less than an inch from his neck, ready, he was sure, to snap his head clean from his shoulders, and then it started...sniffing? Licking? Shaking with uncontrollable excitement? This wretched, emaciated beast was a dog?

And a seemingly very happy-to-be-free one. Its long white fur horribly matted, its bones clearly visible beneath its taught skin, its eyes sunken deep, yet filled with such joy. How many decades had it sat locked away in that tiny box? It seems Harry had discovered Tom Riddle's true first success. Looking the poor thing over, Harry came across a dirty and mostly decayed collar with a small golden tag, "Seventy One" still clearly etched into its worn surface. "Well, that's not a proper name at all now is it? I think I will call you... Soney," Harry murmured to the giant happily wiggling ball of grime and white fur, "He really did a number on both of us didn't he?". Ginny was not going to be at all happy about this...

*** Wrote a little more for funsies--

This was going to be abit of a delicate operation, getting her to accept an immortal, abomination against nature, created by the dark lord himself as a pet? Harry thought himself daft for even considering the notion, but what choice did he have? Soney and himself were kindred spirits afterall, both victims of the same monster. "First things first, let's get you cleaned up". "Tergio" he incanted with a flick of his wand, but was surprised when it had no effect on the incredibly filthy animal. "Hmm" he shrugged, "Scourgify!", but once again no effect was had on the walking mess who was now looking at him with his head tilted curiously. "How incredibly odd.", "Well I've never been overly great at cleaning spells, perhaps Proffessor Sprout would be of some help here."

As they headed out to leave the Chamber for the brighter world above Soney could not help but throw himself into the waters surrounding the walkway, oblivious to the staring snake statues that lined the hall, guzzling the dank muck as if it were a sweet nectar. It took all of his strength to pull the now soaked animal from the bassilisks crypt, and when they finally emerged in the second floor lavatory both were sporting a smell that would scare a boggart. "No NOT THE TOILETS!" he yelled as the still parched dog rushed ahead.

As they made their way through the halls to Sprouts office Harry could not help but turn a bright shade of red as he caught the stares of many students, several grabbing their nose in revulsion as he passed by. "Not a very good look for a suposedly respectable professor", he thought to himself, finally making it to the door of Hogwarts eldest, and oddest working professor. 10 years ago the ministry had pressured her to retire, but she was having nothing of it, 6 members of the ministry, 2 of which were former Aurors, insisted to the point that she outright challenged the lot of them to a duel... simultaneously. The witnesses to the event are said to still wake in the night screaming, and needless to say the Proffessor maintained her possition without further complaint. Harry struck the knocker 3 times and waited for a response, not precisely certain as to what he may see once the door opened.

*** I have a pretty solid outline I think, but this seems like a story that could stretch on for numerous chapters. I do very much like the idea of an immortal dog that can literally smell traces of voldemorts magic and influence, seems like it could open up a very solid storyline quite easily.
