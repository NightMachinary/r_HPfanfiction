Hi all. I'm looking for stories with lots of combat, where harry and hermione aren't throwing stunners at the multitude of dark wizards slinging dark curses at them. Imo it takes away from any and all seriousness when it comes to the fact they are supposed to be fighting a war. Who tries to trip and stun people who are trying to make your blood boil or shove your soul from your body?

Prefer less angst, more independence, and an equal power balance between harry and his romantic partner. Either of them leading the other around like a love sick puppy is not really interesting to me.

Fem!slash, time/deminsion travel, and dark but not evil are all fine.

I prefer Harmony, Honks, and Lunar Harmony pairings above most others.

Thanks in advance!

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

** Linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)

An attempt at a realistic OP!Harry (no Black library, goblin inheritances, or Founders training), where Harry essentially can only use transfiguration. Lots and lots of battles, where Harry almost never 'steamrolls' his enemies. No absurd canon-esque "stand around and shout 'Stupefy!'" style fighting. Voldemort isn't the only bad guy.

Hogwarts part of the story ends after Second Year and the school stops being the primary setting. Lots of international travel (Middle East, Europe, America).

The pairing is not slash and not Harmony, although Luna has a big role. Romance comes later in the fic. Very nearly complete (2-3 chapters to go). No smut, but graphic violence and an attempt to depict trauma from all the aforementioned fighting.

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.
