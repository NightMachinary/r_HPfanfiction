I forgot the name of a fanfiction and I want to read it again. I don't remember much of it so if you don't know either I wouldn't blame you.

Ok! So,

•Remus gives Harry a cool ass trunk

•Harry time travels to the Marauders era

•Remus gave Harry a journal with his memories so Harry can write in it and he can respond, kinda of like Tom Riddle's journal except it doesn't suck out your soul

•Harry creates a spell, makes the victim sleepy

•Harry duels Frank Longbottom?

That is what I remember, if you know what I am looking for please respond.

Thanks!


** That would be linkffn(Harry Potter and the Turning of the Sun by Lord umbrex). Updates basically once a year right around Christmas, only a few more chapters left.

Also! You need to hit the enter button /twice/ for the next item on a list to appear on a different line.

*** This is definitely it. 300k words of pretty much nothing happening except the author getting sidetracked by trying to explain Pottermore stuff that isn't relevant and introducing characters like Frank Longbottom who gets the spotlight for one chapter then has maybe 5 lines total in the entire second half of the fic.

  AU past OP-After Harry is thrust back in time, he has to survive his final years in Hogwarts and live his new life around people he knows will become Death Eaters. Can he beat his prejudices and give people a chance, or will he crumble under the pressure?
