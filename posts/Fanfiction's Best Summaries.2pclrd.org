A good summary is a tough thing to write. And yet, they're incredibly important. Once a story is established (or good enough), it can grow based on word of mouth alone, but to get anyone interested in the first place, it helps to have one of those killer, evocative summaries that draw you in, that point to something compelling, that make people say, "hmm, I want to know more."

What are some of the best you've seen? Here are a few of mine:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or]] - ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

/Cheeky and clever, this one evokes a very compelling image of Hermione./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-That-Was-Promised][The Prince That Was Promised]] - He remembered being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold, dead things. He is only the 2nd son of the King, a spare, but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.

/Almost a bit much, but considering the medium, almost perfect in tone. Hooks you in right away. Explains the premise and whets your appetite./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343543/1/Harry-the-Mysterious-Curse-of-the-GirlWhoLived][Harry & The Mysterious Curse of the Girl-Who-Lived]] - Harry always knew that there was something unique about him. In a way, the arrival of the Hogwarts acceptance letters was almost expected... except, why are they all addressed to 'Harriet Potter?

/Brings up the central conflict straight away, with an unusual twist on a well-worn concept./

You'll notice that I didn't include any summaries that use "tags" such as post-OotP AU, dark!Harry, Harry/Daphne, or anything of that nature. I get why people use them, but I'm a lot less likely to click on a story that tries to pique my interest by putting itself in a box. If you feel the need to include that stuff, fine, but do so in an Author's Note or something and give people the chance to go into it without assumptions.


** I can see why you dislike tags, but I think concerning fanfics they're a good idea. There are just so many fanfics out there, that adding tags really helps with the search if you're looking for a specific type of story (like many readers do) like dark!Harry, or Slytherin!Harry or whatever.

When I search ffnet and want to see if there's a new timetravel story, I'll use ctrl+F to look for the keyword "time travel" and connected keywords like "time", "sent back" etc. If they aren't mentioned in the summary I'm not likely to find the story without the tag as I'm not often in the mood to wade through hundreds of bad summaries just to find one good story. I don't think that the tags are a substitute for a good summary though. I'll look for keywords/tags first and then read the summary to decide if I want to take a look at the story.

I think when it comes to fanfics many readers have very specific preferences, some don't want to read mentor!Snape, some don't like dark!Harry, slash or certain pairings, and tags helpful there. Of course this gives away parts of the story, but with so many fanfics available, I think it's necessary. Personally I especially appreciate tags that state character bashing, I can't stand it and really don't want to waste any time reading stories like that.

*** I do see the benefit of tags, and I don't think people who use them are bad or stupid or wrong, it's just not what I'm personally a fan of. When I look for story recs - on here, DLP, or the TVTropes rec page, I don't mind if tags are involved in the recommendation, because, like you said, sometimes you're in the mood for something specific.

For the times when I'm looking for something nonspecific, when I'm just looking to be intrigued and caught up in a good story, I want that literary-type summary that's well crafted and hooks me in on its own merits, not the merits of this very specific fanfiction nomenclature.

**** yeah, I get that too, but for me often it's just too time consuming to read through all the summaries in search of a good one. So tags help me reduce the number of stories I go through but I'll probably pass up on a few good stories that way. Hopefully I find those in the recommendations on other sites.

I don't really like it when pairing are tagged in the summary. I think it adds something to the story if I'm in the dark for a while and can try to guess solely on basis of the writing who will end up with whom. Of course with so many readers disliking specific pairings or looking for stories with specific pairings it makes sense to reveal it in the summary or an A/N.

** I disagree with you as to the purpose of a summary. I don't think that it's there to seem compelling in and of itself. It's the fic's *content* which draws you in, not the summary. The summary merely informs the reader what that content is. If the fic content aligns with my preferences, I'll open the story. If it doesn't, I won't. And, crucially, if I can't tell from the summary if the fic aligns with said preferences, I won't open it.

This is because the vast majority of fics do not align. It's safe to assume that I'm going to dislike a fic unless it falls into my niche, and I think most readers do the same: there are very few people out there who like all, or even most, sub-genres of fanfic. We all have our pet likes and dislikes.

So a summary that leaves me without a good idea of what the fic is will be a failure of a summary, because I'm not going to open the story. It can be as artistic as you like, but if it's too vague I'm just going to skip right past it.

With that in mind, the purpose of a summary is to inform prospective readers, in as concise a way as possible, what the content of the fic is. A summary that's too in love with itself or trying too hard to be pretty will fail in this task, because flowery language and information density are diametrically opposed.

Incidentally, I also disagree on the topic of the summary of Applied Cultural Anthropology. If fact, the summary is one of the reasons why I quit the fic in disgust in the first chapter, because at no point does it tell you that this is Hermione-centric. The default assumption is that a fic will be Harry-centric; if you're going to do something different you have to tell readers.

*** To expand in a more substantive way, when I'm skimming a summary this is the check list my mind is going through:

1.  Are there any spelling, punctuation or grammatical errors? (If yes, discard)

2.  Harry centric? (If no, discard)

3.  Slash? (If yes, discard)

4.  At least 3000 words/chapter? (If no, discard)

5.  Polygamous relationships? (If yes, discard)

6.  If the summary features any of the words in Appendix A: Independent Harry, discard.

7.  If the summary features any of the words in Appendix B: Shipping, discard.

8.  If the summary features any of the words in Appendix C: Bad Magic, discard.

9.  Does the central plot only work with OOC characters? (If yes, discard)

10. Will Harry have greater agency than canon-Harry? (If no, discard)

11. Is there a plot? (If no, discard)

Any summary that can convey all this information to me in fewer than three sentences is a good summary. Essentially, summaries are my way of screening out the bad, not finding something good. Once I've screened out the stuff I know I dislike, I'll give the fic a try.

*Appendix A: Independent Harry*

Dumbles, Voldie, Moldyshorts, manipulations, betrayal, grey, dark, new path, new way, independent, realisation, realise, block, inheritance, Gringotts, will reading, goblins, Lord, Potter-Black, heir, House, Noble and Ancient, bashing, Neville, true friends, abuse, tired of, fed up with.

*Appendix B: Shipping and Bad Romance*

Veela, bond, soul, contract, marriage, love potions, true love, realises, falls for, all along, meant to be, a certain bookworm/redhead/bushy-haired Gryffindor.

*Appendix C: Bad Magic*

Core, maturity, block, inheritance, training, train, gun, army, royal, technology, elemental, intent.

**** Okay... I think our filters have a lot in common... but I must admit to not seeing the reasoning behind discarding if Summary.contains("Neville")

Specifically I don't think the summary mentioning Neville necessarily equates to a bad Indy!Harry fic. I mean... Neville is in other fic genres isn't he?

****** Okay, true. Ron and Hermione draw a fair amount of flak for things I'm not sure should be held against young children, some of my favorite fics do write Ron off in the manner implied above. I think this has more to do with my current interest in alternative sorting fics than any personal vendetta against Ron. Harry sorting into Slytherin does murder any potential friendships between Harry and Ron rather efficiently, at least during the early game. Discovering they both think Malfoy is a douche-canoe can always come later.

Edit: Completely forgot to make my actual point: I'm not convinced that Neville's (or Luna's) presence ought to be used to rule out a fic. Their existence in badfics doesn't mean they can't be present in good ones. Luna done right can be hysterical. Neville done right...

Also, I realize that I'm accusing you of using boolean if/then statements and processing like a computer AI rather than like a person... but its funnier to think of it that way for me.

******** A fair point. I get suckered into the oddball indy!harry fic now and again on the notion that they aren't /wrong/ based on what Harry learns early on in canon... Dumbledore really is doing some very strange things and setting him up for something... but then the execution makes me imitate Picard and I have to nope out after page 1. People seem to struggle with the concept of a Dumbledore who isn't either always right, or always wrong. Landing in the middle where Dumbledore is still intelligent, but someone who you can have a legitimate disagreement with... is elusive.

********* I always feel that people forget, re: early canon, that Dumbledore never forced Harry to do anything. Dumbledore didn't dump Harry in the Philosopher's Stone labyrinth, he didn't make Harry go after Ginny Weasley. Harry chose to do these things of his own free will. He could have stayed in his dorms both times, like any other kid would have.

Sure, Dumbledore allows Harry to see certain things like the Mirror of Erised. In doing so Dumbledore is doing the exact opposite of what people accuse him of: he is giving Harry options, but letting Harry make the final decision.

The manipulative Dumbledore camp is massively inconsistent on this matter. They accuse Dumbledore of negligence because he didn't protect Harry like a child, while simultaneously accusing him of manipulation because he didn't treat Harry enough like an adult.

This is what happens when you write fics based on a feeling of self-righteous teen rebellion, I guess.

********** Truth. The worst he can be accused of is basic negligence of his duties as a Headmaster in the sense that the stone shouldn't have been in the school to begin with. He had 'valid' overriding concerns/reasons given the implications of having Voldemort still be alive and needing to confirm that... but as a parent, school governor, student, etc its a perfectly legitimate complaint to levy against him that you don't want the man in charge of your children's safety to have /any/ higher concerns.

Edit: is negligence technically the right violation here? child endangerment maybe? not sure.

Also, it could be argued that he'd only be guilty due to the nature of the 'protections' since its mostly the whole 'having fluffy' in the school where a quarter of the student body is known for recklessness that would be cited. devil's snare is taught in first year herbology apparently, so its not terribly dangerous, and you'd /obviously/ play chess as the king.

*** We're approaching summaries with two different goals, then. You're trying to weed out what you don't like, and I'm actively trying to find new things that I do like. I haven't had your (from what it sounds like from reading some of your other posts) massive, immersive experience reading the length and breadth of fanfiction, which probably has a lot to do with my approach.

I don't think there's such thing as an inherently bad trope, only bad writers. And that, above and beyond anything else, is what I'm looking for - authorial voice. A storyteller. If a summary can hint that the author knows what they're doing, I'll give it a try. Of course I do have certain "filters" I'm more inclined to (a lot of them match up with yours below), but for me they're very soft rules.

Take /Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them/. The premise of that story really doesn't appeal to my internal filters. However, that author can flat-out /write/. I guess in the end, I'm looking to discover authors, not stories. If Inverarity published something with a summary that made it seem like it was going to be an inheritance/marriage law fic, I'd read the hell out of it. Because it's Inverarity, and the authorial voice is off the charts.

So, with /that/ in mind, I'm looking for a summary that provides some hint of that gravitas. I care less about what a story has to say than how it's going to say it.

Totally respect your way of looking at it, though. I suspect I'm in the minority.

Oh, and re: Applied Cultural Anthropology - don't the phrases "Harry never really had the drive" and "other Muggle-raised Gryffindor", compared with the giant picture of Hermione next to the summary, kind of give you a solid hint who's going to be the main character?

I don't know...this seems really generic and clichéd.

Also, it should be "better" not "rather". An odd thesaurus mistake. Rather indicates personal preference in choice, an extent or a quantity, or a person's agreement, not a preferred overall result in a generic sense.

#+begin_quote
  "...when things *that he'd[or some]* rather *were* left in the dark..."
#+end_quote

also works. /Someone/ has to "rather" something. So no points there for pure English composition chops.

But anyway, where's the actual hook? Where's the story going? Why should I care? Is this some transplanted characters soulbond fic with GoT overtones and Daphne as a /literal/ queen of ice, or something truer to either setting? Will we see Ron in Westeros fighting for the throne? Petyr Baelish in Hogwarts, teaching DADA to Harry?

Holy shit. Wait a sec. I'd read the *fuck* out of that last one. Someone needs to write that.

But I digress.

It seems more like this is a personal preference for the crossover setting than a truly qualitative analysis of the content of that specific summary. The other two are good, great even, but I'm not sure I agree with /why/ you put them forward, especially as this example totally lacks those aspects.

This summary says almost nothing about what the story is /actually about/, really. I want to know more, sort of, but maybe not enough to click on that link. It's bordering on purple prose, really. Which I guess is as genre appropriate for GoT as a gala ball out of nowhere is in Harry Potter. Doesn't make it good writing, though.

I'd rather have something actually useful, like (again, I assume without clicking):

#+begin_quote
  He remembered being Harry Potter. The 2nd son of the King dreams of it, along with other cold, dead things. Winter is coming... but magic is might. Crossover, set in <book period>. AU Westeros, OCs, no Hogwarts character crossovers. Good!Misunderstood!Aerys. Wizard!Tommen. +Major character death.+
#+end_quote

I guess that last part is assumed.

Compare this one to your other examples and see how it totally misses obvious action and setting information. "Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition" doesn't actually say anything we didn't already know. It would be like saying, "Hogwarts is again full of magic and wonder".

We know. That's what Hogwarts /is/.
