It starts off after Sirius dies in OOTP and Remus is mourning him, seeing Sirius everywhere, from then on it goes to the marauders era. I can't remember the name of the story though I remember that Lilly decided to become a mediwitch in it after James and Sirius were injured and that when they decided to join the order of the phoenix right after graduation they signed a piece of parchment in Dumbledore's office. Moody ends up training them and blows a hole through either James or Sirius's wall because the two were talking with their two way mirrors. Not much else i remember except that Voldemort tried to convince James to join his side in a raid because of his abilities. I remember the author mentioning she started to write the story because she would read the Harry Potter books to her brother and it started from there. If anyone else remembers this story please help me find it! Thank you so much.

**** It is hard to find, considering its character listing is Remus L. Sirius B., so it'll be overshadowed by the slash fics.
