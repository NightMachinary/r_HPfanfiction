I'm looking for a fic where all the main characters are animagi, but preferably with powerful forms, such as a dragon.


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2772010/1/The-Power][The Power By DarthBill]] Harry is a dragon animagus. One of my favorite fanfics honestly.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise Of the Wizards]], in later parts of the book there's a strike force with Harry and several others, the others all have a magical device that turns them all into various dragons. Not harry though.

  Harry's super powerful, so are his friends, he becomes a magical animagus and defeats Voldemort while saving Spymaster Snape and everyone lives happily ever after. Ta da! Oh and Sirius and Remus are alive still too, fifth year AU.

** In "Unexpected Animagus", Harry turns into a dragon, and his friends learn powerful forms as well.

In "Cold Blood", Harry turns into a half-dragon, but it's not an animagus form.

  Response to GoldenSteel's My gf is a what? challenge. GoF: Hermione has a secret. One that even she doesn't know. When she unearths a highly dangerous ritual to help Harry in the first task, the two of them never expected that secret to hit them both and change them into Great Dragons! Are they doomed to be treated as beasts? What does this mean for the TWT? H/Hr; AD/RW/MW putdown.
