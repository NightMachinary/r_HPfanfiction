** Not Fade Away by Slide linkffn(11648754). A WIP but extremely well-written, deserves way more attention in my opinion!

  She fights for a world she hates as much as it hates her. It never stops; not until the world of magic burns to ashes to be reborn, or destroys Lily Evans and all caught in her wake.

** This is a Marauder-era fic, but it centers around Lily and her three best friends/Gryffindor roommates and how the war outside Hogwarts/events inside Hogwarts broke some of her friendships and created others. It's also a James and Lily get together fanfic but the real strength is Lily and her OC friends who are characterized very poignantly. [[http://unknowableroom.org/39/1/]]

(Also they play laser tag in Hogwarts & are generally tons of fun.)

** I'm actually shocked commentarius by bc daily isn't on here. Granted, way more James & Lily than Marauders.

*** I read this fic and it was great! At first, I found the style of writing to be a bit childish- I'm rather used to Jewels5's sort of sophistication- but I really got into it after a chapter or two, and the backstory and character development were exquisite. Do you have any idea if it's completed?

**** Ahh, you got to the cliffhanger. bcdaily is taking her sweet time finishing (but at least she says she'll finish it and this small thread of hope makes me feel there are good things in the world haha). She still writes and is fairly active on tumblr-- bcdaily.tumblr.com -- where you'll also find teases for the next chapter and links to her other writings (I also highly recommend Eight Days). There's also a HUGE James/Lily/Marauder community on tumblr.

I found her talent in writing captivating dialogue to be what initially drew me in, and then the slow burn romance kept me hooked. Having never read the Princess Diaries, which Commentarius was loosely styled on, I can't say for certain if the writing is childish. I just read Lily's rambling journal entries as the chaotic inner workings of adolescent girl (because I was one and my thoughts were pretty much just as frazzled if not more so).

Despite it all I'm glad you liked it!

** "Casualties of the Coming War" linkffn(10880119). The author actually writes quite a bit of Marauder related stuff. Most of it is definitely more Sirius-centric, but there's quite a bit of James in most of their works too.

  In hindsight, the signs were all there. Maybe if they had just paid more attention they could have been more careful. Probably not, but looking back at the events that had unfolded that night they all wished they hadn't had to learn this lesson the hard way. For this lesson may very well cost one of the Marauders his life.
