  The world was seldom just; few people knew this better than Harry Potter. He returns to Hogwarts for his sixth year, a mentor withers, a darkness rises and at the centre of it all, an engaged witch. Harry must reconcile the demands of the war while the weight of an unfair world bears down upon him.

** “Letters” is a great light hearted read. Probably my favorite one overall so far. It's satisfying.

“The Half Blood Romantic” was the one that got me started. But it's likely abandoned and has some infidelity, which isn't everyone's cup of tea. It's really good though.
