Crossovers, anything acceptable really (except Slash/MPreg, the last one is just creepy) Anything is better than the Deus Ex Machina Deathly Hallows victory. An actual power that gives Harry the ability to fight evenly with Voldemort, despite the experience and power gap otherwise. Saw one where Archer (from FSN) was the power he knows not, and Archer beat Voldemort using UBW. I don't care how silly or cracky, so long as it's an actual power.


** There was a /really/ funny One-Shot ("The Power the Dark Lord Knows" or something like that) where the prophecy was true and enforced by fate. In order to be true, Harry /must/ have a power that the dark lord /does not know about./

So Harry spends the entire one-shot writing to Voldemort about all his powers, and the increasingly insane powers he keeps developing in order for the prophecy to stay true. It was an amazing way to poke fun at the OP!Harry genre.

** linkffn(Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday) Unforgivables do not work as the normally do around Harry, and the Killing Curse always kills the caster when cast at him. He also retains the potency of the blood protection.

linkffn(If Looks Could Kill by questionablequotation) Harry captures Voldemort using an army of Basilisks, and Obliviates him comepletely before putting a Killing Curse through his head.

linkffn(Pulvis et Umbra Sumus) Harry has the powers of the Silver Eyed Warriors, and erased Voldemort in first year.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

  (Based on whitetigerwolf's "Letter Challenge 1"!) Harry Potter was understandably shocked when he learned he came from another world, that he was adopted by the Potters...and his surviving relatives, the Branwens, have come back to claim him. Severing ties to Magical Britain, with powers that straddle light and darkness, can Harry make a difference on Remnant?

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Linkffn(The Phoenix and The Serpent) has my favorite "Power He Knows Not." It's something that Voldemort would truly have difficulty understanding, not just an obscure talent or more powerful spell, but it's far more concrete than being Master of Death. The story is unfinished, so unfortunately you never see it used against Voldemort directly, but Harry does use it against one of Voldemort's major weapons to great effectiveness.

I also really like that Harry has to actually earn the power, he doesn't just discover it and immediately master it or inherit it. Reminds me of PoA and Harry learning the Patronus
