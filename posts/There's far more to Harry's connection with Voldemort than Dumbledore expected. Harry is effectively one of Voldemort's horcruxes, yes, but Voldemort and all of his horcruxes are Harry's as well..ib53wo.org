Voldemort cannot be permanently killed without destroying all of the horcruxes and killing Harry.

Harry cannot be permanently killed without destroying all of the horcruxes and killing Voldemort.

I'm imagining Harry dying in any of the dangerous scenarios he gets into. A somewhat panicked wraith floats up to Dumbledore and is all "Uh.. Professor? What the bloody hell is this? Am I ghost?"

Voldemort's reaction when he figures out that he accidentally granted his prophesied nemesis the exact same immortality that he made for himself.

 

Does anybody have any recommendations?

Treating this as a prompt or a discussion is fine too.
