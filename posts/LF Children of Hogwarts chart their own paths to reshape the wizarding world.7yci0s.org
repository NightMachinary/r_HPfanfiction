I was curious if there were any fanfictions out there where Harry Potter and those around him, perhaps even including Slytherins or cannon enemies like Draco, decide to change the magical world from fairly early on in Hogwarts.

Perhaps they are tired of the wars and violence, corruption and ignorance, and are aware the muggle world is progressing and the wizarding world must not stagnate. Perhaps they view the Wizangamot and ministry as a broken system and Hogwarts as a stagnant institution. Perhaps they think they can do better and work to prepare to take control from their parents and other adults, even if they must take them down in the process and use force.

Or perhaps they simply wish to take power from those whom they feel it's being wasted upon. This can be a dark or light situation, but the main focus is that it's the up in coming children of Hogwarts (specifically Harry's generation and those fairly close to his age), following their journey/quest.

I realize this is probably not in existence in this exact form, but anything similar would be interesting to me.


** [[/u/Starfox5]] tends to have this theme. In particular,

- In linkffn(Patron by Starfox5), the only way Harry and Hermione can have an equal relationship is by changing the way the wizarding world treats Muggleborns.
- Even has she leads the Muggleborn Resistance in linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5), Hermione is planning for how to win the peace once war is won.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

**** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief by Starfox5) has Hermione training to be a thief and a spy, and these skills are put to a good use "reforming" the wizarding world.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** I've read 2 of the 3, but not Reclamation. I agree with most of what you said though, however I feel like there are ways to make such stories believable if you have powerful children, Draco, Harry, Neville, and others working together, and if you allow for some darker tendencies in how they act.

**** For Love of Magic has Harry at thirteen thinking about his own mom in a sexual way. He uses cliche rituals to empower himself, etc etc power etc etc... I had to stop reading it because it got creepy and stupid as fuck.
