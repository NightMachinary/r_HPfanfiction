Hey~ Not sure if I am using this flair right but I am requesting Malfoy time travels to the past fic... I know that there are some threads looking for the same thing but they are a bit old and I've probably looked through most of them already. I'm not a huge fan of romance but every ship is welcome! On the time traveling part, I'm mostly searching for Malfoy goes back all the way to his first year or before, but I understand that might be a bit hard to find so any time travel is good with me. If possible a complete or recently (a month?) Updated fic would be great.

Thank you for bearing with me


** “A Life Twice Lived by Nemesis13” linkffn(12660172) ... it's fem!Draco, trying to fix the past with a lot of Black family politics, and so far it is pretty good. WIP, but the last update was this May, so not all hope is lost, and what's there is worthy of reading anyway.

  Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters.Fem!Draco

*** Also “A Time Of My Choosing by Alialena” linkffn(13147319) ... unfortunately, it just a start (yes, long start, eighteen chapters, probably too long start) and it is WIP (last update 2019-06-30).

  When Draco Malfoy misses his weekly probation meeting Auror Harry Potter and his partner Ron Weasley agree to quietly look into it. What they discover at his home will send them and their wives on a mission through time. After all the only reason Draco Malfoy would go back in time would be for evil purposes... Right?

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23872387]]). Good recent series. It does suffer a little from the "stations of canon" problem and Draco is a bit childish sometimes for someone whose effective age is 20+.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6551137]]). Time-travelling Draco seen though other character's eyes.

  All it takes is one look in a mirror and an ill-advised attempt to shatter it, before an embittered Draco Malfoy fresh out of Azkaban is sent back into his body on the day he gets his Hogwarts letter.Suddenly, Draco has an unwanted second chance, with a Sorting Hat that doesn't know what to do with him, a certain Muggleborn who won't leave his study table alone, and green eyes he just can't get out of his head. And then there's his new wand, whose choice of him could just mark him as every bit as dark a wizard as his name means he should be.

  Narcissa wakes with the certain feeling that something is terribly wrong. Draco is acting differently, Narcissa is worried, Lucius is confused, and a meeting inside Madam Malkin's goes very differently from the way it happened the first time around.
