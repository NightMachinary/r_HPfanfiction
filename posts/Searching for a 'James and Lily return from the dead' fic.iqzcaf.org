:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm desperately searching for this fic. Help me, please.\\
I've read it years ago and I can't remember much of it other than James and Lily returning from the dead maaaaybe during Harry's fourth/fifth year? I can't remember exactly.\\
I do remember that Harry was having seizures due to the Horcrux inside him and that Snape helps him at some point at Lily's desperate request.\\
James and Lily also help fight Death Eaters and James gets hurt pretty badly at some point.

It used to be on ffn but right now it could also be on ao3.

It looks like this fic has vanished, unfortunately.\\
If you can't find it could you please recommend some other good 'James and Lily return from the dead' fics? (no wbwl)

#+begin_quote
  The blood magic used in Little Hangleton Graveyard does more than grant Lord Voldemort bodily form; it also brings Lily and James Potter back from the dead. OoTP AU but follows OoTP closely. Lily/James, Jily
