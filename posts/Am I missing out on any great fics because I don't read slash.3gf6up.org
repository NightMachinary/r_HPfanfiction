Obviously everyone has their own definition of "great" but you get the idea.


** I don't really like romance stories so slash isn't something I've ever really touched. Does anyone know of slash stories where the romance isn't the central part of the story? Just a story about magic or adventures that happens to have slash in it?

** Yes.

linkffn(Reparations by Sara's Girl) is a favourite of mine, linkffn(Saving Connor) is a frequent rec around here, linkao3(Earthbound Spook) is also good. All of these are Harry/Draco, which is far and away the most popular slash ship in the fandom if not the most popular ship in the fandom /full stop/.

I honestly don't see why a person would avoid slash, as a category, when it really comes down to the specific ship.

** Yes.

Slash doesn't have to be romance; there are tons and tons of great non-romance-based slash-fics out there. Because of the absolutely leviathan size of the Harry Potter fan community, and the resultant cornucopia of fics that exist, there are many, many slash-fics that are very well-written.

Ex. some classic R/S comprises a lot of the oeuvre of this wonderful author: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1178165/picascribit]]

** Maybe. This is the first one I read that truly captivated me. I've re-read it at least thrice over the past six years and it still hasn't lost it for me. I could say many things about how I feel about it, but instead I'd rather just implore you to attempt to read it. While it has slash pairings, I rarely felt that the story was overwhelmed by it.
