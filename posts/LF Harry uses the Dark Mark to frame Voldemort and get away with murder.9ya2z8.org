So many "Framed Harry" stories out there. I only remember Cadmean Victory having Harry off his enemies or people that benefit him from being dead (Rita Skeeter) and using the Dark Mark to frame Voldemort for it. Are there any other fics that do that?


** The Connection Reversed comes readily to mind, but it's not as much of a frame up, given the magic in play.

  "Clear your mind!" wasn't actually the best advice. Harry is fed up and takes things into his own hands and discovers a way to end the war on his own terms. No one was expecting this of the Gryffindor Golden Boy.

** Hmm...that raises the possibility of other people using the Dark Mark to frame the Death Eaters for committing their own murders.\\
Can you see Dolores Umbridge or Barty Crouch using it to assassinate their political opponents during the war? Protection racketeers using it to cover their tracks?

** In Faery Heroes by Silently Watches, Harry does shoot up the mark after trashing The Daily Prophet. Doesn't murder anyone, but it does force Voldemort into the limelight at a time in canon when he didn't want to be.
