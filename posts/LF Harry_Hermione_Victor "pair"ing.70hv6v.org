I'm reading [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700/][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]], in which Harry and Victor are both plausible pairings for Hermione so far. Are there any fics where, instead of choosing one edge of the triangle, they just all form a relationship? (No spoilers please if HGatGoF turns out to be one such, though I doubt it.) Any maturity level is fine, slash is obviously fine.


** I apologize for not having recs but I'm here to help with terminology. A group of three people in love is called a throuple.

I would like to thank You, Me, Her for introducing me to the term and also rec the show to you. Have a lovely day and hopefully someone can find you a throuple rec.

*** I've only heard throuple used on the TV show Shameless. Far more common in fanfics is triad.

The only story with this pairing I've read is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/24884][Three for Three]] by smutty_claus. It was okay, but I didn't love the characterizations. Post-Hogwarts, no romance between Victor and Harry that I recall. It was more like they were sharing Hermione.

If you click on the relationship tag though, pull see three other stories with this pairing on AO3.
