Because he believes it works, it works TOO well. It turns out ignorant mishearing is the Power the Dark Lord Knows Not, because so long as Harry has his Tent, he's the strongest Wizard ever. A normal 13 year old couldn't drive off 100 Dementors, but Harry pulled out his trusty tent, and his Patronus ripped them to pieces.


** Was it a tent or a towel?

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.
