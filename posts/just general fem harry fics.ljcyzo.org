  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up. This Fic is now complete!

#+begin_quote
  Appetence-- defined as an attraction, a natural affinity, or an instinctive desire. A cosmic sort of bond that clouds the mind until all thought is consumed by that singular point of infatuation. When Voldemort divines what Harri Potter truly means to him all those years ago in the graveyard, a festering sort of obsession begins. His horcrux. A part of his split soul, crafted from his marrow, magic, and might-- his very own damning appetence. He knows what has been kept from him, what rightfully belongs at his side, and he wants her back.
