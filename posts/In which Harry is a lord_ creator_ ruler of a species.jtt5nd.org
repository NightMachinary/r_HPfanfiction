I've read a couple really good fics where Harry is the creator of demetors or their ruler. And one where he was the dementor's father. And sometimes; it's portrayed as /"the power he knows not"/ but they're still favorites of mine.

There was another interesting one where he was lord of the shadows, and used them to spy on people. Lord of the inferi was also particularly good. I think he was ruler of fire nymphs in another.

If you want to know the ones I'm talking about I'll put them in the comments.

I don't care about slash, that's pretty much my standards :P

  In the depths of the Ministry, there is a cell for the world's most dangerous man... and he wants out. Read warnings. No slash.

  Now that Harry has been found, he's going to teach DADA at Hogwarts again for the first time. Will he change and grow as a person? Will he find love? Enh... doubtful.
