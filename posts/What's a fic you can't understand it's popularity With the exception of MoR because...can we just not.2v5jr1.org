** I forgot the name but its the one where Harry and Sirius team up together and just troll people or something. It was ...okay I guess. It had some funny moments but most of it was just boring. The jokes were just unfunny and sort of obnoxious. People always say its the funniest fanfic ever but I just found it immature. I guess my sense of humour is just really odd.

** For me it's The Snape Chronicles.

Don't get me wrong it's amazingly well written and up to Hogwarts it's basically my headcanon now. However, once he hits Hogwarts it whitewashes Snape imo. His every bad action in canon is shown to somehow not be his fault, like the mudblood incident. The Marauders are barely even present and he even has a 'truce' with them by the end of school. His work with Voldemort is totally benign and he doesn't realise what the DE's are about and even the prophecy is handled as if it was all a mistake.

The thing I love about Snape is the shades of grey in his character and this fic reads less grey and more slightly-off white for a lot of it.

** I'd have to say /The Draco Trilogy/, for obvious reasons. It's a little old, but as it used to be a smash hit...

Way back in the day, it was so popular that it catapulted many tropes and cliches we see about Draco Malfoy today, as well as helped launch certain ships into popularity - including Draco/Hermione and Draco/Ginny. However, a lot of it was plagiarized from Pamela Dean's /The Secret Country/, the dialogue ripped from different TV shows, and Draco acting completely OOC. Just look up "Draco in Leather Pants", and you'll see what I mean.

However, perhaps the worst bit about it was the author, Cassie Claire, better known now as "Cassandra Clare" (author of /The Mortal Instruments/ and /The Infernal Devices/ series). Not only are her writing, characters, and plots boring and repetitive - she seems to rehash the same characters in the same plots time and again - but she deliberately used plagiarism and ideas that weren't her own in order to make money. In fact, she got stinking rich over it, and the parts she did write were little more than mediocre at best, even in her novels.

Additionally, whenever someone tries to critique her work or offers criticism, Clare either A) bullies them and/or threatens them with a libel/slander lawsuit, and/or B) ignores it. She seems to think that just because she happened to become a BNF from /The Draco Trilogy/, and got several book (and one movie) deal out of it, that the sun bloody well shines out of her arse.

** /Harry Crow/. It's massively popular, and it's tough to wrap my head around why. I mean, its problems are so numerous it would take me a longish essay to really get into them.

The characterization of - and interactions between - Harry and Hermione are the stuff of facepalming nightmares.

It takes cliches like "helpful goblins" and "Harry Sue" and "incompetent adults" that were already well-worn, and drives them into the ground.

The prose itself isn't particularly good.

The conflict has so many straw men that Harry barely even has to ruffle his diamond-studded cravat or whatever the hell stupid thing he wears in order to solve problems.

The dialogue is often stilted and wooden.

And yet... 24,000+ reviews.

Probably owing to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]]. It's terrible, but it's an original idea poorly executed. Most authors don't even bother trying to do something new; most fics are just retreads of popular fics with a tiny detail changed (E.G. the reptilia28 challenge). He gets points for making an effort. Harry Crow is also original, but the run on sentences, author tract, and unbelievable characterizations make it unreadable. The others are revenge porn, escapist fantasies, and (ugh) Lunar Harmony.

And I completely agree with you RE: /In This World And The Next/. IIRC that one has a reference to sexual assault. That gets me to stop reading a fic immediately.

** Pretty much anything by the Bobmins but most notably their magnum opus, /Sunset/Sunrise over Britain/. North of a million words of infantalized ultra-mega-Harry angsting over Hermione-sue and his lot in life, complete with over-the-top Molly, Ron, and Dumbledore bashing, it was a story I only could slog through with generous amounts of skimming. I remain convinced that this, for their time, popular writing team and story are primarily responsible for making bash-fics even a thing today.

Another reason I don't think much of the Bobmins is more personal: they single-handedly prevented for years any new writers being invited to fanficauthors.net, a site whose boards I used to haunt. This stopped me from receiving an invite back in the day as well as several other writers whom I respect (nonjon and BajaB among them) and ultimately killed off the archive as anything more than historical curiosity.

I remember when I first discovered fanficauthors.net and it was growing, then stopped all of a sudden. Always wondered about that.

**** I don't think I'm saying anything too sensitive by sharing info from conversations over the years with various authors on the site. Basically, by the bylaws Jeconais (Tim Joy, site owner) set up at the time, addition of a new author to the site required unanimous support from all existing authors. The Bobmin husband-wife team basically vetoed every prospective new writer for reasons I believe I know but won't go into here. To my knowledge, the only new author that was let in for several years was jbern† (back during the height of his productivity in fanfiction writing) and even that was a close thing.

Nowadays, Kinsfire runs new author membership and he only seems interested in bland Harmony shippers (and will /never/ consider a DLP regular for reasons that will be obvious to anyone who knows the history there). It's just as well--while fanficauthors.net membership was once something for a fanfiction writer to aspire to, the site's star has fallen in a big way.

I think you're underestimating the amount of negativity, but it's situational. On DLP -as on reddit- there are frequently threads or forum posts about least favorite authors/fics. In this context it's entirely appropriate to add to the discussion given the subjective nature of "least favorite." However in several instances of an author seeking assistance -an entirely different scenario- DLP assumes an undeserved mantle of authority and delivers only ad homs and tu quoques.

The only times I can think of this occurring are when new members put their own stories up 'For Review' (shorthand for, "I think my story is so good that it should be in the DLP Library") and then get thin-skinned over the critique they receive. For Review is intended for story review, discussion, criticism, and ratings, not as a place for author assistance (as has probably been stated over a hundred times on the site and as anyone who has spent much time on the site quickly realizes). Rather, that would go into a thread in 'Work By Authors', where personal attacks of the sort you mention are expressly forbidden and worthy of a site ban.

Incidentally, given the rather outsized number of celebrated writers who haunt/have haunted the site--Joe6991, nonjon, jbern, Heather Sinclair, The Santi, Inverarity, Voice of the Nephilim, SeriousScribble, Morta's Priest, Enembee, [[/u/Taure]], Shezza, Geor-sama, Amerision, Nuhuh, Water Mage, Tinn Tam, Krahae, dellacouer, Master Slytherin, vlad the inhaler (formerly of nos tres reges), myself (maybe, on a good day), and many more whom I've no doubt forgotten--I think the "undeserved mantle of authority" claim may a bit off as well.

Frequently? I don't buy that. A casual scan through the last few months of topics on both sites doesn't bear that out. I'd say "occasionally" or "rarely."

"Several instances." Yeah, I'm sure not every interaction between DLP posters and a budding author has been friction-free. But if you're going to talk about DLP (or any other community) like it's a homogenous entity instead of a discrete group of individuals with varying attitudes and tastes, then you've got to do better than "several instances." You've got to be able to point at evidence of a systemic problem.

I can only repeat my statement that this hasn't been my experience on the site, at all. If you take the first page of the WbA board and go in and look at all the comments, you'll see that the vast majority of them are offering assistance. Corrections, comments, suggestions, what worked, what didn't. I see very little, if any, personal attacks or shitposting.

I mean, yes, there are individuals who post that I don't personally care for - abrasive styles, loud defense of opinions I disagree with, wanton thread derailment, etc. - but that's true of Reddit, Fanfiction.net, and any other community. If you're going to speak in broad strokes about the character of a community, you have to look at the whole picture, not just the extreme outliers.

** Pawn to Queen by Riley. It's probably not fandom-wide popular, but in the niche of SSHG it is. It's so pseudo-philosophical and boring. All Snape does is angst all the time and whine about how great Hermione - given an upgrade to a Mary Sue because the author is laboring under the delusion that HP is anti-female - is. It's not even complete.

Also, let me add to that For the Potions Master's Amusement (it's okay, I guess... but after the first three or so chapters the characters the kind of lose their, uh, characterization) and When a Lioness Fights.
