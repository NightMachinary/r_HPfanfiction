A patronus requiring a very happy memory and positive thoughts.

​

A crucio requiring directed hate and negative emotions

​

Honestly;)


** I don't think I'd be able to do either, to be honest. I hate, but I balk at the thought of actually hurting people, and whenever I do by accident I always feel terribly guilty.

Unfortunately, I don't think I have any memories quite happy enough for a patronus. It's perhaps more likely than me casting crucio, but it'd be very hard coming.

**** At least to me, I see their emotional requirements as follows:

- Patronus - memory of joy, usually related in some way to family, friends, love, or self-actualization

- Imperio - Sense that it is just and right that one's will reign supreme over all others

- Crucio - Joy in pain of other, desire to enjoy the pain of another (divorced from any secondary, such as revenge)

- AK

1) Desire to cause death, reveling in death

2) Desiring the death of specific being.

The mindset of 2 is scarily easily to induce - one must merely have a being who one hates enough, and everyone has an Umbridge somewhere in their life.

Joy is harder to summon without already being kind if neutral to start, whereas hate is easy to call upon always.

*** That actually wouldn't work. /Righteous/ anger, such as the anger derived from the harm of loved ones, isn't powerful enough for the Cruciatus curse to stick. Harry could “successfully” cast the spell after Sirius was murdered, but it didn't do much more than surprise Bellatrix.

** This is a bit of a tough question, to be honest.

I think I'll say no on the Patronus for a few reasons. I didn't really have a good childhood and I never really grew up around it. I was never strong enough to really come to terms with it and so it became a crippling weakness that I now look back on with bitterness. There is no real event in my life that I could conjure up and be able to bask in that happiness because it has never been a constant thing. Yes, I felt happiness when I got my cat, but aside from that? There is almost nothing that I could use as a focus.

The Cruciatus Curse is a bit simpler because of how I am. However, I can easily sum it up for each point.

On a stranger? Most likely not as I would have no connection to them to be able to channel hatred or anger.

On someone who wronged me? Easily. I hold grudges and I shroud the anger around me. I have never really trusted people, a by-product of my youth, and so the number of people who have wronged me to a point is zero. I burn bridges long before people hurt me.

On an animal? No. It would never cross my mind to torture an animal. It actually makes me feel sick that someone could do this. I would sooner torture a human that an animal.

** I don't think I would be able to do either.

When I get angry at people, most of the time it feels more directed at myself than others "for being dumb enough to trust them". I do cringe tho at the thought of causing pain to other people.

But I don't think I have a memory that brings enough joy to cast a Patronus, or concentrate enogh to do it.

Regardeless, I would be very excited to learn Accio.

** I think I'd have a really hard time casting either. The Patronus would be difficult because I struggle with depression, and it taints essentially every memory and thought I have. The Cruciatus would be difficult because I don't see how it'd be worth it. I don't gain anything by causing others pain. There are more effective ways to get information and/or obedience, and they're more palatable as well.

** Assuming I was angry enough not to think of the consequences (which is unlikely since I've never even broken anything in anger), I could probably sting someone with the Crucio, like Harry does to Bellatrix, fairly easily. But I'd never be able to sustain it past that single instant, and I'd almost certainly be so shaken I'd never cast it again.

I'm actually less confident in my ability to cast the Patronus, not for lack of good memories, but because my good memories don't really have a heavy emotional aspect to them. I'd probably have to cast it in the moment to have strong enough emotions; when I remember a happy memory, it doesn't make me feel that joy again, it makes me think, "Yeah, that made me happy." Sometimes there's a vague pleased feeling, but nothing as strong as when it happened.

Conversely, when I remember an /embarrassing/ memory, it makes me blush and bury my face in my hands and wish I could go back in time to prevent it, as though it had just happened a minute before. Even if it was years and years ago and I'm literally the only one who remembers.

** Neither, but most likely crucio. My anger burns hot and bright for about a couple of minutes (so at best Harry Potter level, if not less than that), then I stew in a bad mood for a couple of hours, then I don't see the point in wasting all that energy anymore and go about my life like normal.

** in a normal state? probably neither, leaning towards the patronus

when it counts the most? crucio. if i already strongly hate someone and want to do them harm, using crucio would be the ultimate expression of that

where the patronus counts most is against a dementor. where you're actively fearing for your life against a creature that's depression given form. switching to a happy memory and letting it fill you up in the midst of that seems almost impossibly difficult to me

** Does the patronus have to be corporeal? I'm a poor uni student who gets immense joy out of not failing a particularly difficult and/or boring class, so at the least, I could get a silver mist going (just like Harry with the first quidditch win, I imagine). I realize a more profound memory would have to be used for it to take on a form, and on good days, I'd probably be able to do it. Love and acceptance of family and partners comes to mind. On bad days, I'd surely doubt myself enough to falter.

​

Crucio I'd be able to cast on only a handful of people, all of whom had a significant role in my life at one point, and not a positive one at that. And even then, I'd have to rile myself up, and remind myself how they'd made me suffer, to be able to do it.

​

So in the end, the net results would probably be that casting a patronus is easier for me, in general/ in most situations.

** It seems that for a lot of people, hate and rage is easier to put into action. For me there isn't a single person who I personally hate so much I'd cast a crucio.

But if circumstances lead me to want to cast the person at someone, I think at that point I'd already be able to. However I think the curse needs some sort of emotional distance. I don't know how to exactly put this into words but, If you want to hurt someone that much and go through with it, you need to be able to come to the fact that you're committing the action, but you're fine with it. Or convince yourself that It is justified, or that the person receiving the curse is less than human, so you can deal with what you've done in an easier manner.

** If faced with someone completely horrible, I think I'd be able to cast crucio for a quick second, but as it happened, I'd second guess whether it was the right thing to do and lose focus. My natural impulse is to feel that someone who is acting truly maliciously is a genuinely shit person, which would give me enough crucio juice until I was actually doing it.

​

I do have happy memories, but I'm a bit...scatter-brained, I guess? I don't think I'd be able to viscerally imagine them well enough while focusing on casting the patronus at the same time, although I'd like to think I could learn with practice.
