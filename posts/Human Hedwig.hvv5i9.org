:END:
I read a fic once where Hedwig was able to become human and was either in love with Harry or thought she was his mom... might have been two separate fics.

Been trying to find it or them with no luck. Sound familiar to anyone?

  Harry Potter did not have any reason to suspect his snowy Hedwig was different from any other owl. That's why she waited to tell him.

** In the third story of the Our Lady O'the Bless'd Do Over series by RotaryFile Hedwig learns to become a humanmagus and turns into a girl.

linkffa(89)

There's another story (that I can't find right now) where Hedwig was there that Halloween and somehow Lily's soul joined with her. Eg Harry got the protection from Lily's Sacrifice, and Lily's soul never departed and joined with Hedwig which was why the owl was so smart and attentive to him.

** Somewhat along the vein of More Than Familiar there is a female fawkes story that you might enjoy (though it's heavy with several other tropes). And regrettably like More Than Familiar it's abandoned. The story is called Harry Potter and the Accumulation of Power by Zyachta

  While searching the Black Library for something to destroy Riddle, Harry is led by his oldest, dearest friend to an ancient tome. After reading it, their lives are further linked and forever changed. Very unusual pairing.
