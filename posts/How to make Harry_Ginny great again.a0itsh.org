In the books, Harry's attraction came kinda out of the blue and was poorly described. They don't have common interests outside of Quidditch and fighting Voldemort. Ginny lacks characterisation in general. He used a potion to break up Ginny's pervious relationship and the whole "staged break-up" makes no sense whatsoever. It is then reignited before Fred's body is cold.

So how would you write their relationship to avoid these pitfalls? At which point would you diverge? What else would change?


** I think my favorite Ginny depiction is from linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) - but that's based on Harry having future knowledge, and they're not (as of the start of fourth year) actually dating, because that's ethically problematic. But I really like how the story fleshes her out as a character.

Anyway, although actual shipping would need to be driven by some other motivation than time travel, I still think that a key part is to start building up their friendship sooner. Harry might not have a very wide circle of friends, but he does come into frequent contact with Weasleys - yet he sees a lot more of Ron's older brothers than his little sister. Just do something to get them holding proper conversations earlier than fifth year. It really shouldn't take much more than that, honestly. She's a Weasley through and through, and Harry loves being around Weasleys.

Maybe have him show more concern after her Chamber of Secrets ordeal, and take the time to follow up and ensure she's properly recovering, thus breaking the ice and getting them properly talking to each other in his third year. Maybe something could prod Ginny to pluck up her courage and approach him about something; she might want tips on trying out for the Quidditch team, or to get to know Hedwig better. Or like NoFP you could have Harry end up living with the Weasleys, through whatever combination of circumstances, and thus put them together enough to overcome Ginny's shyness.

Harry/Ginny makes loads of sense in theory, it's just that canon Ginny is hardly present in the story. Bring her in, and Harry will fall for her easily.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

*** Never read this fic, nor have I seen it recomended much. I'm not a huge fan of H/G, but I don't have many issues with it, mostly because I find both movie and book romance between the two horrible, and I dislike the the fact that Ginny is so easily incensed and prone to violence, as if that resolves any sort of issue. Also, when writters go on about her Bat Bogey just cringes the fuck out me, like, it funny once, but later, as people use it as if its a baby AK, just annoys me.

I'm in a massive drought of fics, so seeing as this is TT and 400k+ words, it sparkled my interest, but could you tell me if this is close to completion or in which book this is. Is it canon rehash with one or 2 diveregences that don't actually diverge shit (see Potter and Black series or Black Bond) and just go through the book written differently ?

**** Nightmares of Futures Past holds the distinction of being the most favorited HP story on ff.net, and I consider it my #1 favorite on-hiatus fic. It's "Harry lives through an awful future where everyone else dies and everywhere is destroyed, and he comes back determined to avert it and save the people he loves." So, plenty of divergence, but never at random; things change because Harry changed something. Although the ripple effects quickly get away from him...

Criticism of it generally centers around the fact that it's relatively old, and unfinished. However, even most critics will agree that the author does very good characterisation, and a great job of balancing foreknowledge vs Butterfly of Doom. TVTropes refers to it as an example of Peggy Sue done right.

It's currently near the start of fourth year, although it's not at all certain that it will take the full seven years to finish. Last updated three years ago, but the author continues to assure that it isn't abandoned, and just in the past few weeks, his progress meter for the next chapter has moved up to 94%. He's recuperating from serious health trouble.

** Disclaimer I prefer Harry/Hermione and never liked the Harry/Ginny ship as I felt Ginny was more of a trophy than an actual character. That being said I think there are ways to do the ship better. Here are my suggestions for things that can or should be done.

1. More character building for Ginny I know others in the thread have mentioned canon does build her up somewhat but to me she always felt like a side kick to the main trio instead of a hero in her own right.
2. Make her closer to Harry's equal. Hermione and Harry especially in book three are with each other step by step in the climax. Ron and Ginny lack that and you could do this in several ways. The boring way is to weaken Hermione so she seems less like Harry's equal. But the more interesting way to improve this would be in Book 5 have Ginny be the last DA member left standing outside of Harry. This would set up an interesting dynamic between Hermione and Ginny where Hermione does better in formal classroom settings and duels with rules but Ginny is more effective in a fight.
3. Find a way to bring Ginny along for the Book 7 story arc if the story even remotely follows canon. For example, maybe the Order as part of their efforts to protect Muggleborns sabotage the trace and other forms of magical detection (which would also explain why Voldemort decided to use the Taboo) which would let Ginny use magic without worry.
4. In book 6 skip the Dean/other character romance sub plot and have Harry and Ginny start flirting in book 5 which could led to dating in year 6. This combined with point 3 would avoid the end of year 6 breakup and potion problems. And would give them some more things in common.

** When is it reignited before Fred's body is cold? We have no idea how soon they picked things up after DH, their reunion is not in the books.

Also, all my teenage relationships came out of nowhere. I snogged my first serious boyfriend in the bus park of my school after a little group of us broke in (in something I now find cringey rather than rebellious), and I had only known him very vaguely prior to that. We then dated for two years. In that respect, almost a year of fancying Ginny seems like a reasonable build up, though Rowling could have done far better.

Personally I would have established more one on one scenes far earlier in canon, even if they aren't necessarily romantic. I love the chocolate in the library scene in ootp, for example, and we could have seen more of that sort of thing.

And I'm not asking for explicit details on Harry's wanking fantasies, but some sort of actual interest would not be out of place.

Then again, Rowling had some odd ideas about romance (James obsession, the whole Tonks/Lupin thing).

I agree with the non romantic scenes. Where was Ginny during the tournament? With Ron (temporarily) out of the picture, that was the golden opportunity for Ginny to actually befriend Harry. Or have Harry play some Quidditch with Ginny in OotP after he had been banned from the house team (borrow Ron's broom or take one from the school ones). Have Ginny advise Harry about Cho or talk to him after that ended.

I definitely read the interest Harry had in Ginny, despite its clumsiness. My point is, if you looked at my first relationship that would have come out of nowhere too.

#+end_quote

I think you're really missing the point. Their point was that the relationship was done pretty badly. Your (correct) response was that their friendship was too. But I think the relevant response would be to do their friendship better from the get go, which is why [[/u/Hellstrike]] suggested they bond when Ron leaves during GoF.

Really, the problem is it's difficult, if not impossible, to believe JKR had the relationship planned from the beginning like she said. Ginny's characterization on OoTP is often liked by her fans, but objectively it introduced many things that weren't hinted at previously or shown. Suddenly she's a Quidditch all-star (she always was, apparently, just no one bothered to mention it), she's suddenly "in" with the Trio, a bit spunky (which felt jarring after the little established character she'd had in GoF and prior) and is very attractive.

Like this isn't really a critique of a ship, but a problem of character foundation. Like there's literally nothing there, then a dump of random character traits, then a relationship from sudden interest on Harry's part. Like had the other stuff been built up bit by bit in the first four books, I could read OoTP and be like "Ah yes, this is Ginny alright" and then the HBP would have some grounding here. But it's just a fact that it didn't, and HBP even has her contradict her previous characterization by immediately caving to Harry wanting to break things off. So there seems to be plenty of room to do better in a fanfic, even if it wouldn't be of interest to me to read it.

But the real life comparison doesn't seem to make sense to bring up. People often at least pay lip service to the idea that good friends can make great partners. And in this case, it's not like Ginny was introduced in HBP, she existed even in Book one. She's just all over the place and so it feels odd to me.

I'll agree that the romantic subplot could've have been way more fleshed out. But it's not as "out of nowhere" as people like to argue and it does not detract from the fact that the two do work well together.

And no, it comes out of nowhere. Where is the interest in the previous five books? At best Harry is perplexed or doesn't pay it any mind (even in OoTP, just one book prior). I have no idea if they'd work well together because Ginny's characterization is everywhere. OoTP injects her with new traits not previously mentioned or shown (I challenge you to show me where in books 1 - 4 where she is or is said to be spunky, assertive, "in" with the Trio or good at Quidditch).

Much like Harry's interest, these just show up out of the blue and even then some of them are contradicted later so I can't really understand what she's supposed to be like.

#+end_quote

He complains that he never got the impression that Harry had an interest in Ginny and then immediately says that said interest should be shown through sexual interest, to which I gave him an example.

It comes out of nowhere if you aren't reading the subtext, which is rife with Ginny being good for Harry. Now Harry's overt interest does appear suddenly in Book 6, but supporters of the ship argue this is fairly realistic. His interest in her romantically comes from finally spending actual time wither her the summer before his 6th year. Harry's 5th year we see Ginny actually become someone he can be friends with, which really is the true beginning of seeing her not as the shy little sister with a crush on him but an actual person. But he is still hung up on Cho so he doesn't really give Ginny that sort of notice. Once he's moved on from Cho, and spends time with Ginny, he finally starts realizing he is into her. Seeing her kiss Dean fully makes him realize she is a sexual being and he figures out what his feelings are.

It makes sense we actually start seeing Ginny's personality in Book 5 since this is truly the moment where she has fully grown comfortable around him and sees him as a friend. I would argue you do see a bit of Ginny's actual personality in book 4 when she makes fun of Ron and Harry for their failures getting dates.

In books 1-4 we don't exactly see the true Ginny, but it is deliberate. Rowling wants to have Ginny grow. I agree we should've seen it more on the pages. I'm with you there. But Ginny being different from book 1 to book 5 is deliberate. You're supposed to think Ginny in book 5 is different than Ginny in books 1-3.

I don't really agree that her personality changes much from book 5 to 6. I'm not saying you are arguing this but it's a common complaint. We just get a bit more of her personality. They work well together because we see them work well together. They share a sense of humor, which we do see. They are comfortable with each other, which we do see. Harry doesn't shy away from her touch, which we do see. She can give Harry the business when its needed, but has his back when needed. We see this.

Again, though, I do agree the overall romance could have been written much better and given much more page time. We probably don't actually disagree too much on the failures of Rowling in this way.

#+end_quote

The book 4 example is, I think, so trivial that calling it her actual personality showing through is silly. And saying it makes sense that her personality is finally (abruptly, more like it) revealed is exactly my point. Try this: why did she suddenly feel comfortable around him? What led to this? They spoke one time in GoF (the instance you mention; maybe a bit at or before the World Cup too. Was just a greeting, I think). That's it. Why did we only then get told anything about what she's like? A Quidditch wiz? No one mentions it? Spunky and stubborn, but no hints of it?

This is what I mean when I say it's just random. For its many many flaws as a ship, Ron and Hermione are very clearly hinted to be romantic interests from book 1, and Ron is hardly a developed character himself. But for Ginny we don't get really anything developed, it basically just happens because. A great chance would have been to drive home the whole possession thing as something they shared, but that got one mention in the whole series, and even then only after Hermione breaks him out of his isolation.

Honestly, I'd probably find the ship more interesting if it actually had the subtlety you mention. Bit by bit, building up something between them in the background. But it never really happens that way.

Honestly, I'm fine with it. I would have liked to get more Ginny in book 4, but we got it in book 5. Oh well, good enough for me to understand her character but I can understand your issue. But I assume you have the same issue with Luna, right?

I don't really need to have Harry show his growing feelings for Ginny from book 1 onward. One could argue Ginny takes care of that from her end. For me, I was just happy Harry found someone to make his life a little better, and the Ginny we learned about in book 5 and 6 was really great for him.

But I agree that it could've been done so much better. The chamber stuff could've been a great way to make it better.

Ironically, I think all the lack of fleshing out makes them a better couple to ship since fans of the ship can fill in the holes, which is fun.

No, but something more than "he had an inappropriate dream" and "she looks pretty". Maybe Harry thinks about what dating Ginny would be like. Throw in some fantasy date of his, or maybe the thought of them imitating Ron and Lavender. Use a proper description, and not the "monster in his chest".

******** There were a few scenes sorta like this, like Harry imagining Ginny weeping over his injured body after he gets knocked out from Quidditch, and when he is about to die he definitely has those thoughts, plus the staring at the dot scenes.

But during HBP, I also do wish we got more. I don't disagree with you there. But I argue that is different than what you originally argued, that there was no hint of interest from him. There absolutely was and probably enough to get the message across.

I wish we got a good convo between them while they were officially together. Something about everything that came before that led them to finally being together. One of my favorite types of fanfics are the one-shots that show their conversation after the kiss. I also enjoyed one where Ginny absolutely knew the break up was coming and just kept pushing it off. I think canon scenes like that would've done wonders for the portrayal.

Not really. I mean, let's be honest here, there are plenty of attractive people around, but the difference between simply noticing "oh, she is hot/pretty/whatever" and an actual interest is what kind of thoughts you have and what you do with them. What Harry did in canon was pretty much in line with "well, nice, but also unavailable. I wonder what she looks like naked". But I guarantee you that he had the same thoughts about pretty much every other girl, from Hermione and Lavender to Demelza Robins and Ginny's dormmates. Any guy who says that he has not imagined every woman (aged 16-40) he knows naked or thought about having sex with her lies (or is gay).

And sure, there is some interest in Ginny, but not enough to fall in the serious interest category. I mean, in at least half the "jealousy" moments you cannot tell what exactly he is jealous of. Dean for having Ginny, Dean for having a girlfriend in general, his lack of girlfriend, lamenting his previous shitty experiences with Cho, (Ginny for having Dean). "Monster in his chest" is not really a precise description. Nothing which indicates "that's the one" at any rate.

It seems to me that that kind of attraction is the key difference between friendship and romance, so if you want more depth, then likely what you're looking for is evidence of friendship. And there certainly is that, though really only from partway through book 5 onward, and even then I could wish for more. They spend time together (eg in the DA), he respects her abilities, and her personality seems like a good fit for his. So the skeleton is there, it's just a bit underfed and neglected.

** Alright a lot to unpack here. Basically, I think you're overall wrong about the way the relationship was handled, yet there is some truth to a lot of what you said. Let's start with specifically what you said:

- Harry's attraction came out of the blue - in fact the attraction was built up throughout the entire series. Harry is always describing Ginny in flattering ways, and always seems to be aware of her presence. But he does seem oblivious to his own feelings for most of the series. But the point of his sudden feelings is that he finally spends time with Ginny. Harry was into Cho purely for her looks, so the way he falls for Ginny is meant to show maturity. He falls for her not just because she is beautiful, but because as he spends a lot of time with her, he realizes how great they are together. Harry spends significant time with Ginny over the summer, and then once he sees her kissing Dean he realizes exactly what he's feeling and there ya go. It really is realistic for a teenager to develop feelings in this way, especially considering that Harry saw Ginny in a specific way for most of the books while also being hung up on Cho (Harry also tends to be singularly focused so as long as he was into Cho, he wouldn't be noticing other girls). Also the relationship didn't come out of nowhere if you consider Ginny's POV, which Rowling clearly shows.\\

I do understand the frustration as a reader though. We are conditioned to see the main romantic relationship\\
between the hero and the love interest written a certain way, and Rowling did not do this, preferring the very\\
subtle build before whacking you in the face. To fix this, I'd have Ginny just date Corner or Dean, and have her and\\
Harry grow closer and him notice his feelings for her in OOTP, then get them together midway through HBP or\\
earlier, not push it off till the very end.

- They don't have common interests outside of Quidditch and Voldemort- This is not true. They also share a sense of humor, which is HUGELY important to their compatibility. They share a sense of morals, family, and loyalty. Both are fighters who hate being kept in the dark and out of the fight. They both like pranks. They both have similar friends and treat those some might consider their lessors as equals. Truth is in terms of hobbies, Rowling doesn't give us much of anything to go on with any characters. There is Quidditch, maybe gobstones, and studying.
- Ginny lacks characterization - Everyone says this but we actually learn a great deal about Ginny's character. She is brave, fiercely loyal, has a bad temper when provoked, craves independence and being seen as an adult yet can be quite immature, understands Harry in a way no one else does, has a wicked sense of humor, enjoys picking on Ron but stands up for others who are picked on, is amazing at Quidditch, can be prone to jealousy, hates to be treated like a damsel by boys, yet will allow Harry to protect her, fought Riddle on her own and handled the aftermath virtually alone, still bares the scars from that experience and is quick to remind Harry of it, can become vicious when defending herself, and attacks others where they are most insecure in fights. She has a dynamic story arc, which is overcoming her shyness to become the equal Harry needs, and overcoming a traumatic childhood event to become incredibly strong.

But I wish we did see more of all that, and I specifically wish we got a better conclusion to her various story arcs.

- He used a potion to break them up -clearly they were heading there and maybe Harry sped it up by a couple days.
- the staged break up makes no sense - agreed based on the idea of protecting her. But the subtext to that scene is Harry didn't think he would survive and didn't want her waiting for a dead man. He wanted her to move on and be with someone who deserved her, because after years of abuse Harry still doesn't think he deserves happiness. And the scene is doubly ironic and sad because despite Harry's desire, Ginny would not ever move on from him and she feels he does deserve happiness. So the break up is futile on that front, but in a more meaningful and poignant way.
- Fred's cold body - I'm sure Fred would be the first person to tell them not to waste time and get back together already. They just survived a war. They can get back together while also mourning Fred. Those two things are not mutually exclusive.

With Harry and Ginny, there were things Rowling needed to accomplish and things that would have been nice to have added. Rowling needed the reader to see Harry and Ginny as well-suited for each other and she definitely accomplished that. Whether or not you feel the build up to them getting together was handled correctly, it's tough to deny they work well together. But since Rowling was focused on the trio's friendship and the overall Voldemort plot, things like Harry's love life got pushed aside to a point. We are not really used to that in fiction.

If it were me, I'd include a couple more scenes of Harry and Ginny interacting one on one prior to them getting together. I would have actually shown a scene like that in the summer after Sirius died. I think they needed one real heart to heart that wasn't about something else, but actually subtly about them. I would've liked a scene where Ginny kinda hints she is into him and maybe he hasn't lost his chance, or at least something that better explains why she dated Dean for so long. I think that never made sense based on Ginny's character (she is a strong woman who clearly wasn't too into Dean, so why date him even when the relationship was dying by Christmas) but clearly Rowling did it for plot purposes, just to not have her and Harry together for that long.

I think Ginny was handled poorly in Deathly Hallows. She needed to play a larger role in the final battle, since she was touched by Voldemort but never got her vengeance for it. She should've destroyed a Horcrux, instead her big story was being kept out of the battle by her parents and having a row with them, then needing to be saved by her mom, thereby proving her wrong and everyone else right that she needed to be protected. And of course, we get no reunion scene between Harry and Ginny, even though she was his last thought before dying.

I would have LOVED for Ginny to get more page time, to show more scenes with them both before, during and after their relationship. But the writing /was/ effective at showing the two are meant to be together and it made me invested in their success. Harry/Ginny has always been great, we just needed to see a bit more of it.

**** Ginny is provoked into several confrontations, which she is justified in feeling a need to respond to, but the mature thing would be to walk away or handle it differently.

For example, Ginny is justified in not liking how Fleur treats her. But her response, to mock her behind her back and call her Phlegm, is an immature way to respond. She is only 15 so its not like this is some huge character flaw of hers, but there it is.

Also, when she wants to stay for the order meeting in OOTP but her mom forces her upstairs, she stomps up the stairs, throwing a fit. Again, I get her frustration and it makes sense since she is only 13, but it's there.

All that said, she can also show incredible maturity at times, such as her acceptance of the break up because Harry needed her to be strong.

** Canon Harry and Ginny is awful, but there's a lot of potential in it if it's written well. Most of that depends on the development of Ginny. In an HBP/DH rewrite I've been working on, she has a bigger role (for example, when the trio need to spy on Malfoy, she provides a distraction, and from thereon they start including her in things). Later on, during "DH", she never returns to school and instead "helps" at the twins' shop.

The whole Dean saga is completely pointless, too. In my story, Ginny is never with Dean. Harry and Ginny see Michael and Cho together, make a few jokes about it, etc., etc. There is absolutely no "chest monster" or room for a love potion theory.

Really, the key is to actually /see/ Harry and Ginny interacting. HBP fails at this. The few scenes we /do/ see them together, Ginny is being a b*. That doesn't exactly make the pairing endearing.

** I think to make Harry/Ginny great again, we should edit the movies so Hermione doesn't come off as the main love interest for Harry. There was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/9zga7v/harry_potter_spoilers_ron_weasley_used_the/?st=joyeo9od&sh=1cce0f4f][this thread]] in [[/r/fantheories][r/fantheories]] the other day that outright says that they don't take the books into account while stating a theory that Ron Imperiused Hermione into falling in love with him, and that Hermione was romantically interested in Harry. What the fuck? Tent dance was not a book thing, Ron was not a moron, Harry was not some kind of magic whiz, and Hermione was never a love interest in the books.

Additionally, there is an alarming amount of fanfiction portraying Hermione as this perfect goddess with perfumed farts, which incidentally demonizes the Weasleys. If those were to suddenly go up in flames, all of them, I suspect that Harry/Ginny would be much more popular.

I would like to end this by saying that I am not against Harry/Hermione. I am against Harry/Hermione that is one-dimensional and would be a sorry sight to behold in a pulp magazine. I am against Harry/Hermione that comes at the expense of other characters. I am against the bullshit trope that is bashing. That's my take on the thing, for what it's worth.

Oh yeah, and I don't consider the movies canon, just so you know.

That being said, I imagine Hermione would try to argue that separating them would be pointless since they are intimate either way.

In fact, Ginny seemed to have a lot in common with Bellatrix:

- Completely loyal to her love

- Absolutely devoted to her cause

- Reasonably intelligent

- Magically powerful

- Easily angered

- Prone to aggression and violence

Voldemort, in his earlier times, was charismatic, convincing, persuasive, and handsome. What Voldemort preached was also in line with Bellatrix' family ideology, so she was probably groomed to fangirl him (just like Ginny was brought up to 'like' Harry). As a result, she chose Voldemort as her love, and she became a monster herself.

Of course, they had some major differences too. For example, it's Ginny's Weasley temper vs the Black mental instability. Ginny also seems to have significant leadership skills, as her actions in Year 7 showed.

That even though Rowling considered Harry and Ginny soulmates (she has said they were in at least two interviews), if not for Felix, Ginny would have gone on to marry Dean?

Felix works in the randomness of the universe, where it might compel you to stare at something an extra second, thereby causing you to just miss the roof that caves in, which was always going to happen. That roof was destined to cave in.

Ginny and Dean were destined to break up. They were clearly heading that way. Felix allowed Harry to arrive at the portrait at just the right time to cause the event that sped up their ending. But they were always going to break up. And judging by how inconsequential the cause of the fight was, it was also quite clear the break up was imminent. Felix did not cause Ginny to have the reaction she did.

*********** Talk about making some unfair assumptions.

First off, Harry didn't intentionally do anything. He bumped into Ginny on accident, and the rest is history. Who cares if Dean actually didn't bump her as she thought. Two people in a good relationship don't let a misunderstanding end a relationship.

Seriously, honest question: Do you think if Ginny didn't get bumped, she would still be with Dean, or that they would've dated for many more months at least?

Regarding my assumptions, it's actually totally fair to make logic and evidence-based assumptions and then base an argument off of it. That's kind of how this all works.

#+begin_quote
  I hope I don't need to explain why this is horrifying reasoning.
#+end_quote

No, please explain. Because nothing I said was wrong. Clearly, Dean did have a habit of trying to "help" Ginny which she didn't appreciate. Ginny and Dean did fight a lot. The fight that was caused by the bump was clearly not the first time they had had this type of fight, or fight in general.

I want to be clear so as to make any unfair assumptions. Do you believe Ginny and Dean had, up until that point, a good relationship that wasn't in danger of ending?

I don't care if you don't care about her intent. It still must be considered. And you again have to ask yourself, does Rowling really want us to believe that Harry and Ginny only got together because of a potion, and that if that never occurred, she would have still been with Dean?

Finally, I think we need to also consider the fact that magic is simply part of the world and thus if magic is involved in the coupling of Harry and Ginny, well that doesn't de-legitimize the relationship. I was very lucky to meet my wife, and it was the result of a series of lucky events. Maybe Ginny and Harry did get together in part because of some magical luck, but so what?

************ I feel like you're missing my point. It doesn't matter if Harry intended to break them up before he took the potion. It doesn't matter if they would have stayed together or not. It doesn't matter if they were fighting. It doesn't matter if their relationship was dysfunctional. It was influenced without their knowledge by a third party who then took advantage without ever revealing the lie.

That's really just not true. People misuse the term all the time but this is what Death of the Author refers to, and it's a legitimate angle of literary criticism.

***************** Then you completely missed my point with that argument.

The argument Dean and Ginny had was one they had many times. This was nothing new for them, something Ginny clearly hated, yet Dean had done before again and again. So it's not like saying the potion made the two act differently or put an otherwise great relationship in peril. Put another way, if it wasn't Harry bumping into Ginny, it would have been something else Dean did to annoy her. So to put their breakup solely on the potion ignores the entire context of their relationship and gives it way too much power.

Also, while yes we do not know exactly how Felix works, it is fairly logical to surmise is that since Harry was the only one who took it, the potion cannot actually affect other people. It's not like Harry takes the potion and suddenly Ginny's mind is under his control. No magic, be it a spell or a potion, has been shown to act that way. So yes, Harry bumps into Ginny likely because Felix set him on a course that would allow for lucky happenstance to occur. But her reaction was not influenced by the potion in such a way that she was acting out of character.

Also, surely you can agree that Ginny would not have dumped Dean if his only transgression was being chivalrous a couple of times.

Is that the fundamental disagreement we have here? That you think the potion can control the thoughts and actions of those who did not take it? Because if that was the case, I could see your point. But I really don't think it works like that. In all honesty, I think all it does is convince Harry to take a right instead of a left, which leads to a series of fortunate events for him.

****************** I think you're right about our fundamental disagreement, and having looked back at the text it's less clear than I remembered. Ginny says, “everything seemed to just miss us,” after the attack at the end of HBP, which is plausible with the potion only affecting those who took it (I interpreted it as the Death Eaters being influenced to miss, originally). It is never stated whether the friendly fire among the Death Eaters was influenced by the potion. I suppose it's likely that, given an obviously absurdly powerful potion, I just followed the most powerful interpretation of its abilities.

******* Naw not really, I think Harry would have still gotten with her either way. Just maybe later that he did. Dean was not going to stop that. I think Jo drug out their relationship too long as it is. It was quite clear Ginny lost interest in Dean long before that time. Even if they did last longer and Harry didn't get with her, doesn't mean she would have stayed with Dean. Her and Harry could have started dating in DH. Or like sometimes in real life later than that, if her and Harry are meant to be they would end up together anyways. Whether or not her and Harry ended up together, her and Dean wouldn't have last much longer and she would eventually end up with someone else, whether Harry or another person in general.

Obviously. But what if one of Harry's fangirls threw herself at him and when his cock was in her, he realised that perhaps this was not at all a bad idea? Or Romilda raped him? Or what if Lavender decided to get back at Ron by seducing Harry? (see example 1 to where this might go).

Never doubted that. I just poited out that without the potion, they might not get together in the canon way.

** I'd sprinkle a few more scenes of her before Harry thinks, "She hot. Me like," which is basically all we get out of their relationship in HBP. Great for a teenage infatuation, but it wouldn't last for the long term. (And to all the others knocking on OP, he's right: Felix Felicis means "all your endeavors succeed." Ginny and Dean would've broken up eventually, but it would've happened at a later point when Harry might've lost interest in her already.)

The best divergence would be to have Arthur die in OotP. Ginny has no concept of loss. This sounds callous, but she lost /one/ brother out of six of them, and a twin at that. It's very different to lose a parent. She also might be able to understand Harry better, that's he's fighting Voldemort because he doesn't want this to happen to other people, instead of thinking he actually /wants/ to hunt down Voldemort.
