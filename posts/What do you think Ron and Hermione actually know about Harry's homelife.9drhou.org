** Ron knows that Harry's relatives don't feed him well (bearing in mind that Ron's perspective on being well fed is a bit warped since he's had three meals a day from Molly Weasley since he first tried solid food!) and don't give him Christmas gifts worth a damn. Beyond that...

Hermione, I'm much less sure about. She's likely noticed that Harry's glasses are old (which should stick out to her, as the NHS provides /free/ eye tests and frames for people under 16, so he should have replaced them several times in seven years) and that his clothes are old. She'll understand, as Ron does not, that the area Harry lives in is a very wealthy one, which makes the hand-me-downs and old clothes seem especially weird.

I don't know if either of them would know the full extent of it, but they both can see clues that something is off.

**** According to wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  The form of Surrey which remains since 1965 is a wealthy county due to economic, aesthetic, conservation and logistical factors. It has the highest GDP per capita of any English county, some of the highest property values outside Inner London and also the highest cost of living in the UK outside of the capital.

****** Yes. Very much so.

It's got some of the highest property prices, highest average incomes and highest cost of living in the UK.

The Dursleys are probably mortgaged to the hilt trying to keep up with the neighbours.

** Oh no. Now I'm imagining Ron and his brothers writing off the bars as a weird muggle thing (burglar bars are a thing here in the US). Then later after the war they all get drunk and Harry blabs and Ron and Hermione are /horrified/

** Well:

In the first book we know Ron told his parents that Harry wasn't expecting any christmas presents. He always stays at Hogwarts for the holidays.

From the last page of the first book:

“Ready, are you?”

It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.

“You must be Harry's family!” said Mrs. Weasley.

“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry up, boy, we haven't got all day.” He walked away.

Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.

“See you over the summer, then.”

“Hope you have --- er --- a good holiday,” said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.

“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. “/They/ don't know we're not allowed to use magic at home. I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...." - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone

​

So we know that the Dursley's are routinely unpleasant to Harry in public in front of Harry's friends and their families.

He asks all his friends for food when Dudley starts his diet and Petunia makes the whole family join in so they know he isn't being fed properly at home.

There's the whole thing where the Order threatens the Dursleys at the end of Book 5.

​

I'd have to do a full re-read to refresh my canon knowledge to find more anecdotes he's told them or specific incidents that would have happened in front of Ron and Hermione but honestly I'm surprised Hermione never got her parents to call CPS or whatever on them.

​

Then again, I have serious doubts about how good Hermione's own relationship with her family is since we only see them once in the books IIRC and that is in the Diagon Alley trip in book two and we don't even learn their names before they rush off after the debacle in the bookstore. The next concrete thing we hear about them after that is the fact that Hermione blew off going on a skiing trip with them in book five to spend Christmas at 12 Grimmauld Place with Harry and the Weasleys. It all starts to add up to the idea that her Muggle Parents can't handle their daughter being a Witch and Hermione doesn't know how to bridge the gap. She might not have paid too much attention to Harry's own home life since she has her own issues to worry about.

** Enough. But like good friends would, I imagine that they could see he didn't enjoy talking about it and wouldn't press him if he didn't want to say anything.

Thats how a friend is supposed to be: never pushing you to do something you think is right, but there to support you when you need their help.

** We shall consult the Book of Philosophers:

#+begin_quote
  I heard you went to live with Muggles,' said Ron. ‘What are they like?'

  ‘Horrible -- well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers.'

  ‘Five,' said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. ‘I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was Head Boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a Prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand and Percy's old rat.'

  Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat grey rat, which was asleep.

  ‘His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a Prefect, but they couldn't aff-- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.'

  Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.

  *Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.*

** I think it depends on how much Harry was willing to divulge about his home life to his friends. It should be noted that children that grow up in an abusive household (and let's not kid ourselves, Harry did have an abusive childhood, if not quite the hourly beatings that some fanfics tend to depict it as) are rather reticent when it comes to telling others about their life at home.

*** It's hard to say how much Harry has told them. He certainly makes off hand jokes (having a good sense of when to duck when they are discussing Muggle liaison in ootp for example) and although we don't see it in the text we know he spoke to Ron and Hermiones about exactly what happened in the graveyard, so it's not that he's suuuuuuper private about upsetting things. He is also honest about how much he hates it there and was happy to write to them asking for more food.

That said, I don't think it's ever clear that they know about the cupboard, or how often Dudley hit him. I don't believe in the fanon idea that Harry was ruthlessly beaten by Vernon, but I expect that he was knocked about on occasion.

**** I might be wrong but didn't the food thing also happen when Dudley got put on a diet so the whole house did too? If he mentioned that in the request then its not even 'they're making me suffer' rather 'we're all suffering please help'.

***** Ron knows about Harry not being fed well much earlier than that.

When the Weasleys come to break him out in CoS, one of the first things out of Ron's mouth is “they were starving him, Mum!”

Ron may not know that this is a normal state of affairs for Harry, but he definitely knows that the Dursleys are willing to use hunger as a punishment for him at least some of the time.
