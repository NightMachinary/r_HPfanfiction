As the title says, I'm looking generally for fics involving Harry and a non-Human dating or being close friends. That could be Harry-Fleur, Harry-Vampire!Hermione, Harry-non-Human!OC; stuff like Valeriana Natassa, Harry Crow, that one where Harry dates a semi-punkish werewolf girl, etc.

I'm also looking for fics where (I think there's one where it's Fleur?) talks about how much it sucks to be a non-Human, and Harry doesn't claim she is human, only that there's nothing wrong with being non-Human. A lot of fics involving Fleur tend to take the "You're just as human as the bigots are" and I'm curious to see one where he's just like "Yeah. You're a Veela. So what? That doesn't make you lesser, just different." or something to a similar effect. I think it'd be an interesting approach to take that we don't often see.

Harry can be human or not-human too, I don't mind. The only requirement is that the fic involves him dating or being close friends with someone who isn't human. As always, any relationships okay, slash or het or gen or femslash, any weird stuff accepted, any tropes and cliches welcome. Feel free to rec the crap as well as the good - maybe someone else will enjoy what you don't. :)

"Greetings, Lady Glimmerjade. May your enemies get stubbed toes and your accounts earn a positive rate of return."\\
"Greetings to you, Sir Potter. May your wand remain long and firm. Wanna get pizza?"

"Harry, it's good that you're trying to immerse yourself in Mitzy's lifestyle...but you should probably wear more than a bath towel."\\

** Not exactly dating or besties, but in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts) and its sequel linkffn(Harry Potter and the Physical Adept) , Harry ends up adopting the dragon Hagrid hatched as a daughter, though he does treat her more as a peer than as a child.

It just so happens to be that the dragon is closer to /Dungeons & Dragons/ and /Shadowrun/ dragons than the dragons of the original lore, and while Harry certainly considers her a threat due to her raw ability, he never really treats her differently than how he really treats anybody else beyond being a little more empathetic and understanding.
