Hey all, I have been following Noodlehammer's HP fics and his latest fic in the series, is a crossover with the Warcraft universe.

I am really interested in the Warcraft universe and would like to read some good crossovers with HP which explain the lore in the fic, as I would like to get to know more about it.

Link to Noodlehammer's latest HP crossover fic :-

** My knowledge of Warcraft lore is mostly just what I picked up from once having a friend who played WoW. But there are two HP/Warcraft fics I've read. I don't really remember much about either one because it's been so long, but I enjoyed them enough to follow them.

linkffn(Wizard Runemaster by plums) - This one is complete, but it has a sequel that hasn't been updated in almost two years. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8933408/1/][Link]]

linkffn(Of Eldritch Entities and Hapless Heroes by Gemfist) - Hasn't gotten very far yet and hasn't been updated in almost a year, but the author appears to still be around at least. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13542728/1/Of-Eldritch-Entities-and-Hapless-Heroes][Link]]

** Noodlehammer's Warcraft fic is probably the best HP/crossover and I don't quite remember a fic that honestly did a better job introducing the universe even with Harry's opinion.

There is a few decent crossovers but not really one that explains the lore. Wizard Runemaster by plums is decent but from what I remember is mostly a waifu collection story with the evil ones being OOC.

â€‹

linkffn(11975368) The Stormreaver starts with Harry being educated by Orc Judas at the start of the first game but don't worry he has a change of heart later. If you want to read what happened to the world before Noddlehammer fic this is a decent one.

** As far as I remember this doesn't have too much Warcraft lore in it, but it's a great crossover and actively updating to boot. Takes characters from Warcraft to HP universe first>! but if you last long enough they do travel to Warcraft in some of the latest chapters even if it's not for long.!< [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13677583/17/Elune-s-Pebble][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13677583/1/Elune-s-Pebble]]

This one barely qualifies as a crossover at all since it's only a character insert if I'm remembering right. Does showcase some interesting lore for different places occasionally though. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13388520/1/Risen-in-Light-Fallen-to-Shadow]]

These might not fit what you asked for completely but I think they're two of the best crossovers for the fandoms you mentioned. Even if I don't like a couple chapters I think overall they're very unique in that they don't follow the main expansion stories, but also stay away from devolving into mindless wandering the world.
