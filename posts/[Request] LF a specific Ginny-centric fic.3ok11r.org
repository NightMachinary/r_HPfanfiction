As I remember it, Ginny runs away because she got her nose pierced and got in a fight with her mother over it. She ends up coming back to the Burrow years later (heavily tattooed) after traveling all over the world and inheriting a designer shoe company, and the bulk of the story is about her trying to fit back into everyone's lives. Any idea which fic this is?
