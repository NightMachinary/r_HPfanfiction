#+TITLE: Are there any good fics out there where Peter was still the secret keeper but never gave up the Potters. I don’t think I’ve ever see a story where Peter stayed the good guy.

*** I like to imagine peter belived his side would lose the war, so he turned to voldemort in hopes that voldemort would spare his friends when the order lost

and then the worst thing possible happened, harry potter was born and voldemort decided he was the chosen one

** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/Stepping-Back][Stepping Back]], but Harry somehow accidentally kept Peter on their side. It's a time travel fic. He was likable in this fic. Well, near the end. There was that whole "But he betrayed muh family" period.

** I remember reading some long unfinished fic (I think it was a deleted one by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/409523/padfootjr24][this guy]], but can't be sure) where Peter had the location tortured out of him, imprisoned by the bad guys, and the Peter we know is an impostor stuck due to a prototype Polyjuice variant gone wrong.

** Self-Promotion: I wrote a short fic where Peter was still ruthless when it came to his own survival but didn't betray the Potters:
