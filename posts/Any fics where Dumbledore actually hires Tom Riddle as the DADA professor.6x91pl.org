** I remember reading a story where good!Voldemort tricked Dumbledore into doing so. It's all I remember though.

I remember it was one where they arrived in the world a day before all the people that lived on Earth came. They were in a different universe to fix shit or something like that. I think the houses had crazy names too, like Ravenpuff and Slythindor or something like that. I don't remember the name.
