** OP's Note:

#+begin_quote
  It's worth to note that this video is currently #13 trending on YouTube, with over 153,400+ views and counting. As someone who's read a /lot/ of Tom Riddle/Hermione and some Voldemort/Hermione fanfiction, I was very surprised to see how popular (and well-done) the trailer was. Usually, some people on [[/r/harrypotter]] tend to react very badly / angrily to anyone even mentioning this 'ship, so I am quite surprised the trailer is so popular and well-accepted (15k likes / 90 dislikes).

** Ha, I just tried to post it and it redirected me to this ! I love HG/LV and HG/TR (my fav pics, actually), so this had me grinning like a madwoman. It's really well done too ! I'd love a breakdown of the vfx shots, as I'm in the industry.

** You know, if someone didn't have any prior knowledge of Beauty & the Beast, or Harry Potter, they could mistake this as a genuine movie trailer.

*** The actress who played Hermione (Emma Watson) is now in a live action remake of the DIsney Cartoon "Beauty and the Beast". The trailer for said movie is more or less this video, with "The Beast" replaced with Lord Voldemort.
