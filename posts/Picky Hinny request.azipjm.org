** I'm not sure whether or not you would like my fics as I keep it as canon as possible, but have you tried asking on the [[/r/harryandginny][r/harryandginny]] sub? They know more of the old school ones than me.

*** In your fics does Ginny act like she can hex whoever she wants? Act like she can do whatever she wants and that she's better than anyone? Is she portrayed as a Mary Sue with barely any real flaws? If so then thanks for the offer, but if not I'd love to give your fics a try

**** Erm, I mean I don't think so? Maybe in my humour one shot because that was just something dumb I wrote when drunk and never put any thought into it, but I like to think that in linkffn(Not From Others) I write her as a balanced, complex character.

I won't be offended if you don't like it - I clearly disagree with your interpretation of Ginny so I won't be surprised/take it to heart if you see the same Ginny in my fic.

***** Don't you think the fact that she makes fun of everyone at their expense is bad? How she calls Luna loony behind her back but then tells other people not to call her that, acting like she is “noble” per se because she hangs out and defends the weird girl? She heard anyone who is a minor inconvenience to her, and just acts like she can say whatever she wants about people behind their back (fleur) and basically doesn't care what anyone thinks about what she does

And you can't say that she isn't portrayed as a Mary Sue, she is, and her flaws of anger and a temper are never called out and noticed. Rather it just makes everyone fear her and respect her and make her seem badass

****** Saying that Ginny is a Mary Sue but that she also has lots of flaws is a contradiction. You can only have one or the other. The only reason it is not called out is because it is from the perspective of Harry.

******* I said her flaws are turned around so that it makes her seem badass, as JK Rowling probably intended. Her flaws are not real flaws because everyone is like "fear Ginny Weasley" and she walks around like she can do or say whatever she wants to anyone. Anyway I made a mistake by commenting that, I really don't wannt argue the character, so kindly leave

  *This story is now complete.* A post-Hogwarts H/G fic. Strange circumstances draw Harry and Ginny closer together. But are they in danger? Romance, adventure, Monty Python, and tartan boxer shorts abound. No sequel to this is planned at this time. Sorry.
