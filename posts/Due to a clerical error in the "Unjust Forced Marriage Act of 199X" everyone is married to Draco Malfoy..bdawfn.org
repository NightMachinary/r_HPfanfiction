He sighed deeply as harry sat down next to him holding a similar letter 'ron, I think I am being pranked by the twins' harry said looking at him "I have a letter saying I am married to malfoy'

"bloody hell mate, I got the same letter' ron frowned as he passed harry the letter

*** Harry looked at the letter, shocked and turned to look at the headmaster, who would SURELY have some sort of explanation. Dumbledore always has some of those... except.. this time the headmaster looked as stunned and shocked as everyone else. His phoenix Fawkes is making sad circles around the headmaster, as to give comfort to him, but upon closer inspection, Harry could also make out the letter peering out from Fawkes' beak. Merlin's beard! Fawkes was married to Draco as well! In that moment a loud "snap!" could be heard, immediately drawing everyone's attention to the centre of the great hall, where dobby aparated with wide, blood-shot and almost insane eyes, wearing nothing but a towel tied around his waist, mismatched socks and a long floral courtain to serve as a cape. In his hands he holds a golden spatula that looks to be twice the size of the poor, demented elf. He looks around the room and screams: DOBBY NO GO BACK TO MALFOYS, NO SIR, NO! DOBBY MARRIED TO MALFOY ONCE, DOBBY GET A DIVORCE, DOBBY IS A FREE ELF!!! with an unholy shriek, Dobby starts charging towards the teacher's table with his spatula smacking everything in his way. Shrieks could be heard from all sides and absolute chaos unfolded in the great hall.
