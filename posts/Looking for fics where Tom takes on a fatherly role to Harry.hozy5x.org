  After the infamous massacre of the Potters, young Harry Potter went missing. It doesn't really help that years later he turns up again, a bit darker, stranger and more erratic than anyone had hoped for. But Harry hardly cares, in the end it's his decision on which side he will fight; dark, light or no side at all. Eventually HP/LV... of sorts.

  Tom floated in the empty space, his eyes scanning the dark gray area as random objects floated about before glancing down at Severus, who sighed. "How's the view?" He asked."The same as always. It's still Limbo."-------------------Tom Marvolo Riddle is sentenced to Limbo for his crimes and for his fractured soul. He has to feel remorse for his sins before he will ever receive salvation.After a century of going insane and spending another to repair his broken mind, he is sent back in time to fix his mistakes and raise both himself and his nemesis, Harry Potter.But who knew that it wouldn't be that easy? Definitely not him.
