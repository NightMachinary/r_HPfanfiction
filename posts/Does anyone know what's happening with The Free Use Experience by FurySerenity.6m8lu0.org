It seemed like the author had been updating every day, but now it's been more than a month. It was just starting to get towards the good parts, too. Is anyone aware of why it stopped updating?


** It is likely the answer to the question will be lost in time, as has the rapid slowdown in posting/cessation of posting by many other authors. I don't think we're entitled to know why exactly people abruptly slow down/stop posting their stories, but it would be nice to have some closure.

** Likely dead, Vance McGill aka FurySerenity afaik has never completed a single fic. It isn't the first time they wrote 100k+ words in a flash only to leave us hanging.

*** IIRC he finished the first two books in the Bonds of Time series and /maybe/ one or two others but yeah he mostly never finishes his work.

Thus proving the point. The fic may be labeled complete but it's not really considered done until the series is complete because you can't really read it as a standalone.
