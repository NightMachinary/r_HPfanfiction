in this FF Harry lives in Prague and is well integrated into the wizarding community. I think it is set after Hogwarts, cause he isn't exactly a dark wizard but he isn't even a pure knight. He is part of a very famous order of Alchemists and works on a Golem project. I don't remember much else, unfortunately.


** Could it be Azoth? I haven't read it in a while but I'm pretty sure that Harry is an alchemist in that one

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

  An uncharted city. A forgotten artifact. An innocent man. What could possibly happen when Ed and Al decide to jump into the case? First time, please R&R even criticism
