Hello!

I'm trying to find a specific fanfic that I read years ago. Remus and Sirius has saved a young abused Harry from the Dursley's and harry was very skittish and hid all the time. He was particularly petrified of taking a bath if I remember correctly. I think he was somewhere between 4-6 in this fic. Thank you!
