Most wrong boy who lived stories have one twin being what was written above and going into Slytherin, Ravenclaw or Durmstrang, with Snape usually being the only one who actually figures out that it's that twin who is the real BWL. Some fics have James and Lily being idiots for believing a manipulative Dumbledore... Well you probably know the trope. So what if the trope gets a twist? Where the dark twin who manipulative Dumbledore thinks is the real BWL isn't really and the twin who seems like an ordinary kid without any extraordinary powers is? I think it would work best as a parody. Has anyone written anything like this?


** Probably the most famous "Harry has a brother who is identified as the Boy Who Lived" fics has said brother genuinely be the BWL.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Isn't this most of them? Usually Harry gets sent to the Dursleys or somewhere else horrible because they think he isn't the boy who lived, and he gets treated like shit pretty much up to the point where he defeats Voldemort (if that ever happens). Are you saying what if the pampered one actually /was/ the BWL for once?

OP is requesting where the "identified" BWL is actually the BWL. The issue I have with this is that I've yet to read a WBWL fic where anyone inside the story realizes they misidentified the BWL (have also yet to read one that actually gets to the point of revealing this...), so the requested premise doesn't make sense in my mind.

Now, I'll admit, I'd be interested in a WBWL story where the twist is on the readers, i.e. the author hints that it's a WBWL story the entire time, only for the ending to reveal that everyone was right about the BWL and the readers were just reading too much into the hints, but I've never seen one like that before.

**** I thought they meant that Dumbledore genuinely thought he was rearing up Harry to be an abused little sacrifice, except that the decoy BWL really is the BWL, and has been raised normally, and won't walk to his death. I'd like to see it when Dumbledore realizes his Greater Good sacrifice was for naught, and he ruined a child's life "needlessly".

**** The idea is that everything plays out like a regular WBWL fic --- Duncan-Smith Potter or whoever is the pampered, spoiled Boy-Who-Lived while poor Harry who also has a mysterious curse scar is kept in the shadows, seemingly by the manipulative actions of Dumbledore... /except/ that Harry is just deluded if he thinks his scar is anything else than an old cut, and Duncan-Smith /really is/ the Boy Who Lived.

**** They think that non-Harry is the BWL when it's actually Harry, which makes it the wrong BWL. I don't know if I understood the question so I asked if he meant it the other way which wouldn't be WBWL.

** ffnlink(Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived by The Santi) Isn't meant as a parody or making fun of the trope. And Harry isn't abused by his parents, not really. Still he is not the BWL, his brother is for real. And he does in fact go down the Dark and misunderstood path in life.

Note if you like it, there is more on Dark Lord Potter forum. But this latter half is WiP and subject to change before official posting on FFN.
