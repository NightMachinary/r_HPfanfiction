Only thing I remember is, Sirius makes harry is heir since he cannot have any kids. As a black heir harry can marry only a pure blood, but he is truly in love with Hermione, and initially it leans towards harry having a 2nd wife and Hermione even suggests Ginny , but harry finds a way around it by claiming the life debt Sirius owed him and ask him to nullify that Balck family marriage clause...


** I know you're not the author so this really isn't directed at you, but that makes no sense. Why would Sirius black insist in him marrying g a pureblood? And it can't be some unspoken rule enforced by some family magic because of andromeda, but maybe it only applies to the the "heir" but still a pretty poor fic theme.

** Andromeda was cast out of the black family and this applies only to the male heir of the family.... That's what the author implied

*** My main thing is why would Harry have to force Sirius into letting him marry a Muggleborn? Like is this Sirius OOC or what?
