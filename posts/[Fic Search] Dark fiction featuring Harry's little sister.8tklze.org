So I've been looking for a fic I read a couple of years ago, but so far, no luck.

As far as I can remember it went so far as changing the calender to put a huge role on the summer/winter solstice and the impact of numbers in general on the life of magical beings. Lily and James performed a ritual to conceive a second child during the winter solstice. Through the help of a time turner Lily gave birth to her daughter at the following summer solstice, which was supposed to give their child exceptional powers. The Potters kept the whole affair hidden and switched their daughter later for Ginny Weasly, so that she would not be targeted by Voldemort. The real Ginny was sacrificed to give Harry a chance to survive, the Potters themself died that Halloween.

It went on with the new Ginny's childhood and early school years in Hogwarts. As said before it put emphases and the influence of numbers, rituals and magic in general as well as the secrets of Hogwarts. Ginny herself was not able to speak and was not social, it went so far as that she was performing a subconscious form of notice-me-not charms, which caused the population of Hogwarts to forget about her, she herself had no idea why that happened.

The whole episode with Tom's diary still took place, though with a little twist where the soul of another Harry (Master of Death, time travel involved) took over the diary and was the one communicating with Ginny. The story continued with her magical training under the direction of the diary and facing the dementors, which was quite troublesome for her.

Last thing i remember is that Ginny planed to give the soul inside the diary a body, which required her to sacrifice the diary, Harry and the soul-less animagus form of the diary, which she had to find yet (Took place during the GoF arc).

Thanks in advance for any pointers

The real Ginny was what now. Am I reading this right, did (the Potters?) sacrifice a baby so Harry would have a chance?

*** Yes indeed, the Potters abducted Ginny, replacing her with their own daughter in the process, and sacrificed the baby in another ritual to give Harry a chance to survive. I don't think it was explained why all of this happened, but the fic was still going on, so it coult be that it was addressed sometime later.
