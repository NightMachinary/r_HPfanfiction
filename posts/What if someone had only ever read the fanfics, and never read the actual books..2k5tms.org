I read a disclaimer that wondered how anyone could be reading Harry Potter fan fics and /NOT/ know that Harry Potter belongs to JKR. The way this author worded their disclaimer made me wonder... How many fics can stand on their own merits if they were read by someone who hasn't read the books, watched the movies, or been exposed to the series in any way? I know quite a few redo the opening sequence with Harry not being a normal boy and getting his letter... but are there any at all that would properly make sense to a reader who wasn't already familiar with the canon books?

Since thats not fair to any fic thats starts in a year other than first year: How many, if any, fics could work as a viable substitute for the series from their selected point forward if you handed them to someone who had only ever read the previous years' books

And finally, if we found this person, and kidnapped from from their home under the rock they've clearly been living in, and subjected them to a reasonable sampling of fanon... I wonder just what they'd assume the source material had been about having never read it.


** Hermione and Harry end up together, but both secretly have a thing for Draco. Ron is stupid, violent and bigoted, and together with Ginny makes ample use of love potions. Snape is both a pure selfish evil rapist and pure selfless awesome sex-God, and for some unknown reason, both Harry and Hermione secretly always had a thing for him as well. Dumbledore is senile and harmlessly stupid while being a cruel master manipulator that is actually a dark lord that no one knows about. Remus and Sirius are so gay and together. Tonks is secretly wild about Harry. Also, Voldemort is stupid and tortures his own officers all the time because that's how your run an army that is completely loyal to you.

Harry is more powerful than Voldemort, smarter than everyone, and could win the war on his own if he just believed in himself from the start. Hermione is a genius and possibly a supermodel. Sirius left Azkaban and the next day was perfectly back to his happy self made of cheerfulness and fatherly emotions. Snape isn't that bad actually, except the times he forces students to sleep with him to get passing grades, and the torture of muggles he seems to enjoy... but his attitude towards Harry is because retroactive of sexual attraction from five years after he starts being a git.

Also, Hermione was wrong and a slave race is perfectly acceptable.

In the first war was going against both the Order and the Ministry and at the very least not losing (if not winning). You can't do that with a demoralized military force, which makes me assume that he rewarded successes, and his punishments were carefully meted.

edit: also, a world where Voldemort actually knows what he's doing and being an equal to Dumbledore (just with different blind spots) is much more interesting and realistic.

If we had someone who doesn't know anything about the books/movies and made them read a ton of fan fiction, this is how they'd imagine canon actually was.

There are a few ones like A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles who actually stand on their own... but those are the rare exceptions, and even then they need canon to complete the picture.

I think authors tend to view characters as having one overarching trait that is immutable and must always be in full force. Or at least one gimmick that they can always use to push a character into an interesting situation. In /Prince of the Dark Kingdom/, it's Harry getting misplaced. In Alexandra Quick, the titular character will rush headlong into some situation with no thought to consequences or danger. No matter what consequences or danger she's been through in the past.

I'm told that there is eventual character development in this regard, but too late. I had to stop reading.

** Well I've read Harry potter, but there's quite a few crossover fics I've read with him (lord of the rings, avengers) where I haven't read the books/comics or watched the movies for either, but just going by my faint knowledge on those series it's pretty simple to understand what's going on, usually the authors also write the stories in a way where even without knowing anything about the series I can understand everything. So for those who haven't read Harry porter or only read a bit before quitting, as long as the author is doing a good enough job with they're story they'll prob get it.

Though in all honestly they'll probably believe Tom was a sweetheart, Harry's meant to be a slytherin, ron's an evil hit and dumbledore is some mad man out to ruin the wizarding world

*** Rowling decided to start that with when she put a whole bunch of them in original books.

What is the problem that so many people have with the word "wards"? Every fantasy book that used them as far as I know always meant some sort of enchantment designed to protect something from attack or entry.

Rowling had enchanted items in her books. Wizards' main sport involves enchanted brooms and balls enchanted to seek out targets and pummel them.

Voldermort protected his stuff with really contrived and utterly inefficient enchantments - major parts of the final books involved characters getting past these enchantments.

If their magic allows for ridiculously stupid stuff like "goblet that forces you to drink contents and is somehow impossible to drain otherwise and activates hordes of undead in surrounding lake" than how much problem would they have with something straightforward like "ground blows up if intruder steps on it" or "set intruder on fire if he comes near" or "let out a few dozen bludgers under exact same enchantment that a house-elf was able to perform in second book" or "use that enchantment Dumbledore has cast that one time to WARD off the Goblet of Fire from underage wizards"

Only to end with "and then X opened all that stuff up" or "X couldn't get around those and went on his/her merry way".

It would also not make much sense for a society not that dissimilar from ours to NOT possess a common means of protecting private property.

To me it seems sort of like calling a historical fantasy book "unique" because that author neglected to use the word "locks" and instead merely described several instances of mechanisms designed to hold shut hinged doorways unless a particular token was used to release them.

There is a commonly used word that defines a concept that is almost entirely unique to fantasy literature - if one has that concept in their story, might as well use the existing word.

Here's one on the DLP forums talking about the "blood ward" that protected Harry when he was at Privet Drive. [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=1375]]. *Editing to add a better one: [[http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/33965/could-someone-explain-to-me-the-blood-wards-of-4-privet-drive]]

The HP Wiki also references both Hogwarts School and Nurmengard Prison as having similar anti-apparition wards. I definitely think "wards" can be used pretty clearly in the context of magic in the HP universe. If JKR never used the term herself, well it certainly does come across as very natural, like you said, so I do find it rather interesting that it annoys people when writer's use this term in their own fanfics.

It's easier, faster, and more useful to call them ducks.

What personally annoys me is whenever someone refers to eyes as orbs or use the term "sheepish grin" - it feels like a cheapened version of what it should be. Most people find "wards" more annoying because they feel that you lose something with that word - in this case, part of the "Rowlingness" of the world.

I made no claims as to justification for that feeling. I personally don't really mind, though would prefer "wards" be a new magic that wasn't described in canon, giving (at least superficially) a reason why it wasn't used in canon. I would think that would probably explain why others feel that way - addition of a major branch of magic that wasn't described in canon is a risky thing that usually backfires in fan fiction... so that word becomes a subconscious warning flag to some.

****** yeah... I /have/ an account... I just don't use it to write with. My alerts list is still in the low double digits and I'm already seeing the message that /STORY HAS UPDATED/ and realizing I don't have the faintest recollection of what that story was about. Wind up skimming or outright rereading the previous chapters again to sort out which of them it is.

1000+... I think I'd lose what little grip I have left on my sanity.

I am not losing my sanity ; it is simply that I am the only sane one in my mind.

...

yeah writing is not my thing . That was a dumbledore-esque inspired sentence. and I would rather read anyways. lol

**** You're right - I just did some google-ing. Some websites require you to have them and others don't.
