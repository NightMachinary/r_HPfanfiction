Spent a week reading almost all of Keira Marcos stories and I loved them. Am looking for stories like that. Loved the HHr soul bonded one. I loved the whole Lors Potter/Earl of Gryffindor and I know people love to hate that trope but I love it. Most of those trope stories are not good but some are. Love the whole parsel magic scenario. Im not explaining myself well but people who have read her stories and like them know what I'm talking about.

At least 150k wording. Prefer some bashing (Weasley/Dumbledore).

And please, please don't recommend Dodgin Prison and stealing witches! I've tried reading it so many times but I just can't with that story.

Thank you!
