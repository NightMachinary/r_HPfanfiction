Saw a post with Hermione centric crossovers and am looking for more. I've read all crossovers with Supernatural. Cute one shots or long fics. Looking for fics placed in the crossover world with HarryPotter elements. No Anime or animations like Steven universe, RWBY crossovers.


** linkffn(The Winter Witch) is Harry Potter / Game of Thrones crossover. It has a few nice things going for it - for example, the HP magic system is appropriately powerful, which I like.

However, over time, the fic has lost some steam for me, although I still enjoy its updates.

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom and finished with a battle outside her tent. The deciding line between staying and helping Robb Stark, or returning to her universe, is getting harder to see the longer she's in Westeros. But it's a decision that she has to make, or it's one that will be made for her. Part 1 & Part 2 complete! Part 3 now ongoing.

** >No Anime Stevens universe

... wow, that sentence is... wow. First, you misspelled Steven Universe, that's his last name, the show isn't calling the Universe Steven's. Second, Anime is only used for Japanese or Japanese inspired shows, if you want to exclude all Animation, call it Animation.

**** Well, Steven Universe is not an anime, so you're going to have to be more specific on what types of shows you don't want a crossover for.

Like is Gravity Falls okay? Phineas and Ferb? Scooby Doo? You say you don't want to block all of animation but don't actually tell us what you don't want in animation.
