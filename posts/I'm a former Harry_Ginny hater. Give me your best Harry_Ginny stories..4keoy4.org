I used to really hate Harry/Ginny and especially Ginny as a character, at least as far as her portrayal in fanfiction is concerned. As a result I've read only few FanFictions featuring that pairing. However, after reading linkffn(9818387) as well as linkffn(2567446) I'm beginning to change my mind. So hit me with your best Harry/Ginny. No stories with Ginny as a Harry fangirl are allowed.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]] - linkffn(4740107) - Ginny does a redo. Not a lot of action, just Ginny working the horcruxes and her relationships.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11281891/1/][Failsafe]] - linkffn(11281891) - an abandoned HP-LOTR x-over, but I really just like the HG relationship in it -- no angst or second-guessing, they just really enjoy each others' company.

My own best? Probably linkffn(4889913), followed by linkffn(5116751) (one-shot), linkffn(4905771) (one-sided HP/GW), and linkffn(4543379) (hate-triangle thing with Harry, Ginny, and Daphne).

The community's best with the pairing? Arguably, linkffn(4101650). Perhaps the best Ginny-centric character piece is linkffn(6919395); it's not HP/GW (yet), but you won't see the character in the same way. Definitely worth the read.

** There are some great canon compliant Ginny fics:

*Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince*, linkffn(5677867), is a wonderful year 6 story from Ginny's POV.

Fellow redditor [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] wrote *Not From Others*, linkffn(11419408), the best year 7 Hogwarts story imho.

*Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126), is an excellent fic about Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2010.

  Growing up as a Kneazle is tricky, especially when you realize you might be human, too. Add in posessed professors, sinister snakes, and more detentions than he can count, and Harry's Hogwarts career has certainly been memorable. What will he do when he faces his biggest challenge yet? Being a teenager isn't easy no matter what species you are. Sequel to 'Growing Up Kneazle'
