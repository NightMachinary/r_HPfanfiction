Splinching can be healed flawlessly, but scars from werewolf attacks and the blood quills can't. Also, the effect of long-term memory charms and cruciatus are apparently permanent. Is it mainly curse related? Does that mean that Nagini was a curse type magic?


** I believe that if it's a dark curse, then it's not exactly treatable. There's exceptions, such as Phoenix tears, but it's pretty much a case of "get hit, you're screwed"

** I think the general rule is: if the magic is intended to injure then it is difficult to heal.

Purely physical injuries, such as burns and breaks can be healed easily. Most magical accident injuries, such as Neville's potions accidents or splinching, unless you are really unlucky can be fixed relatively simply. If you are looking to affect your target permenantly, then you would specifically look for, or design, a spell that is deliberately hard to heal. The same reason that malitious software on a computer is so hard to get rid of, because it is made that way. How you make a spell hard to heal is up to you.

My head canon of the examples you provide split into two groups. Firstly you have offensive curses and magical creature attacks, like the werewolf bites or basilisk venom, which leave behind some magic in the wound to fight off any attempt at healing, the curse aspect, if you will. The memory charms and cruciatus curse I would attribute to a combination of wizarding healing not really extending to magically healing minds, and that while you may be able to fix what is broken, you can't replace what is missing entirely.

** This is a personal headcanon, but I think the injuries you mentionned cannot be cured for 2 different reasons.

I believe that the injuries caused by Dark Magic (Sectumsempra, Blood Quill, Werewolf's bite . . .) cannot be healed because the initial attack left a lingering magic that actively work against any magic trying to heal the injury. It is my belief that this is the presence of this lingering magic, powered by the intent of the caster, that determine the magic used as Dark Magic. In the case of Nagini, her bite could not be healed because of the presence of poison in the wound. The (magical) poison had a similar effect to the lingering Magic of the Dark Art, but the difference was that it could slowly be drained, which explain why Arthur Weasley eventually healed while Dumbledore injury kept worsening until his death.

Concerning the other kind of injuries you mentioned such as the one who affected Gilderoy Lockart or the Longbottoms, I just think that despite their magic, the wizards are not able to heal the minds. Unlike the other physical injuries that can be erased with a wave of a wand, the mind is a very complicated thing, that can't just be recreated. Add at that the existence of a soul (that should be linked to the mind), and the injury becomes even harder to heal.

** The author. It's a canon thing though that minds cannot be really healed through magic.

** My headcanon is that it's cursed wounds that cannot be healed. This includes werewolf scratches because lycanthropy is a curse.

Canon makes a distinction (but never defines the limits) between hexes, jinxes, charms, and curses. (Strangely, the generically-named "healing spells" aren't included in any of these categories.)

Memory charms are shown to only disrupt the /connections/ that allow you to recall certain memories. (Bertha Jorkins was obliviated after accidentally finding out about Barty Crouch, Jr, and Voldemort was later able to pull that information out of her head through a combination of torture and callous legilimency.) Restoring those connections would be like trying to reconstruct a hayfield by reattaching the pieces in a bale of hay.

** In my fanfic, I've established that injuries that do not affect the magical core itself are very easily healed. Things such as cuts, bruises, a bullet wound or something to that affect would and could be healed in no time. I think splinching, whilst still able to be healed in relative quickness, would take longer as it was caused by a magical accident.

I think magical illnesses would be harder to cure. Wizards and witches are susceptible to both magical and muggle illnesses whereas muggles are not. I think it's because magical illnesses such as dragon pox attack the magical core first, which then lowers the immune system. That's why perhaps certain squibs and descendants of squibs could perhaps die of magical illnesses, as they're essentially born with a magical core that is empty. Perhaps why muggles die of an unidentifiable or rare illness that pops up in the muggle world very rarely, as descendants of squibs can be born with or without an empty core
