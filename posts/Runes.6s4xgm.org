  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** I'm trying to remember the name, but there's one in which Harry accidentally travels back to the time of Merlin and learns runes and blood magic from him. I'll look through my Favourites and see if I can find it!

***** I started this one today. Does the writing get better further in?

I like the premise, but there's a lot of 'show, don't tell' rule breaking, and weird repetitive prose.

****** In all honesty, I read it a while ago and can't remember. The other fic I recommended (Anarkia) I think has pretty decent writing, but is pretty out there AU-wise.

  Abandonned by his guardians, Harry Potter vanished from existence. Years later, a young man graduates from one of the most elitist and secrete Magical schools and makes his way through Magical societies. Fate or Fatality? Ancient Greeks called it Anarkia.
