Hi guys I'm looking for the first fanfic I ever read. I read it before the fifth book came out. It's a fifth year fic that features Harry becoming a griffin animagus. Either Malfoy Sr or Voldemort imperiuses a bunch of girls to want to be with Harry including Hermione. But tHermiones wears off and they stay together. Draco and Ginny are a thing but at the end of the year Ginny kisses Harry or something.

Writing this I realize this was prob a shitty fic but it was my first and I really wanna revisit it, so please help :)

Idk if it helps but I downloaded it from Limewire back when it was a thing.

**** No problem whatsoever, it was the same introduction to fanfiction that I got. Although I used Imesh to download it (it was a Limewire clone)
