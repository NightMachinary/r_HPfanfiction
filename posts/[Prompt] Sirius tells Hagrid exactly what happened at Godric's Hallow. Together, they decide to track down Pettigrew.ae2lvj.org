** Or maybe, instead of giving his motorbike to Hagrid, Sirius drives him and baby Harry to Surrey and tells everything to Dumbledore and McGonagall?

** This would make a great segue into a fic where they both get sent to Azkaban and break out in poa, covering the wacky hijinks of a dog animagus and a half giant on the lam, since Pettigrew's scheme would work regardless of if there were two people chasing him.

*** Not necessarily. We don't really know what led up to the situation so it would really be at the liberty of the author. All we know is it took a couple of days so perhaps there where more instances they met before the final confrontation.

**** Well of course it wouldn't /automatically/ lead to them both being thrown in Azkaban, I wasn't suggesting that. I was saying that if the author /wanted/ to, it would be very easy to have the plot go in that direction.

*** Not really. The whole "you betrayed James and Lily" schtick doesn't work against Hagrid, because Hagrid was never Secret Keeper, or even involved in the process. Dumbledore can vouch for that for sure, especially since you can't have multiple secret keepers

**** I was more thinking, Hagrid and Sirius track down Peter, Peter blows up the muffled as per the books, and now Sirius is accused of betraying Lily and James plus the murder of the muggles, and Hagrid is accused of co-conspirating with the man who betrayed the Potters, as well as participating in the murder of the muggles.

Sirius wasn't just convicted for betraying the Potters, he was convicted for betraying them /and/ killing 13 muggles + Pettigrew. Even though Hagrid wasn't thought of as the secret keeper, he could easily be convicted for helping to murder all the muggles.
