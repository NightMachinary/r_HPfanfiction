I've been reading HP fanfiction on and off for the past few years, mostly with just a short story to get some variety from my usual Naruto fanfiction, however these past few months I've been reading mostly HP fanfiction now and I've noticed something.

In Naruto fanfiction Yaoi (Slash for those who don't know) isn't too uncommon but it is far from a majority but with HP... I've only seen around 3 non-slash fics. There are so many Harry x Tom or Draco and Snap that it just feels like a consipiracy. I have nothing against it (As long as all parties are consenting I don't care), I'm heterosexual, but I have to say that it makes me a bit uncomfortable if the scenes get overly romantic. The first real HP fic I read was /The Rise of a Dark Lord By: Little.Miss.Xanda/ and I loved it. It was a bit cringey at some points but still a lovely story that got into rather heated situations with Tom and Harry... Still definitely one of my favorite stories at the moment though.

So is it just my mind trying to tell me something or is most Harry Potter fanfiction slash?


** Not even close, OP. There are only a couple hundred good slash stories out of over 769,000 stories presently on fanfiction.net. You are likely looking in the wrong places.

**** Recommended and general recs are on the sidebar. Making a thread about the best stories from a certain "type" of story or plot-line (or simply googling threads) is a good way to find stories via this sub. You can also use FFN's search filter to narrow down stories by characters, type, length, reviews, followers, and other options.

***** I found them just a few minutes ago and I've been using FF.net's filter for the past few weeks. If I get the idea for a story I have to read then I'll ask if it exists here =P. I'd say if it weren't then I'd try my hand at writing it but I don't think I have a good enough grasp on the community yet.

****** FFN's search filter is usually enough to find even the most niche stories. Selecting characters (sometimes called /pairings/ if the characters have a relationship) is usually enough to, with time, find unique stories that may otherwise be extremely difficult to weed out.

Before you post here, I recommend googling your query first. Re-posting of requests for pairings (such as Harry/Daphne) is a serious problem on this sub, as the pairing is extremely common and requested almost daily, and it would be helpful if people were to search for their query first. If you can't find anything that fits your tastes, then that is when you should make a topic. That is what I do, anyhow. Your mileage may vary on when to create an original post.

Everything listed there is very well written as well as being the best in in the fandom.

After that I would recommend going through [[https://m.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][DLP's C2]] which is also full of amazing fics. As far as I know none of the recommendations contain slash.

***** Highly recommend every story on all four of those lists, excluding Alexandra Quick. Furthermore, DLP's forums contain many lesser known stories that are top notch in either plot, writing, or both. I highly recommend going over there and reading some of the 4 and 5 star stories from the different areas in the forum. The amazing thing about having hundreds of thousands of Harry Potter fanfictions on the internet is that there is most certainly at least /one/ story that will fit everyone's tastes, if not more.

On a different note - I don't understand why Alexandra Quick makes many "Best of the fandom" lists. The author's writing style isn't captivating, and the plot is essentially a loose canon rehash meant to fit a female protagonist and a different country with different antagonists. Can somebody enlighten me as to what makes Alexandra Quick such a popular character and series?

  is most Harry Potter fanfiction slash?

No.

I think there are more female HP writers on ffn and that may result in a bit more slash than there otherwise would be. If you like guys, what's hotter than two of them?

I thought the amount of HP slash on ffn is equivalent to the Naruto slash on AO3
