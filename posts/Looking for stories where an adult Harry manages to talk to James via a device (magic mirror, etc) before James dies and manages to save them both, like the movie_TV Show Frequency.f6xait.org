So in the movie Frequency, a detective with the NYPD somehow (some movie hand waving with Northern Lights and comets I think) is able to speak to his fireman father 30 years or so ago in the past. The son manages to warn his father about a dangerous fire which the father died in. The warning caused a ripple in which the father didn't die. There are further ripples, like a serial killer that was supposed to die but survived.

The TV show is basically the same but updated and has a female lead.

I was looking for something along those lines, where Harry "fixes" the past by saving his parents but there are unexpected ripples that both he and James try to (and hopefully suceed) fix. The added complication of the "device" being the only way they can communicate (and sporadically at that) would be an interesting plot point as well.


** Oooh, I loved the show!! It would be really interesting to read, but the planning would take so long. Any little thing could change so much, oh boy

** Man that movie is one of my all time favs.

Managed to catch that one in theaters when it first came out way back in the day. So good.

** Only thing like that I've seen is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3022004/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freak-Parade][Harry Potter and the Freak Parade]]. It starts off as an Indie!Harry shopping trip parody iirc, and then gets wacky from there. Harry manages to save his parents by replacing them with animated steaks, and then goes into hiding with the real Lily and James until it's 1996 again. It's only 23k words and pretty silly, so I'd recommend it even if it isn't precisely what you asked for.

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.
