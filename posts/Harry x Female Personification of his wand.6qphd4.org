*** Like he can manifest a female avatar using the power of his dick but unfortunately can't actually have sex with her because while she's manifested he's impotent due to her manifestation being powered by his male potency.

"Well... we can cuddle?"

"Why do I keep doing this to myself?"

Tbh, I suspect many girls at Hogwarts were in the habits of using their wands as, ahem, /substitutes/ for the guys they wanted to date but couldn't.

[[/spoiler]["Come on, Harry," 14-year-old Ginny growled as she spread her legs and calmly guided her wand along her inner thigh to her wet entrance. "Come on, Harry, get /in/ there..."]] (hidden behind a spoiler tag because it's rather nsfw)

**** Holy shit no! That'd be like saying I bet female soldiers use their rifles for substitutes. Wands are dangerous. Just transfigure something man

**** nice thought but shit implementation. look at your PC clock for 10 minutes. nobody is going to stand around that long while olivander gapes at nothing. they'd take him away for a medical check after three minutes or so.

***** Lol this is actually something that REALLY bugs me in fics. Some revelation happens and "dead silence filled the room for the next two minutes".

When that happens it just feels weird to imagine people awkwardly saying nothing for 120 seconds which is a long ass time.
