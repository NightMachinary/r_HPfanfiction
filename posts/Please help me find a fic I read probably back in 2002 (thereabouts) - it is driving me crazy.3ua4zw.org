I forget the name, author, where I found it...here is what I DO remember:

- It starts in the U.S, where Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Lavender, and Draco moved after Hogwarts, and take on muggle identities.

- Pairings: H/Hr, R/L, G/D

- Each couple has a child (H/Hr have a daughter, the others sons I believe).

- Minerva and Albus live across the street as the grandparents.

- The adults are all called back to Hogwarts for some reason, and introduce their children to magic (they are in their early teens).

Thank you!


** ...they introduce their (magical) children to magic in their early teens?

...does 11 count as "early teens?"

** I think I know this one. Does it mention Pink Floyd somewhere? Does it mention planets/stars/stellar shit colliding with the use of magic?

**** Don't know the title, but I think we're on the lookout for the same story, then.
