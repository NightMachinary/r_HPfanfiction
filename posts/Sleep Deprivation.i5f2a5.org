Sleep deprivation is my favorite drug, especially when you stay up all night to finish a good fic, and then it turns out it's unfinished and the ending leaves you unsatisfied. ðŸ˜ž


** Now that I'm thinking about it, there was any fic that you literally couldn't stop reading and you stay up the whole night? Not like till 3AM, the ones that you noticed and, it was already 7AM.

*** That was me last night. I'm part of the way through an 800k work. All I want to do is read, but sadly real life beckons.

**** Yes, real life sometimes sucks. But think this way, sleep is for weak people so you have the whole night to read

*** That was me last night I was reading Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence and finished it at 0653 this morning. I just didn't want to stop reading. It's a Harry time travel fic where he ends up with a teenage Bellatrix.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** At one point earlier in my life long addiction to FanFiction i used to do that but I stopped because in my head i was reading the fic but i was actually dreaming of doing that so I usually try and read the fic within the time allotted then just go to sleep and finish in the morning.
