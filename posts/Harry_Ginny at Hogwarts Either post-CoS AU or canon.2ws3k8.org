Looking for fics with Harry/Ginny that are either a) Ginny and Harry become closer after the events of CoS and end up as friends. Doesn't have to be romance since they're so young but they should be better friends then in canon. It's fine if it's more about trio + Ginny.

b) canon fic that portrays Harry/Ginny's relationship during HBP.

*** Only a few chapters in, but things feel a little bit too...perfect/mary sue-ish. And not a fan of Ron bashing. Does this get better later on?

** I recommend Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. But you've probably already read it.

**** I would rate it 90/100. The author stopped publishing chapters in 2012, halfway through third year.

It's cool though, last week he started publishing again.

The story is outstanding. There's a bit of Mary Sue, but it's worth it. So, so worth it.
