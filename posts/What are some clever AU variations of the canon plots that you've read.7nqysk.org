I'm a big fan of canon AU fics, but it's really common for their plots to just be rehashes of canon (or as TV Tropes puts it, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon][The Stations of the Canon]]).

What are some fics that, while inspired by the original book plots, go in a clever direction that's not just a rehash?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] and [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] both rehash canon stations to a certain degree, but offer enough differences and changes as to be highly interesting.

** I'm a bit confused by your first line. "Canon AU fics" are mutually exclusive. An AU is by definition completely different then Canon.

I'll just try and recommend you a few AUs that I love.

In the Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs magical bonds are a huge point of divergence from Canon which drive the plot. The divide between muggleborns and purebloods exists, but the divide between wizards/witches is greater. You either love or hate this work, but personally I love it (it's my favorite fic of all time) and the uniqueness and creativity cannot be denied. The world gets a bit Dark, but it's a refreshing twist in my mind.

Or in "Prince" By SallyJAvery (I highly recommend, it's incredible) takes place within Venice. It's short, but makes you really feel invested while still managing to remain Harry Potter. This is a must read.

Stages of Hope is another popular AU that shows up a lot. It's recommended a lot on this sub so I won't go into much detail other then the characterization is incredible.

If there is a specific sort of AU you are looking for whether it be one with a different magic system or just a few different concepts please clarify.

AU is an incredibly broad term, including things that span from almost starting from scratch like the Firebird Trilogy or building upon Canon such as Stages of Hope.

#+end_quote

I'm coming from the BBC Merlin fandom (which unfortunately doesn't have its own fanfiction sub like HP does, which is why I lurk here!), and it's common to distinguish between modern AUs vs canon AUs (i.e., time period).

By a HP "canon AU", I mean stories that are set in a magic-exists-and-is-more-or-less-like-the-books, Harry-goes-to-Hogwarts type of universe. Again, that's understandably broad, but it helps to differentiate from time-travel AUs or space AUs or coffeeshop AUs or whatever.

I hope my above explanation helps.

Thanks for the recommendations. The first two might be a bit /too/ AU for my tastes (which I'll readily admit are very vanilla when it comes to HP fanfic), but I'll check out "Stages of Hope".

Though I think the term you want may be "divergent timeline." As in, recognizable as the canon-verse but with

** /Completely AU story/

linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19) is a massively AU fic where Salazar Slytherin is, more or less, the immortal god-emperor of the wizarding world. The fic focuses on Hermione and Harry and their experiences in this world, and it keeps them as reasonably in character as possible (with some changes because of world-building reasons).

/Interesting Rehashes of Stations of Canon, mixed with original story/

linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or by jacobk) is probably my favorite Slytherin!Hermione fic, because it doesn't turn her into suddenly beautiful and immensely cunning. It's got good character development too.

While I said that Applied Cultural Anthropology is my favorite Slytherin Hermione fic, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn by Flye Autumne) is a fantastic fic where the whole trio lands in Slytherin. The author also releases chapters pretty regularly (they're on the second book of this series, White Knight).

linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower) is a fic where Harry loses his memory to Lockhart in 2nd year, and that has interesting consequences to the story.

linkao3(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) is good, even though it only goes through first year (there is an epilogue that details what happens after).
