I‘ve seen a few of these in the last months, but never completed or even over like 30k words. So are there actually stories around with that pairing? Because I think I‘d quite enjoy it. It's basically genderbent Harrymort without the weird age-gap and the father&daughter relationship could be very interesting, especially with Harry thrown into the mix.

Voldemorts daughter can be named Delphine, but please no post Hogwarts cursed child shenanigans.


** The first short in these one shots is that.

  This is just any and all 1 shots I may write. They are not intended to be brilliant or even good, they are just ideas that I may have. Some I may turn into stories in the future, others I may just write for the hell of it. These are just random ideas from my mind

  AU, 3 changes bring forth an uneasy peace between the Ministry and Voldemort based upon a marriage contract. Merope Gaunt's ghost reunited with a Tom Marvolo Riddle just out of Hogwarts, Delphini is born the same year as Draco, and Delphini attends Hogwarts for her sixth year. Harry's life is irrevocably altered. After all, Delphini always gets what she wants. Marriage Contract Fic

  At the age of seven, Harry Potter meets the new neighbors, including twin sisters his age. When he introduces himself, they recognize his name. Four years later, a very different Harry Potter takes the train to Hogwarts. See AN for more detailed information.
