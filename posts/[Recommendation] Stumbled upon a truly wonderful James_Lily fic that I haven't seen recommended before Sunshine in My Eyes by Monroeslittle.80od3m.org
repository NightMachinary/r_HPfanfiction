linkao3(sunshine in my eyes by monroeslittle)

Lily POV. You wouldn't know the focus is James/Lily from the summary but it is. The writing is excellent (though there are some spelling errors) and there is plenty of action, drama, heartache, and joy as the story progresses. It's complete at 7 chapters (be warned that the chapters are loooooong) and there is some sexual content. The same author wrote linkffn(just stay here tonight by monroeslittle) and linkffn(and the wolves all cry by monroeslittle) which are also both excellent, though for some reason the author has different fics on ffn.net vs. ao3.

If you like James/Lily I highly recommend it. I really enjoyed watching their relationship grow from different beginnings than in canon. Also McGonagall as a strict but doting auntie is delightful. :)


** monroeslittle is a treasure. Everything she writes is amazing.

  Mr. and Mrs. Evans are killed when Lily's only a girl, and she's supposed to go to a home with her sister. Instead, a relative they didn't know they had comes to collect them, and introduces Lily to manners, magic, and a life that's just the slightest bit different from the life she was supposed to live.Or, an AU in which Minerva McGonagall raises Lily.
