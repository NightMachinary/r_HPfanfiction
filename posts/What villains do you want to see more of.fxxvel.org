I'm curious - what types or interpretations of villains would people enjoy seeing more of in HP fanfiction?

Because, y'know, character interpretation isn't the most... consistent thing across the fandom, so we've got a wide variety to pick from. Five fics could have Voldemort as the villain, but each Voldemort could be completely different.

Ron could be a tactics villain (not Idiot!Ron, but still Villain!Ron), or Draco could be a Knight Templar type in removing Muggle influences in the sincere belief that they're all barbarism ([[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/knighttemplar]]), or MacNair could be a child murderer (a la Faery Heroes) or Voldemort could be wanting to remove the Aristocratic (fanon Noble Houses thing) Purebloods from power and decides to drag them down as their leader rather than use the less socio-economically powerful Muggleborns to rebel against them.

Personally, I want to see more Lawful Evil Altruists or Knight Templar types. People who believe they're doing something good, but use villainy methods to get there. That whole Handsome Jack-esque (Borderlands) "You've got to break it all down to build it back up" sort of mindset.

To give you some ideas - and I apologise in advance for the hours you'll lose linkhopping here - I've got the Villains page from TV Tropes, which lists every type of villain or characteristic of a villain they have. And they have a lot.

Villains Link - [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Villains]]

Fairy Heroes - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes]]


** Sympathetic villains who /genuinely/ think they're doing the right thing are always interesting to have in there, I agree - it makes it significantly more morally ambiguous.

Cause wise, the Harry Potter universe gives a /lot/ of opportunities there. Muggleborn or magical creature rights, economic inequality, seeming lack of punishment for the death eaters, etc - you can easily find something lacking with the universe, and make someone's cause a crusade to try to make that better - or alternatively, coming to the conclusion that it's all so rotten and corrupt that just breaking it down is necessary.

One other type that I'd enjoy seeing more of is international villains - whether that's at the national level or just individuals, but using more of the Wizarding World opens up a lot of other opportunities than simply focusing on the British community.

Overall though, I'm probably happy if the villain is competent, not an idiot, and at least has a plan/goal.

*** International as in non-British, or International like they operate across borders?

eg. Boris the Russian Hitman arrives in Britain and proceeds to hunt down BWL-supporters vs Magical Bratva agents loot Gringotts and steal the Cup Horcrux (Horcrupx?) then Harry has to chase them through Eastern Europe and their associated gang chapters and such?

**** Both, actually!

As it stands, basically every antagonist in the series seems tied to Britain - there's some in the backstory, like Gindelwald, that aren't necessarily, but in the main books (and most fanfics) that's not common. I think non-british actors doing their own thing that threatens multiple nations could be interesting, as can international agents being hired or joining up with someone opposed to Harry/our protagonist.

So the example you give would be a fun one to read, I think! But so would having another dark lord in another European country that has to be dealt with, or a faction of wizards from ____ joining up with Voldemort, or a pureblood coalition stretching across half the world as they try to make sure to keep their supremacy, or any number of other options.

** *Sympathetic villain:* more Barty Crouch Jr in stories and darker Sirius.

*Jerk/bully:* a James Potter that's not all that sorry even in his 30s and more Crouch Sr who loves his wife, hates his son, and has hypocritical opinions on the Dark Arts.

*Family values:* Malfoys/Blacks that love each other. Tired of abusive Lucius and weak Narcissa who secretly hates her husband, son, and sister.

*Arch-enemy:* more Sirius vs Snape or Harry vs Hermione that's not bashing one and wanking the other.

*Minions:* Dawlish doesn't getting much love as a bootlicker and Ministry antagonist. You see him do whatever Fudge says in OOTP and attacks Augusta Longbottom in DH.

I've always imagined Dolohov and Evan Rosier to be very nasty with a wand.

** I don't care who the villain is, but I want to see one who admits his own errors not only to himself but to his minions and to the hero, while also having the common sense to not gloat about his evil plan willy-nilly. For instance:

Hero walks in, says "We meet again, evil bastard. You really fucked up trying to kill me last time didn't you?"

Evil Bastard says "Yup."

Hero opens his mouth to taunt Evil bastard some more, hoping that evil Bastard will respond in kind. Unfortunately, Evil Bastard has learned from his mistake. Without another word, he just gets on with his next attempt to kill the Hero.

**** Wait, what? I must've unfocused the page at some point, because I can remember writing a lot more than that.

Alright. I'm very sick of Voldemort as a villain - he's good, but you can only warp the character so much before he breaks. He can be made more cruel and evil, as well as smarter, but you can't suddenly have him have feelings. His emotionless state is the backbone of how he was created. If you do a rational Voldemort, then he has to have second thoughts about Horcruxes, for instance. If you have him be able to feel love and empathy, then he needs a very morally ambigous dilemma-situation for all the shit he's done. He needs reason, if you make him reasonable.

But even with all that, you can't bend him too far. He can't be an anti-hero, or a politician, or a corporate mongul. That would be exceedingly strange. Tom Riddle could be these things, but at that point he would be an OC.

I guess what I'm saying is I want some more completely original villains. Ones that are in no way connected to either Voldemort, don't have his platform or his opinions and aren't related.

As an example:

"Ingrid Herrmann, a german witch who fought on Grindelwald's side of the war as an officer. She managed to scrape by at the end of the second world war because she was disgusted by the lengths he and Hitler went in the end, and served the forty years mandated by magical germany. However, she doesn't espouse his entire ideology. She believes that wizards are superior to muggles, and that they have to be ruled and monitored from the shadows to ensure something like WW2 doesn't happen ever again. She runs for magical chancellor in germany, wins, and slowly establishes a massive surveillance state that first monitors the muggle political sphere, then the scientific sphere, and then everything else. When she starts becoming active, "convincing" muggle scientists to abandon dangerous fields of study, manipulating the muggle Bundestag into abolishing their own attempts at surveillance, the surrounding countries begin feeling the shift in the winds."

"When the DoM conducts an experiment on the Archway of Death, attempting to redirect its destination somewhere else, they make a mistake. They cut the connection to the Underworld, correcting an absolutely massive magical imbalance that has wide repercussions (for instance, Dementors disappear). However, instead of closing, the portal still connects somewhere. They send through some probes, getting back paradoxical readings, until the portal suddenly stabilizes itself one day. A few moments afterwards, the first things come through. The department is quickly overrun, and the ministry taken, and the heroes of the story have to fight monsters that originate from between the dimensions, where nothing should exist, and yet still does. All of them are different, there are no mooks or minions to be mindlessly sliced through. Every single monster from beyond is unique, they have a wide, wide array of abilities, powers and such, but they are not unbeatable."

***** Eh. Short and sweet, I say. It did make me chuckle as well. :)

I mean, some would argue that corporate mogul and politician would be perfectly appropriate career choices for a remorseless psychopath (:D), but I see your point. After a certain level of change, you're no longer writing Voldemort as Rowling saw him, you're writing your own OC that you happen to have named Voldemort. Out of (slightly tangential) curiosity, since you used the word 'suddenly', would you feel better about him being any of those things you mentioned in your first paragraph if he grew into them over the course of the story?

I see what you mean about OC villains though. At this point, thirteen years after the last book and nine years after the last movie, it's probably about the time to get into some more original elements in HP fanfiction. Are there any particular kinds of villain you might like to see?

Those are both very interesting ideas for villains, incidentally. The latter kind of reminds me of The Arcanist's demons.

When he says to Voldemort that why don't use the blood of any man... if Voldemort would hear him, probably Dumbledore couldn't know if he had returned or not (not calling Snape), and the Triwizard Tournament has too many chances to fail (Voldemort's plan).

And... selling whom the more powerful one, it is a rational idea. (It is a bad one, to the long time, because Voldemort wants to kill too many people, including his own allies).
