So, my dad's in hospital for a little. I mention HP. Dad: Oh, yeah, I was talking about HP earlier. I said my son was going to uni this year, and these two med students asked what you were stufying. I said you were studying the arts, and that you write. They asked what you wrote, so I said Harry Potter fanfic. Me: Out of all the things I write, why would you tell them I write that? Dad: Because you make money off it. Me: ...... ?????

My dad doesn't quite get the distinction between fanfiction and original stuff that I sell, I don't think.

Do your family and friends know that you read or write fanfiction? Do they "get" it? Do they comically misunderstand everything?


** Only my boyfriend knows and he thought it was adorably nerdy at first, but now he's a very enthusiastic beta and nags me for updates. We read other fics, like Hogwarts Houses Divided together too, and today he mentioned he'd like to write Fallout fanfic. He says he won't, but I'm so close to converting him, I know he'll cave eventually.

** One friend knows, completely by accident, and I have sworn him to secrecy. No one else does, and I plan on keeping it that way.

** My father has forgotten about it at this point I think. My mother, however, was quite intrigued until she found that I read everything in English. Her English stops at "Hello, my name is...." so she can't really read them. We also found out that German fanfiction is an even more cancerous cesspool of bad writing than the English stuff.

Well, it got her to re-read HP at least.

My friends know about it and make fun about it. However, we're all a bunch of geeks and nerds so everyone got his little "cringey guilty pleasure" that is used liberally to make fun of him.

** They don't know it and they don't even like HP.

** Some of my family knows, but most only know that I write. My mom keeps telling me I should write something that I can sell instead.
