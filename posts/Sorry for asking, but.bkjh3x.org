are there really no good hetero fics that explore the potential of the various mind control devices?

I'll admit yeah, my first thought was smut-based: really going into how spells, potions, etc would affect the mind, and allow all sorts of perverted shenanigans is erotic as hell (think of "The Collar" by sinsub; but even politics and other things could be super interesting with this added dynamic.

It's sort of weakly acknowledged that there exists this mass of delicate and powerful tools to influence and control people, but then it's equally flimsily dismissed as irrelevant because it can easily be detected or some crap. If specific spells need specific counters, why are mind-altering potions and spells such a complete nonentity?

Anyway, anyone have any cool stories that explore this theme?


** If all you want is hetero mind control smut, literotica has plenty of it. Not with all your favorite HP characters, but I think it'll satisfy your lewd urges.

  Hermione has everything she could possibly want... Except a life. People are getting sick of her superior attitude, especially Draco Malfoy, who schemes to get her down, once and for all. And then there's the thing with The Bracelet... 7th year AR. COMPLETE SINCE 2009 XD
