So I've recently took a several month break from hpfanfiction to give time for some stories to maybe update and come back fresh into some stories I never finished. Anyhow I quickly found myself re-reading Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi. I love this story for several reasons and I know it's hard to find something close but I wanted to know if there any stories that come close in certain specific styles? I love an intelligent but not 'super genius without trying' Harry, I love a protective of his family Harry (doesn't have to be older but an older Harry seems to more likely be protective in stories), but also I really enjoy a morally grey character who makes real decisions that they may believe is right but can be flawed and have others question them. I apologise for the bad grammar and formatting by the way English is hard. If you can't think of any stories that fit this though, feel free to recommend me absolutely anything id be very happy to read it and explore more of the hpfanfic community! Have a great day, hope everyone is healthy and well.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

Even though the main character is not Harry but Ron instead, it features intelligent Slytherin morally-grey (as in not caring about love and compassion to enemy) Ron who decides to pick up the slack after having a vision of the future of Fred dying.

Even though he is very powerful for his age, doesn't go too far as to make him as powerful as Dumbledore or adult Aurors. And most importantly, no bashing! (Atleast, no more in later chapters)

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.
