I can't remember title or author but Harry ended up king or emperor, had kids and grand kids, and some of the order had fled to america. There was this thing about where Hermione once said said something about less horcruxes than there were, but Harry had already destroyed them and went sure, whatever instead of correcting her. Then Dumbledore decided riddle had possessed him and Ron and Hermione try invading to take him down bit kill his grandson or son instead. I read it ages ago but can't find it.

** Is this the one where, at the end, [[/spoiler][Harry kills Ron and Hermione's son right in front of her]]?
