Just Aurors doing their thing and investigating crimes, not necessarily connected to Voldemort or the canon plotline.


** "Sir, the hag saw the suspect drop a house on the victim at around 6 in the morning. Autopsy indicates that the victim died on the spot."

"Well it seems we have...

** A loud /pop/ reverberated through the foggy morning air. Alastor Moody, clad in standard issue Auror attire and a grizzled fur coat, scanned his surroundings with beady eyes, alert despite contending with dawn's early hours. He turned and nodded to a figure to his right, "Ollivander."

Ollivander, initially startled by Moody's sudden appearance, now peered at him owlishly, "Alastor. How nice to see you. Now what was it . . . ? 15 inches, blackthorn, dragon --"

"Yes, yes. Dragon heartstring," Moody cut him off, impatient. He reached into a coat pocket and withdrew a small scroll. "Says here you believe there was a break-in at the shop?" At Ollivander's sharp nod, he continued, "Hm. Dark incantations. Sounds of transfigurations. Animals?"

Ollivander nodded once more. "I was equally surprised."

Moody regarded him intently now, interest obvious in his voice, "Anything else you'd like to declare?"

"I have hence taken stock, and do not believe anything was taken."

Moody snorted derisively, "What's the point of breaking into Ollivander's if you aren't looking for a wand?" he stepped into the shop, pausing shortly to catalogue the devastation.

While the majority of the exterior remained as faded and sturdy as ever, Ollivander's shopwindow had been destroyed, splintered glass shards framing the scene. Blackened scorch marks threaded their way across the interior of the shop, leaping onto walls and shelves and meeting as insidious pockmarks on the ceiling. Contents from ransacked cabinets and showcases littered the floor, ornaments of the preceding chaos. Moody barely took a breath before tasting the remnants of dark magic in the air, toxic echoes of maledictions potent enough that they were sure to last for a while. He noticed a dark bob of hair peeking out from under the counter, and called out loudly. "Robards! Thickey! Reports."

Elena Thickey appeared from behind the counter and leapt over to stand at attention, soon joined by Gawain Robards, who had been lurking in Ollivander's precarious labyrinth of yet to be sold wands. "Sir," she began excitedly, already gesturing with her hands, "Appears to have been a duel of some sorts, at least two wizards to each party." She paused, considering, "Either that, or two overly enthusiastic casters. I'd reckon two dark wizards broke in through the window and met the defending parties at the counter." She gestured behind her at the chaos, "A fight broke out and they were turned away. They fled without leaving much trace, though." She finished glumly.

Moody nodded, mouth working as he envisioned the scene. "Lot of assumptions there. Robards?"

Gawain regarded him steadily, equally eager to impress, but decidedly more restrained. "Elena's right about the fight being here. Taste of dark magic isn't nearly as bad back there as in front. Most of the incendiary curses are contained to the area in front of the counter here," He gestured expansively with his wand. Pointing to the entrance, he continued. "But they did not break in through the window, the doorknob's melted off."

Elena coloured slightly as she and Moody regarded the door. "So it is," Moody acknowledged gruffly. "Spells? Any signs of motive?"

Elena started, seemingly unperturbed by her oversight. "I cast a few Reverse Spells around the room." She gestured to a pile of wood in the corner. "That used to be a shelf, Someone transfigured it into some kind of barbed wire and tried to restrain something." She kneeled close to the ground and motioned for the other two to do the same, "See these brown hairs on the ground?" She sat up, a befuddled brown creasing her otherwise animated face, "According to my Extrapolation Charm, they're from a stag."

Gawain interjected. "A stag? Are you sure they didn't transfigure the shelf into-"

"Nope," Elena shook her head obdurately, "I know my wandwork. There was a live stag here."

Moody had grown quiet, but now stood and faced the entrance, twirling one of the stag hairs between his fingers. He muttered under his breath, scowling staunchly. Both Elena and Gawain leaned forward ever so slightly, trying to catch what he was saying. They heard grouses of "knockety upstarts" and "Black and them" before rapidly adopting masks of keen attention as Moody turned to face them.

He barked out resolute orders, "Thickey, study everything here and log anything else you see that seems out of place. I want you to deliver your memory to me later, so don't miss anything or its your hide." She gulped, but noticeably brightened as he reluctantly added, "Good work."

Turning to Gawain, Moody continued, "Robards, take any further statements from Ollivander and then take statements from the surrounding shops and any willing witnesses. Then help him with cleaning up around here. Compile their reports and deliver an accurate summary of events to my desk later. Consult with Thickey if you need to. I want your eyes sharp and ears sharper."

Gawain nodded, only the slightest twinge of a nerve on his neck betraying his displeasure at the mundane duties. "And you, sir?" He asked tentatively.

Moody turned again, stepping out of the wreckage of the shop , eyes slowly sweeping the crowd that had begun to form outside. "Those dark wizards aren't going to be back." He admitted grudgingly, "They weren't discreet about it, but they got the job done."

At Elena and Gawain's visible confusion, his face twisted again and he raised his wand. "I'm going to go converse with a few young acquaintances of mine."
