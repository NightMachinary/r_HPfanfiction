So I've become obsessed with the Throne of Glass series. It's full of fae, witches (very different than HP witches), shapeshifters, demons and all kinds of creatures.

Are there any fanfics that involve a broader range of species? (I've read The Denarian Renegade, and a lot of vampire fics. But I haven't seen many that really explore other creatures and beings)

I don't really care about pairing (although I'm a sucker for a good Daphne Greengrass for some reason lol). I'm not a fan of H/HR but if you think the fic is good enough I'll read it. Don't care if it's slash or not. Harry/Snape kind of weirds me out a bit but again, if it's good enough I'll read it!

EDIT: I've also read the Miranda Flairgold fics which are amazing!

*** I will totally admit the first two books are a bit slower than the rest of the series but once it gets going its amazing! Funny yet dark. I really love how its this huge fantasy world yet it stays logical regarding the way people would react to situations. The writer does a fantastic job of creating new cultures and a new form of magic. It has great character development over the whole series.

It won't be everyone's cup of tea but I thoroughly enjoy it

**** 1. No author should ask their readers to get through bad books to get to the better ones.

2. Throne of Glass is neither funny nor dark.

3. The world of the first book is a few rooms, a dungeon, a hallway, a ballroom and some trees.

4. Celaena doesn't react to situations like a hardened assassin probably would, she reacts like a spoiled princess.

5. First book features no character development for anyone.

The author claims she wrote a book about an assassin fighting for her life in Fantasy Hunger Games, but she didn't. It's fine to write a different book, but market it as what it is - fluffy romance with a few other things in the background.

  Celaena is possibly the most unsympathetic MC I've ever read about. From the first pages I wanted her to die.

Have you ever read Prince of Thorns? Jorg is a dick.

****** The characters were dry in the 1st one, but their motivation and actions are explained throughout the series..... Including why she was an assassin at 18 and why she was so good...

******* It doesn't matter. "Please, read the next book even though the first one was garbage." So what if it's "explained". That's just one of many problems with /Throne of Glass/. I have no confidence that sequels will even deliver on the back-cover blurb premise when the first book didn't.
