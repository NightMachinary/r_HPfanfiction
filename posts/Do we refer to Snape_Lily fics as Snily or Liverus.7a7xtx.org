** Snily is the going term though I loathe it; for that ship I prefer LE/SS as those initials are fairly unique I think? But there is a place for ship names. For example, wolfstar is lovely as ship names go. And when you want to get into tropes and away from (romantic) shipping, I've found "severitus" a useful filter as I don't tend to like fic that labels itself that way.

*** I agree and disagree with you. I hate it when people say ship names when referring to people out loud, but it's quicker to google something like Snily fanfics than Severus X Lily fanfics. Uses less space in summaries.

**** I prefer name acronyms for pairings, except when multiple people share the same initials. Like if it said "HPxPP." Which PP is that? One of the Patils? Which one? Or is it Pansy Parkinson? Sometimes you can find out from summary context, like if it says "ravenclaw Harry" it's probably not going to be Harry x Parvati, likewise if it's HPxPPxPP, it probably isn't Padma and Pansy.

**** Perfectly valid point. Still hate them; just my personal hang up, I guess.

(I mean, it wouldn't stop me reading a fic if I saw it in a summary and I'm not gonna flame/downvote/hate on people that do use them or anything like that, but they do generate an irrational burst of anger whenever I see them.)

** If I could sway the fans of the pairing, I'd recommend Sevily or PrinceEvans. I suppose it'd be a matter of who domme'd who as to which to use.

I'm fond of 'The Government Stole My Toad' [NL/LL], but it doesn't really abbreviate anything.
