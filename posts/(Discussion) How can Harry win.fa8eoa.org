** While I do appreciate to read about epic duels (like the one between Voldemort and Dumbledore in canon), I have some troubles about the Magic is Might option.

While Harry is a rather gifted student (especially in Defense, and in survival I guess), Voldemort is supposed to be a genius, like the most talented student who went to Hogwarts since Dumbledore, if not beyond.\\
I'm pretty sure that, in a duel with Voldemort (without "Love Protection" or "Wand Ownership" powers used in canon) the only difference between canon Harry and one that training H24 during all his childhood is that the trained one will be murdered in 30 seconds rather than 10. Not to mention that the one that say that "Dumbledore should have trained Harry rather than letting him with the Dursley" seem to forget what a walking mess the protagonist would be if he had only trained to fight all his life (I imagine a young version of Moody even more trigger, or I guess wand happy who is expelled from Hogwarts during his 1st week after murdering his housemates because "They were probably Voldemort' spies").\\
I enjoy it when the might does not only come from training though (Time traveler Harry who truly had time to train, reincarnation of a founder or Merlin . . .).

As for a way to win :

6) Betrayal. Through some planing (either of Dumbledore of Harry), and the habit of Voldemort of abusing his followers, they (or at least some of them) decide to betray him. Voldemort takes a drink only to fall, poisoned. Several Death Eater simultanously raise their wands and try to take him one. May work or not but at least he is weakened enough for the good guys to finish the job.

As another person has already commented, Voldemort held his own, and even toyed with Dumbledore while his opponent wielded the elder wand. I think that we can draw some fairly obvious conclusions from this.

This is because there are two things that really bother me in the cannon and Fannon Dumbledore is considered Merlin reincarnated even though he is in his 12th decade and having worked in 2 full time jobs (I think they are) and one that is part time for some years and working to keep the world of politics to the side of the light and the second thing is that Voldemort is considered a Dark Lord more dangerous than Grindelwald.

I think that politically, he was less influential because he was solely focussed on Britain whereas Grindelwald afected all of Europe (and beyond?). In contrast, Vodlemort had more power in and of himself and probably could have surpassed Grindelwald in other resepects had Dumbledore taken as long to engage him as he did with Grindelwald.

***** Well, I think that it's pretty obvious that Voldemort/Tom Morvolo Riddle should have been a genius. He was already pretty sly and cunning at a young age since he was able to manipulate Slughorn and the Grey Lady into telling him pretty precious knowledge.\\
He was also the leader of a bunch of members of very old pureblood families that all of themselves to be the top of humanity. So my guess is that Voldy didn't only manage to get their loyalty by just sweet-talking, he must have shown them that he is a powerful leader. No weak, talentless goon like Fudge who can manage to look important and powerful, but is weak in reality can control a bunch of psychopaths that love torturing, rape, and killing in their free time.

Dumbledore was the only realistic opponent for Voldemort - in my opinion. Harry Potter shouldn't have had a chance at all. I mean he didn't know any strong spells besides the most basic ones that 90% of the population know about. Voldemort studied the Dark Arts all his life, an aspect of magic not only knows for being evil but also powerful. He loosing vs. Harry as he did in cannon was just silly.

However, most of the stuff in cannon was silly, it is a children's book after all and the author would have lost a lot of readers by making it overly complicated and realistic to satisfy the more mature audience.

Anyway, my point is that cannon Harry was way too weak. He shouldn't have been able to beat Voldy. Idk, but I feel that Voldemort had been dumbed down a lot. It was mentioned that Voldy was supposed to be one of the most terrifying dark lords in recent history. He had the knowledge, the power, followers, experience, immortality, but he was still beaten by a bunch of school kids... feels a bit cheap.

** 1. You are not alone, Harry. The power of love represents itself through his charisma with which he coordinates group of people more skilled than himself, and they all as a group defeat Tom Riddle & co. See linkffn(11916243) for an example.

Option 2. (super!Harry) I detest, because it runs straight into The Problem of Peter Pevensie. In the finale of the first book from The Chronicles of Narnia series, we should believe that thirteen year old (magically slightly grown older) boy defeated in the fair battle the mightiest of all witches of the superhuman size. It is barely possible to do it in the book, where the suspense of unbelief is more simple, but when they tried to make a film from the Narnia Chronicles, the result is a pure disaster: thirteen year old boy fighting adult warrioress just looks ridiculous, whatever film magic you apply (similarly, it turned impossible to make a good film Aslan ... whatever they tried he looks still like a overgrown plush toy). It usually leads to adding some completely non-canonical super!Magic making Harry into super!Harry with complete destruction of the character of HP universe. If you want to write the Marvel Universe fanfiction, you know where to find it.

** Why stick to just one factor?

Very few real events have a singular cause. Most come about through a combination of multiple contributing factors. Even in a battle that looks like one particular action brought victory or defeat, if you look you'll find that this outcome was only possible because of everything else that had happened to bring things to that point.

In a yet-to-be-published chapter of one of my fics, Harry wins through a combination of several factors: He trained hard (category 2) in a crossover element (category 4-ish), but also benefitted from prior experience due to the nature of his de-scarcruxing. Voldemort's hubris also played a major role; he started out the duel more focused on showiness and sadism, wasting a lot of magic and tiring himself out way more than necessary before he finally started to switch to less flashy but more efficient and practical spells and tactics. Even then, Harry was still slowly losing and only won by choosing to accept a probably-fatal hit in order to deal a killing blow in return.

Honestly, any or all factors/categories can work, but the key is to make the victory feel /earned./ Much of the objection to the canon version is that Harry really didn't win that final duel with Voldemort, he just provided an opportunity for the Deux ex Machina to do its thing. Nothing about Harry's character, abilities, or actions played any role in the final duel, save possibly indirectly.

The heroes' victory or villain's defeat should come about at least partly as a result of their traits and actions. Heroes win because of their bravery, determination, friendship, etc.; villains lose because of their cruelty, hubris, untrustworthiness, etc..

** I like a combination of "magic is might" and "deus ex machina".

That is: I want my protagonist to exhibit high competence, at least by the end of the story. This is a prerequisite of my respecting the character, and I will generally fail to identify with a protagonist who does not meet this requirement. The result of the protagonist's lack of competence is that (at best) I lose interest in the story or (at worst) I am actively rooting for the hero to lose because I feel like they do not deserve to win.

However, "magic is might" is not enough. This is for two reasons:

Firstly, it's not enough within the established elements of the HP story. Even if you write Harry as playing in the same magical genius ballpark as Dumbledore and Voldemort, you have two problems: (1) Voldemort has a lot more experience and (2) within the "magical genius" ballpark, Voldemort is said to be the top of the scale.

Secondly, it's not enough within the requirements of telling a satisfying story. "Harry was stronger so he won" is not the kind of ending which readers go away from feeling satisfied. There needs to be some element of the unexpected in the climax to a story, as well as the very real risk of loss.

This is why in TOHF I considered it so important to have Harry lose a duel to Voldemort, even with access to all of Dumbledore's magical abilities. I wanted to make it clear that (a) Voldemort was stronger than Dumbledore, so inheriting Dumbledore's abilities is not an instant win, (b) unless Harry introduces something new to the equation, he would likely lose the war.

The "something new" - the element which surprises the reader - can I suppose be referred to as "deus ex machina". I'm not too fond of using that phrase though, because it is associated with something coming out of nowhere. That is also unsatisfying. A satisfying surprise is one which is foreshadowed and in retrospect makes sense.

** Personally I quite like the idea behind how Voldemort is defeated in canon in theory. In so many ways, it is love and Tom's inability to understand it that defeats him. It is love that causes Narcissa to lie. It is love that motivates Snape. It is love for his friends and family that causes Harry to sacrifice himself. Etc etc.

But at the same time it is unsatisfying because Dumbledore's plan is bonkers. What if Harry had managed to kill Nagini at Godric's Hollow? How was Snape supposed to respond to Dumbledore's instructions? What if Ron didn't return on that particular day? What if Ron disarmed Malfoy? What if Harry was too late to get Snape's memories? Too many things fall into place conveniently for seemingly no reason other than the plot.

While I do enjoy the occasional Harry is a powerful mage kind of storyline that pits him against Voldemort, it is unrealistic to a fault. I do like stories where there is a lot of political maneuvering behind the scenes that helps defeat Voldemort's movement, even though even that is unrealistic considering the Ministry falls first. I guess what I prefer is something that keeps to the spirit of canon in that it is not the intelligence and power of Harry that defeats Tom but his ability to understand magics that Tom pays no attention to, like house elves, to be able to accept death rather than try to defeat it, to be able to love and be loved so deeply and things like that. But at the same time to also have the agency to do these things, not to be pulled like a puppet on others' strings.

I found the ending of Importance of Intent pretty satisfying for example.

** The description you give of 'Magic is might' is very tough to do in a satisfying way, I think - you need to have a good plot and writing ability to justify having Harry power up so quickly without feeling bad.

I prefer the approach of Harry being powerful/competent, but obviously not /as/ powerful as Voldemort and Dumbledore - and thus, having to rely on more than just himself. That is to say, instead of /just/ Harry crushing Voldemort, it would be Harry + his friends defeating Voldemort + his followers, and involving some sort of cleverer plot than just raw magical ability.

But more generally, it'll depend on the fic. One focused on relationships, romance, or humor doesn't need to have a great final showdown with Voldemort - loopholes, luck, or canon would work fine there, because it's not the focus of the story. One with Voldemort as the center of the main plot, however, does need a satisfying resolution. And although it's /possible/ to do that with super powerful Harry, I don't think it's the best default option.

Plus, epic magical battles are more fun if Harry isn't so powerful as to easily win, right?

  Loopholes. These are stories where Voldemort is "killed" by Harry, but really defeated by someone else to fulfill the requirements of the Prophecy.

That's fairly explicit in Harry not being the real one to defeat Voldemort.

I would say that Harry + his friends making a strategy that doesn't revolve around the prophecy - or executing one made by Dumbledore - would be Harry winning, even if he's not the only one facing down Voldemort in the end... or even if he weren't the main one to do so.

Eg, if Harry and his friends are tasked by Dumbledore to go deal with the last horcrux while Voldemort + Dumbledore are having a big flashy duel, Harry would still be defeating Voldemort by doing so, even if 90% of the real duelling/fighting against the dark wizard was being handled by Dumbledore.

**** It was mostly luck and plot armour that Voldemort was defeated. Voldemort acknowledges Lily's sacrifice at the graveyard as ancient magic and makes the point of touching Harry to prove it. Then he makes the tactical mistake of offering Harry to surrender, making the same mistake twice.

And even though Voldemort's spells lacked their usual potentcy, when Bellatrix died he was still able to blast McGonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn back. So when Harry starts his monologue all he had to do was pull out his Yew wand or summon Bellatrix's wand and start cutting people down. If Kingsley, McGonagall and Slughorn were still beaten despite Harry's sacrifice, then the rest of Hogwarts can be beaten too.

** 3/4. Just destroy his current body with a sniper, it will allow Harry to grow up and learn enough to finish the job.

Many people dismiss this as Mugglewanking, but there's nothing in canon that suggest Wizards have the skills to block supersonic projectiles, much less detect/react in time. We also know that creating a new body isn't easy, so keeping Voldemort as a wraith is a comparably easy way to keep the world safe.

*** With all due respect, isn't this boring? Putting aside muggles vs. wizards I think it cheapens the deaths of the first and second blood wars if a single sniper could kill Voldemort.

** I don't think the canon option would have worked, realistically. Or I suppose, you could keep the theme of Dumbledore maneuvering the entire country to subtly lead them to defeat Voldemort, but the way canon showed it? I doubt it would work.

Honestly, I think the most realistic and likeliest to succeed is the option of having adults that are more than incompetent idiots and/or comic relief, and they actually do what they are supposed to do while the kids are left out of it as much as possible. Including Harry.

In terms of personal preference, Im a sucker for a good fight too, I'd definitely pick option 2, magic is might.

** 5) Harry changes the rules of the game from what Voldemort is expecting. Usually via a magic system LV for some reason doesn't use, or by going for something else that he wouldn't.

Like HP and the Rune Stone Path, where it involves runes, polyamory, diplomacy, and a Crumple Horned Snorkack.

It's fun to see the extra systems develop.

** Loopholes are my favourites for sure. I remember a story with Voldemort being slowly slashed to pieces during a truly prepared battle, Harry was basicly baiting him during that and then Voldemort died by Harry's hand as in two most trusted people he called his right and left hands.

Also I would really like a mixed ending where horcruxes are really powerful device but only if you make only one. Voldemort would be basicly defeated by his own magic. Maybe you lose part of your power with each destroyed horcrux and then Harry duels a near squib Voldemort. Maybe you lose part of your power and it leads to a Death Eaters Civil war. Or maybe when horcruxes actually posses someone it just makes that person a new dark wizard but not exactly your ally. The last one would probably be a mix of Death Pride and DP&SW in that subject and I think I would love it.
