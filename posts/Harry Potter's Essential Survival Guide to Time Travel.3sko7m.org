Dear Temporally Displaced Harry Potter,

You've inexplicably jumped back in time. Oh No!

Fret not, for here is a no-nonsense, idiot-proof guide just for you!

Special Equipment

1. Cloak of Invisibility
2. Marauder's Map
3. Holly and Phoenix wand

Unique Locations

1. Room of Requirement (you led an insurrection here once, why not use it to scheme?)
2. Hogwarts' Kitchens
3. Gringotts
4. The various globe-spanning Potter properties

Essential NPCs

1. Hedwig
2. Dobby
3. Hermione (She knows her potions!... And will eventually figure you out)

Important Bits of Magic

1. Occulumency
2. Your kick arse Patronus
3. Expelliarmus

Things to See and Do (and Avoid!)

1. Save Padfoot
2. Do not look into twinkly eyes
3. Insist on a blood test at Gringotts'
4. Gingers aren't you friends (except the Twins, they're cool... And owe you money)

Optional Side-Quests

1.  Down the Rabbit Hole: see how far Dumbledork's manipulations go.
2.  Sticky-Fingered Gingers: you really shouldn't have let Molly have your vault key.
3.  Redemption of Snivellous: because he wanted to bugger your mum.
4.  She's the One: the bushy-haired genius edition. Kissing her automatically triggers the 'Sticky-Fingered Gingers' side-quest.
5.  Fucking Up the Time-Line: Luna knows, so why not just roll with it and go off script?
6.  Make Your Mother Cry: by starting your own harem!
7.  Phenomenal Cosmic Power: heed the call of the Deathly Hallows. Kissing Luna automatically triggers this side-quest.
8.  Grumpy Old Men: as an eleven year-old, your voice is essential in Parliament, so claim your ancestral seat on the Wizengamot.
9.  Marry, Fuck, Kill: because killing Dark Lords aren't enough. Why not seduce dear Bella, and see if your vault has any betrothal contracts? Also, French birds love it when clueless 14 year-olds ignore them. The French, am I right?
10. The Nasty in the Pasty: explore your Oedipus complex and find out just how much you love redheads.
11. Snog Everyone! : Because you'll never know who you're soul-bound to.
12. Forgotten Something?: Kill whats-its-face... Voldemort!

Congratulations, you're now on your way to a kick arse playthrough of: Harry Potter, Fate's Fool Edition.

If you get killed, never fear, that Horcrux wedged in your skull allows for unlimited playthroughs.

Enjoy,

Every Time-Travel Fic


** Don't forget your super special three core staffwood blood rune trunk that costs one trillion galleons that comes with time travel and portals and an internal space greater than Britain and several linker trunks for your harem.

I remember that fic. Didn't Harry start a female-only nudist colony with his wives in it? And the elder Potters were alive but in suspended animation?

**** Not quite.. I have several problems with linkffn(Not Normal). But there wasn't a nudist colony, just his multiple wives. And the trunk wasn't THAT big. In fact I still go back to that fix every now and again just to read the manor court chapters because those were amazing. In fact the only REAL complaint I honestly have with the story (and many like it). Is the whole "girl sex" thing. But then again.. I love harem\multi stories. Sometimes I'm just up for trashy fics.

  His life was never normal, then it becomes truly abnormal. He must save a world he never cared for, but with others ... he can care. H/Hr and maybe others. Rated M to be safe.

This... This is a bad thing?

Edit: I understand that time travel is an easy gimmick, but if you're going to use it then sticking to the same script is probably the worst thing I can imagine.

Also need help understanding how having (or knowing about) the Cloak, Map, Trunk and Room of Requirement and using them intelligently became a bad thing. Only thing I've got is that they're used often, but funnily enough there's a good reason for that.

How dare canon introduce useful things and then fic writers use them too? How dare they?!

Jesus.Fucking.Christ. Stay away from Worm fanfiction having competent characters might make you sad.

** As much as I hate to say it, most fics, not just Time-Travel fics, are just like this.

Plot is supposed to have a rising action, and characters are supposed to overcome challenges to achieve their final goal. So many fics just find some useful bit of magic or an item to overcome that challenge with no effort or plot. It's horrible writing.

** Well, there are really three types of time-travels:

1. Only the memories and powers are sent back, inhabiting a younger body (preferably first year). Limitation: no time travel before birth, cannot take equipment along

2. Time turner travel, with all its limitations such as not changing major events, no meeting your counterparts, and risks to space-time continuum.

3. Dimensional travel to a parallel universe that runs a certain amount of years behind. This is the most flexible form of 'time travel', since they can do anything they deem fit.
