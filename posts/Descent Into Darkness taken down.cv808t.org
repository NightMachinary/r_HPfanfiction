I went to look for Descent Into Darkness by Athey the other day on ff.net and the link didn't work. I'm assuming that it got taken down for some reason, as did Breeding Darkness (which was unfinished). Does anyone know why they got taken down? It's not really a problem for me because I had them downloaded, but I'm just confused as to why they got taken down. Anyone know the reason?


** Hey I was wondering if you could send me the downloaded fics, I sadly didn't have time to save them before she took them down.

** Was it one of their fics with sex scenes? If so, someone may have reported it and had it brought to the admins' attention.

By FFN's t&c, fics aren't supposed to have explicit sexual content, as the ratings only go up to M, unlike the NC-17 or E ratings on other sites like Ao3. (Or LJ pre-Russian buyout.) Since there are so many fics hosted on FFN, no one moderates the content except in individual cases where it's been reported.

*** Some basic googling shows that the author chose to take the fics down herself, not because someone reported them.

Author's note about it:

***** I suggest you take the time to educate yourself on how different fanfiction authors have handled their works in the past, what rights they have to their works, what entitlement you have (none), and the loose conventions of the fandom community which generally respects the authors enough to willingly abide by their wishes. This sub in particular has rule 6.

Now, let's look a little more at why your base instict to fling insults is completely out of line.

The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2328854/Athey?a=b][author's FFN profile]] shows that she is actually one of the more openly fair minded and generous writers in this fandom. She is fine with people adapting her ideas in whatever way they want without crediting her. She even gives permission for anyone to adopt her abandoned stories as long as they list her as the original author. Most fanfiction authors are more protective of their creations and wouldn't give such broad license for others to use and abuse.

The author specifically warned her fans that the stories were going to be taken down, thus giving them a grace period to save copies for themselves if they love the story. Most other authors tend to take their stories down without any warning at all. To be honest, the readers are not entitled to anything, but Athey shows more courtesy to her fans than most other authors give in similar circumstances.

In conclusion, you would do better to learn more about a situation before sticking your foot in your mouth, and you should endeavor not to repay freely given courtesy with unjustifiable vitriol.

****** I know what kind of person she is because i've read most of her work, and i still think it a dick move for her to explicitly forbid people from sharing her work.

A person who actually cared about the creative comunity wouldn't pull that kind of move.

** If anyone has a copy they could send me that would be amazing! This last year was my graduating semester, followed by a move, and then job hunting so I completely missed her warning about taking it down. If you can help I'd really appreciate it!

** There might have been one, but I don't think they ever had full on sex. I can't believe someone got so triggered over a small slashy scene that they decided to report it :((((. That really sucks.
