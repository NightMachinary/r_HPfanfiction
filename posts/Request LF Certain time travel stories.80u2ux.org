Looking for certain time travel stories where either Harry or another character other than Harry ends up in the past, changes things to the point many of the future information would be useless/worthless, and tries to do damage control but fails.

So many stories has either the character going back in time and not doing anything to change things, or changing things and no problem arises from the changes. If Harry or another character goes in time I'd still like for it to be set in the Golden Trio Era, I'd also like it if Harry or other character only tells a few people, not everyone he knows and trusts, or maybe even no one that they are from the future.

I'd also appreciate it if they knew things, but didn't know everything. Say Harry from fifth or sixth year ends up in first or second, that would work because he would know things, but not everything. (And note that was just a suggestion, doesn't have to be set in those years).

That would make it interesting imo.

No Harry/Hermione and no Draco/Hermione but any other pairing is fine.

And as I said anyone can go to the past, not just Harry.

Any rating, would like for it to be completed, but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Doesn't have to have all of these things I posted, can be a variety.


** maybe you would like linkffn(6728900) where there are multiple time travellers who try to hide it

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

** Maybe try linkffn(the many deaths of Harry potter) not exactly what you asked for...

Every time he dies he gets transported some time back a tries to do things differently. Not always successfully.
