The Magical Britain community is small, we all know that by now. The entire nation is made up of (at best, with very generous number fudging) 10,000 humans of all ages from 0 to 100 (/Note 1/). It is essentially a small town, rather like the one I grew up in. Yes my school population was about the size of movie Hogwarts, though well padded-out with students from neighbouring communities, and we soon found (to much youthful consternation) that most everyone's parents knew each other.

In such a small town, there's actually very little in the way of organisation. Despite its grandiose name, the Ministry of Magic ought to be more like a Town Council, which in our case was highly informal. We didn't so much have a police station, as a police /cottage/. Ditto the clinic, fire station, etc. People tended to be known as Brown the Baker, Smith the Grocer, Mike the Mechanic, Stan the Other Grocer, etc. (Drama was when so-and-so ticked off Smith and decided to shop at Stan's instead... /Note 2/)

So it irks me, just a little, /just a little/, when I read post-DH/Epilogue fics where Harry and co. are all at the Ministry, and they act like it's a massive bustling government bureaucracy, of the kind that deals with tens of millions of people, and they hardly know anybody in it, even after spending some time there. Alright, so I know the MoM does have to deal with a lot more functions, has lots more geographical area to cover, and should have more people. Fine. That doesn't mean key staff ought to be totally unknown. There should be lots more bumping into familiar faces, and lots /less/ bureaucracy, because nobody has that much time for paperwork when dealing with a maximum of 10,000 chaps at most.

Anyway. That's just my pet peeve related to fanfic writers not really /getting/ HP's population size. *What's yours?*

/Note 1/: Based on annual cohort at Hogwarts of 40 x 2 (giving allowances for the 1st war) x 100 years average life expectancy = 8,000, plus say a generous population of 2,000 "foreigners".

/Note 2/: This seems to imply the Wizarding Wars is more like what if the local gang of ne'er-do-wells and dopeheads invaded the Town Council and extorted shopkeepers for money and so on, but with more stabbings...


** The simple answer to all this is that Rowling either put a very low premium on consistency or was terrible at it. I've read statements by her to the effect that the population of Wizarding Britain was about 3,500 (fewer than the /neighborhood/ I live in!), and that she sucks at math.

​

As for the sheer size of the Ministry and its bureaucracy, well, the whole of Wizarding Britain might fit into a small to middling town (depending on how you world build it), with magical transportation blunting the effect of physical distance, *but* it consists of people who can do magic and base much of their identity in that fact, with the added burden of having to preserve the Statute of Secrecy.

Magic is a Big Deal, by the way. Living in a small town where "everyone knows everyone" breeds conformity and an aversion to high drama, but having supernatural powers encourages nonconformity and risk-taking. How much more unruly would /you/ be, if you had powers like teleportation, conjuration (however limited), combat power roughly equivalent to modern man-portable firearms up to RPGs (minus the long range), invisibility on demand (clothes included), *mind control,* etc.?

The Ministry must therefore spend orders of magnitude more resources to control and govern this government's nightmare of a population, including creating a lot of jobs, many of which may be sinecures most or all of the time (This might even be partially if not mostly funded by the unaware Muggle taxpayer: if the Wizarding bureaucracy numbers no more than a few thousands, it would be a small item in the British national budget, and easy to hide).

It is now fashionable to be anti-Christian, because most teenage readers/writers of fanfiction somehow live with a weird idea that the establishment is pro-Christian and they can be edgy and anti-establishment if they are anti-Christian. Nothing can be further from truth, but I am afraid I won't be able to change the worldwide fashion to be sensible. Fashions usually are not.

I might have thought like that as a kid as an elder millennial who grew up listening to grunge or whatever, but in the end moved away from the Christianity of my parents because of its colonialist/genocidal history, which a lot of millennial, gen y and gen z kids care very much about.

And the only information he acts gets from Neville wasn't even from Neville. He accidentally found out through other means.

Other than Ron and Hermione, Harry doesn't really go out of his way to actually bond with anyone else.

** I don't understand how there can exist the class of the poor and the rich when everyone has magic. How do the rich acquire their wealth and what does this wealth consist of exactly? Obviously, there should be some mechanisms at place that prevent the poor to become equal to the rich. I also suspect that there are families so underprivileged that they can't even afford for their kids to go to Hogwarts. Basically, it irks me that there's no realistic explanation of how the economy of the wizarding world functions. But at the same time it's not surprising, because in canon we see everything mostly though Harry's eyes, and he doesn't bother with figuring this out.

*** Ah, economics. Well, TLDR version, the true underclass would be Squibs who are no better than Muggles and so don't have access to advanced magical farming spells.

Otherwise at nearly the bottom you have the like of the Weasleys who probably had roots as magical subsistence farmers before Mr Weasley got a "City job". With magic farming must be extremely easy. That settles basic needs.

What keeps working class wizards down however would not be food or even education - Hogwarts has scholarships and is extensively funded. It would be expenditures on magical necessities such as Floo powder, wands, potion ingredients, Doxy spray, etc. Basically wizards enjoy a certain better quality of life compared to muggles, never truly starvation poor and with better life expectancy, but they have magical problems to deal with as well, creating a natural magical economy and socio-economic strata that should be little different from ours.

It would be interesting to go into all this in detail but I suspect it would be quite boring to most people, lol.

**** I assume that very, very few wizards or witches are competent enough to be self-sufficient (almost none seem to be able to cast a Shield Charm in canon, and that's on the OWLs). The vast majority of them can cast a few spells, no more, and so need the services of other wizards and witches.

Perhaps combat magic is as rare as combat skills are IRL. Even Hogwarts did not actually teach much combat magic - Umbridge stepped in at the first sign that the curriculum was veering off from its Dark-animal-centric focus. I suspect Snape might have been toughening up the student population in Harry's 6th year, on Dumbledore's orders, in his own terrible way.

Given the ease of farming and multiplication charms I reckon nobody magical actually starves, food and basic basket of goods surplus capacity must be insane. Even if many wizards are incapable (which I don't personally think so), all you need is a dozen capable wizards at the Ministry, and that's sorted.

Magical plagues is the one problem that could seriously affect magical quality of life. The major international trade goods of the Wizarding world must I think be medical potions ingredients and personal spell services...

***** Well I think that Defense Against Dark Arts is mostly a theoretical subject. Students know how to identify some curses and dark creatures and some small defensive spells to facilitate your escape are taught. The main point is conflict resolution as shown by the fact that the only major offensive spell up until book 4 is the Disarming Spell, that is taught during the Dueling Club, and the Patronus, which is taught to Harry in private.

All the offensive spells, as well as the shield charm, used in later books are self-taught by Harry in preparation for third task. He later teaches these spells to the DA. Later on, Snape, takes a more practical approach teaching students how to duel, but they are in the middle of a war. So I think the average witch or wizard is not very good at dueling, unless they complete their Auror training or are competitive duelists.

** I would agree, but JKR made it at least a large bureaucracy. They have a 10 floor office building, and at least some of the departments are in shift work.

There's 40 people in Harry's year, but a few hundred people in Slythering according to one of the quidditch descriptions.

There's a full professional quidditch league in Britain, and multiple leagues worldwide.

Andorra has it's own MoM. How?

Not remotely consistent with a pop of <30k for Britain, and a few hundred thousand world wide. Not that she seems to be consistent in numbers in interviews either. JKR is terrible at math and the hard parts of World Building. She also doesn't seem to track any of that from one book to the next.

** Do we know that? I guess if you go with the assumption that Hogwarts is the only school then your numbers make sense. I also just find that so amusing because they're all like thinking they're so significant in the world and it's like you're a culty, violent clique at most, lmao. It's like that feeling in doctor who where they'd build up this massive story line and the final battle is between like twenty people.

I have seen a few different fanfics that have Hogwarts as being more of a dying elitist institution with a lot of other schools and things spread throughout the UK. As much as I hate that grooming fic, dodging prison and stealing witches has the structure I've sort of embraced in my own head cannon (I had already thought it but that author fleshed it out way better than I had) with a population of wix that are rural and hidden, and don't really get involved with Diagon alley or the ministry or Hogwarts, or even schooling at all. then you have the working class who are a bit more tradespeople and go to school in a shoe or whatever, and then the middle class who work in the lower rungs at the ministry, and then the Hogwarts set, the lowest of whom are the Weasleys

The idea that the wars have destroyed the population is also valid though. I was struck at the size of the ministry in the fantastic beasts movie because there's no way the ministry for the population in Harry Potter would use that much space

Even so though, I definitely don't think there would be more than a million people in magical Britain. It would populate m a large town at most, you're totally right.

To answer your question, a lot of my biggest peeves are based on the movies, so I can't even blame the ff authors so much as I hate the aesthetic that the movies brought in.

I suppose a big peeve is the weird way people like Arthur Weasley think about muggles when seriously you live in the world and use a telephone to get into the ministry, why would you call it a ‘felletone?' Like there seems to be this massive discrepancy between the way they actually manage to hide themselves from the Muggle world, and then the canon behaviour where they act like fools and wear nighties

And the biggest one is the way that they go about being Victorian when they separated during the medieval era. So so annoying. Why would the Muggle-hating Blacks have gaslights in their house? It makes no sense!

With things like the Express I have decided that Queen Victoria really was such a bossy pants that she would be like ‘oh there's a secret magical world, is there? Better boss them around as much as the Muggle population. They obviously need a train', but the Black family having post-industrial-revolution decor is very strange to me (other than oooooooh creepy aestheticccccccs)

** I've estimated the total population of wizarding Britain to be a bit larger, about 15,000. However, that calculation is based on the 200 Slytherins cheering their team at the end of PoA. It's likely that in that very year the school-aged population of Britain was at an all-time low because of the war. Taking that into account, the total population might well be twice as large. But I agree with your point. That's too small a population to need as much bureaucracy as JKR showed the Ministry to have.

One thing that I've grown to dislike is the habit of shoehorning paganistic traditions and elements into the wizarding world as an inconsequencial type of worldbuilding that ends up having nothing to do with anything. I'm OK with it if it's done well and really adds something to the story. But usually it seems to be just a few mentions here and there as if paganism is a canon element of the wizarding world in the same way as blood purism.

Does the Harry Potter fandom attract people who have some grudge against Christianity? However, many things in the Harry Potter books (I don't care about any other material) suggest that British witches and wizards are just as Christian as their Muggle neighbours.

1. They celebrate Christian holidays such as Easter, Hallowe'en and Christmas, and at least the Christmas song Sirius sang in 1995 mentions God.

2. One of the Hogwarts ghosts was a friar in life.

3. At least in Godric's Hollow wizards and Muggles share a graveyard that is located next to a church.

4. Phrases "my God", "thank God" and "for God's sake" are being used quite commonly by wizard-raised people such as Ron, Mrs Weasley, Lupin, Malfoy and Fudge.

5. The mainstream ethics of wizarding Britain doesn't seem to have any significant difference to that of Muggle Britain, and the mainstream ethics of Muggle Britain is based on Christianity.

There is absolutely no evidence about wizards being pagans or atheists. Clearly JKR intended wizards to be Christians, but decided not to tell it explicitly because it would have caused controversy without adding anything to the story.

Does anyone know why it is so common in Harry Potter fanfics to change this part of the canon?

Ah I see. Well, HP has wide appeal, I won't judge. I agree too that HP is based on very traditional British literature foundations, which owing to the nation's history and general makeup are generally Christian in nature.
