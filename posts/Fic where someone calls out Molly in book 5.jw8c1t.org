Specifically for that argument she has with Sirius. Like come on holding his forced imprisonment against him ? Cmon Molly that way too mean. I just would like seeing someone more openly have his back there. Preferably one of the adults like maybe Remus. Doesn't have to be a bashing fic just needs that scene.

No oc ships or incest

slash ships are fine

  Set after GoF. Harry is fed up of being used as a pawn and now he's broken free. be warned wizarding world because the new Harry is cooler, more confident and will wreak havoc on those who get in his way. Snape bashing, initial Dumbledore bashing but Dumbledore redemption arc. Harry/Katie Bell.

** Reclaiming the House of Black is a good one. The Molly call-out happens in chapter 2 and 3. I should note that later Harry and Ron call out Hermione too in chapter 6.

** Okay, it's been a while since I've read the books, so sorry if I remember this wrong, but wasn't Molly essentially right? I'm thinking about the scene where she said that Sirius doesn't really know what's best for Harry... which I somewhat agree with.

Don't get me wrong, Sirius did nothing wrong, he was thrown in prison unjustly and had a general shitty life. But that doesn't change the fact that he spent over a decade in "the worst place on Earth". He wasn't completely sane from the experience IMO. He had the tendency to mistake Harry for James. Like it or not, Sirius isn't exactly someone I'd trust to raise a child.

*** Molly was wrong in my opinion, Molly doesn't know what is best for Harry. Harry needed to know what was going on. just like in POA when Sirius was apparently out to kill him, keeping Harry in the dark was a mistake.

Sick of seeing people says Sirius mistakes Harry for James. Sirius never mistakes Harry for James in the book he always sees Harry as his Godson that's a movie only thing.

The line "Nice one James" ruined the order of the phoenix movie

Molly wanted to keep Harry safe but she was doing the opposite, not telling someone about dangers related to them doesn't just suddenly make the dangers disappear or non existent.
