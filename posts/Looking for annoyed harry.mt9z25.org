Looking for Harry thats annoyed with how everything is going and strikes out on his own or with 1 other person to go fix it all.

preferably overpowered harry but thats not a requirement.

if he doesn't strike out on his own atleast have him do something about the annoyance.

everything from oneshots to millions of words is fine

If in doubt please send it :)

I thought it was brilliant and he's definitely dark and annoyed!
