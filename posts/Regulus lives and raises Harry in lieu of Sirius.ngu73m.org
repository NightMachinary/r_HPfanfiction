** I don't think I've seen this eventuality, and I'm intrigued by the still publicly a death eater side of it

I'm in the midst of writing a few different regulus as god-uncle stories, but not this one

*** There are a few regulus raises Harry stories but one has a gross soul bond against someone's consent in it, and most of the others are unfinished

There is a lovely little Harry stumbled on regulus in his childhood by lullabyknell and it's worth reading, he's less public death eater and more hidden from literally everyone though. That seems to be what everyone thinks he'd do if he survived linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24500287/chapters/59141077]])

and there's a few Professor black stories too, but not so many complete daddy black stories, which is a shame.

I really like your idea!

  Pre-Canon AU: On the street named Privet Drive, in Little Whinging, Surrey, a man lived alone at Number Eight, supposedly. It was apparently difficult to tell.

**** Sure! The only one that's being posted at the moment is a Professor black one, but he's working on adopting Harry, he's just talking a while to get there as he keeps stumbling on other problems to fix first linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18335585/chapters/43406147]]) it's still ongoing. It's been a while since I posted, because I realised something needs to happen in between what I had written, which always slows things down, and is very irritating lmao
