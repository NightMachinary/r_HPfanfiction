** Yeah, Dumbledore is manipulative, but not for anything you said.

Parading Harry in front of Slughorn. Lying to Snape about Harry being a pig for slaughter. (Rightfully) taking advantage of a grieving Snape. There's more, but I can't think of them off the top of my head.

** I actually do think Dumbledore is manipulative (though not evil), but I don't think any of your examples indicate as much.

/Molly Weasley yelling in muggle London at 9 & 3/4,/

Molly was trying to handle five kids, two of whom were notorious troublemakers, one of whom was about to go to boarding school for the first time, and one of whom was crushed to suddenly be the only sibling of seven left behind. She was either too frazzled/emotional to remember or (my interpretation) was asking a question to make Ginny feel important/included. Both of these explanations are far more likely than an elaborate scheme by Dumbledore, since there's no indication that Dumbledore and the Weasleys were tight at this point in time. Molly/Arthur weren't even Order members the first time around. When you hear hoofprints, think horses, not zebras.

/not being able to grant Sirius a trial when he was Chief Warlock, or at least meet up with Amelia Bones to have her setup one/

He might have been able to, but why? He testified that Sirius was the secret-keeper, because Sirius/James/Lily told him that Sirius was the secret-keeper! And there were multiple eye witnesses who saw/heard Peter screaming that Sirius betrayed the Potters! And there was Peter's finger. And instead of speaking in his own defense, Sirius laughed.

People were being thrown in prison left and right without trials. Why would Dumbledore intercede for one who was so clearly guilty, especially when he had a million other things to do to?

/not letting other werewolves go besides Remus./

Very few people are bitten by werewolves.

A subset of those bitten are wizards.

A subset of wizards bitten are children.

A subset of wizard children who are bitten live through the experience.

A subset of children who survive the infection are kept by their parents and educated (others are abandoned to Greyback, or worse).

Of that tiny group of children, how many are likely to have the academic chops to keep up with their class while missing a few days of class every months (and feeling miserable for a few more days)? Oh, and on top of that, they need to have the temperament to hide their very visible illness.

Remus was the only one because Remus was unique.

*** Ahh see this I understand, except the Sirius situation was for third year. Also, why didn't Molly ever floo? I mean I doubt that there wasn't a foo spot seeing as Lucius Malfoy, and others of a similar mind would hate to interact with muggles.

**** What would be the point of giving Sirius a trial in third year? They had literally no evidence of his innocence. The most likely result is that he would be found guilty and kissed by a dementor for escaping Azkaban.

*** Definitely not these. You can find it with him grooming (per his and Snape's words and actions) Harry to get "killed" by Voldemort.

Or getting two children to save a man instead of him.

Or being a headmaster.

Or guilting Snape into being a spy.

Quite a bit of it was good, but Dumbledore's mistakes were from assuming he was right. The Dursleys, while not fanon abusive, would have cut out that behavior with any sort of visit.

The lack of trials by Bartemius Crouch should have been approached.

There's nothing in the text to suggest Dumbledore had the political power to approach BCS about anything. In fact, in GOF he's sitting in the stands with Moody while Barty was doing the questioning. Dumbledore was very popular, sure, but Barty was the leading hero of that war.

******* It might be an unpopular opinion, but Rowling made the best Harry Potter fiction.

No fanfiction compares.

It's why Cursed Child is so unpopular. The writer pretty much took his direction.

As a whole I honestly think there's only a few things the books could have done to improve themselves. Hermione should have been held responsible by the narrative. Harry shouldn't have been so lazy. I love my symbolism and I would have liked a Harry/Tom relationship similar to what Ender/Peter had in the ender's game.

*** I'm notice seeing malice, more as just him setting up situations. Also, pure-blood bigots would hate mingling with muggles so it's pretty reasonable for there to be a floo point. Molly might be busy, but she's being loud in the middle of the platform which has everyday muggles. Also, she's been there pretty dang often and seemed to remember when Harry asked where it was. Even if she didn't remember, the twins and Percy no doubt would've.

I'm talking about Dumbledore during third year, in which case I wouldn't be surprised if he sprung an emergency meeting, and said that since he didn't have a trial, he was required one. And yeah that werewolf one is a bit of a stretch, but not too far of one considering Greyback was active then. It's whether or not these were setup, or just a strange occurrence is what the discussion is about.

**** Dumbledore holding a position as Chief Warlock doesn't mean that he has the political power to support it. We know that Fudge can 'dethrone' Dumbledore quite easily in OoTP, I don't think this will happen if Dumbledore has a loyal political support at the time. Also, as [[/u/SuspiciousPaint1][u/SuspiciousPaint1]] pointed out Dumbledore has no evidence that Sirius is innocent after PoA. It will be hard for him to push the issue.

***** Yeah, but I'm more or less wondering how many of his supporters were sheep who went with the flow. Also, it probably helped that he was being called insane and delusional. I figured something along the lines of a 'hey, this guy didn't get a trial' and lo and behold what do you know.

** - Is there canonical (books & films) evidence he actually WAS the Chief Warlock in 1981?
- I don't think there is any evidence for the /intentional/ grooming of Harry. He didn't know about exact conditions of Harry's upbringing (we really don't know what Mrs. Figg reported) and even if he was suspicious that it was less than ideal, it was better if Harry was alive.

** Yes. I Mean,His protection of the Philosopher's Stone was breached by three 1st years two of which didn't even know of magic until less than a year earlier. His final protection was the mirror which wasn't even in place until he had the stone for over three months and left it out for harry to find.... as well as gave Harry the very device that would get him there. Dumbledore has been pulling strings for the longest time.

Someone else mentioned Sirius Black. It doesn't matter if Dumbledore thought Sirius was the secret keeper or not,he still has to be brought to trial! Bellatrix LeStrange GOT A TRIAL! The Dark Lord's favorite woman gets her day in court but the man Dumbledore knew personally doesn't even get a second look? It's almost like he's an acceptable loss if it let's the headmaster control Harry's life.

** On the point about Sirius...

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I'm sure he wanted to, but unfortunately it would have been career suicide for him to do so, and probably wouldn't have helped Sirius at all.

First off, we have Sirius, a man who everyone believes betrayed the Potters to Voldemort, killed Peter Pettigrew and a dozen muggles, went crazy in Azkaban and escaped, and has been trying to kill Harry Potter for an entire year. We, the audience, know this isn't true, but for the entire wizarding world it is. For Dumbledore to request a trial, or suggest Sirius is innocent, would ruin his reputation.

Secondly, how would Sirius win his trial? He has no evidence. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Veritaserum#Limitations][Veritaserum can be resisted]] and is thus inadmissable at trial. I doubt pensieves are allowed in trials either as we know memories can faked. Slughorn might have done a sloppy job with his, but who's to say a more competent wizard couldn't make a perfect fake? He has no physical evidence that Peter Pettigrew is alive. There are only four eye-witnesses: three kids who are known rule-breakers and mischief-makers, and one adult, who was Sirius' bestfriend at school and is a werewolf. Their testimonies would be worthless to the Wizengamot.

Sirius getting a trial after book 3 wouldn't change anything except by making the public dislike Dumbledore a year earlier.

*** Sirius Black is also a member of the sacred 28. We all know Dumbledore has a way with words.... point that out to the old pure-bloods that this case sets a precedent and Sirius gets a trial in 1981. Whether he wins is up for debate but he has a chance at least.
