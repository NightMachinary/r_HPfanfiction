** It's been banned by [[/u/Denarii]] ages ago. No one cares about it now.

*** What do you mean by banned? Also, I've been making a Fallout 4 mod that mocks that terrible fic and his cult.

**** It's not actually banned, it's just a long-standing joke for us to ask Deenarii to ban it. He always says no.

That said, yes it's bad, yes most people don't like it. We've been over this topic enough that most of us just prefer to forget it exists.

***** Bro, you're better than that. Banning something bad from your site won't destroy it. Besides, you're not feminists.

And pretending the bad thing doesn't exist won't help, either.

Only through mockery, memes, and spreading the word shall the scourge of cultism be eradicated! Mockery helped to convince people it was okay to hate hitler, you know.

Also, I've finished that Fallout 4 mod. It's sweet, not too OP, and pretty damn cool.

**** Probably because it was really badly written. The guy turned Harry into his Mary Sue Author Avatar, then had events conspire to give Hermione a choice: Get sent to Azkaban for a crime she didn't commit, or make an Unbreakable Vow to serve Harryzer as his slave. Also she didn't even get to make that choice, frakin McGonagall (The last person who would be up for this) rushed over to ask "Do you trust me?" or whatever and then make her make the vow without her knowing what she was doing. Right after hyping it up as "A friendly rivalry between intellectuals" despite the bitchy narration constantly insisting "Hermione has book smarts, Elizer has true smarts!", the manchild's titanic ego refuses to allow even that.

Also, the prose reads like a children's novel, and frequently preaches the virtues of Elizer's Rationalist Cult.
