*Synopsis:* The Dark Lord's defeat left Bellatrix's world shattered and broken, on the run from the retributive Ministry of Magic, she hides where one would least expect it: the Muggle World. From here she plots a revenge so powerful it will shake the Wizarding World to its core.

*Note:* I've been trying to get back to writing in a big way and felt that the best way to stretch out the creative muscles is to do something fun and explore the Potterverse once again.

First time writing fanfiction of any kind. Would love to hear what you all think of this humble piece of AU.


** So to preface my criticism you should know I started reading this very late at night.

It's competent/good. It's certainly not bad but it's not great either.

There didn't seem to be an glaring mistakes in the first two chapters, but something about it didn't really grab me. The concept is interesting, though Bella seems to contradict herself by hiding. That's fine, your Bella is different to the one in the book, but if she is going to go into hiding, she cant very well criticize Narcissa for doing the same thing

If you removed her criticism of Narcissa and worked on Bella's motivation a bit more I feel the first chapter would work better.

Some of the formatting is a bit off and there are grammatical mistakes as well. The chapters are also very short. This I admit is personal preference.

For me the foundation is there for a good story but it needs a few more revisions to truly make use of such an interesting premise.

*** Thank you for your thoughts.

To correct you, Bellatrix is criticizing the fact that Lucius has disavowed the Death Eaters. My Bellatrix basically ran away from the raid in which the Lestrange brothers were arrested but she managed to get away. I will be building up on that in coming installments. But there is a fundamental difference in the motivations of both Lucius and Bellatrix and how they reacted to the Fall.

FanFiction formatting I don't know how to do properly, I'm learning. In my experience, chapters that are too long often times, in fanfiction, tend to veer off into the territory of redundancy. Though of course, length is entirely subjective.

What would make it great in your eyes? What's missing?

**** Ha, if I only knew how to make something great. I haven't articulated this before but here's what I think.

Let's look at the very first line of HP ever.

#+begin_quote
  /Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much./
#+end_quote

I think that is great writing. It's dense. It's layered. If you found someone who had never heard of HP and got them to read just that opening line, I think the could make some rather accurate deductions about the Dursleys.

You get a sense of pride and normalcy from the use of "/Mr and Mrs Dursley/" instead of "/Vernon and Petunia Dursley, of number..../" There is also a distance there, a formality to it. Immediately you get the impression of strained propriety.

The next fragments is "/of number four, privite drive/" which says all sorts of things about how house proud they are and again we have that formal mode of address. It's not, "/Mr and Mrs Dursley, who lived in a cosy house on Private Drive.../" No it's numbers and facts. It's dry, unsentimental. There is also a hint that they identify with where they live. The Burrow reflects the Weasleys, Mr and Mrs Dursley reflect their house. They define themselves through there possessions and status.

Moving on; "/were proud to say that they were perfectly normal/" What kind of person is proud of that? Who prizes being generic? Conformist and social climbers is who.

But it's an odd statement to make. Why would people consciously prize this? There is a question asked of the reader in that moment. The Dursley's draw a line in the sand and without realising it, we the audience, are thinking about what might be "*/abnormal/*?

When you ask the audience a question, you generate suspense which is great for drawing the reader deeper into your story.

Finally we arrive at "/...thank you very much./" To me this just screams affronted pride and posturing. JKR might as well have writen, "/how dare you even ask me that!/" Again it reinforces the notion that Mr and Mrs Dursley are social climbers. It very quietly sets the stakes too. You know that something is going to come along and disrupt this, you just have to keep reading to find out.

Then look at how every section works in harmony to make the whole structure more impactful, more informative. I would bet good money most readers develop an instinctual dislike of the Dursley's from just that one sentence.

That is great writing.

You must wring the story from the words you use at every opportunity. You must tease and inform the reader with every paragraph.

I attempt to do this in my own fic:

#+begin_quote
  "/Deep in the heart of Hogwarts, below a certain third floor corridor, past several rooms of defences stood The Mirror/"
#+end_quote

How did I do?

*** It's actually pretty deliberate. A bit of light-hearted fun, not meant to be offensive. It does tend to stand out though, so I thought why not?

***** No. I just felt it was a silly, yet striking name. It's not meant to offend. I hope people don't get too offended to a point where they hate me. Haha. /nervous/
