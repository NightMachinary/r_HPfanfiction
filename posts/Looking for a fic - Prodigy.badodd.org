Looking for a fic that I think was called Prodigy or had prodigy in the name.

Here's some bullet points on what happened:

- Harry grew up in an American orphanage with his best friend that I forgot the name of
- Harry goes by James as he was bullied for having a â€˜weird name'
- CSI crossover
- Harry works with CSI at 15-16 years old
- Harry graduated college at a very young age
- James Sr and Lily gave up the wrong twin cliche
- Twin's name is Sirius, when Harry and the twin meet they get along pretty well
- Harry investigates a death caused by overheating in a car by doing a mock race in the desert
- House crossover
- Harry performs a field brain surgery when intervening in a crisis
- Gets roped into helping Dumbledore find horcruxes

It was written very well and any help is appreciated, thanks!
