Harems are okay, but i'd prefer just the single couple.

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

  Who will be next to perish? Should he support the Ministry? Does Dumbledore have a plan? These questions and more haunt Harry as he and his new Order train for war and vengeance in-between three weddings and a funeral. Hogwarts is stunned when Snape gets the Defence job. Will he too be struck down? Harry has been warned about the returning Potions Master, but how can he resist hearing tales about Slughorn's favorite student, Lily Evans?

  Tear it all down and build it back up, better. It's a modest goal.

***** Nuke the goblins?

Fine with me.

Kill a bunch of ministry morons?

Sure, why not.

But using past rape as a plot device so that the main character got laid a day later is just bad.
