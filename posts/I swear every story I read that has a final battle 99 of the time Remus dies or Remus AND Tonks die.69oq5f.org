** Honestly, I wouldn't mind trading a couple Weasleys for Remus and/or Tonks.

Weasleys got off extremely lightly, considering how much they were involved in this War. Other families got decimated or even wiped out for much lower levels of participation.

Losing one out of nine and adding three powerful heroes (Harry, Hermione, Fleur) to the family, they really couldn't complain too much.

*** RIGHT!

I like the Weasley's but I agree that they got off lightly considering everything. I think JKR was really obsessed with having one big happy Weasley family. Personally I think JKR should have had Arthur die as impetus for Ron to mature.

******** I think it would have been great for their character building. Ginny would see that Harry can't escape the war because they're all part of it - and might have understood the Horcrux hunt a bit more, Ron would have matured a lot, and maybe that could be a catalyst for a relationship with Hermione, the twins could realise that defence things like their shield hats could save lives, Percy could reconnect with his family, Charlie and Bill could move back and then play a greater role in the books. So much potential.

**** The story is from Harry's perspective, he's not going to have a front row seat to every epic duel (and if he did everyone would complain about how he didn't do enough to save whoever he watched die)

He's in the middle of a castle spanning battle. Most of it is going to happen off screen and coming upon the aftermath of a particular duel is much more likely than seeing it in progress.

*** There's plenty of ways to get rid of Remus. I always thought Remus/Tonks was one of the most outlandish pairings in the entire series.

I mean, i can see it happening for like a month or two, maybe Tonks wants to piss of her mother or something but them getting married? That's just ridiculous.

I don't particularly like Remus but i still felt like JKR just pulled that pairing out of her hat simply because she wanted people in the Order to marry.

**** I could get behind Remus/Narcissa because maybe they had a secret thing at school or something. It would add intrigue and drama. I could understand pairing Remus with a random Order member like Emmeline Vance or Hestia Jones (or anyone in his age) but Remus/Tonks simply sucks.

Remus is a bad guy, he did nothing for Harry and tried to abandon his unborn child. But Rowling somehow likes twisted, unrealistic relationships with Neville/Hannah (hinted) and Cedric/Cho being the only ones that are plausible in the entire series.

***** The age difference is not a problem at all. My grandparents had an age difference of 20 years, were married for 46 years, had two kids, and died within a week of each other.

Although Remus's character suffers from the usual "plot demands that this happens, no matter how stupid it is". Not as bad as Dumbledore, but still.

****** Besides the fact that Ron was horrible to Hermione for most of their Hogwarts time and only got better after he was poisoned at his 17th birthday?

Well, where do I begin?

1.) His treatment of Harry in GoF, who for the most part was Hermione's best friend. And while Harry might have forgiven Ron after the first task there is no way in hell that Hermione would not hold a grudge against him for that. Remember, she got mad whenever Crouch was mentioned after he dismissed Winky. And now the offense committed was not against a House Elf, but against her friend.

2.) Soon afterwards we have the Yule Ball mess. Ron's petty jealousy was pretty bad, starting random shit with her due to it was worse and calling her a traitor/spy is unforgivable, especially considering that she had just recently proven her loyalty (unlike Ron, what also makes him a hypocrite).

3.) Ron constantly starting fights in their third year, blaming Hermione for things that she did not do for five minutes of attention of his peers. He was proven wrong in the end and yet he does not apologize. A simple "sorry" would not do in this case.

4.) Ron accusing her of being intimate with Viktor. Petty jealousy and implying that Hermione is a slut.

5.) Ron's lacking emotional range and his overall immaturity. Do you really believe that Hermione would deal with that shit?

6.) Lacking common interests.

7.) Completly different mindsets and work ethics. An overly enthusiastic overachiever and a lazy couch potato with massive procrastination tendencies would not work well in a relationship.

Do I need to go on?

**** I see it in a more thematic sense. End of war creates an orphan. At the end of the first one, orphan is left with family who dislikes him and doesn't ever really get to know his godfather. At the end of the second war, orphan is left with family who loves him and grows up knowing his godfather. Part of the wrap-up that shows that Voldemort is truly gone.

Plus with the whole "open at the close" thing, it truly fits in.

It's basically a Hero's Journey thing, from what I understand of the Hero's Journey. Same reason why Harry had to die in /DH/ (all heroes descend into death and come back).

***** I still see a good amount of it in the later books (loss of the mentor, death & resurrection, atonement (though HP sorta twists it back into a failed plea to get Voldemort to feel remorse), the 19 years later epilogue works rather well as the return home), though it's definitely a good thing that it isn't full on Hero's Journey, which would be slightly boring.^{1}

^{1} Plus, when it comes to being a version of the Hero's Journey, nothing will probably ever top the first six Star Wars movies (Original Trilogy being true Hero's Journey, Prequel being a failed).
