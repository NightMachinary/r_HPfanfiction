Even if the person at hand didn't know what the Horcruxes were? As long as someone was specific enough, and said "I need the Horcruxes that Voldemort made" Surely, they'd show up?

Even with all the protections that they were under. I'd imagine, anyway. Any thoughts on this? Any stories that do this, in any way?

I'm just thinking. No one can just ask for food to appear. But maybe if they know what the Horcrux is, they can ask the RoR to bring it? Or to help them find it, at the very least?

That's a bold assumption to make on absolutely no evidence. It's never made entirely clear if items that appear there are things that were already in the Room (in its junk room configuration) or if it just conjures things as needed, but nothing in canon suggests that the Room has the ability to summon objects from outside Hogwarts. At best, you could argue that if you requested a Horcrux, it might give you the diadem.

*** I think you don't have to go straight to 'It works or it doesn't work' for this situation. Certainly, the Diadem would show up. I also find it intensley unlikely that the other Horcruxes would show up. However, consider the 7th book, where when they were looking for food in the Room, it led to the Hog's Head. There's a certain amount of leeway the Room is willing to give if what you ask it isn't something it can do. While I highly doubt it's going to give you a tunnel straight to, say, the Lestrange Vault, it might find other ways to help out.

Assuming, for a moment, the Room is limited by what you know about what you want, it might do something like scrounge up old records about Tom Riddle, or maybe old notes or diaries students wrote about him then lost. Maybe it might look for some record a Death Eater made/gave to their kid about a mysterious benefactor asking them to safekeep an item, so on and so forth. If you had reason to suspect Gringotts had one, maybe it would bring up books about Goblin treaties and bank-related legislation. If you knew about the founders' items angle, it might bring up information about them to help you track the items down as much as possible.

**** This is a much more plausible take on the idea that I can get behind 100%.

** I feel like at most it would only be able to bring the ones in the school at any given time

** I wouldn't think so. It seems like the items in there are based on conjuration rather than summoning as it doesn't work in DH when asked for food except by giving you a passage to the Hog's Head. I think it could though show you the diadem since it was in there already although it is unknown whether it would specifically recognize it as a Horcrux. The objects it produces seem to be mundane... such as cushions, libraries, hammocks, bathroom.

** In my fic, the diadem was found in a configuration of TROR which functioned as the 'lost and found' room of Hogwarts. Imagine trying to find anything in a room with 1000 years worth of stuff.

Anyway, I had Harry ask the room for a device which would help him find it, and the room supplied him with a Geiger counter of sorts.

** I think not, but I do believe the Room would be capable of replicating the objects, but not their horcrux properties.
