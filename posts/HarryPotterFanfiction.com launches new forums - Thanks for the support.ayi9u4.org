Hi everyone,

​

This is Ronnie, the Logistical co-founder of the new [[https://HarryPotterFanfiction.com][HarryPotterFanfiction.com]] and I'm excited to announce that we've officially launched our new Harry Potter forums!

Check them out here: [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/forums]]

​

Throughout 2019 we'll be making major updates to HPFF as we pursue our vision of transforming the site into a hub for writers to improve their craft and build their communities.

Thank you all for the support and feedback, it's all so very helpful :)

​

Happy writing!

-Ronnie
