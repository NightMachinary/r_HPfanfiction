Hopefully I am doing this right. I absolutely love reading fanfiction and come up with ideas on a daily basis that are neat but never seem to have enough to do anything with. I have been mulling over a thought in my head for a long time and wanted to put it here. If someone goes with it, I would love to be notified so I can follow the story. To put it shortly: I am a terrible writer, and have next to no time to write something like this.

I wanted a story with no Dumbledore bashing and trying to find a logical reason why he would be placed with the Dursley's outside of the blood-ward. In addition I wanted a Katie pairing because it seems to be so rare but she is only a year older. I really like the idea of Katie and Harry but I wanted to add some twists to the story so here goes:

- In midst of the celebrations the Dark Lord's supporters and sympathizers call a rushed Wizengamot session to render harry impotent. They rule he has to stay with his closest blood relatives and there are not enough sober Wizards and Witches available to vote against this. Even dumbledore has his hands tied. Sirius is incensed and that is when he meets Pettigrew which lends credence to he was not in control.
- Petunia was in love with Snape (or something along these lines) which is where her real resentment of Lily came from.
- When Harry gets his Hogwarts letter the Dursleys kick him out, rendering the wards inept and so Harry stays in Diagon Alley for the rest of summer.

  - Lupin notices this and takes Harry in.

- Harry is left alone for much of the ride and never runs into malfoy. He subsequently gets sorted into slytherin.
- First years are allowed brooms but not allowed to play quidditch.
- Harry is odd one out in Slytherin (could be friends with Daphne, tracey, blaise) and is out flying and starts chasing this odd gold ball. Turns out he interrupts the Gryffindor tryouts and trounces all the seekers that were trying out.
- Slytherin spying on the tryouts sees this and Harry is told he better be ready for next year, he is going to play.
- Tentative Katie runs into Harry in the halls and they talk about quidditch. She agrees to teach him.
- Katie is missing randomly from the great hall and things like that. Can never hold consistent meet times or locations.
- Harry finds out she is a werewolf and talks to Lupin about this. Decides to become an animagus to accompany her.
- Their friendship and eventual romance would have to be secret.

I would imagine Harry /not/ going after the socerer's stone in his first year, but definately going into the Chamber his second year. I feel like maybe this has enough twists and drama while pulling on a few themes from the Marauder's time without actually pulling a time-jump.


** Very solid, unique way of getting together. Not bad. Would be interested in seeing more.

*** Totally true. I suppose it wouldn't have to start there, it could be done up with flashbacks or clever back building through the plot. It would have to be linear for me to not lose control of it, it's how my mind works.

I...really don't think that 'impotent' is the word you wanted.

I'm also struggling to understand why Harry being impotent (as opposed to him being a toddler) would necessitate his being placed with his nearest relatives. Or how this would fit in with the agenda of a Voldemort sympathizer. Unless your implication is that one of them thought that they were the closest blood relation on the Potter side so they would get custody of Harry, until Dumbledore was able to subvert the ruling by placing him with his closest relations on the Evans side.

Either way, wouldn't this ruling still be in effect when he gets kicked out of Number 4.

Yeeeaaaahh, bad word choice. Technically still reasonable, because it also means "unable to take effective action; helpless or powerless." Nobody's brain goes there, though. I was like, "They stop him from having kids? That's super fucked up, why is that a major enough plot point to put in the summary?"

I guess the idea is that a muggle-raised wizard is less of a threat than a wizard-raised by Sirius Black, yeah?

**** Well he'd be powerless to do anything /anyway/, he's eighteen months old and probably unable to form coherent sentences..

There's also that maybe his family is powerful politically, and keeping him with muggles would keep him unable to leverage that and probably unaware that he had it to leverage at all.

*** Maybe bad word choice sure. But in cannon, Dumbledore takes Harry to the Dursleys. I'm trying to find a better reason for that because I wanted this story to have a good Dumbledore. At the time, Sirius, Frank/Alice are all alive and ready to take custody.

Short of kid napping Harry, the only way to get him placed in a place that would render Harry weak and unprepared to enter the wizarding world would be muggles who hate him. I figure the day after most of those celebrating are going to be inebriated or not paying attention for a sudden wizengamot meeting.

Thus the Dark Lord supporters would be able to push through legislation that puts Harry in a bad setting, looks good because they are placing him with blood relatives, and does it in a way that prevents Dumbledore or Sirius from interacting. It also further triggers Sirius.

**** I mean I know they'd assume that all muggles were awful, uneducated boors because they are bigots but it doesn't exactly ring true that they would know for certain that the Dursleys were bad. How would they even know that Lily Evans had a sister? Dumbledore presumably only knew because he was Headmaster when Petunia wrote asking to come to Hogwarts. Even Snape would have had no reason to mention the muggle sister of the woman he was in love with to his Death Eater friends.

Dumbledore only finds out about the Dursley's habits from McGonagall right before he drops Harry off. So far as he knows prior to that the Dursleys could be an absolutely lovely couple who treated their son well, desperately wanted another child, and would have raised Harry and Dudley like brothers with full knowledge of the wizarding world.

Plus, why would they want him weak and unprepared. Wouldn't they just want him dead? That's certainly a credible reason for wanting him to go into the muggle world, easier to kill him off without notice there.

** Excellent ideas! And the Petunia-Snape angle is fucking awesome!

I think with ideas like these, you should put the pen to paper yourself. I'm curious what convinced you that you were a bad writer

*** Because I can't dialogue well between characters, everything I've written has come out super flat, and my vocabulary sucks. Not to mention I'm not even remotely British and can't fake it in writing to save my life.

The truth is I can write it but then I would instantly hate it. I've been around long enough that I know the quality of my writing, and it's something I've come to grips with, just like not being able to sing.

** That's interesting. I'd definitely read that.

I honestly think I would be interested in any Harry/Werewolf fics. I've never read that before. Anyone have any recommendations? Preferably without slash? So it'd probably need to be an OC. I don't think there's any female werewolves in canon, right?

** We need a fic where Harry dates Katie, dumps her and as revenge she bites him and turns him into a werewolf. During the transformation, he kills her. And then there's a redemption story as he fights for werewolf rights.
