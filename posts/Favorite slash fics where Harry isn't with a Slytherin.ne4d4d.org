I get this is largely a het subreddit, but was wondering what slash you liked where Harry isn't with a Slytherin.

Also don't want him with someone who is old enough to be his dad either.

This is also to get people hopefully interested in slash a little, since a lot of people complain about Harry being with male Slytherin or with a really older guy.

Would rather NOT have Weasley bashing (if at all possible)

Would rather not have over abusive Dursley's if at all possible.

Some that I like:

Harry/Ron: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/562941]]

Harry/Cedric: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11314398]]

Harry/Ron: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9210605]]


** Some Harry/Ron fics I liked: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2136939][Perspective]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8274067][Or the Look Or the Words]]. I'm only just now realizing that both of them are Yule Ball fics...

A lot of the HP slash I read doesn't have Harry in it at all but if you're interested in other pairings I can list those too.

**** Dudley/Goyle: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/200820][Hand in Glove]] (rated explicit)

The following fics include male Slytherins but not Harry.

Quirrel/Snape: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13615362][Quirrell's Moonlit Stroll]] (rated explicit)

Dumbledore/Voldemort: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25975459][A blind date]] (silly) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1601735][Purgatory]] (not so silly, rated explicit)

Quirrel/Voldemort: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1146804][The Greatest Weakness]]

These next few fics contain potentially offputting or “problematic” dynamics but again, not actually with Harry.

Dudley/Piers: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189985][Dudley Distracted]] (rated explicit, Dudley has a weird unrequited incesty crush on Harry that he processes together with Piers)

Tom Riddle/Slughorn: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1169296][In the Style of a Lover]] (rated explicit, a scary reversal of the typical teacher-student power dynamic)

  In which Ron realizes that maybe, just maybe, you aren't supposed to feel this way about your best mate. But only after a dance at the Yule Ball, months of being busy with other things, Cedric Diggory's death, the return of Voldemort, and a quiet knock at his door.

  Goblet of Fire AU: The change in their relationship happened during fourth year, when an exhausted and dateless Harry groaned out the important question of, “Why can't we just go together?”Pure fluff for the 5+ AU Headcanons game.

** I like the “Amare” series for Harry/Cedric (two done, one in progress), though it does have worse-than-canon abusive Dursley's: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1757755]]

Another in-progress Harry/Cedric one that I've been enjoying is “You're Okay”: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29204478/chapters/71706093]]

Oh actually I suppose there are quite a lot where he's paired with either one or both Weasley twins or Oliver

Here is a fic with Harry/Oliver but it's them as adults because the age gap is too much for school aged linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3217646]])

** My fic is Harry/George (sorry for the shameless self-promo). Harry/George is my OTP, so I basically just wrote the fic I wanted to read. It does feature abusive Dursleys, but I mostly just read between the lines of canon. It's nothing over the top and mostly is referenced as part of Harry's reactions to other things. I hope u like it :)

#+begin_quote
  Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts ended in tragedy. Now, as he faces a world darkened by Voldemort's return, he must cling to those he loves more than ever. Struggling with his guilt, Harry resolves to work harder so that he can protect others from Cedric's fate. Follow a slightly sadder Harry through a different fifth year at Hogwarts as he deals with an evil pink-clad professor, a mysterious connection to Voldemort, and the very real trauma of his past.

** My all time favorite slash fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13449260/1/Stay-Alive-For-Now][Stay Alive for Now]]. It's a slow-burn (incredibly slow) Harry/Cedric, and the writing is just beautiful.

And you're pretty much proving that discussion thread's point...

    if you want explicitly slash subreddit, you may try [[/r/HPSlashFic/]]
  #+end_quote

People doing stuff like that is why people think this subreddit doesn't like slash. HPSlashFic had to be made because HPFanfiction wanted slash fics gone, which isn't right.

This subreddit should allow different stuff.

Slash and femslash fanfiction should be allowed on here.

**** Ahhh I see now what happened. I applaud you for putting up that post. Seriously that was good.

As for the pairing I had recently read Harry/Bill/Charlie if you are fine with threesome but it hasn't yet started with the relationship. Its WBWL with a good twin brother no weasley bashing with an evil Dumbledore.

Blind Love by misteeirene

Wrong boy who Lived. Dumbledore declared Harry a squib and so he was sent to live with his aunt and uncle. What will everyone do when they find out that Harry is the true prophecy child? What condition will the Order find Harry in when they finally locate him.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1792537/chapters/3842731]]

Harry/Cedric. Seriously light hearted and so good and no bashing at all. Complete

Paranoia and Puns by You_Light_The_Sky

Harry makes three rules to survive fourth year: 1) watch the new DADA professor like a hawk, 2) suspect all animals of being animagi, and 3) avoid Cedric Diggory at all costs. Shame Diggory didn't get the memo.

For a tumblr prompt by johnlocked-starkid: maybe a Harry/Cedric thing where the Triwizard Cup isn't a portkey and Voldemort doesn't happen, and instead they just win together and are happy and celebrate together. (bonus points for shy confessions of a crush from one or the other)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14016627/chapters/32279778]]

Edit: Blind love is not finished but there is re-write going on.

*** If you're subscribed to that very subreddit, there's actually a recent post about how people there feel about the atmosphere towards slash in this subreddit. I think some of the people who saw it might be trying to prove it wrong by posting about slash and showing that the users of this subreddit can recommend and discuss slash fanfiction too. After all, slash fanfiction is fanfiction too!
