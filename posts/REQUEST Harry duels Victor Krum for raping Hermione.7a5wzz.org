read a story years ago where Harry Potter during the Triwizard Tournament duels Victor Krum for raping Hermione Granger, during the duel he disarms him by cutting off all of his limbs with a flame whip thus disarming him ending the duel. also Hermione commits suicide, later Luna is either killed or also commits suicide then Harry kills himself. all three meet in heaven, discover they should have been soulmates but for interference, all 3 go back, etc.

*** It's almost like I'm reading a parody request.

To each their own though. I know I've read my fair share of junk.

** I don't know what fic that is, but I'll recommend one that sounds pretty similar.

Linkffn(10766595).

Harry/Daphne/Hermione.

There's a soul bond thing going on, and it's mentioned that Daphne was sexually assaulted.

** That sounds like a particularly nasty beginning to one of those Lunar Harmony fics that came as a result of Paladeus's /Champions of Lilith/ challenge, or it's predecessor, reptilia28's /Don't Fear the Reaper/ challenge. One other commenter mentioned Death's Pride (linkffn(4321881)), by Paladeus himself, but here's some others:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Paladeus-Champion-of-Lilith-Challenge/58410/14/0/1/0/0/0/0/][Paladeus's Challenge C2]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Paladeus-Champion-of-Lilith-Challenge/58410/14/0/1/0/0/0/0/][reptilia28's Challenge C2]]

Edit: Also, you'll have to change the filtering to sort by all, not just K to T, since a majority of these fics have lots of sex and violence.

** "Death's Pride" is probably the most famous Lunar-Harmony-soulbond-repeated-lives fic out there, but even though it's been a while since I last read it, I don't think this particular scenario was anywhere in it.
