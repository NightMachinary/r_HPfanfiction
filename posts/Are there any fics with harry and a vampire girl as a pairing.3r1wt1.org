** I think that guy who had a fic about Harry with perfect memory had a vampire setup.

Then again, I haven't seen that fic in years, so my memory's blurry there.

*** There are at least 50 fics where Harry has(naturally or magically-induced) eidetic memory. And typically no use for having introduced such an affinity, since the author has no method of writing someone more intelligent than themselves.

** I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the Daughter of darkness by Ri-kun) is but it's been years since I've read that story so I don't remember too much about it.

  Book 1 of DoD Trilogy! Summerfic. Sirius is dead, and Harry is facing the prophecy alone. A new stranger appears in his life, one who seems to identify with his lonliness. Is she truly a kindred spirit, or is this another plot by Voldemort?

** I started to write linkffn(Touched By Night's Veil) a few years back, without getting really anywhere. Would still be happy about your feedback :).

**** I recently rewrote a few paragraphs I was unhappy with, and do have some ideas where to take the story. Right now, there's just too many way to go, but I hope I'll be adding chapters some time.
