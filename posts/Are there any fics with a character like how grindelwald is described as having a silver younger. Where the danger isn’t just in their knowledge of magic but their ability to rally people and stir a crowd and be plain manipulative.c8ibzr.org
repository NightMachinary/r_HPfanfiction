#+TITLE: Are there any fics with a character like how grindelwald is described as having a silver younger. Where the danger isn’t just in their knowledge of magic but their ability to rally people and stir a crowd and be plain manipulative and be really good at it.

*** Emphasis on younger. Voldemort from what we saw didn't seem to have as much charisma. I'm talking about someone who doesn't have to fight or even necessarily do something illegal to rally people around a cause exceedingly well.

** Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort)

Has a very manipulative Voldemort character.

He does spare Lily when she says that she'll do anything, gives her the mark and slowly turns her into a dark witch. Snape's fully loyal to him as a result. He spends a lot of time managing the different factions inside the death eaters to switch from killing the mudbloods to using them as curse fodder. He also manipulates the public to reduce support for Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)
