Perhaps with Bellatrix as his student... I'm a bit of a Bellamort shipper. But if there are other fics you know of, whether it contains Bellamort or not, I'd be happy to view it! :)

** I don't know any, but your question reminds me of a fic I read years ago, where Tom Riddle (or Lord Voldemort?) invited Harry to /tea parties/. There was a lot of etiquette lessons and political discussions. It was ... strange.

** linkffn(2595818) has Tom Riddle as a Hogwarts professor who then travels to a new dimension where his counterpart is the Dark Lord. Great read, but is unfortunately abandoned.

** I remember reading a fic with Tom Riddle's day job was teaching and dark lord at nights. It was about 4 horseman of apocalypse. Fem Harry. It was actually a great fic. It's sequel's name was something like masquerade or masquerading. If you know what I'm talking about let me know. I'm too lazy to find it

  More than two decades ago, Headmaster Dippet made the fateful decision to hire Tom Riddle as an associate Hogwarts professor. And now, at last, Riddle's double life as Lord Voldemort is threatening to bring the Wizarding World to its knees...if only he can convince his students to leave him alone.
