According to the [[https://legacy.hp-lexicon.org/magic/legilimency.html][HP Lexicon]]:

#+begin_quote
  Legilimency is easier when the spell-caster is *physically near the target*, and when the target is off-guard, relaxed, or otherwise vulnerable. *Eye contact* is often essential, so it is useful for a Legilimens to verbally manipulate his or her target into meeting the Legilimens' eyes, with the fringe benefit that the target's emotional state may bring relevant associated memories to the surface (OP24, OP26).

In the film /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/, we see Queenie Goldstein listen in to her sister's thoughts when they are in the same building (of unknown size).

Is this directly contradicted by established canon? In an [[https://www.bustle.com/articles/194596-what-is-a-legilimens-queenie-in-fantastic-beasts-can-see-into-your-soul][interview]] with the actress who portrays Queenie:

#+begin_quote
  "She sees into people. She's not just reading what you're currently thinking, she's reading you," Alison Sudol said.
#+end_quote

Is this merely an extension of lore first mentioned in OotP or is it something different?

I'm looking forward to reading your opinions. Thanks in advance.

Edit: formatting


** Three things.

Firstly, there is at least one example in canon of a character using legilimency without eye contact: Voldemort in the atrium on Harry in OotP. While he could be using the scar connection, it seems unlikely as we never see it used for regular legilimency at any other time, and on top of that the way Voldemort describes it makes it sound as if Harry's mind is just wide open.

Secondly, I think it's fairly clear that Queenie's legilimency is not standard legilimency. It's not something that she has learned, it's a natural ability like being a metamorphmagus or parselmouth. If she had learnt it then she would be able to turn it off. Given that it's not standard legilimency I feel like it's firmly in the realm of "expansion" to canon rather than "contradiction".

Thirdly, it's still not clear to me if JKR intends for Fantastic Beasts to have occurred in the movieverse continuity or the bookverse, and therefore what its canon status is. I suspect that it's supposed to be taking place in a fudge of the two.

** I honestly assumed that Queenie was just rather strong with a natural ability. It didn't seem like she learned it, and it doesn't seem like she has full control over it.

That being said, it's probably an expansion of canon? Of she is a rarity and quite strong, chances are there aren't that many cases of individuals with her ability. Also, I feel like if people (Madame President) knew how strong her ability was, she wouldn't be serving coffee and tea... either that are she is really, really good at downplaying one hell of a skill.

So she's a psycher. Is that heresy I smell?!
