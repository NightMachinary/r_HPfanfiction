:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where Harry and Gin become friends with each other after the chamber, and Harry helps Ginny recover. Do you guys know anything like this? Also, if you do, I would like it not being romantic or anything like that. I like the idea that they are friends, and they don't care about romantic relationships at the tender ages of 11 and 12. Maybe through the years they get together, but for now I'm strictly looking for a fic where they are basically best friends. So if anyone has any suggestions, pls let me know! Thank you everyone who's made of this far!


** That fic? I dunno which one you have in mind, but /one/ fic is this.

Also, if you want Ginny's perspective (and can wait for the main deal to happen in sixth year), there's also this + sequels:

  Harry decides to help Ginny recover from her experience in the Chamber of Secrets, causing a special bond to form between them. Rating is for violence in the later chapters. A French translation called Si tu peux l'aider is being written by Sined
