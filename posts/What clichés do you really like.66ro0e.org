** WBWL or not BWL of a certain kind. While I don't mind suspending disbelief for the premise - whether it be neglect or abandonment at the Dursley's - I like stories in which the premise is somewhat justified, and people's reactions henceforth are genuine and interesting. Absolutely hate those bland portrayals where the parents have no clue why the abandoned child would be angry.

Time/Alt uni travel in which the characters Harry primarily interacts with are more than just blandly nice, or undeniably crooked. Love stories in which he develops a complex relationship with his mum or dad or sibling/s.

** I like dimension travelling a fair bit, as it can lead to some really cool interpretations of not just the HP universe, but also provide some really good foundations for a crossover, which if handled well make for a gripping read.

Otherwise a bit of the ol' time travel never hurt anyone, as long as the story goes somewhere interesting and doesn't shackle itself to canon. Bonus points for time travel that begins pre-GoF, and changes the whole Voldemort resurrection thing. I've seen way too many stories do post-GoF or post-OotP when there's so much more to work with!

** Harry gets raised by someone else. Especially if that someone else gives him a good childhood.

** Magical Cores, cause it's more mystical that "Magic is everywhere but only those with this specific Gene Sequence can use it" what determines Magical depth or strength is it random or is there a level of fate that determines it? Also solves the problem of if everyone is the same strength why anyone would follow and kowtow to Voldemort? He isn't better that anyone else, he isn't stronger if the other theories are right, so why kiss his robes? Why not Poison him or team up and kill him and have a more influential or higher profile Pureblood take his place? Voldemort being a powerful and dangerous wizard that scares everyone into submission and those who stand against him is like a beaver dam against the Sea makes everything far more mystical.

The Chamber of Secrets contains Salazar Slytherin's Library and stuff cause why not.
