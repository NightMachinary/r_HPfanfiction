** Which ones have you read? I usually recommend Nightmares of Futures Past, if you're ok with incomplete stories (but still a really great read), or Backward with Purpose if you're ok with a slow start (book 1 is decent, but it's book 2 that's really great).

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
