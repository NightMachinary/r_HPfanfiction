Soooooo, I just recently started reading fanfics and they usually mention things like spell needing some kind of power to cast (something like mana/chakra in games/manga)? Is this some kind of canon thing?

Because I don't remember such things in JKR books. I always thought that to cast spell you had to know incantation, hand movement and have some mental focus. And in some special cases intent (killing curse) or mental training (patronus). But in fanfics I've read Harry and others seems to be tired after using spells several times and sometimes they even can't cast them in succession (like they have cooldown or something?)


** In canon, power or energy (in terms of running out of it or needing a certain amount to cast a spell) is never established.

I believe fanfic uses it a lot as it is a natural check to keep protagonists or antagonists from being too OP. It is the age old fanfic question: What is to stop a Death Eater from casting Avada Kedavra relentlessly as it is unblockable (unless blocked by physical objects and other rare circumstances) and guarantees certain victory? Why would Voldemort or Bellatrix cast anything but Avada Kedavra when dueling?

Requiring a certain amount of power or energy to cast a spell is then a natural check to keep characters from being too overpowered.

Though, I would argue that it makes little thematic sense, in canon, to assume a wizard/witch could cast a spell indefinitely or with no recourse.

JKR's magical system is famously vague and folks such as [[/u/Taure]] have gone to great lengths to prove or debunk certain theories with evidenced cobbled together from canon. Fanfic allows us writers to create our own rules pertaining to magical power and it is up to reader to either believe or disregard the rules established in a fic.

*** The "without limited power, what's to stop a wizard casting the same spell over and over?" question seems to have a natural response that's simply the opposite of the same coin: "without limited power, there's nothing to stop a wizard casting the same /defence/ over and over".

If your first curse failed to penetrate a wizard's defences, then casting the same spell again and again is just going to have the same failed result. This applies equally to the Killing Curse, to which there /are/ defences. Of course the Killing Curse is still incredibly dangerous, which is why Voldemort uses it an awful lot (it's pretty much the only spell he uses as a direct assault), but if you aren't having success with it you're going to have to switch up your strategies to find a way past your opponent's defences -- like any other spell.

We see this in OotP where Voldemort starts using other magic to try to distract Dumbledore and out-manoeuvre him, before once again trying a direct attack in the form of a Killing Curse. If not for Fawkes, it would have succeeded too.

Indeed, thinking about it, there's actually more incentive to spam the same spell at people over and over in a "limited power" world. If there's limited power, then you can spam one spell at people to wear them down and win by having more power than them. That doesn't work in a unlimited power world: if one tactic fails on the first try, the only way you can win is by changing your tactic.

**** A very good point, but if we were to get into the meta of it, what is to stop Voldemort or Bellatrix (facing anyone other than Dumbledore) to simply cast AK over and over again until all physical objects capable of blocking it are destroyed?

The counter is that you can use other spells to distract him in between AK's or you have the ability to conjure objects indefinitely to block the AK or get the fuck out of dodge when you realize you're facing an AK demon.

Supposing you can defend AK with physical objects or conjurations, would not every duel become a race to who can first cast AK without it being blocked by a physical object? I suppose that is the point of the Killing Curse anyway.

Rambling aside, what I'm trying to say is that if it is a duel to the death - and if Harry and Voldemort exist within the particular fic, then it /must/ be to the death - then it makes for uneventful writing if all it requires is who wins the race to cast the unblocked AK first.

Of course, there are other lethal spells besides the AK, but what I suppose is this: If you, as a Death Eater or MLE, can successfully cast an AK, then all life or death duels should lead to that eventuality. I think this would make for boring writing.

Which is why I think there should be some restraint that exists wherein the user can not infinitely cast AK or whatever spell it may be. Whether that restraint can be implemented in a believable manner is up to the writer, but I feel (which is not to say everyone should feel the same way) it is more compelling and dramatic to have magical restraints as opposed to a battle of who can counter X spell with Y spell until Z happens.

***** What you're describing is basically Voldemort's standard duelling tactic: essentially all he did in his duel against Dumbledore was move around and cast Killing Curses, defending himself between. I don't think that duel was boring to read at all, because of the manoeuvring part of the duel. In fact I feel like it was the pinnacle of magic in the books.

I feel, in general, that HP duels should be quite short and the first party to land a spell wins. So the majority of a duel is trying to put yourself in a position where you can land a single spell. The moment one party has an advantage, the duel is basically over.

With particular regard to Harry, I don't think he would ever use the Killing Curse, regardless of how effective it is.

**** I was implying more that wizards don't have a magical HP counter. This is an overly simplistic example but some fics have it so that casting a spell takes 200 hit points from the wizard's 1000 point pool. There's no evidence in canon for that sort of magical check.

There is some evidence for a poorly defined magical power needed to cast certain spells, including AK. But, JKR's vagueness strikes again as we do not know what this power check is. Snape mentions that it takes nerve and ability to perform the Killing Curse, but what does this /mean/? What does it take to cast Avada Kedavra?

It is never explained in canon, so fanfic writers can sometimes take liberal interpretations of this implied power check in their stories.

******** I think you're misrepresenting what ego depletion is. It has the word "depletion" in the name, but that doesn't mean that there's a literal finite source of willpower that is reduced by actions. Rather, ego depletion simply refers to the idea that making difficult choices in quick succession gets increasingly hard (see: quitting smoking example).

Further, it doesn't seem relevant here.

"Ego depletion" is largely about behavioural discipline, not about mental focus. This has pretty much zero relevance to magic use. It's a rare spell that involves any mental component at all, and even those that do don't seem to involve self-control.

The only magical concept I can imagine ego depletion playing a role in is occlumency.

Other, similar concepts like mental fatigue are problematic for similar reasons: magic doesn't seem to involve anything that would result in it. Even the spells with a mental component like the Patronus aren't particularly strenuous mentally. You can wallow in past memories all day without getting mentally fatigued. Bored, yes. Fatigued, no. Also, mental fatigue has a lot to do with physical fatigue.

** I've spent a fair amount of time thinking of this as well, and I think I've come up with a half decent idea.

Wizards obviously have some sort of limit to the amount of spells they can cast, or magic that they can use in a given amount of time. I've figured that they have a shared HP/Mana/Stamina pool, that is both connected and somewhat independent. A wizard can certainly die while still being able to fight and cast spells, so a critical backstab might reduce their HP to 0 while they still had positive Mana or Stamina. And Harry certainly held on to consciousness until Quirrelmort had been defeated in his first year, so while his Mana and Stamina went to 0, he still had HP remaining.

Any two wizards or spells have a different amount of magic in them, the vast majority of wizards presumably exponentially more magical than the vast majority of spells. There is a sliding scale, and outliers for both categories of course- Dumbledore, Tom Riddle, Harry Potter as the most magical and something like Lumos as the very least. One could even think that some awe-inspiring spell like a 'Mountain into a Monster' transfiguration or an acre of Fiendfyre would be more magical than the lower end of wizards, and certainly more than a squib like Argus Filch.

Magical expenditure is affected by skill, and by the size of the Mana pool of the wizard. While Harry may have had a larger MP than McG, were they to cast the exact same transfiguration, it would take McG significantly less magic. Also, it would allow McG to perform larger/more intricate/more impressive feats of transfiguration than Harry, despite his greater magical power.

Its implied that there is a seemingly excessively large amount of food served at Hogwarts, so I presume that using magic takes energy. It burns calories to cast spells, so even if the students have relatively inactive lifestyles, they still need a large amount of food. A wizard probably cannot exhaust himself casting spells until he dies, but would be able to cast until he collapsed and was unable to continue, like if someone out of shape were to just go outside and run. Until they couldn't anymore. I can't imagine any sort of cooldown on anything that doesn't sound absolutely stupid. You couldn't just chain-cast AKs for an hour, it would be like nonstop power-squats with backpack full of bricks. But Dumbledore or Riddle certainly could stand there and unleash breathtaking spectacles significantly larger and more powerful than poor staircase victim Sally-Anne ever could.
