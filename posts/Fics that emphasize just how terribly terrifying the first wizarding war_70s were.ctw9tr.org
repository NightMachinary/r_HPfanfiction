  Imagine that Voldemort's powerful now. You don't know who his supporters are, you don't know who's working for him and who isn't; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves. You're scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing... The Ministry of Magic's in disarray, they don't know what to do, they're trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere... panic... confusion... that's how it used to be.

This was so terrifying and unsettling, even the beloved Marauders all started turning against each other. Sirius at first against Remus then both Sirius and James and later Remus started suspecting Sirius himself. These were the guys that became animagi for their friend. It later turns out that Peter had willingly turned against his friends, being so terrified of them. There so much distrust in the world, it was able to break apart one of the closest friendships. Dumbledore himself thought that one of these would turn against each other, as he believed the traitor was from within the group.

Lucius Malfoy was not a known Death Eater. No one was. The Minister for Magic herself could've been one for all people knew. These were people in masks, anonymous and always moving in packs, orchestrating attacks. The muggles are also being attacked left and right and centre, so the ministry isn't just trying to ward off the death eaters, but also trying to find out who was working for Voldemort and sabotaging their efforts. It can be a family member (the crouches), friend (marauders) or even lovers. Everything was just so sketchy.


** I'd also add something a lot of people seem to forget is that Voldemort was a terrorist with essentially government backing. His followers kept the aurors from fighting efficiently, people up against him might come home to find their family had been tortured and killed. You never knew who was really your friend and who was secretly spying or imperioused or polyjuiced. It wasn't a conventional war and that's what made Voldemort so bad. He'd attack innocent people to make a point.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Mr. and Mrs. Evans are killed when Lily's only a girl, and she's supposed to go to a home with her sister. Instead, a relative they didn't know they had comes to collect them, and introduces Lily to manners, magic, and a life that's just the slightest bit different from the life she was supposed to live.Or, an AU in which Minerva McGonagall raises Lily.

Oh I really want such a story and it would explain why little things like saying mudblood and agreeing and hanging out with people that seem to agree are such a big things, because those really are the only pointers they had to see where someone stands
