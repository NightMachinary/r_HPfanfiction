I see alot of what is your favorite characterization of harry potter characters, and in honestly im curious. What is your favorite character outside the harry potter universe? Why? Personally im extremely invested in Eragon from the Inheritance series. I read those along side Harry Potter and dare I say it I liked it a little more.. Too bad there is no good inheritance saga fanfiction.

** Meruem from Hunter x Hunter. I loved how he was born to specifically fulfill a certain role and yet discovered he was very different than what he and others thought in the end.

Emma Woodhouse from the book Emma. Loved her and the character development. In my opinion, Emma is Jane Austen's masterpiece.

Scarlett 'O Hara, I love her.Maybe it's just because of how deliciously ruthless she can be.

** If you look through my comments I've talked about Dr. Doom in some detail. His motivations at least.

He is by far my favorite character ever created.

He's arrogant with the power to back it up.

He's been a God and a creator.

He also legitimately looks after his people. They aren't living the high life but they want for nothing.

He has his flaws but he can be the strongest there is.

I've got loads of favourites. Nick Carraway is my favourite novel character. Even though he's probably the closest we get to a decent person in /The Great Gatsby/, he still falls short because of the whole self-centred brooding and private condescension.

Spike Spiegel from /Cowboy Bebop/ is a hallmark of Shinichiro Watanabe's craftsmanship. Spike showed more layers in 26 episodes than an ogre might in... well... four feature-length films. You get it, though.

Zoe Barnes. Just Zoe Barnes.

****** Yeah I even confused myself in retropsect.

4 - Classic Who. Tom Baker. My first Doctor.

9 - The War Doctor. John Hurt. Retconned in for the 50th Anniversary

9 (10) - Christopher Eccleston.

10 (11) -David Tennant.

11 (12) - Matt Smith

12 (13) - Peter Capaldi.

My intended response was, 4 - Tom Baker, 10 (11) - David Tennant, and 12 (13) - Peter Capaldi.

******* Thanks! I remember seeing some teaser that ended with "Introducing John Hurt as the Doctor!" and then the next episode/season started with Peter Capaldi and I was confused. The sequence of events in that show can be so confusing.

My favorite is David Tennant, too, though I haven't seen anything pre-modern Who.

** Favorite characters from childhood:

- Sapphira from Eragon
- Kitty Pryde from X-Men Evolution
- Sam from Lord of the Rings
- Padma from Star Wars
- Lyra and Pan from His Dark Matierals
- Zuko from Avatar
- Elizabeth Swan from Pirates

I would go on from about recent favorites, but I'm in grad school and my brain is dead. The only thing that comes to mind right is Kenneth from 30 Rock because everything hurts and my portfolio is due next week.

** *Dr. McCoy* from /Star Trek: TOS/ - I love how he's so irascible and grouchy, and yet he's a healer. I love his brilliance and his compassion, and more often than not I find myself agreeing with him, rather than Spock or Kirk.

*Bertie Wooster* from the /Jeeves/ books. He's a fool, but he always manages to bounce back from any embarrassment. I envy that. He also fancies himself a man of iron will, but he's actually a pushover. He's actually sensitive and kind under his posturing. He can be an arrogant twat, but he always comes through in the end, contrite and helpful. He never lets a pal down, even if he doesn't particularly like them, and even if it means he looks like an escapee from the local asylum to everyone who doesn't know him.

In their very different ways, they both have a wonderful decency and humanity about them that endears them to me and keeps me coming back.
