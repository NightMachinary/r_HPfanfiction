I am not talking about explanations regarding the plot of character behavior.

I mean - do you like it when the author uses a concept or a historical name and in the AN explains the concept or who the historical person was; or maybe he wrote something in a different language and posted the translation in the AN.

Do you like it or do you think it kills the flow of reading?


** It really depends on the situation. If its, say, to explain why characters are acting so erratically or out of character, it says something either about the quality of the writing or the opinion about the audience. I don't care why Harry is super strong and then suddenly gets utterly beaten for bs reasons. I already know thats stupid plot setup so the author can make something else happen.

Conversely, some author notes are useful or interesting. Sometimes certain things are introduced in stories that are only mentioned briefly in story (not as large exposition dumps which is okay only if used sparingly). An example for instance would be something a bit of background geography or history about a location, or possibly where you got the idea from. This is fine. Also translations for large sections of non-english dialogue, if they occur, are always nice (not a dealbreaker though).

** Yes and no.

If it's explaining why a character did something because they can't seem to portray it well in the chapter... No I dislike it.

If it's changing something small in canon and explaining ooc why you decided to do that, that's okay.

A good example I would use an authors note for would be explaining why I decided to make hogwarts a private expensive school instead of free like it is in canon. Especially as my fic is not an massive AU. A large reason I would do this is not to get tons of reviews saying hogwarts is free in the books.

for example, at the end of linkffn(12629461) the author makes the following observation

** I use a lot of these explanations in ANs at the end of the chapter since I write AUs where these explanations are necessary because not everybody knows where Bohemia is or what historical significance it used to have (the only kingdom in the HRE). I try to explain these things in-story, but sometimes it does not fit in the narrative.

And why would sticking something to the end of a chapter kill the reading flow? If it bothers someone, the "next chapter" button is right next to it.

** No.

I usually have explanations for stuff in my story, down to character names and choices of setting and colours mentioned and all sorts of details no one notices. Nothing delights me more than when people notice or ask about them in reviews. But that's kind of the point, they should be for people to work out themselves. I find something quite pretentious about breaking down your fanfic symbolism as if it's an English class.

** I'm in two camps on this. When reading stories I'm rarely interested in what authors notes have to say, regardless of how pertinent they are. Yet in my main story does have them. Why?

Basically, it's a compromise. I'd usually prefer to have the story speak for itself, and I do try to make it as accessible as possible. However, there's a fairly sizeable number of readers who like to know just what I'm referring to when I mention X minor character from the background lore. Knowing who they are, and if they're part of the canon or not, is not necessary to the story, but many people seem to want to know.

So I insert an as-brief-as-possible note at the end, explaining just what is canon, what is canon-based conjecture, and what is original content.

** If there is something you think you will get a lot of questions about, then an author's note makes sense. I'd put it at the start or end of the chapter -- the start if it's not spoilery and might throw people, like a person in the 14th century named Tiffany, or the end if it's spoilery or wouldn't get people to instantly write a caps lock angry review.

I generally dislike author's notes. I really dislike author's notes within the main text.

Far better than author's notes is to work the thing into the text.

** Yes. I prefer when A/Ns are at the end of a chapter, because if you aren't interested it's very easy to hit End or whatever and skip past, rather than trying to find where the true chapter beginning starts. You also have to remember that although ANs don't necessarily help the binge reading experience, they do provide interesting tidbits for someone who has caught up with the update cycle.

As for content, if the Author wants to share some cool little bit of research that they love but doesn't quite fit into the story? Go for it. I adore enthusiasm and this really sets the tone of how much the Author loves a particular aspect of their work. Translations are useful in that they support my laziness as I won't look it up myself :p I do think there should be some sort of "soft" translation in-chapter through context, though. Basically the story shouldn't depend on its ANs to provide understanding, but they can provide extra context for those who are interested. Like a Behind The Scenes or similar.

For me personally, the couple of times I've done that in my writing, I've added it at the end of the chapter (after the person has read whatever it is), and it's only like if it's something that seems really random.

Except that doesn't work when there's so many terrible writers in fanfiction. If a character behaves in an unbelievable or OOC manner I have to assume that the writer has no idea what he/she is doing. If suddenly the Fidelius works entirely different than in canon, I have to assume that the writer hasn't actually read the books and not that it is a clever AU... etc.

If the writing/plot is rough and wierd stuff starts to happen, it might be what caused me to finally stop reading.

But if the writing/plot is solid so far, and some wierd stuff starts up, I'll give it a chance even without the author taking an extra note to assure me 'it's all a part of the plan.'

Really?! 4/5 five stories I pick up contains obvious mistakes that are not part of the plan (be it OOC characters, huge plotholes, or just lack of understanding of canon). Why would I assume that? If "House Elves need a bond to survive" is a major part of your plot you better make it very clear to me that you're writing AU so that I don't assume you're an idiot.

I have the same approach as you on published novels, because I know that at least one other person (the editor) has read it and would called the author on stuff that sounds like obvious bullshit.

That's bullshit. If someone in the US writes a story about a someone going from Harrison, Nebraska to Juno, Texas there is no way more than 10% of the readers would know where even one of those is. When I write the geopolitical framework for the rest of Europe and base it on 15th-century borders inside the HRE, most people in Germany would know what a prince-elector is, but that percentage would be a lot smaller in other countries. And explaining it in-story sometimes makes no sense. Why would an international, magical German newspaper explain what an elector is?

** Most I've seen so far is fine, like when the author gives some trivia or explanation about a real-life place/object/concept/person/whatever that is not explored in the story but interesting nonetheless. Another thing that I am totally okay with is etymology for spells, like in The Arithmancer.

With regards to translations I think that anything that absolutely needs a translation should not be in a foreign language in the first place, in most situations it's better for the reader to be informed that an important dialogue is taking place in French instead of having to read the dialogue in french and then look for a translation on their own or skip to the end to read the translation in the AN (And don't ever put ANs in the story, they belong at the beginning or the end, everything else breaks the flow). If you want to show off your French skillz or just want to make it a bit more authentic then use the foreign language for unimportant bits like introductions etc and sprinkle some foreign words with obvious meanings or foreign curse words through the text that is supposed to be in the language.

Anything that explains or describes the world or characters should go in the story itself and not in the AN, with the exception of a single short introduction to the world at the beginning of the first chapter along the lines of "this story is set in the 11th century" or "this story follows an OC character named XYZ" or "everyone is OOC" or similar stuff.

Basically, if it is of any relevance to the story, put it in the story.

If it's like in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Master's ball) where the author explain that he did this or that to adhere to the stations of canon while changing this or that and why (not really /that/ prevalent in the first 3 books) or when he say that Harry will meet his love interest and future wife in a few chapter... then I absolutely despise it, it just takes me out of the story and kills the suspense.

** Mostly, no. But this is because I often see it used poorly.

If you create new terminology, or use unusual terminology, perhaps it would be sensible to mark it with postscript and then in the Notes at the bottom of the page, expand upon the meaning of the word so the audience can understand it. If you're unsure, leave the AN out and trust the reader to Google it.

Without postscript, I generally see Authors Notes as unnecessary exposition. If it's important to understand the story, it should be /in/ the story, if you (as an author) have problems introducing exposition to the audience then you should study storytelling to see how other authors do it. Read excerpts that display exposition via dialogue etc.

I generally skip past Authors Notes, rarely even skimming them. This is because I've seen some authors include whole /short-stories/ in the Authors Notes and it's irritating. Completely takes me out of the main story and I develop a dim view of the author because of it.

If you're an author and want to expand upon your world, just create a separate post on FFN/wherever and Title it "Notes from [fic name]" which is basically what Tolkien did with his Lord of the Rings ideas. This allows you to avoid butchering your main story, and you get to pay about with the world.

I would like to add, however, that this is my personal opinion. I know some authors use the Authors Notes to develop a dialogue with the reader, and sometimes even to promote their other work or to thank the reader or ask they participate ("Please comment what you liked about this chapter -- Don't forget to Follow/Favourite this story to get the latest updates!" and so on...) - I can't blame an author for doing this, you have to promote your "brand" at the end of the day.

** Has any other medium used author notes during the story to try to explain themselves and their story? No? Then leave it out of your work. The only reason to include an authors note is to inform the reader of a change in upload schedule.

*** Uh, yes. I mean, read alot of Dramas - the old stuff. Berthold Brecht, Georg Büchner, Gotthold Lessing, and more, and the Dramas usually contain some sort of underline that explains stuff. Or when the Drama is slightly bigger, the stuff that isnt easy to understand is marked by a number and at the end of the book you will find a list with explanations.

So yeah. Theres that.

**** Yes, annotated /versions/ of many things exist. But you know what you're getting going in, because you know you're reading an annotated version. And such stories are often ones that require background on dated references, words/phrases that have fallen out of use, or greater in depth extrapolations made for students to make reports out of. None of those things exist in 99.9% of the fanfiction of a series that's only two decades old.

If you still desperately want author notes to ruin a story, release two versions: the original, and the original (annotated).

*** Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell and Good Omens are just two examples of fictional books which use footnotes as a part of the story. There are others.

True they aren't Author Notes in the strictest fanfiction sense but they are used to impart necessary story information which otherwise wouldn't fit into the main prose. Because both take place in worlds with alternate histories where explanations would be more along the lines of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow]["As You Know Bob"]]
