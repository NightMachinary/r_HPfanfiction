Hello. I have lurked on this sub for years. I have enjoyed a bit (or a lot!) of HP fan fiction over the years. I'm a health care professional working in a hospital affected by the covid pandemic, and this past week I have loved re-reading some of my fave fics to take my mind off of things. It was just wonderful to be able to dip into the magical world for a few moments before and after work and forget just a little bit the horror all around me...

So, I need you. My mind is just too numb and too tired to be searching fanfiction.net right now. I need your tried and tested fics, the one that make you laugh, warm your heart and you find you want to go back to again and again.

To give you an idea of my taste, I adore Isolation by bex-chan and Australia by MsBinns. Love a bit of Draco/Hermione but also post Hogwarts Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione. Nothing too whacky but open to widening my world...! Completed only, I just can't take any more heartache in my life!

Thanks in advance and stay safe one and all!

Update: just wanted to thank you all for your suggestions, they have kept me sane over the last few days. Thank you so much.

** I just finished catching up with the Innocent series by MarauderLover7. I am sorry that it's not post-Hogwarts, and pairings are not decided yet, since the latest fic of the series, Intensity, is only halfway through the fourth year.

But, the series starts with Sirius escaping from Azkaban to adopt Harry, and it goes...well, it goes a lot of places from there actually. This has easily become my favourite Sirius-adopts-Harry, as well as Harry-gets-realistically-stronger fics (or rather, series of fics, ever). There is a lot of heartfelt family bonding, between Sirius and Harry, between Sirius and Remus, between Harry and Remus, and a host of other people frankly. Plus, this fic series has the best good Draco I have ever seen.

Here is the first one in the series: linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]] ). I hope you will give this one a try.

Thank you for your service.

**** Very glad you liked it! I like broadening my horizons too, but I'm similarly wary of new experiences. The prose was just so solid in this one that I got hooked.

These days I do like finding authors and sticking with them moreso than doing the old filter search - if coco's writing appealed to you, I'd also encourage checking out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5909028/SallyJAvery][SallyJAvery]] - her writing is very poetic and evocative.

** Linkao3(Say a Prayer by mad_fary) is very long, I think about 5 or 6 parts.

Linkffn(make a wish) is one of the most hilarious stories I've ever read.

Linkffn(The reunion) one of the few completed time travel stories I've found and by far the funniest.

** If you liked Isolation and haven't read Hunted by the same author already, drop everything you're doing and go read that. A hidden gem that I am disappointed not to see on this thread is The Unwinding of Percy Weasley, which I feel is a delicious slice of low stakes fluff that still manages to tickle the need for substance. The main female character is perhaps slightly too perfect, but the characterization of Percy and Arthur is superb. If you REALLY have an overabundance of time, I recommend checking out ByeByeBirdie's Balcony series, which is honest to God probably the longest work of fiction I've ever finished, with the exception of The Wheel of Time. ByeByeBirdie has a weakness for dramatic monologues, but over such a long story you will build up a tolerance surprisingly quickly. Given it's length and melodrama, some have compared the series to a soap opera, which I feel is inaccurate if only because you actually grow to care about the characters. Mad respect to ByeByeBirdie for her dedication to completing fics- her first was published in 2002, and she just finished another a few months ago. Order of Mercy is a fantastic canon compliant Deathly Hallows fic that focuses on Percy/Fleur/Bill, my only gripe with it is that the author makes Fleur just a wee tad too domestic for my taste- I could be mistaken, as it has been a long while since I read the fic.

#+begin_quote
  Falling in love had never been part of Rose Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy's plan. She hated him and he hated her. Until one day they didn't. Until one day they looked at each other and realized that everything had changed. So even though falling in love had been unexpected, being in love was something they couldn't stop no matter how hard they tried.
