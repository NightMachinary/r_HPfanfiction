Have any of you read a story where there was something that is always done terribly or the idea behind it is just ludicrous, but was written so well as to be good?


** linkffn(Travel Secrets First)

This series does a lot of things quite badly, and a lot of things very well. One of the things that has always stood out to me is how it makes Dumbledore a bad guy, without /feeling/ like bashing.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

Molly bashing often comes across as she's just in it for the money or to make her big Weasley family dream come true. There needs to be depth to it most times like trying to restore the house of Prewitt or Weasley.

Ron canonically deserves bashing in my opinion. However, that's because I feel he lacks character development. Linkffn(a cadmean victory) features some decent character development for Ron and Hermione both.

It's only described that she made a love potion as a /young/ girl and that she, Hermione and Ginny were giggly about it.

#+end_quote

Where are you getting this from? She's behaving like a typical mother who has trouble letting go of her son. She doesn't believe that Fleur truly loves her son and that as soon as the "we're in love" phase is over or when Bill is no longer handsome Fleur will dump him for the next best thing.

Molly is proven wrong after Bill got scarred.

Sometimes it would do you well to reread the canon books instead of relying what fanfiction writers say in their works or ANs.

As for Molly bashing, for me Molly bashing is pure Freudian. A fanfic writer have issue with their own mother and, with Molly being literally the only mother figure in the entire book series, bashes Molly as a stand in.

I don't think that's bashing though. That sounds like a valid interpretation of Dumbledore based on his actions in the books. Just because someone is painted over with a grey scale doesn't mean they're being bashed. Dumbledore bashing, to me, is making him a cartoon villain of himself, mumbling about the Greater Good, giving out laced lemon drops and usually stopped by those meddling kids.

**** Dumbledore being evil is very well supported character interpretation if you look at HP books from realistic viewpoint instead( [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment]] )

Problem is that there are hundred of plotholes in HP books (many listed in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1624376/ARedHair]])

When you ask why Dumbledore did nothing in those points' Occam razor explanation is that because he is evil, or insane or completely incompetent of any combination of these. Best good Dumbledore fic to address these was that he took magical oaths that make him unable to do anything with DE as he took oath to never harm pureblood wizard...

Problem is that when most writes starts depicting Dumbledore as clever manipulative bastard which is easy to do they couldn't stay true to his character. So after mandatory shopping trip and showing Dumbledore manipulations (and in bad ff finding Weasley's stealing which is contrary to evidence as if it was case then Ron would have Nimbus 2000 from 'uncle's inheritance) writers couldn't come with decent plan for Dumbledore where he wins some tactical victories. Instead he becomes Albus Dolores 'I am supreme mugwump.' Dumbledore.

While I don't know many good stories where Dumbledore switches from clever to idiot in chapter 5 there are many good stories with evil Dumbledore. A prototype what evil Dumbledore should do is linkffn(Partially kissed hero) where DD has 13 horcruxes, people believe Daily prophet because it contains compulsion for it... Another notable one is linkffn(Harry Potter and sorting hat's gift).

*** I think part of the success of the marriage stone, is that even though it starts off as a Harry/Severus marriage fic, it really isn't about that at all. I mean even the fact it is close to 400,000 words and Harry and Sev have barely gotten past heavy petting and it still doesn't feel like enforced UST shows how not just about their relationship it is. It has a rich background of culture and new ideas. It's a pity it ends with most of the world in an unrecoverable death like state, and no real end in sight.

- Pureblood history of sword fights and honour duels which makes sense.
- Severus is tattooed
- Severus has family who are not just 2D place holders
- A magical community beyond just Hogwarts
- Eldritch abominations
- Norse mythology
- Intelligent Dragons
- Harry becomes King of everything and isn't happy about it at all
- End of the world, which actually kills millions (at least) of people.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** Not really, no. Being well written doesn't mean it's not cliche. I've never really been a fan of the whole idea of "taking a trope and doing it proper". You can sprinkle flowers over a pile of poo, but it's still fundamentally unchanged. I haven't seen anything written well enough as to make me forget that fact.

*** A cliche is defined by overuse. That doesn't mean it can't be done well. Time travel has become a cliche, but that doesn't mean there aren't any or won't be any good time travel stories. Linkffn(wastelands of time) is one of the better written ones I've found.

**** Time travel is a genre, it's way too broad of a category to say it's cliche. If you want to use a specific mechanic of time travel such as accidentally falling through the veil of death and waking up as your 11 year old self, then yeah, that part would be cliche, and there's probably 1000 stories that use that.

***** Science fiction is a genre. Fantasy is a genre. Time Travel is a plot device that is used in multiple different genres like science fiction and fantasy.

Tropes are also often plot devices. More broadly, they are a "figure of speech" in narrative story telling which are recognizable to audiences. Some are big enough to create a framework for a story (like soul bonds or marriage laws). Some aren't. Some are used so often that they become cliches. Some aren't. Some are difficult to use well. Some aren't.

Do you really want to try to argue that there aren't any tropes in Star Wars? Lord of the Rings?

Shakespeare?

Please, don't pretend that there is some sort of "pure" sort of narrative fiction out there that has not been infected with the "curse" of tropes. They are everywhere, even if the authors aren't using them consciously, and their presence does not automatically mean that a story is bad.

What matters most is the skill of the storyteller.

Oh, and whether something is "cliche" or not depends on the audience. A cliche is not simply something that is overused, but something that distracts the audience because they are annoyed by how overused it is. So what you find distracting isn't necessarily what I or someone else finds distracting. And if you use something in a manner that is unexpected, you'll surprise the audience, meaning that it stops being cliche. That is possible.

Once again, what matters is the skill of the storyteller.
