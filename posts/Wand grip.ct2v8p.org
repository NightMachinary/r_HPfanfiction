Is there any agreed upon hand position for wands? I think in the movies it's kind of a full first grip, but in my head while reading it was always more of a pencil/pen finger grip. It seems like it would have been a pretty big part of first year, if you think about how much thought people like drummers put into different stick grips.


** I've always pictured the hand positions as being very similar to the various ways an orchestra conductor communicates with a baton.

EDIT: I remember when this was being shared a lot, it felt very /right/ to me: [[https://pin.it/zjeuo6ahjwqgh4]]

** I would say similar to [[http://saxonfencing.co.uk/wp-content/themes/saxon/images/history/1934hand.jpg][how one grips a foil]]

** Depends on what you're doing, I guess. For the middle of combat, a secure fist grip that allows fast casting and good aiming, possibly similar to how you hold a pistol.

For enchanting maybe more of a pencil grip that allows more accurate wand movements. placement of spells.

Wands are described as about twice as large as a pencil, so you have to take that into account.

*** If you held it in a secure fist and the wand is straight it will point up or be murder on the wrist. Pinching between fingertips, resting the pommel against your palm or little finger would allow better fine motor control for wand motions.

**** Good luck holding onto your wand pinched between fingertips while running around and dodging curses. If you're doing delicate work in a calm setting, ok. In a battle, no.

** Could be personal style/preference and skill level. Movie Ron wield his wand more like a club, while movie Grindelwald has more of a "conducting an orchestra of pure power" sort of style, signifying a greater skill and finesse with his wand.
