Tom Riddle is cunning, charming, and resourceful.

Voldemort is a bit like a Scooby-doo villain. He's so obsessed with Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore that whatever his plans are for the Wizarding World take a backseat.

I'd like to read some Fics that go into detail about what his plans were once he conquered Britain. I don't think what happens in DH is what he planned because he was still distracted by Harry Potter.

I kind of have a random idea if someone wants to use it as inspiration for a fic. Salazar Slytherin went to Albania (hence why Helena fled to there and Voldemort felt safe hiding there). It would be plausible for him to start a second family there. Tom Riddle creates a third persona of an Albanian descendant of Salazar Slytherin. His plan is to create an awful Dark Lord and have that persona defeat that Dark Load thus being handed a bunch of power like Dumbledore post Grindelwald defeat. Triggering a prophecy was an accident, but the more awful Voldemort was the more grateful the Brits would be for him saving them. The Dark Mark could be a means to kill all the death eaters at once when Voldemort was "killed" getting rid of a bunch of wealthy politically powerful people making his takeover easier. The plan couldn't be evoked until Dumbledore died as he would see right through it.


** IIRC Harry Potter and the methods of Rationality had an arc where Voldemort was a "Scooby doo Villain" persona and the original plan was for him to have a charming hero persona swoop in and save the day, but The death eaters were just so much lower maintenance to direct to do things than the Ministry/Order so he gave up on the irritating chorework of being the "Charming Hero"

** Honestly, canons Riddle/Voldemort didn't really have a plan beyond “kill people who don't bow to me” and “live forever.” When he was younger, he had to be careful with showing his true colors - using his cunning and charm to get ahead. However once he fully became Lord Voldemort, he stopped caring about “playing nice” cause no one bar Dumbledore could even slow him down from the way people talk about the first war in the books. Personally I think that mutilating his soul to the extent he did probably also made him less mentally stable.

** Realistically he is the villain of a series written originally as a children's book. He was probably intended as the evil Dark Lord who wants to rule the world through fear and make dark arts the norm.

My headcanon though is that he wanted to be worshiped as a god. He didn't care about riches (he doesn't even seem to own a home) or about titles (he could have easily become the Minister for Magic using his charm alone according to Slughorn). Even when he conquers magical GB, he doesn't rule but instead allows the Death Eaters to do so. Dumbledore said that he hated everything that made him seem common and after journeying to the magical world, he found out wizards were common amongst themselves too.

In HBP it's stated that his biggest ambition was collecting trophies from his victims and in the end that's what it seemed magical GB was for him too... just a trophy which he ignored afterwards.

I agree with the fact he wanted to be worshipped. Being worshipped was Voldemort's high point in life. For someone like him who has never been loved and is quite unable to love, worship was the closest thing he had ever had got. Yes, it's super messed up and wrong, but it's Voldemort, so of course it is.

** One of my favourite fics has this to say:

#+begin_quote
  /"You have the essence of it, I think," said Flamel approvingly. "What I mean is this: Voldemort's character is uncompromising. His goals are the kind of goals that must ever come into conflict with others. No matter how skilled he is, no matter how many times he wins, he will always find opposition. And, because his only response to opposition is to destroy it, he will fail eventually. It is inevitable. It might not be you, and it might not be for a century, but Voldemort's dream is incompatible with reality, and his character will continue to grind against it until he is dust, and he will never seek to adapt or reconcile or merge. He will simply continue on, like a bad cough, until the world spits out a remedy."/

Linkffn(What You Leave Behind By Newcomb) Which has long since been abandoned, much to my continued sadness. I think JK's message at the time of writing was that Love in all its myriad permutations is what makes life worth living. Voldemort had no understanding or interest in such a thing and so his life would be forever hollow for the lack of it.

The Harry in For Love Of Magic (OP jerk/indy trope) quips to Voldemort that the only thing that gives Tom's life any meaning is their fight.

  /The Dark Lord was nearly frothing at the mouth like a rabid animal at this point and barely structuring his attacks. The variety left much to be desired as well. Still dangerous, but predictable. "That's why you need me. Who would you hate if I was gone? What would be left of you?".../

  /..."You think power will ease the pain of your existence? Only an honest death will grant you relief, but you are too much of a coward to accept it, so you lash out and make the world scream alongside you, as if hurting less by comparison will make it more bearable. What a pitiable creature you are, and how embarrassing for me to be associated with you through prophecy."/
