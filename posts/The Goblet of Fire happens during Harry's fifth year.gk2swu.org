Are there any stories where Harry /isn't/ a fourth-year? Are there stories where he's legitimately chosen as a champion to participate?


** Harry would have to be seventeen to legitimately participate, so a Seventh Year. Then again, I can't imagine Harry choosing to participate in it, though.

*** There are points where he daydreams about how cool it would be to win it, but that's about as far as it goes. Most of his indignation about being entered is that no one believes him when he says he didn't enter himself, as well as either hating or worshiping him based on the assumption that he entered himself. It isn't till he finds out about the dragons that he worries for his life.
