I would like to know fics with said "Pair", but i dont want them to be romantical involved. Both are attracted to each other and just want to have fun. I would even accept AU fics that have no Voldemort and/or James and Lily alive and a bit "different" Harry than the Canon one....not to say OoC. I think thats a tough challenge, since Fics with no war wont cause any effects on Harry with any loss. Both of them can have other Partners, though.


** I can't link it because Harry isn't of age, but Summer of Change by lorddwar is a pretty decent Honks fic mixed with some powerful!Harry.

EDIT: Sorry, didn't read the description before responding. Harry/Tonks is one of my favorite pairings, but it's not quite common enough for (to my knowledge), those kinds of demands.

linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon) has them as a pairing where they're not romantic but get together. I wouldn't call it a smut fic because nothing is ever explicitly described (though it is, often, explicitly /said/).

  COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

** "It could only happen to Harry" fits the bill, even if it's a harem fic (one of the very few decent ones). There is some casual Harry/Tonks and Harry/Tonks/Parvati, amongst others.

  A mature commission set after DH, ignoring canon: Harry asks Tonks to sit near him at a Weasley family gathering so Molly doesn't try to set him up with Ginny once again. Tonks would rather play footsie under the table and tease him in a very public place, instead.
