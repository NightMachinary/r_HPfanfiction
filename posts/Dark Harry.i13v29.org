A Dark Harry fic where he can either be a Dark Lord, Voldie's friend (but no slash) or an independant dark wizard. Preferably 100k+ No slashes whatsoever. Any rating Not 'The Darkness Within' because I've already read it. Thanks in advance.


** The single best Dark Harry/dark wizardry is in Scott Press's Lesser Evils and the WIP Ascended Vices. The first ~third of Lesser Evils is a bit rough, but I don't believe it detracts from the dark wizardry.
