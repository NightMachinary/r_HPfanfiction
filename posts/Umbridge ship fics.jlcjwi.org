Anyone know any fics where an Umbridge romance is a main part of the story? And she remains as nasty as in canon? And not in a Harry bdsm way, in a reasonable way.


** I'm honestly kinda horrified by the idea. I'm sure there are some Fudge/Umbridge that exist. This whole concept horrifies me

** Only non harry one I know if is the punishment if hermione Granger. The things she does to her arent the worst I've ever but the writer does go into hermiones emotional state during and after and I think that makes it far worse
