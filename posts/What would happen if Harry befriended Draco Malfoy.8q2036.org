What are your opinions on the topic?


** It depends on who else Harry meets, and whether Malfoy is affected by Harry's presence.

Realistically, Hagrid muddied the waters of the Houses long before he entered Hogwarts, so its unlikely he would have ended up in Slytherin or even want to go there.

** He wouldn't stay friends with Draco very long. After living with Dudley for a decade, Harry would not stick around another spoiled bully.

I mean, you could argue the butterfly effect and Harry ending up in Slytherin, but canon Slytherin would not be a place that he'd like. Almost all students subscribe to blood purity and have Death Eater relatives who have a bone to pick with the "Boy who lived". It would be hell for Harry.

*** I have to somewhat disagree on the first point, and strongly disagree on the second.

In the first chapters on book one (before declining Malfoy's friendship), Harry's character isn't really defined. Heck, being an eleven-year-old, /he/ really isn't defined, so it pretty much presents a blank slate for a fanfic author. Is he a hero, sticking up for the downtrodden, or is prone to emotional instability and lashes out, becoming a bully himself? You can do whatever.

On the second point, however... Remember , it is /Malfoy/ who extended an offer of friendship to Harry, not the other way around. So, Draco, coming from one of the most blood-purity-type families is immediately willing to overlook the fact that he's the Boy-Who-Lived. So, ergo, if Malfoy acts that way, then the other Slytherins would probably follow suit (at least, until Voldemort comes back), and thus Harry would be fine. Maybe even popular.

**** No, Harry pretty much doesn't like Malfoy's attitude from the get-go, before he even knows Draco's name. In fact, one of Harry's first thoughts re Draco is "Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley." Followed by "He was liking the boy less and less every second." Harry's also not happy when Draco denigrates Hagrid.

So unless that first meeting in Madam Malkin's doesn't happen at all, or happens very differently, Harry isn't particularly predisposed to like Draco.

***** Err, yeah. I meant Harry's character before meeting Malfoy. Once he sees him in Malkin's (which later grows into rejecting his handshake), his attitude begins to set per canon, but prior to that it's all fair game.

Except Harry doesn't actually reject Malfoy's friendship until a chapter later, when they're properly introduced and Harry doesn't shake his hand.

So, pedantic though it may be, the chapters before Harry declines Malfoy's friendship cover their first meeting in Diagon Alley.

He also openly called for genocide and boasted about Voldemort's return. Draco isn't exactly a good standard to use for intelligence or kindness.

***** Well, sure, but that...is not what we're talking about. My statement is a response as to whether or not the other Slytherins would accept him. Since Draco did, then they probably would have, too.

** Draco Malfoy...he probably wouldn't let Harry go away from him once he became Harry's friend. He would try to manipulate and control Harry, so that he would end up dependent on Draco--there would be no escape for Harry, especially if he ended up in Slytherin.

** They got off on the wrong foot in, what, the fourth chapter of a 199-chapter long series? So unless you are going to completely rework their canon personalities, it'd be difficult to write something where they hit it off right away. If they're going to become friends, I think it would have to be in a scenario where they develop a kind of grudging respect for each other. They would have to go through similar difficult experiences. Here are two that I think would be interesting and semi-plausible:

- Draco also ends up crosswise with Umbridge and wants to fight back.
- Harry's name comes out of the goblet as the fourth Triwaizard champion, and then Draco's name comes out as the fifth.

Or if you want something bonkers, you could have a fic where Dobby goes insane and tries to assassinate someone, and Harry and Draco as the two people who knew him best have to track him down and figure out what's going on.
