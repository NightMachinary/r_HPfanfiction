** Welcome to the club! Unfortunately it's a rather small club... most of the fandom is still rather taken with projectile focused spell tennis duels. It's common for fanfics to sprinkle this with a bit of token "battlefield transfiguration" but rarely in an interesting or exciting way.

The following fics feature more canonical approaches to HP magic. They're generally not very combat focused, but what duels they do contain generally focus on a duel as an attempt to outwit your opponent, rather than the more common fanon approach of overpowering your opponent.

***** Still true. HP fanfic, both reading and writing, kinda lost their shine for me for about a year, but it's been steadily coming back over the last month or so. Again, not giving any "I'll update by X date" promises, as that just makes me stress about a deadline I imposed on myself.

If for whatever reason I decided I just never wanted to work on it again, I'd publish my (rather extensive) notes, and at least let people see all the stuff I had planned.

*** I blame the movies for this. It showed magic as being... Well... Blasty. By the final films, we got less obvious distinct spells, and magic had seperated into 'wordless point and cast blaster bolts' and 'dramatic rituals with long impressive incantations'.

Which is fair enough but seemed oddly distant from the earlier books' and movies depiction of how magic worked.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.
