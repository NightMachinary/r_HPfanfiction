So I remember this cool tidbit, but I don't remember what fic it is from. It was about some wizard who when learned about Napoleon's planned invasion of Britain cast a protective spell to stop "likes of him" from ever getting to Britain. But nobody knows if the spell works because nobody knows what "likes of Napoleon" is supposed to mean.

I've checked my main suspects: Alexandra Potter, The One He Feared, What You Leave Behind and Forging the Sword, but there wasn't any direct mention of Napoleon in any of them.

So I ask this here, because it annoys me that I can't remember where it is from. The fic is probably somewhere on my list, but there are many fics there so that doesn't help very much.


** Well, I can't say what fanfic you're thinking of, but you might be interested in Susanna Clarke's novel /Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell/ if you haven't read it already. It has an extended section in which one of the two title magicians takes part in the Napoleonic Wars.

*** I'm actually rereading it right now but considering that last time when I've read was around ten years ago, I'm pretty sure that's not this.

** I know that there are some HP crossovers with a series called Temeraire, which apparently is the Napoleonic Wars retold with dragons. I haven't read them yet as I want to read the original books first, but I remember seeing the occasional Temeraire crossover get recommended and thought it might cover your request.

*** Never even heard about this series. Also this wasn't set in Napoleonic times, it was mentioned as historical tibdits.

**** I've been meaning to read it for a while, my friend highly recommends the series! A possible crossover might be set in the HP timeline with Temeraire-style history, but again I do not know for sure :(
