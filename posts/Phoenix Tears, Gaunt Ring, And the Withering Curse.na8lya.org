In the books it seems that Phoenix tears are talked about as something that can cure almost any ill. Top of the list was Basilisk venom both detoxing the venom and then healing the puncture wound in Harry's arm. So if that was the case then why didn't Dumbledore have Fawkes cry on his injured hand or in his mouth so the tears are ingested? At a minimum it should have greatly slowed or stopped the progression of the curse.

Now the books never state whether phoenix tears were used in the potions that Snape made Dumbledore.

So what does everyone think was this just a "missed" plot point or are Phoenix tears really not that powerful?


** I've always thought that curses must cause a different sort of injury than physical attacks or poison. Even with all of the Healing magic they can do Moody is still scarred and has multiple prosthetics, and we see that Healing potions/magic can do things like regrow bones.

** Phoenix tears probably aren't as powerful as /fan fiction/ makes them out to be. In fan fiction they can cure just about any ill. In the books they "have healing properties" according to Dumbledore and TMR. That probably amounts to mending wounds and negating venoms and poisons.

Snape and Dumbledore did this. As you said, we don't know if phoenix tears were included, but that curse was meant to kill instantly. Dumbledore and Snape's efforts tacked on about a year.

*** Well, they do heal basilisk venom, which is one of the most deadly poisons out there.

But I think the reason's in the name.

It's not just damage. It's a CURSE. Even if they used tears to completely heal the damage, the curse remains and would start again. It's more than the damage itself, it's a spell continually affecting him.

**** True. However except for the Killing curse it seems that every other curse has a counter-curse. I also remember something about the curse currently being contained in the right hand but it would eventually break free (also something about Snape could have done more if Dumbledore had got to him sooner.

If that's the case why didn't they simply remove the hand.

It really won't work like that. Leaving aside that if it had worked, they would have done that, it also conceptually makes no sense. The curse is magical, not physical. Hence it has to be magically removed, not physically.

I agree though there could be a counter curse. Unfortunately, the only one who would likely know it, if so, would be Voldemort, just like Snape was the only one to know the counter curse for Sectrumsempra. Security (in terms of a certain magic working as desired) by obscurity appears to be very much a thing in the magical world.

**** There's something about "most deadly" in the first place as well.

By what metric? Everything that kills is deadly, that much is obvious. But what makes something "more deadly" than something else? The reason this is relevant is because if you define it as the options available to counter it, I'd disagree. That makes a poison rare or specialised, not more deadly.

Hence, only Phoenix tears can counter basilisk venom. But what does /mean/, except for that it's super specialised poison? In particular, I don't think one can derive anything about Phoenix tears from that, except that they're just as rare and specialised.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if for regular poisons, Phoenix tears did little or nothing at all -- there's a reason Bezoars exist.

And going from there, follows your point about curses.

** Voldemort knows that dumbledore has a Phoenix. Voldemort knows the most likely person to figure out about the horcruxes and also have the ability to hunt them down is dumbledore. Thus, Voldemort designs a curse on the ring that phoenixes can't heal. As one of the greatest wizards ever, I'm sure he could figure it out. That's how I've always thought about it.

** I think that no matter how powerful Phoenix tears are or could be, they don't stop curses - in fact, since curses don't seem to be stopped, or reversed, by anything else but the one specific countercurse, if one exists - so potions, Phoenix Tears, anything with healing property, isn't a cure for the curse - like with a disease, it only fixes symptoms, it doesn't solve the cause.

As far as it's seen in the book, the curse does indeed not spread beyond the arm, so Phoenix Tears or sth similar was probably used to slow its progression, but not able to stop it.

I don't see it as a plot hole, nor like a weird thing that just isn't explained, but simply as idk, common sense to try methods of restraining (stopping) the curse, including Phoenix Tears, but none of them work, and Dumbledore is kinda hopeless about it and thinks he's really gonna die by the end of the year, or even earlier.

** I think jo really does seem to pick and choose when certain magic works or not. But I'm sure we could come up with a fancy reason. Maybe it was the wrong time of the burning cycle or something lmao

Another option could be that Voldemort knew Dumbles had a Phoenix so he found a Phoenix tears-proof curse
