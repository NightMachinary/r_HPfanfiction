#+TITLE: three people—harry potter, and two women from different books or shows—are trapped in another dimension. All three have significant others. How long do you think they would wait/try to get back before giving up and giving in to their urges?

**** I think you missed the point smart ass.

Because you don't list the 2 women, you don't provide a strait forward question of any sort. This is because depending on who the women are, their personalities, traits, looks, nature of the world they come from, and so on a so forth, it likely changes how long they would wait, or changes if they would wait at all, or changes if they would even stay within the context of your question. Perhaps they are lesbian. Perhaps they would choose to kill off the other 2. And so on... and so forth... You also dont list or mention the situation within that other dimension where they are trapped. Are they on a desert island... a water planet, shrunken on a strawberry, at the DMV.....???

Seriously... its such an open ended and strange query, that its hard to have an actual discussion or even answer the question properly...

No, but seriously... viol8er, my mate. You gotta be more specific here. Who are you even talking about?

If I'd add Tracer, for example... never. She's not into dudes.

** Canon Harry: seems entirely faithful and loyal. He probably wouldn't at all. He seems to be despondent of anyone he has no real emotional attachment to, so if he developed a deep bond and dependency with these women after a lot of trials and tribulations, I could see it happening.

Fanon Harry: Would instantly seduce them, find a way back to his own dimension, and then tell his love interest who would be totally fine with the idea of Harry sleeping with other women and suggest building Harry a harem as he becomes Minister of magic and changes the entire wizarding world.

In all seriousness though, this question needs to be a lot more specific in order to have any meaning at all.

** Hmm, probably a couple years to lose /all/ hope of getting home. Giving in to the urges may happen before that, if they ever hit a really emotional point where they just need comfort. Which would be dictated by what happens to them.

** How old are they? The younger they are and the less time they have been with their SO the less time it would take to get over them.

Though, it also depends upon who it is and if there is any chemistry between them as to whether anything will happen at all.

Assuming chemistry and teenagers, and there is no one else to interact with, it would probably happen after a few weeks to a month or two of only interacting with each other.
