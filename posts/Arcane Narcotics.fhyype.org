What kind of magical drugs and intoxicants do you think would be available? Would they just get Muggle stuff, would they make potions or powders, would they have magical or interestingly novel effects, etc?

If you have any fics that do interesting magical drugs, then please feel free to link!

All relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome.

  So magic drugs would be able to have some seriously crazy effects. There are potions that affect the brain in extremely complicated ways, seemingly with very few side effects (take veritaserum, for instance - how does the potion's magic even begin to understand what truth is? not to mention how to entice only it? and how to force the user to answer? all this in a tasteless, odorless, colorless form?). I took the liberty of making up a few.

  - The Third Eye - a drug that opens someone's "inner eye" forcefully, regardless of otherwise manifested sight. They don't usually speak prophecies, as those seem to be dictated by magic itself, but it can happen (it usually favors a proper seer though). Users become completely trapped in their own mind, seeing possibilities and events playing out with no clear correlation. Withdrawal symptoms include extreme paranoia and panic because they've grown accustomed to knowing what will happen. It is made by heavily enchanting a centaur's eye.

  - Eagle Eye potion - A substance that sharpens your senses to an incredibly high degree, making you able to hear and see everything to its fullest extent, coupled with a pain reliever so you don't feel the sensory overload. See every pore on someone's face a mile away when you focus on it. Repeated use causes damage to your nerves similar to the cruciatus curse. Withdrawal symptoms are significant worsening of the natural senses beyond their initial state.

  - Portable Pensieve Charm - a spell that forcefully descends the user into a pensieve-like trance state. They can recall and experience all they remember. Withdrawal symptoms are worsening of natural memory.

  - Repeated use of the Rennervate Spell shortly before falling asleep - can make you stay awake for nights and days on end, all while never feeling a bit tired. The effects of tiredness, apart from the feeling, still happen. Withdrawal symptoms are long-lasting insomnia which is resistant to sleeping potions.

  - Sands of Time - if you snort a line of this, time distorts in one of two directions for your mind. Either it moves faster, or it moves slower. The strength depends on how much you took. It doesn't have withdrawal effects, but repeated use makes it so your body starts feeling the accumulated time by ages faster/slower.

  - Casting a confundus on something consumable - has an effect similar to alcohol, but without making the person sleepy or poisoning them. You just become more and more "drunk" until you're too dumb to eat/drink more.

*** I like your ideas, thanks! The creation of the first using a centaur eye is pretty cool, really makes a magical-poaching fic quite doable. :)

** Hadn't ever thought of this before, but I bet Felix Felicis is popular on the black market. Maybe I'll play around with that idea someday...

*** Quite possibly, yeah. I'm not sure if it being hella difficult to manufacture is canon or fanon though, but if it was it might be a bit much for black market dealings.

**** It's definitely canon that it's really difficult to make, but that's why it would be black market stuff, it's not as good. So like if you got a bad batch you could have weird side effects while being incredibly lucky. It could be a fun concept to work with

***** Ah, that kind of 'genie in the lamp' sort of thing - you get good luck but in a really inconvenient way.

** Check out Reparations and its sequel Foundations and the other related fics by Sara's Girl.

It is HP/DM, Harry finishes up healer training and finds himself in the rehab facility of St. Mungos. Which is run by Draco Malfoy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1550773/Sara-s-Girl]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/50568]]

Another story that discusses drugs is Tissue of Silver by fearlessdiva. Again HP/DM, Harry is an Auror send to protect Draco from getting murdered and one of the possible suspects is a druglord, plus Draco is not above indulging in some stuff.

*** Thanks for the recs! Are they canon-compliant and redemptive (ie. Draco did terrible things during the war, lets build him up to being a semi-decent human being) or do they blank out all that stuff and stuff him into the usual leather pants?

**** Both fics are redemptive. Leather pants might make an appearance, but it is not the usual "Draco is hot, they should shag" fic.

Canon-compliance:

Tissue of Silver was written before OOTP came out, which is why Narcissa's maiden name is different (not Black) and why Snape is a rich pure-blood. Draco turned spy under Snape's guidance in 5th or 6th year, which is why so many people want to kill him. Despite these deviations Tissue of Silver has really stood the test of time, it is one of the big H/D classics and definitely worth reading.

Reparations and Foundations was written post-DH, so it is canon-compliant except for the epilogue and Cursed Child.

***** That's all good to hear. I'm alright with Harry-Draco pairings, but the two of them getting involved without the effort to redeem/remake Draco into not-a-Magic-Nazi is always slightly creepy to me. Like a weird Stockholm Syndrome.

Thanks for the recs, and clarifying their status. :)
