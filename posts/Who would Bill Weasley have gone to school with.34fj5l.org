Help me with the timelines a bit, or is there one gigantic timeline anywhere out there that shows when everyone went to school?

I'm thinking Tonks for sure. I know he was a couple of years too late for the Marauders/Snape, but how about Quirrell? I know he was quite young for a teacher, could he have been in school just a couple of years before he taught DADA?

Also looking for any Bill Weasley-centric fanfic recommendations where he teaches DADA or turns out to be a death eater. Thanks!


** Tonks would have been a few years younger (and not in his house). He might theoretically have known her, since she was in Charlie's year. However, she was a hufflepuff and wasn't a prefect, so it's dicey.

Based on her birth year and the fact that she had just finished 3 years of auror training when Harry had just finished his 4th year, I believe she would have been in a 7th year when Harry was a 1st year. So Harry is Class of 1998, Tonks is Class of 1991, Charlie is Class of 1991, and Bill is Class of 1989.

He would have gone to school with Percy (Class of 1994), but not Fred/George (Class of 1996 and would have started in Sept 1989). HPL has an interesting article on the dynamics that you might want to check [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/essays/essay-weasley-dynamics.html][out.]]

Since Quirrell taught DADA in 1991, and JKR said he taught muggle studies teacher prior to PS, I think it would be reasonable to have him teaching muggle studies in a story set during Bill's seventh year (1988-1989). That's not really that far from when the books pick up, so the staffing changes shouldn't be too major.

The HP Lexicon might have some suggestions for older Gryffindors (like Oliver Wood who would have been in Percy's year) and other students he might have known. However, I don't think we know too many people in his class year.

*** I remember reading somewhere that Tonks and Charlie were in the same year, so Tonks would have been a year out of training when she first meets Harry in OOtP

*** If I'm not mistaken, McGonagal makes a comment to Harry in Year 1 that they hadn't won at Quidditch since Charlie left, making him class of '90 at latest.

Although that's most likely just JK not thinking it through fullym

**** You're not mistaken, but I think that was just early weirdness, to be honest.

JKR later specified the age differences between each of the Weasleys, and made Charlie three years older than Percy. She also gave Charlie a birthday of 12 December 1972 which means that he would have been 11 in September 1984 and finished in June 1991.

#+begin_quote
  You said recently that Charlie was two years older than Percy. If that's so, he would have been the Seeker in Harry's first year. Can you clarify his and Bill's ages for us?

  I knew I'd messed up that question the moment I had answered it, but web chats move fast and I wanted to keep going to get through as many questions as I could. Bill is two years older than *Charlie, who is three years older than Percy,* who is two years older than Fred and George, who are two years older than Ron, who is a year older than Ginny.
#+end_quote

Obviously there's still a conflict, because in Sept 1991, Fred says ""I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year," said Fred. "We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant."

I think this is just a mistake on JKR's part, but if you want to find a work-around, you could say that Charlie was not on the team for his entire school career. Maybe he had lost interest or was already working toward a career with dragons. Or he could have left school entirely before he finished his N.E.W.T.s. He apparently "went off chasing dragons." Maybe he dropped out in favor of a work experience type program.

Again, I think it's most likely that this is a mistake. But there are ways to make it work.

There are several references to the fact that if Gryffindor loses the Quidditch cup during the 1993-94 school year, it will be the 8th year in a row. A lot of people take that to mean that Charlie hasn't been on the team for 8 years, but Fred/George say that Gryffindor haven't won since Charlie was on the team, not that they won every year when Charlie was on the team.

So hypothetically...

84-85 Charlie's 1st year, RandomPerson1 plays seeker

85-86 Charlie's 2nd year, Charlie plays seeker, Gryffindor wins

86-87 Charlie's 3rd year, Charlie plays seeker, Gryffindor wins

87-88 Charlie's 4th year, Charlie plays seeker, Gryffindor loses

88-89 Charlie's 5th year, Charlie plays seeker, Gryffindor loses

89-90 Charlie's 6th year, Charlie loses interest/is injured/quits/etc., RandomPerson2 plays seeker, Gryffindor loses

90-91 Charlie's 7th year if he hasn't left school, RandomPerson2 plays seeker. Gryffindor loses (McGonagall says they were "flattened" the year before Harry joined)

91-92 Harry's 1st year, Harry plays seeker, Gryffindor loses

92-93 Harry's 2nd year, Harry plays seeker, Gryffindor loses by default

93-94 Harry's 3rd year, Harry plays seeker, Gryffindor wins

It's a little bit weird, but if you have to make it work, I think this is the only way. I'm not sure why they lost so often, but Wood says they've had the worst luck in the world. I guess that would explain why everyone talks about how they haven't won since Charlie left.

*** Thanks! I absolutely loved the Lexicon article, too. A strange thought occurred to me as I read it... think there's any chance Molly kept having kids so she wouldn't have to fight Voldemort directly? I know she's a good duelist, but that wouldn't mean she enjoyed it or wasn't frightened.

**** I don't know, I feel like if she didn't want to fight Voldemort she could have just said so. She's a Gryffindor, so even if she truly didn't want to fight Voldemort I think she would have found the courage to be honest and say "I would rather stay out of it." Besides, even if she hadn't been pregnant, having young kids is still a very reasonable excuse for not fighting.

Are you going to try to come up with OCs as well? I'm assuming you'll have to.

***** It won't take place entirely during Bill's school years, those are just flashbacks/pensieve scenes. Mostly it will be Bill teaching DADA/trying to break the curse on it. Yeah, I might have to make a few OCs (mostly prior DADA teachers and what happened to them) but I'm trying to keep it to a minimum.

**** I don't really like molly Weasley. That being said it might've been the other way around. Having kids in a war is either stupid or brave. She saw her twin brothers die. Maybe she saw all these other wizards around her dieing and was like well let me roll up my sleeves and restart populating the Wizarding world with light wizards. Or maybe it's just a bunch of nights her being scared with Arthur and needing long all night loving. Forgetting to use a contraception charm? Maybe she really wanted a daughter and didn't give a fuck and was like I'm gonna keep going until I get a girl. Who knows? Molly Weasley is weird and creepy.

** I never went that far back, I have list concerning Harry's years at school with every known student at school when he was there.

It shows more or less the year in which student entered Hogwarts for their respective first year. There's some margin of error here, with some we can't know for sure. A few are also movie only, like the Carrow twins. Notes are with respect to Harry's year (Ex, when it says prefect year 5, it mean that particular student became prefect when Harry was on his 5th year). Sorry for any mistakes I may have made.

Edit: Gemma Farley entered in 1987 not 1986.

** Slughorn taught around this period, so if we look at the students he mentions we can probably find a rough list of mentioned-once-and-then-never-again characters:

Gwenog Jones (Class of 1986)

Eldred Worple (Class of 1988).

Also, most of the members of "The Weird Sisters" would have been active around that time.
