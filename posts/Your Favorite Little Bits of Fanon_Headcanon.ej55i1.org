Basically what it says on the tin - minor bits of fanon, headcanon, or other such ideas you've had or seen (though if it's not yours, please reference whatever it's from if you can remember where you saw it). I especially love stuff that's more on the worldbuilding side.

An example from my brain:

During the battle in the Ministry Atrium, Voldemort's Killing Curse bounces off of a fragment of the statue from the Fountain of Magical Brethren. What if this was because it was made of (or at least covered in) actual gold? Alchemists considered gold to be the perfected form of metal, eternal and incorruptible, and associated it with immortality.

Gold (only pure, /real/ gold) can reflect specifically the Killing Curse without suffering damage. This is actually one of the reasons Goblins love to hoard the metal - they /know/ about this property and want protection against one of wizards' favorite weapons.


** I really love the idea that Lily had a fondness for darker magic and that Harry's survival was bc of some kind of magic on Lily's part that would horrify the average magic user. A lot of people just use her own death as the blood sacrifice needed to deflect the killing curse, but I think it would take more power. The only ritual we see in the books is Riddle's resurrection which required both willing and unwilling participant. And being part of a vigilante group usually requires a certain acceptance with killing the enemy. So I like the parallel of Lily's protective magic involving the ritual sacrifice of an /unwilling/ person (a death eater) to create it along with Lily's /willing/ sacrifice to activate or power it. This reflects the breaking of said protection during the resurrection with the reverse of a death eater's /willing/ sacrifice and Lily's son's /unwilling/ sacrifice.

*** I really dig that concept. Canon is simply too black and white for my tastes. The good guys die in scores because they don't kill. That would be evil after all...^{/s}

That's not to say that I want Harry to walk around and execute prisoners in cold blood, but the idea that Lily (and James) were desperate for an advantage or even naturally inclined towards both sides of magic WITHOUT abusing it is great.

**** Hmmm and now I want a Harry willing to commit war crimes - after Sirius' death, has a bit of a psychotic break and decides that the only good death eater is a dead one, starting with Malfoy. A fic detailing him spiraling into madness as he starts using dark magic to kill anyone in his way, until he is little better than Voldemort himself.

After Voldemort's gone, he starts killing pure blood families who supported his ideals (“unmarked death eaters” in his mind). That twists into killing pure bloods who disagree with him, then pure bloods in general.

His friends first try to moderate his actions - stop him from killing, stop him from killing prisoners, etc, until they try to take him in when he goes off the rails. Someone ends up seriously hurt (one of the Weasleys maybe?) and they all end up arguing about how to best handle him. Moody goes off on his own and tries to assassinate him, ends up getting caught and Harry kills him.

Harry's “public face” is one for Muggleborns and “blood traitors” to rally behind, a political front to tear pure bloods from positions of power. Hermione could either go from trusting Harry to do what's right to hating what he becomes, or becoming a devout fanatic to his cause (his very own Bellatrix).

Not sure whether to take it in a Harry wins or Harry loses direction as a finale...

The trick is to kill them in a fight rather than execute them, that way they are dead and you do not commit war crimes.

Your idea would be a pretty interesting take on darkHarry, although I wouldn't go as far as equalise him with Voldemort. Maybe closer to Crouch Sr before his son was caught.

** Arthur and Molly were active duty Order members during the first war and absolutely kicked ass. Molly in particular was extremely viscous following her brothers' deaths, and only stopped once she was pregnant with Bill.
