** I'll have a think and get back to you. I'm currently reading linkffn(When A Veela Cries) which has some really interesting bits on magic usage, and cultural history, but less focus on deep theory. By this I mean there is a strong focus on combat magic, and I think this writer really has the hang of writing magical fight scenes. I don't think it's /quite/ what you're looking for, but it's at least partially relevant. Will have a hunt through my Favourites now.

*** In case you haven't read them already, linkffn(Basilisk-Born) and linkffn(A Long Journey Home) both have a large helping of History and deeper Magic by their very nature. The premise of both is that Harry (or in the case of ALJH Fem!Harry) gets sent back in time a /very/ long way. Stuck in the past, he (r she) learns magic as it used to be. Don't let the Fem!Harry element put you off - it works fine in that particular story.

*** linkffn(The Crown of Metis) might be up your street. It captures the wonder of magic quite well, and looks at what makes specific acts of magic 'light' or 'dark'.

** Maybe linkffn(The Life he Leads) on the old magic front.
