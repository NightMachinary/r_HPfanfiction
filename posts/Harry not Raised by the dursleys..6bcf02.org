Looking for any story where harry is taken from the doorstep of the dursleys or after a time at the dursleys je is then taken/leaves. I want it for dumbledore to have put harry there so he can be molded more easily JUST LIKE IN THE MOVIES, but because harry wasn't raised he has a backbone, and doesn't stand for the usual crap.

Option: He learns new or different magic where he is that makes him unpredictable.

***** That is what i did do. I asked because i'm only looking for the stories where he was not raised by the dursleys mainly, because you can't just search for that on fanfiction. Also a realistic reaction to dumbledore finding out his pawn is no longer under his control.

******* Thanks, and sorry if i came off a little rude. It's just you can't add emotion or tone to your words so saying something like 'where is that story' could sound anywhere from threatning to curious, and you can't know.

****** There's a Harry wasn't raised by Dursley's tag in Ao3 that I was sifting through this weekend if that would interest you? Includes crossovers. I also just got to the most recent update of Hadrian Romanoff And The Beginning linkffn(12095483) a bit ago. There's also another 'raised by Black Widow' one that I liked as well.

  Harry Potter was destined to do great things under incredible odds. Hadrian Romanoff was destined to do even greater. Taken in by the infamous Black Widow and raised alongside her merry band of fellows, Hadrian will return to the wizarding world and take it by storm.

******** Link to Hardrian Romanoff just showed up. Still trying to remember/find the other one I read last week. I think it's in the Avengers/HP crossover section on ff.net (though pretty recent). In the meantime, here's the archive tag:[[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter%20was%20Raised%20by%20Other(s)/works]]. Hopefully you'll find a couple things. I'm currently sort of searching for similar, so I'll add a few as I come across them.
