On its own your face being permanently altered in a matter of seconds is an incredibly traumatic experience, but paired with the fact that your DNA is mutated and your last link with your birth parents is severed, it adds up to be one of the most unintentionally horrifying tropes in Harry Potter fanon.


** I think it could be easily used in a sort of pureblood-dominated world where they blood adopt the Muggleborn after they're found. It'd be an intensely horrifying experience to be kidnapped from the world you knew and then have your whole physical identity be overwritten so that even if you were to escape your parents would even really be your parents anymore. It's be an interesting one-shot horror story for a Muggleborn kidnapped and holding on to the hope of escaping and getting back to their parents only to be blood adopted and look completely different and slowly lose their hope of ever being reunited with their parents.

Side note: With the casual use of selective obliviation (to reduce potential of brain damage?)then that'd put an even worse horrifying aspect on the adoption process. You could go from knowing you have parents and were kidnapped, looking completely different and then start slowly losing your memories of your parents. Hermione completely erased her existence from her parent's memories so combining that with blood adoption would be an intense story concept.

Sorry for the ramble ðŸ˜¬

*** I remember there was a fic like that. No blood adoption, but the kids had no memories ot their muggle homes. Not many memories, at least. Mione was adopted by the Malfoys and Harry had all of his memories, since he didn't slept on the bed with all the charms to erase his memories. It was a dystopian world.

** IMO blood adoption is overpowered if it were to be inserted into a horror story. It's sole purpose is weird wish fulfillment in fanfiction. So it's not designed for the kind of terror horror stories induce. A better way to corrupt it for horror would be to make the changes gradual, and to add the paranoia of behavioral changes into the mix.

** Two words: Body Horror.

Take a sample from a man and a woman who... weren't that lucky with their fall down the ugly tree and/or have a hereditary disfigurement.

Yep, scary stuff.

-

This is why I headcanon Blood Adoption as a potion + ritual type deal. Otherwise you can slip a blood adoption potion into a heir's drink and they aren't technically a heir anymore.

*** I head canon the same, my head canon is the physical changes also take time (at least a full day) to be complete and there are some blood adoptions where the DNA of the new parent(s) may just combine with the originals. Such as, if Sirius Black wanted Harry to be the heir to the house of Black, could use a ritual so genetically he had 2 fathers and a mother so he was still the Potter heir too.

** There's one like this but not blood adoption that's a crossover with katekyo hitman reborn where dumbledore steals harry for purpose of prophesy and harry takes purge potion and then finds family.

Quite a lot of one's where he is stolen from the malfoys and blood adopted by potters and then it all comes out eventually

** Blood Adoption has a lot of interesting implications, but when it comes to body horror you don't need to get more complicated than transfiguration.

Slughorn was able to transfigure himself into an armchair, and back!?

** A lot of people take that aspect away by making it so that he gets to keep his parents DNA as well as the new parents. So he gets a quarter or a third from each parent, depending on how many people are adopting him.

** That is actually a plot point in linkffn(the odds were never in my favour). In the second book, someone is blood adopted while possessed by the diary, permanently altering who they are in a way that can't be undone.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...
