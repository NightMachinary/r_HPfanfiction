I'm frustrated by a recent rash of fics I've read where Draco is just assumed to be a good guy, like people are legitimately confused about who's who between Ron and Draco.

What are your favorite fics where Draco is cool with being an obvious villain and gets his ass handed to him, combat wise or politics wise.

Bonus points for HHr but I'm not fussy. Slash is ok, but if anyone dates Draco it needs to be extremely clear that they are slumming it.


** /Applied Cultural Anthropology, or/; Hermione is sorted into Slytherin, and she beats his ass a few times, including several duels where he's clearly outclassed by her, so much so that he eventually comes to fear her

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/12/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or]])

/The Changeling/; Ginny is sorted into Slytherin, and Draco is a slimy asshole, but Ginny doesn't really confront him until end of third year. Still, he's much the douche as he is in canon, and in fifth year, he loses his arrogance and is absolutely pathetic

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling]])

/Harry the Hufflepuff/; where Draco isn't really featured much, but he's still an annoying git, and in one instance, Harry manages to lose Draco house points

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

He successfully recruits most Slytherins of his year into a Death Eater cell.... and manages to get the entire group killed and captured before achieving anything significant. At least Daphne and Tracy manage to get something done.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

**** Because that's a very one dimensional description for one of the only characters in the series with any semblance of actual character development. Just say you want Draco bashing fics and be done with it. I don't have a problem with people that enjoy bashing fics we all did at one point in time, just be honest about it.

He is a douche and he is pathetic but not at the same time

****** This. Draco is the very definition of a coward. His actions in the last two books, but especially in DH, are of a pathetic douchebag too cowardly to pick a side.

Pansy is (rightfully if not excessively) demonized for wanting to give up Harry. Draco is forgiven 'cause he cried in a bathroom and couldn't look Harry in the face in DH despite trying to kill him a few chapters later.
