Just put his name in, and he has to show up or lose his magic. Without magic, he is as good as neutralized.

Has any fic come up with that solution?


** I very much dislike the idea of "losing magic" (it is never mentioned in canon). They say that Harry has got to compete. I think that if the penalty had been losing magic then Maxime and Karkaroff would have demanded that he do that. If the punishment was death (which seems more likely given unbreakable vows), then they wouldn't be able to demand he doesn't compete.

*** I dunno, I feel like losing magic would be far more severe than dying to many, particularly pure-blood, magicals. I mean even the Weasley family is a bit embarrassed of their Squib family member. Marius Black was blasted off the Black Family Tree for being a Squib. Many Squibs are abandoned to the muggle world. I really do think that death would be seen as kinder than losing your magic in the HP world.

*** Canon does mention 'stealing magic' though. And even if we dismiss that as Death Eater propaganda, a significant portion of the public believed it, which kinda does suggest that while 'losing magic' maybe impossible, it is not unheard of.

**** +You are pretty sure to be wrong, then. It's canon, Rowling gave that reason when people asked her how Junior managed to enter Harry's name into it.+

+The name /has/ to be written by the person whose name it is. That's the first requirement for the goblet, with the other requirement being that it has to have the name of one of the schools listed (Harry here being no exception, it's just that when Junior confounded the goblet he added a fourth school with no name and Harry's slip had no name of the school and thus fit).+

Never mind, I can't find the source where I'd found it so for the time being I'm crossing this stuff out.

****** Hmm ... rats, I can't find it now and I don't have enough time to look through half the internet right now. So feel free to treat it however you want for the time being, since I have no proof on hand. I'd struck out my previous comment because until I or someone else manages to find that, it's just a piece of text that might provoke arguments and doesn't really serve any purpose.

That said, since I did not write it earlier and I probably should have done that too, I do agree with the sentiment that it's better to have freedom to write whatever, including whomever entering; I just don't really mind things being AU (which some people shy from, for whatever reason). I did enjoy some stories where he's called by the goblet either from far away or after acting in a way that would have made it impossible for anyone to enter him if he had to be the one to write the blasted slip.

** If you want to an AU story in which it happens, go for it. I'd linked one that uses a similar device in one of my comments in this thread, though I presume you've likely read it already.

+But canon-wise, he'd need to be able to write, with which skill he'd have to write his name along with the name of the school he represents on a slip of paper, which someone would then put in the goblet, so I don't think it would actually work considering he's an ugly baby of doom at the time and rather unlikely to write the slip for someone who'd want to instigate his end. And, on a random note, this requirement makes it sad when stories have Harry disappear but appear when he's called by the goblet and the authors say that it's all canon compliant.+

Edit: Never mind, could not find the bit where I'd read about it being canon so I'm striking this stuff out.
