:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
You know Harry dies and Fate sends him back to fix his destiny. But in the one I'm looking for Harry is pissed this god thing is trying to control him and goes out of his way to ruin fates plans.


** Fate's Chosen by Luan Mao might be the one you're looking for. In a twist basically Harry was going against Fate's plan the whole time.

  Harry dies and wakes up in Fate's office. You've heard it before, right? You're expecting a re-do fic, right?

** Fate's Dilemma by Bobmin might be another one. Here Harry resists going back unless he gets major concessions from Fate.
