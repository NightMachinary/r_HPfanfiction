I read this fic yeeeaars ago on fanfiction.net and I am trying to find it again. It was an au where the roles reversed for most of the characters. The Malfoys and Snape were good guys who tried to help Harry and the Weasleys, Hermione, and Dumbledore were evil.

I think one of the first scenes was platform 9 3/4 and the Weasleys were being creepy to Harry but the Malfoys stepped in.

If anyone recognizes this fic please let me know! Thanks!!


** This could be a couple stories can you give anything more specific.

** I'm pretty sure I know what one you're talking about. Harry was surrounded by the press and Lucius went to help and then Molly shows up saying he's scaring him but it's actually Molly who is scaring him. Lucius then escorts Harry and Draco to the train and tells Draco to look out for Harry. It turns out that Harry is abused and he thought his name was Freak. It's cross-posted on ao3 and FFN. Here's the ao3 link.
